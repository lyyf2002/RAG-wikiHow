Figure out what size iPad you want. The earlier versions of the iPad are thicker and heavier than the new iPad, so, if you’re looking for something lighter, the iPad Air might be a better fit for you. If you need a powerful iPad for professional stuff, the iPad pro 12.9"" or 9.7"" is the perfect one for you. If you don’t need a large screen and you need an iPad for daily usage, you might opt for the iPad Mini, which is thinner and smaller than a full-sized iPad. Think about how much storage you need. If you have a lot of music, photos and video, you’ll want more storage. Earlier models of the iPad that were released in 2010 only offer up to 64GB of storage, whereas the newer iPad Air models offer up to 128GB and the new iPad pro offer up to 256GB. (“GB” means gigabytes.)Decide whether or not you need an iPad that offers mobile capabilities. All iPads come with Wifi, but if you’d like to use the iPad as a phone or even use a hotspot, getting a 3G or 4G iPad would be wise.
Figure out if you need an iPad with retina display. If you really like to play games on your iPad or watch a lot of movies, then getting an iPad with retina display will improve your viewing experience. The older versions of the iPad may not offer retina display, so remember that when selecting a model.
Keep in mind that older iPads don't always work with every network. Technically, all iPads should be able to connect to the network of your choosing, but many people have complained that the older versions don't always work like they’re supposed to. So remember that when deciding if you want to get one of the older models or generations.;
, The generation and model of iPad you choose will determine what colors are offered to you. Earlier iPads come in black and white, while newer versions come in silver, space gray, black and gold.


Also consider whether or not you’d like to have the iPad engraved. When you purchase a new iPad from Apple, you can get words engraved into the back of the device for free.
Since you’ll be purchasing the iPad used, a free engraving probably won’t be offered with your purchase. However, you can contact the seller and ask if they would do an engraving for a low cost.

, New items from Apple are usually on the pricey side — with new iPads usually starting at around $499. Price alone could be a motivator to go used and get an iPad for a half or quarter of the price. Granted, most used Apple items don’t come with the accessories that new iPads do (i.e. lighting power cords for charging), so keep in mind that you may be purchasing accessories elsewhere.

, The main difference between a refurbished iPad and a used iPad is that a refurbished one receives new glass, a brand new battery and a new outer shell. A used iPad is exactly as it was when it was purchased, and usually does not have a warranty. If you buy the refurbished iPad from Apple (as opposed to another seller) you can also get a one-year warranty and choose to purchase Applecare, just like you would for a brand new iPad.
If you buy an iPad that’s been refurbished by another seller or company, be wary of whether or not it was refurbished properly. Apple is known for taking good care of their products, but other sellers who tamper with the iPad may not deliver the same results.

, Sites like Amazon, Cell Phone City and Gazelle usually offer pretty good deals on used or refurbished iPads. There isn't a chance to haggle, but there may be no need if the price is right.


Fixed price websites often offer accessories with the iPad to sweeten the deal, when auction sites may not. So you may be getting more bang for your buck if you opt for a site like Amazon.

, The Apple Store offers refurbished and used iPads for customers on their website, . Apple has rave reviews about how well their refurbished and used iPads work, but they can be a little more expensive than if you bought from another seller.


If you buy through Apple and end up spending a little more money than you would have if you bought from another seller, you'll still be paying less than you would for a brand new iPad — and you'll be paying for quality.

, Since bidders are the ones who set the price for the iPad, this could give you the opportunity to purchase it for a great deal. The fewer people who bid on the iPad, the more likely you are to buy the iPad for less money. If you're really strapped for cash, this could be the best option.

, Whether you’re picking up a used iPad from someone on Craig's List or if you’re getting one at Best Buy, in-person purchases allow you to make sure the iPad is in good condition. Sometimes, you may even be able to haggle down the price if the seller is right in front of you and knows you're looking to buy.

, This may be difficult to do if you’re buying online; if the seller says that it’s scratch free or has hardly been used, you basically have to take their word for it. It’s good to make sure the seller has a refund policy, so that when the iPad comes in the mail and it’s not what you expected, you can send it back. But if you’re buying the iPad in a store, this is the perfect time to test out its functions and examine its body to make sure it’s worth your money.


When checking the body of the iPad, examine the screen for dead pixels, cracks, water damage, dents, scratches or any other signs of wear and tear.

,


Check to make sure that the iPad turns on and off by pressing and holding down the Sleep/Wake button on the top or side of the iPad. The screen should go dark and a button should pop up and say ""Slide to Power Off."" Slide it to the right to do so. To turn it back on, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button again.Check to make sure the iPad connects to Wifi. Go into the Settings application, select Wifi and then turn Wifi on. If the iPad connects to the closest available network, then the Wifi capabilities work.

, Be wary of sellers who may be trying to scam you into purchasing a stolen iPad. To figure out whether or not the iPad was stolen, check out the the serial number of the device in the Apple support website at https://checkcoverage.apple.com, and check to make sure the Find My iPhone Activation Lock is turned off and the device is ready for you to use.


You can check the Activation Lock status on Apple's website here.
After going to the website, enter your device's IMEI identification number or its hardware serial number, and the page will say whether the device is locked or not. This will show that the iPad you’re buying has been cleared of all the previous users’ past data and that it truly belongs to you.

, Charger cords can be damaged or not work properly, so plug the iPad into its charger to make sure that it works.


The older versions of the iPad have a 30 pin connector, while the new iPads have a lightning cord. Do some research online for your specific iPad to make sure you're getting the right charger accessories with your purchase. If a case was offered with the iPad, check it for cracks.

Move forward with positivity.",How to Break Up with a Boyfriend Who Still Loves You," It can often be helpful to reach out to a trusted family member or friend for advice. This can help you figure out the best way to end things with your boyfriend. Be careful about who you talk to; you don’t want rumors of your break up to get to your boyfriend before you get the chance to talk to him about it. Sometimes confiding in an immediate family member is less risky., Go over the break up in your head or write it down in a notebook. Prepare what you’re going to say, and contemplate how he might react. Being prepared makes it easier to properly express and explain in the moment, which will be better for both you and your boyfriend.


Not making decisions about what you’ll say can lead to more confusion for your boyfriend.
It’s an emotional moment, which might make it tough to be clear-headed if you don’t think about what you’ll say beforehand.

, Start brainstorming new activities to try and ways to stay busy once the break up has happened. As soon as you go from being in a relationship to single, it can seem like a negative change. Work on seeing the positive aspects of this change so that you’re in a good place when the break up actually happens.Journaling positive thoughts can help you change your perspective about being single.

, While it might seem easier to you, breaking up with someone in a text message, in an email, or on the phone isn’t the way to go. Your boyfriend deserves being broken up with face-to-face. This is the considerate thing to do because it allows your boyfriend to freely react, ask questions, and feel less alone. Just as you’re expressing your emotions, you need to let your boyfriend do the same., Instead of bringing it up abruptly and in an uncomfortable location, pick an appropriate time and place to break up. You may have already started separating emotionally from your boyfriend, but consider that he will have some catching up to do. Easing him into the break up as much as possible.You might say, “Hey, could we meet up today or tomorrow sometime? I’d like to talk with you about something important.”
Avoid breaking up right around birthdays, Valentine’s day, or funerals of loved ones., It will really soften the blow if you initially communicate that you value your boyfriend.


You might say, “We’ve been close for a long time and you’re really important to me.”
You could also say, “I really like you and I’m glad that we’ve spent time together and have gotten to know each other”, Starting statements with “I” instead of “You” will make your boyfriend feel less blamed and/or attacked.


Consider saying, “I understand where you’re coming from,” if your boyfriend gets argumentative and upset., While breaking up, acknowledge the emotional toughness of the situation.


To be supportive, you might say, “I know this is hard.”Even if you don’t think you were the reason for the break up, taking ownership for at least some of the blame will make your boyfriend much less prone to depression and stress after the breakup.

, Try to be honest and straightforward without being abrasive. Avoid saying things like “maybe one day we will get back together” or “part of me still loves you.” This is a tough part of breaking up because if you are too harsh, you may come off as heartless, but if you aren’t firm, you’ll give your boyfriend false hope., Your boyfriend will probably feel confused, angry, and/or sad. Do your best to be comforting and understanding when this happens. Answer any questions that he has while remaining calm and kind.

, Even if you want to be friends with him, it’s important that you initially give your boyfriend time to heal. Resist the urge contact him so that he can adjust on his own and without you to lean on. You both need time to reflect, process, and recover from the breakup in order to move on. There’s a chance that later on you’ll be able to be friends, but don’t expect this or attempt to make it any time soon., It’s painful to let go of someone you care about, especially when you’re the one who let them go.


Remember that there was a reason you broke up with your boyfriend. While breaking up might have caused him short term pain, it prevented drawing out the pain between the two of you.Own your feelings. If you want to cry, let yourself cry. Don’t hold your emotions in, or it will be more difficult to truly move on., Once you’ve grieved, get rid of reminders of your boyfriend. There’s no need to have his old T-shirts and pictures of you two lying around. Then, start a new by keeping busy and socializing with people you care about.


Spend time doing whatever makes you happy--hiking, dancing, cooking, etc.
Consider taking on a challenging new workout routine.
Try volunteering with a friend."

Be careful next time you move in with someone.",How to Break Up and Live Together," You do not want to waste any time. It's important to establish boundaries quickly. Without ground rules, resentment for your ex can build up quickly. It may be hard to have a calm, diplomatic conversation after a breakup, but this is vital in the wake of a breakup.Think about basic responsibilities and interactions, such as household chores and social interactions. Will you still do each other's dishes on occasion? Who sleeps on the bed and who sleeps on the couch? If a mutual friend has a get-together, can you both go? These are questions to ask in the aftermath of a breakup.
It's a good idea to mutually agree to stay out of one another's personal life. If you're living together, this can be difficult. However, you can set a general rule that you no longer get to ask where the other person is going or who they're seeing.
Until you've both moved out, check in regularly. See how the other person is feeling and whether you need to adjust any boundaries and expectations.;
, Usually, one person will eventually move out. It can be tricky to decide who will make the move. Sit down and have a conversation about who's staying and who's going, as well as financial obligations.Will the party who moves out still be expected to pay half the rent? It's usually not appropriate to leave the other person hanging financially. Make sure any lingering debts, like utility payments, are taken care of before someone moves out.
If you need a new roommate, you should both agree to find one together. No one should walk away from the lease and leave the other party fully responsible for the extra finances.
It's a good idea to get everything in writing. You want to make sure you come to a clear mutual understanding.

, There are a lot of emotions involved in a breakup. You may experience feelings of anger or resentment for your partner. In these situations, however, Even if its hard, do not lash out at your ex. You do not want to create a hostile home environment. Strive to remain calm, even when you're feeling strong emotions.
Keep things cordial between the two of you. You do not have to be best friends in the aftermath of a breakup. In fact, it may be difficult to do so. However, at the very least strive for basic manners.

, Depending on how long you live together, one or both of you may start dating. This can create an awkward situation. In the event you do begin dating someone while living with your ex, make sure to set respectful boundaries.It's a good idea not to bring dates home. These situations will likely be uncomfortable for your ex and your date. You should both establish a ground rule that you will not bring dates to the house or apartment you share.
If you are dating someone else, let your ex know. It's a bad idea to hide a new relationship when you're living together. Say something polite like, ""I just wanted to let you know, I'm seeing someone. I won't bring him into our home, but I thought you would want to hear it from me and not someone else.""
You should also respect the person you're dating. If you meet someone you would like to become involved with, be completely honest with them about your situation. It may be a good idea to wait until your lease is up to start dating.

, If you were living with your ex, you probably relied on them for a lot of emotional support. You likely told your ex about your day, asked them for input when you were stressed, and generally shared most things. It's unhealthy to continue this level of closeness after a breakup, even if you want to eventually be friends. Look for other sources of support so you will resist the temptation of leaning too heavily on your ex.Talk to close friends and family members instead. If you have a bad day at work, for example, call your best friend on the commute home. This way, you'll have gotten everything out of your system before you get home. You'll be less likely to vent to your ex.

, Space is vital after a breakup, and it can be difficult to obtain if you're living together. On certain nights, see if you can stay somewhere else. This will help both of you gain some space.If you will only be living together for a short period after your breakup, consider staying with a friend until your ex moves out. It probably will not be too taxing for a friend to have a house guest for a week or so.
If you'll be living together longer, you may want to stay at different friends places a few nights each week. You and your ex could also talk about taking turns staying elsewhere. You and your ex could each agree to stay at a friend's place two nights a week, for example.

, If you really want this to work, stay away from the house or apartment. It can be uncomfortable to relax in a place that contains memories. Actively work on getting out of the house on a regular basis.You can get out by going to the gym, the library, going for a walk, or just doing anything to get out of the house. The gym can be particularly helpful, as exercise can help you regulate your emotions.
Try to make plans with friends. Good friends will understand why you may need to get out a lot.

, If possible, try to work opposite hours. If your ex works days, you can work evenings, for example. It is possible to live together but rarely see one another.


If different work schedules are not possible, think of other ways to have different schedules. You could, for example, agree to go out with friends different nights of the week. You could also agree to do things like grocery shopping and running errands on different days and times.

, It can be hard to regulate your emotions during any breakup, but it may be particularly difficult if you see your ex every day. Once a week, remind yourself what you have to be grateful for. This can help alleviate stress and increase feelings of happiness.Make a list once a week of everything you're grateful for: friends, family, your career, your passions. This can help you put things in perspective. Breakups are difficult, but romantic relationships are not the only route to happiness.
Do not try to do this more than once a week. A daily gratitude list can feel overwhelming. It may be difficult to think of something every day, which can fuel negative feelings.

, This is very important. Breakups can cause feelings of sadness, leading to you neglecting your personal care. It's important to keep up with the basics of hygiene, healthy eating, sleep, and exercise.Sleep can be particularly difficult if you're sleeping on, say, a couch. See if you can find a cheap inflatable mattress or futon after a breakup. This may make sleep easier.

, You should not withdraw completely during a breakup. It's important you have support from those around you. Try to make plans with sympathetic friends who will listen to you vent. In addition to helping you regulate your emotions, this gives you an opportunity to get out of the house. This can provide necessary space from your ex., It's okay to let go of certain hobbies and extra obligations during a breakup. It's important to give yourself time to grieve and think. You may be inclined to overwork, but this is often a way to avoid emotions. You should confront your feelings instead of burying them in work.Cut back on extra obligations. Skip a few meetings for organizations you work with, for example. Say no to doing favors for friends.
Make time for self-care, hobbies, and time with friends instead of loading your schedule with extra work.

, Strive to learn something from this experience. In the future, make wiser decisions when you decide to move in with a partner.Do not move in just due to finances or convenience. This can result in you pushing yourself into a situation prematurely.
Wait until the honeymoon phase of a relationship ends before moving in. Strive to date for at least a year or two before cohabitation.

Though you may not think there's anything objectionable about breaking up the person you like and his or her significant other so both of you will be happier, the world may not see it that way.,

Don't be paranoid about the past or it won't last.",How to Break Up a Couple," Also, mature and intelligent couples can see your motives clearly and easily, especially if you have exhibited any jealous to one of the partners, claim to be a close female friend, or an ex-girlfriend.


If this is your goal, make sure you're completely certain it's the right thing. Are you willing to sacrifice your dignity? If the break up is caused by an outside force (you), and not a natural problem in the relationship, the couple may still harbor feelings for each other which might grow stronger over time.;
, If you want to break up the man or woman of your dreams and his or her significant other, then, like Othello's Iago (but far less devious), you have to get in the middle of the couple, slowly but surely. To do this, you have to get the person you like to trust you and to begin to open up to you. Be understanding, agreeable, and sympathetic, show that you're a good listener. At first, the person may not open up to you about his or her relationship, but that time will come.


Just one warning: there's a difference between being the confidant of your love interest, and in falling into the Friend Zone with that person. Make sure you don't act too buddy-buddy or friend like with the person or he or she won't ever be able to see you as a love interest. If one of the partners finds out, you are sure to fail. This does not work 99 percent of the time.

, Every relationship has flaws, and the chances of a couple past honeymoon stage and dating for a few years breaking up is low. The worst thing you can do is openly criticize the person's relationship, criticize the person's partner, or generally make the person feel like he or she is in a doomed relationship. This will make the person feel angry, defensive, and more determined than ever to make things work. No one wants to admit to a failure, especially not in a relationship, so you have to wait for the person to naturally admit a problem on his or her own.


You can start by just letting the person talk about the relationship. Ask innocent questions. For example, if you know that her band was playing at a local venue the night before but that her boyfriend didn't show up, innocently ask if he liked her show.
Or just ask questions about how the person's night went. If she seems kind of upset, just say, ""How was your weekend?"" and wait for her to reveal the rest.
Ask, ""How did that make you feel?"" Keep it broad with general questions that encourage the person to keep talking -- and to start seeing the cracks in her relationship.
Unfortunately, you may be trying to break up a couple that is in a great relationship, which would make it difficult for the person to reveal anything negative. But if you've made yourself the person's confidant, it's less likely that the relationship is in great shape.

, Once the person does start revealing the flaws with his or her relationships and all of the problems with his or her partner, the worst thing you can do is to completely agree or to say, ""You deserve so much better than that."" This will make the person see that you have ulterior motives. Instead, act a bit withdrawn or confused, forcing the person to talk for longer and explain why he or she is really unhappy -- and why his or her partner isn't perfect.


If the person has to explain his or her frustration further and you keep him or her talking, then he or she will notice the problems even more.
Just keep the person talking any time something negative comes up. Questioning his or her thoughts will make him or her explore them even further.
Not criticizing her relationship will also make things better down the line. If you do end up together, no one can tell her that you sabotaged the previous relationship. When you ever openly criticize one of the partners, especially if your plan has failed, it proves you were trying to screw up the relationship.

, Without completely changing your personality, you can try to be the person that the person you like is looking for in a relationship. If she complains that her boyfriend never asks about her feelings, make sure to do that. If she wishes her boyfriend shared more of her interests, go hiking or check out the new vegan cafe she was raving about with her.


This isn't as manipulative as it sounds. If you want to be with the person for a good reason, then you should want to be a good partner to her, right?
Don't make a big deal about it. If she complains that her boyfriend never does her favors, bring her lunch or coffee when she's having a busy day at work. This may backfire because she or he might just be using you as an emotional dump.
Don't go over the top with this. Doing these things and being a good person for the person you like will naturally make you start to fall into the boyfriend or girlfriend role, but don't do anything too extreme, like get her flowers, or tell her how beautiful she looks. It becomes obvious if you do something romantic like buying her extravagant things so be careful. If you're a girl trying to break a man up with his wife, he will push you away if you buy him things because that is openly telling him you like him, unless he is a user.

, This doesn't mean that you should be at the person's beck and call or to be a lap dog. It just means that slowly, you should start hanging out a little more...and then a lot more. Offer to give her a ride to class, grab a casual bite, and propose an innocent game of tennis and until you've become a part of her everyday routine. Make sure you're not getting obsessive and that your love interest is making some of the calls.


Don't be too dependable. The person should see that you have a life of your own -- beyond trying to break up the relationship.
Being more present will help the person see what it would be like to be in a relationship with you. This should give her a good and more certain feeling about you.

, Every couple has it's own weakness. Let's say they're the kind of people who tend to fight when you're out at big, drunken occasions. Perfect -- invite them to your next party. Let's say the woman of your affection's boyfriend drinks spends too much money -- tell him about a new gadget he can't live without. Let's say you like a guy with a girlfriend who is too obsessed with her appearance; take her on a shopping trip.


Once you pinpoint whatever is wrong with the couple -- and there may be many, many, things -- you can go about making it so much worse. Turn that little crack into a gaping hole until they can't help but fall in.
If one person in the relationship wants to get married and the other is reluctant, find ways to bring up the subject of marriage. Talk about your parents' anniversary, invite them to an engagement party, even send them a diamond ring catalog through the mail.

, Nothing will make a couple lose interest faster than having a good time hanging out separately. Invite your love interest's girlfriend out for a girl's night -- or better yet, introduce her to a guy she'd click with even more. Do what you can to keep the two people apart as much as possible, making sure they actually like what they're doing when they're apart.


Don't be too obvious about it. Just casually introduce some activities that would naturally keep them away from each other.

, If you really think that the person you like is in a terrible relationship and that he'd be better off with you, then chances are that his buddies feel the same way. If that's the case, then you should be friendly with his friends without making a spectacle of yourself, just making them think you're a cool person. This may lead them to ask your love interest, ""Why are you still with that loser? Why don't you go out with instead?""


When you're hanging out with the friends of your love interest, don't hang on to him too much. Don't make them think that you're out for their friend; just make them notice that you'd make a great match with their friend.

, There's a difference between becoming a closer friend and being available, and acting like you want to hang out with the person you like all the time, in spite of his or her relationship. Don't try to hang out on obvious date nights, special occasions, or times when you know the couple is spending time together. This will make the person you like suspect that you'd be needy and clingy if you were together -- and nobody wants that.


You can make yourself available without texting or calling the person you like every five minutes. Set your trap and wait for her to come to you.

, Nothing will make the person you like realize what he'll be missing faster than seeing you with another guy by your side. This doesn't mean you should use somebody to make the person jealous; just spend more time with a close friend of the opposite gender, or go on a few harmless dates and report back about it. You'll be surprised by how quickly you'll be seen in a new light, and the situation will grow more desperate. It's good to remind the person that you won't be around forever.


This will make the person think, ""Oh no! This great friend I have may get snatched up...oh wait, why should I care? Could this mean that I have feelings for him?""

, Unless it's very obvious that the person is ending the relationship for you, you should not swoop in immediately and start trying to date the person. Instead, you should be a good friend, a sympathetic listener, and just a shoulder to cry on as the person deals with the sad feelings that naturally accompany any break up -- even if it was meant to be.


Tell the person you're always there if he or she needs to talk, and that you can't imagine what he or she is going through.
Still, don't bad-mouth the other person. Calling the person's ex a jerk or worse right after the break up might make the person angry.
Know what would cheer up the person. Give her a silly stuffed animal or take her out to a comedy. Just don't do anything too romantic yet.

, Though you may have waited months (or longer!) for the relationship to finally end so you can be with the person you like, this doesn't mean that you should move in all of your things, start hooking up, and introduce the girl of your dreams to your parents and fifty closest friends. Instead, give it time. Even if you have decided to date right away, don't spend every moment of every day together -- just see the person a couple times a week, giving her time to heal.


The best thing to do is to give the person time to heal and not to date at all until he or she is ready. But if feelings are serious, this is easier said than done.

, Though you and your new boyfriend or girlfriend might have initially spend hours dissecting the previous relationship, this is not the time to rehash it. Though you shouldn't pretend the person's ex doesn't exist, you should avoid talking about him, or definitely asking about him, until the person has had enough space -- this could take months, or even over a year.


Of course, if the person really wants to talk about the past relationship, you shouldn't change the subject. But you can say that you think, in order to focus on your new relationship, you should leave the past behind as much as you can until you have firmer footing.

, Don't get stuck in the past, and don't worry so much about being the perfect person for your new partner -- just be yourself. If you were really meant to be together, then you'll find a routine that works for you and will find a path to true happiness. Don't compare yourself to the ex, try to be the opposite of the ex, or try to be something you're not.


Sure, you might have used some devious tactics to make your new relationship happen, but if you want it to last, you should think only about the two of you being together -- and nothing else.
Even if you had a deep friendship before, you should find new things for you to do together as a couple that can define you as an item, not make you think of the past.

, You may find yourself in a hard position. Your new love interest has broken up with an ex for you -- who is to say it won't happen again if he or she finds a person who is even more right for him or her than you are? Well, no one can promise that it won't happen, but to stay sane and have an amazing relationship, you have to tell yourself that the previous breakup was meant to be, and that you and the person you're with really belong together. It won't happen again.


If you always ask about what the ex is up to or act jealous when the person spends time with people of the opposite sex, you'll be dooming your relationship to failure.
If it's really meant to last, then in the long run, you'll find that you'll stop worrying about the ex or the previous relationship. But this could take months -- or even years. But if you're meant to be together forever, burying the past will be worth it.

Are you feeling as if all the zing has gone from your romance?
Are you failing to talk intimately anymore?
Has the intimacy as a whole dropped?
Do you feel as if you've grown apart from one another?;
, This is tricky, because sometimes meeting people comes with promises and excitement, so make sure you are in the relationship for the right reasons. Here, try to think of the things for which you are grateful.


Things you might be grateful for: Conversation, intimacy, sex, sharing, coziness, building a future together, being given space, similar goals, willingness to keep trying, personal traits, and so forth.

, Realize that this may not work out but it is important to try and to remain focused on the things that matter rather than focusing on what you feel is letting you down about the relationship. The idea is to amplify the reasons for being together and see whether these outweigh the reasons for ending the relationship.

, If you like knitting, and he likes sports and you spend your afternoons apart either knitting or watching TV, then you are bound to lose interest or forget why you are together in the first place. Doing things together will not only spice up your romance, it gives you the time to ""remind"" yourself why you are with the person. Of course, a lot of things about your partner might irritate you, but keep trying to look on the positive side of this relationship.

, It is said to be a medicine, so do it regularly, make it a habit.

, Be grateful for their interests as much as for your own. Buy your partner a comedy show ticket and take her out. Surprise your partner to something you know they'll like, such as a football ticket (go along with your partner), a book (if they like reading) or a Grand Prix ticket. Stimulate the things that they care about, in order to better understand these interests.


If you're worried you'll get bored, realize that it will only take a couple of hours, then you are good to go!

, Communication is key, Talk more and try to help your partner find the reasons to be grateful for the relationship through introducing the ideas into what you talk about. If the relationship is nearing an end, inject the reasons for sparking it back to life through your discussions.


Remind your partner why you both came together and what inspired you about each other.
Remind your partner of his or her appeal and why you love them.
Ask your partner to tell you what they're grateful for within the relationship.

, If you are both feeling that the relationship has become flat, dull and near its end, it is definitely time to talk. If your other half is not giving you enough attention, then you both need to sit down as adults, and discuss what works and what doesn't. This is important because you're probably both tiptoeing around the disintegration of the relationship, letting it eke out without addressing the causes of its breakdown.


Never make promises you never keep: This screams disaster! The last thing you want is pressure. And if you put yourself under a lot of it, you might tend to fail at your own game. Not cool. instead of making promises, make surprises. when they least expect it.

, If you always find yourself complaining, stop, it's a bad habit. Instead take advice and feedback, look on the positive side of life and make something good out of it. Inject the gratitude in place of the whining. Remember that moaning, whingeing, whining are all irritable behaviour that people really find hard to cope with and are usually an outward sign of inability to deal with inward issues. Try to lighten up, be funny, show your fun side and don't take all things personally.

, Maybe it's a gratitude jar filled with good memories, a shared journal or a weekly or daily round up of what you care about in each other. Whatever ritual you choose, make it a part of your rebuilding the relationship and stick to it regularly. It will help to remind both of you why the relationship matters and needs working on.

, If you've tried hard and things haven't changed, it may be time to end the relationship. You can't make another person change if they don't want to. Be reassured by the effort you've put in to try and salvage the relationship this far. It's far better than not having tried at all.

, There is a saying that it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. You will have learned much from this relationship and that is something to be grateful for. Whether it's what to avoid doing, the type of person to avoid being with or the good things that happened during the relationship, there is learning to take away from it. Give yourself time to grieve and recover but also give yourself the chance to take away the good lessons for your future.

While this many feel hard in the moment, talking in person makes it easier in the long run because it will provide an explanation and some closure for the other party. If you don’t talk to them directly, they may keep trying to contact you which would be harder for you over time.


You should consider how long you’ve been together before you decide how to break up. If you’ve only been on a few dates, a phone call may suffice and may be easier for you than doing it in person. But if you’ve been together for a few months or more, you should try to do it in person.;
, When you break up with someone, they are likely to have lots of questions for you. These can be general or specific things about why you are breaking up with them. Take some time to answer these questions for yourself before you talk to the person. Keep your answers, short, direct, and considerate. Some questions you might want to prepare answers to include:


Why are you breaking up with me?
Did I do or say something wrong?
How long have you been thinking this way?
Is there anything I can do to change your mind?

, Give your partner the courtesy of telling them what is really going on. Avoid being unduly hurtful, but let them know what isn’t working for you. This will make it easier for you both to come to terms with the breakup.Be as honest as possible at every step of the breakup. If you don’t think you can be friends with them after it’s over, don’t lie to them and say you want to continue being friends.
If you make the break up about how you feel, then they won’t be able to argue with you. Your partner can make all kinds of promises to change various aspects of their life or behavior, but they can’t change how you feel. This will make it easier for you.

, With any break up that you want to go well, it is important to explain your feelings and the reason why you want to leave the other person. But if you want the break up to be as easy as possible, there’s no need to hash out every single little detail that annoys you or upsets you about the relationship. That will just drag the conversation out longer.Choose one big thing that you feel is the main problem and give that as your explanation for why the relationship is over.
For example, if your partner doesn’t want children and you definitely do, you could bring that up as the reason you want to end the relationship. But you don’t need to explain how some of their habits annoy you and how your friends don’t like them. These things will just prolong the conversation and make the break up harder.

, Are you moving forward or standing still? Sometimes it's easy to recognize this, and other times you may move blindly through a bad relationship for months or even years. Take a minute to think and consider these questions together:


Do your conversations often come to a dead-end?
Do you argue over small things?
Does it seem painful to make plans with one another, or do you not enjoy each other as much as you used to?
Do you not feel the spark anymore?

, It is important to be direct and honest when you break up with someone, but you can also be compassionate towards the other person. Try to say what you need to say in a direct way while also being kind and considerate of the person's feelings. At the same time, avoid making overly kind or confusing statements.


For example, a direct yet compassionate statement might be something like, ""I really do admire you for so many reasons and I'm glad that we've had this time together, but ultimately it's clear to me that we want different things."" This lets the person know that you think they’re great and have enjoyed your time together, but that you do not think the relationship is working and you want to break up.
Avoid making a confusing statement might be something such as, ""You know I love you, but I can't be with you right now. Maybe I'll feel differently soon."" This can make the person think that you might want to reconnect with them again in the near future, which is misleading if you really just want to break up with them.

, If your partner doesn’t accept the break up, it doesn’t do any good to stand there and argue with them. That just gets you sucked back in to the drama of the relationship. Make your point clear and then walk away if they refuse to listen.


Don’t feel like you have to repeat yourself a million times. As long as you say what you want to say, the easiest thing to do is walk away after.

, The best thing to do after a breakup to make it easier on both parties is to give each other some space. Spend time away from each other to reflect on how you feel without your partner. Does it feel any different? Do you feel like you're missing something? Or does it feel like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders?Sometimes it takes a while to determine how you really feel after a breakup. You may miss the idea of a relationship, not necessarily your partner. Don't mistake loneliness as a reason to get back together because you might just be craving someone.

, After breaking up with someone, you may experience feelings of loss and grief. Instead of trying to ignore these feelings, do what you can to process them. This may involve writing about your feelings, crying, talking with friends, or even seeing a counselor if you are struggling to cope with your feelings. Recognize that there are five natural stages to grief that include:Denial. This is when you try to deny that you are experiencing any negative emotions about the breakup.

Anger. In this stage, you might feel anger towards the other person or yourself for the breakup.

Bargaining. This is when you might try to work out scenarios where the relationship might work.

Depression. In this stage, you may feel extremely sad and lose interest in your usual activities.

Acceptance. Finally, you will reach a stage where you feel at peace with what happened and you can begin to move on.

, Give yourself some time to heal from the heartbreak, but don’t let it affect how you treat others in your life – even your ex. Try to handle the fallout with as much grace and maturity as you can muster.


You and your ex may choose to be friends. This sometimes works out easily, and a great friendship may evolve. Other times, it just becomes awkward and calling yourselves ""friends"" is pointless.
You also may choose to simply ignore each other if it’s the easiest option. It shouldn't be awkward when you pass them in the hallway or scroll over their contact in your phone. It doesn't have to be. Take the high road and say ""hi"" every once in a while just to show that you can move on and be mature.

, The more quickly and completely you enact the breakup, the easier it will be for you to move forward. Don’t hold on to the past once you have decided to let the relationship go.Don’t continue hanging out with them like nothing has changed. This will only make it harder for both of you.
Try to get rid of all of the nostalgic reminders you have of your relationship.

, Try not to spend too much time reflecting on the memories of your relationship. This might make you doubt yourself because you might focus too much on the positives and overlook all the negatives. You broke up for a reason. Trust in that and don’t doubt yourself.It may also be a good idea to unfriend your ex on social media to avoid seeing their pictures and posts and to prevent yourself from reminiscing over old photos and posts.

, As you heal from the breakup, remember to take good care of yourself. This involves ensuring that you are eating well, getting regular exercise, making time to relax, getting enough sleep, and caring for your hygiene, such as by showering daily and wearing clean clothes.


Try doing something nice for yourself now and then as well, such as by buying yourself a new outfit or getting a massage.

, Support is essential for healing from a breakup. You may need a shoulder to cry on, someone to listen to you and offer reassurance, and people with whom you can enjoy spending time and having fun.


Call up friends to go out to lunch or dinner once or twice per week.
Spend time with caring, supportive family members.
Try joining a group to meet new people, such as a running club or a cake decorating class.

, Healing from a breakup can take a while. Although you may be impatient to move on, be sure to give yourself plenty of time to fully recover. Go at your own pace, and do not feel pressured to begin dating again until you feel ready.

, You may be moaning over your heartbreak, or rejoicing over your freedom. Either way – you have to remember the entire world is not just this one guy or girl. This doesn't mean you have to start dating or looking for someone seconds after the breakup. Enjoy your single status for a while. But when someone new comes knocking at your door, don't be afraid to open it.

Back up your decision with facts.,
Listen to your significant other’s concerns.,
Stay firm.,

You could also give your significant other a heads-up that you’d like to talk to them about something important at a later time. For example, you could text the person and say, “Do you have time tonight to talk? I think we need to talk about our relationship.”;
, Unless you are in an abusive situation and need to leave immediately, it is best that you talk to your significant other about your decision to break up. It will probably be a difficult and upsetting conversation, particularly if the other person does not agree with you. Talking to the person and making clear that you want to end the relationship, however, is the mature, responsible, and correct thing to do, even though it will not be fun.It is best to have this conversation face-to-face. You could decide to write a letter and present it to your significant other, and have the person read it while you are present.
Be clear in your intent. You could say, “I want to end our relationship,” or “I need to break up with you.” Saying things like, “I don’t know if this will work out,” or “I’m having doubts about our relationship,” could leave the other person into believing there is a chance to get back together again.

, This person was an integral part of your life for some time. Acknowledge that you had happy times together, and that you value the person for the part they played in your life.You could say, “I care about you a lot. You’ve been a part of my life for two years now, but I think we are growing apart.”

, Cite examples of why things between the two of you have not been going well lately. You could talk about previous arguments, breakups, or differences in values.


You could say, “I know we care about each other, but it seems to me that we also fight constantly. Remember last month when the neighbors knocked on our door to make sure we were okay? I don’t want to live like that anymore.”
Use “I language” to make your points. Describe your feelings instead of placing blame on the other person. For example, “You never want to have sex!” could become “I feel hurt that we haven’t had sex in so long.”

, They may be angry or upset, or they may agree that this is for the best. Allow your significant other to express their feelings.


Do not continue the conversation if the person becomes verbally abusive toward you. If that happens, you could hold up your hand and say, “I am not talking to you when you call me names. I am leaving now. We’ll talk again when we can have a respectful conversation.” Leave the premises before the situation can escalate further.You could say, “I know you’re upset, and I know you wanted us to work this out. But it doesn’t seem to me to be working anymore, and I don’t want to try to fix it again.”

, If your mind has been made up, don't allow the person to suck you into the same old arguments, guilt trips, or drama. Do not let the person try to persuade you to change your mind.


You could say, “I think we’ve been having this same disagreement for a while now, and we’re not getting anywhere. I’m done arguing about it, and I have made up my mind.”
You could say, “I know you want me to give you another chance, but I’ve already given you several chances. I don’t want to do this anymore.”

, It’s okay to be sad about your relationship ending, even if you know it is for the best. Crying is a healthy expression of grief.

You can even give your significant other a hug and cry with them if you feel comfortable doing so. Do not let the physical contact progress beyond a hug, to avoid sending mixed signals.

, Say your goodbyes and let your ex know that you will talk to them again in a few days (if necessary). Give yourselves a few days to grieve, calm down, and adjust to a new reality.


You could say, “I’ll call you in a few days to drop off your things from my place.”
If you live together, arrange to spend the night somewhere else. Contact a nearby friend or family member, or stay at a hotel. If there is nowhere else you can stay, you could say, “I’ll sleep on the couch tonight, and will find somewhere else to stay tomorrow.”

, If you are in an abusive situation, make plans to get to safety immediately. Do not stick around to see if the situation will improve or the person will stop. You have not done anything to deserve being treated that way, and you are worthy of better.


If you need to leave quickly, take only the essentials, like money, important documents, medications, and a few changes of clothing. Remember, things can be replaced.Bring your children to a safe location with you.
Have a safe place to stay, like a friend’s house where the abuser may not think to look for you, or a domestic violence shelter.
Once you are away from your ex, consider contacting law enforcement about pressing charges against the person, and/or filing a protective order against them.

Get some distance.,
Take a communication break.,
Look elsewhere for emotional support.,
Stand up for yourself.",How to Leave Someone for Good2," If you want to move on from this person for good, you may want to keep your distance from them for a while. Creating space between you and an ex helps establish a new boundary with each other and move forward in your separate lives.Consider avoiding some of the places you went together. You don’t want to run into them, and you don’t want to be nostalgic for your relationship, either.
Avoid “accidentally” bumping into them. For example, if you know your ex is a regular at a particular coffee shop almost every morning before work, don’t make an excuse to run into them there.
Change up your old patterns to avoid seeing your ex. Shop at a new grocery store, go to the gym on a different day, or find a new favorite hangout.
Consider moving to a new town if necessary.

, Even if you intend to stay friends, it's a good idea to avoid contact with this person for a while after you break up. Otherwise, they could slip right back into their old role in your life and start the cycle all over again.


You could say, “Right now I think we both need some space in order to figure ourselves out again, so let’s not contact each other for a while. You can email me in case there’s an emergency.”
Do not drunk dial (or drunk text, or drunk email) your ex. You will only end up creating more drama for yourself.
You may want to delete or hide your ex on your social media accounts so you will be less tempted to contact them., Your ex may have been an extremely important emotional support in your life. They may have been the first person you turned to when you had a bad day or were feeling down. Now that you are broken up, you will need to find other people to fill that role for you. Relying on your ex for emotional support may find you back in a relationship with them. You may be more willing to re-enter a relationship when you are feeling vulnerable.Think of people in your life who could be emotional supports for you. Who could help you on a bad day, and be there to listen? Consider friends, family members, coworkers, teachers, coaches, clergy, or roommates.
It’s okay if you have more than one person to fill this role for you. Relying on one person to be your sole support can be stressful to your relationship.

, If your breakup was nasty, you may hear about your ex spreading rumors, calling you names, or trying to turn mutual friends against you. Correct people on what isn’t true and stand up against your ex’s bullying, but stay positive and try not to stress too much about it.


You could try setting a boundary with mutual friends and say, “I no longer care what Angela thinks of me, so please stop letting her words get back to me. Please don’t repeat them in front of me anymore.”
Don’t stoop to your ex’s level and engage in name-calling or backbiting behavior. If someone tells you something your ex said, you could just say, “I’m sorry to hear she feels that way,” or even just “Oh.”
Be cautious if your ex is manipulative, possessive, or controlling. Be aware that they may have the potential to harass or stalk you. Ask your friends and loved ones to help take steps to ensure your safety.

Pack up your belongings. Have family or friends help you move, or hire movers.
Divide up any shared property.

, You may have lost mutual friends following your breakup. If you are divorcing, you may even be losing people you considered family. You may find yourself lacking in people you can trust to help you in a wide variety of ways, so you will want to make some new connections to help fill your support network gaps.Think of the people you are still in touch with post-breakup and the roles they play in your life. Does your old roommate still make you laugh? They can be someone you can call on a bad day. Is your new neighbor a handyman? They might be someone who can help you figure out what kind of repairs you need to do in your new place.
Think of all the roles your ex filled, and figure out if there is someone in your life who can replace them. Your ex may have been your emotional support, your friend, your lover, your person to go to the movies with, or your exercise buddy. You may find a new movie buddy in your coworker, or you may decide to take a fitness class to be able to work out with other people. Get creative to connect with others!
Understand that it takes time to make new friends and find people who can help you out. Be patient with yourself and the process.

, Getting over a breakup isn’t easy, even if it was time for the relationship to end. You may have physical symptoms like difficulty sleeping or loss of appetite, and emotional symptoms like sadness, anger, or anxiety. The best ways to move through grief are to let yourself experience the emotions without judgment and to talk to others about what you are feeling.Get rid of gifts, photographs, and any other relics of the relationship--or at least put them away out of sight -- at your own pace. There are no rules about when this needs to be done.
If you feel that you are struggling with your breakup, consider talking to a counselor about it.

, While grieving is healthy and normal after a breakup, sometimes you need to distract yourself and pull yourself out of your sadness. Keep busy with new activities to help encourage a new chapter in your life.


Take a class.
Train for an athletic event, like a triathlon or obstacle race.

Volunteer for an organization you support.

, Do all the things you were never able to do with your ex. Call on your friends and family, and make some new friends. Enjoy the beginning of this new chapter in your life!


If you are struggling to come up with some ideas, make a list of things your ex never liked to do with you, then go do those things. They may be something as small as going to get ice cream, because your ex was lactose intolerant.
Schedule dates with your friends and family. Take the initiative to plan fun activities with others.

, When the pain of your separation has passed, take some time to reflect on the positives of your relationship. What lessons did your ex help you learn? What did you appreciate about this relationship?You might wish to spend some time journaling about this, or spend some time alone with your thoughts.

If you want to be a good person after a breakup, avoid saying bad things about your ex. This is especially important when talking to mutual friends.If you really can't put off the temptation, write down everything bad about your ex in a notebook. Venting in your diary or journal is better than complaining to others.
Talking too much about your ex can also be bad for you. You don't want to get into a place where you're wallowing over negative things that have happened. This will not help you move on and let go of bigger feelings.If someone asks about the breakup, respond without saying anything negative. Instead of saying, ""She broke up with me because she thinks she's too good for me"" say something like, ""We wanted different things, and that's why we broke up."";
, Communication, even online, is a bad idea after a breakup. This can fuel bitter feelings. Try to un-follow your ex on various social media outlets. Avoid the temptation to visit your ex's Facebook and Twitter pages. If you're feeling any resentment over the breakup, you may start feeling bitter if you see your ex posting happy statuses or pictures.Do what is best for you when it comes to social media. If you think you will be better off not seeing your ex’s posts, then delete your ex from your friends. If you think deleting your ex will make things harder for you, then don’t delete your ex.

, Jumping into a new relationship is not fair to your new significant other. You need time to heal after a breakup. Going into another relationship right away is often a means to deflect negative feelings.You don't want to carry any negativity into a new relationship. If you're still reeling, you want to give yourself a chance to calm down before you pursue someone new.

, If you want to be a good person after a breakup, you need to be good to yourself. If you're feeling bitter or otherwise negative, you're more likely to take this out on those around you. Try to be aware of any negative, irrational thoughts you experience. Work on consciously replacing them with rational thought patterns.Many people have bitter, exaggerated thoughts during a breakup. You may, for example, think something like, ""My life means nothing without my ex"" or ""I don't think I'll ever be happy again.""
When you experience such thoughts, try to step away and look at them rationally. Replace negative thought patterns with kinder ones. For example, think things like ""I have a lot going on for me, even though my romantic relationship did not work out"" and ""I will be happy again eventually, even if things are rough now.""

, You don't want to emotionally unload on people long term. In the initial weeks after your breakup, friends and family members will be happy to offer you support. However, after a while, people will need to return to their own lives. If you keep leaning on people for too long, they will get frustrated.Seek out a therapist if you find that you still need significant emotional support after a few weeks have passed.


Try not to ask for too many favors for too long. For the first week or so after the breakup, it's acceptable to ask people to spend weeknights with you and listen to you vent.
After a few months, however, you should give people their space. Work on feeling better on your own instead of expecting other people to fix your problems.

, If you broke up with someone, you can offer them an explanation. If someone comes to you asking for closure, kindly explain why you wanted to end the relationship. This can help the other person grieve and move forward.You don't have to be cruel with the person. Remember to phrase things tactfully. You can also give a partial truth. For example, you found the person a little boring and therefore did not want a longterm relationship with them. It's a bad idea to say, ""You just kind of bored me as a person, so I wanted to be with someone else.""
Instead, tell the person you just didn't think the two of you were compatible long term. This is true, without being cruel. For example, ""I'm just at an age where I'm looking for something longterm. I really liked you a lot, and spending time with you was great, but I felt like it wasn't going to work out in the long run.""

, You want to make sure the person you broke up with still feels valued. A breakup can really affect someone's self-esteem and sense of self. When breaking up with someone, make sure to let them know you still value them as a person, even if you don't want a romantic relationship.Try saying something to the person along the lines of, "" You've been an important person in my life and I still care about you, but this is not working out for me because…""

, The person you're breaking up with may have some questions for you. It's okay to let the person ask certain things. However, repeatedly answering the same questions will not do any good. It's not good for you or the other person if you are just going around in circles. You both need space and time to heal.Try to give answers that do not invite further questions and discussion. For example, ""I want kids and you don't."" Or, ""I know you have goals to move up the career ladder and move out of the country. I don't want that for myself."" Avoid giving answers like, “I don't know what happened, but I'm not in love with you anymore.”
You can also invite the other person to ask questions if they're curious. For example, ""What do you think of this? Do you understand my decision?""

, Whether you dumped the other person, or the other person dumped you, you should not communicate too much directly after the breakup. Both of you need space. Being too involved with one another right after a breakup can lead to bitter feelings and arguments. After a week or so, you can stop talking as often or at all.If you want to stay friends, make sure to make your boundaries clear. For example, you can agree not to talk for a month or so and then talk again when you both feel ready to reignite a friendship. Try saying something like, “I want us to avoid communicating with each other for one month, so I will not answer your calls, texts, or emails during this time.”

, It's a good idea to keep yourself busy in the wake of a breakup. If you linger on bad feelings for too long, you may lash out towards others. To regulate your emotions, take up a new hobby or rediscover an old one. This can help you be a better person, as you'll be focusing on new, positive things rather than negative feelings.You can try to join a hobby where you meet new people. You may be in a better overall mood if you focus on starting fresh with new friends. You could, for example, take a cooking or painting class.

, If you're taking care of yourself, you're more likely to have the energy to manage your emotions. This will make you a better person in the aftermath of a breakup. Make sure you keep up with eating right, sleeping right, exercise, and personal hygiene., Don't try to do too much when you're feeling wounded emotionally. Especially in the days right after a breakup, it's okay to take time for yourself. Do not feel bad if you have to lessen your commitments for awhile.For example, say no to things more often. Don't agree to do extra favors for others or take on volunteer opportunities. You need time to recover.
Skip one obligation during the week. For example, miss one meeting for your church's vestry. Instead, stay in and do something nice for yourself.

, It's a good idea to stay social after a breakup. This can help you remember that there are still people that value you, even if you're not in a romantic relationship. Make plans with friends from work or school. Invite an old friend out to coffee. Staying socially active after a breakup can really help you mend."

If you or someone you know has recently attempted suicide and is currently in immediate danger, call 9-1-1, and request an officer trained in mental health.;
, Seeking help from a counselor, therapist, or healthcare professional in your community is key. Thoughts of suicide after a recent rejection may be tied to other mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. Seeking professional help will likely lead to better outcomes.


Professional counselors or therapists focus on healing and can help you find ways to cope more effectively.
Ask your primary care doctor for a referral to a highly qualified specialist, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or counselor.
Search for a provider in your community. See if there are options for counseling through your school, an employee assistance program, or non-profit community centers.
Most health insurance plans cover mental health services in the same way that medical services are covered. See if your insurance plan has mental health providers in your community that are covered under your insurance.

Make a conscious choice to choose peace and Zen over fear and blame.",How to Take a Zen Attitude to a Break Up," It is fairly standard after a breakup to put on the rose colored glasses and to see all the perfect aspects of the relationship, while not noticing what was far from ideal. Bewilderment at the loss can cause you to seek shelter in platitudes and convictions that show the best of your ex and the relationship you once had. However, as time passes, some hairline cracks appear, to let through a few disgruntled memories. At this stage, it's time to start focusing on the real reasons for why the two of you broke up, so that you can seek peace amid the turmoil. Common reasons for the end of a relationship include:


Too many arguments. Arguing and disagreeing with someone on a daily basis can take a toll not only on the relationship, but also on your psyche and self esteem. While some couples feed on the excitement of arguing and then subsequent making up, most people become exhausted and distracted from other aspects of life.
No mental or physical attraction. In order to have a healthy, balanced relationship you need to have both physical and mental (or cerebral) attraction. Convincing yourself to stay with someone based on looks or personality alone can only take you so far and eventually you’ll stray from the relationship. However, if you felt it on both ends, but your partner didn’t you must remember that you deserve to be with someone who is both mentally and physically attracted to you too.
Relationship timing was off. Perhaps your schedule or his or her schedule was too hectic or one of you had to move to another city––either way, scheduling and location problems can often cause problems in a relationship. Instead of wallowing in the break-up, take it for what it is––a break. Give your sorrow to a higher power and consider the relationship to be a possibility in the future. If it was meant to be you will find each other again.
Somebody cheated. Cheating is the enormous red flag in a relationship. If you were the person who strayed, understand that you should have first broken it off with the other person instead of betraying the relationship. However, what’s done is done and you must move on no matter what. And, if you were the one who was wronged, try to remember that you wouldn’t want to entrust your love to someone who would seek romance in the arms of another while still being in a relationship with you––you deserve better.
The whole dating thing was a bit of a game. Perhaps not for you but perhaps for your partner, or perhaps both of you never really knew whether you meant to stay committed seriously. If one or both of you thought this relationship was just about having a good time, then it's likely that a deeper connection was never going to be made.;
, Getting to a Zen place is most likely going to take time but that is good in itself because you are allowing yourself to get over something that was of worth to you rather than trying to rush to a place of feeling good again. People who refuse to face the pain of a break-up tend to risk rebound romances, in which they haven't worked through the painful issues of the past relationship and tend to project their pain and wants onto the new partner, even going so far as to substitute the ex with the new person and not seeing the new date for who he or she really is. Allow yourself the grieving space, which sometimes will feel as painful as mourning a loved one who has died. It’s a loss in your life and the only way to come out on the other end with health and peace is to properly grieve. Some psychologists believe that grief is comprised of five to seven stages including:


Isolation. A time when you need to be alone and reflective. Typically this first stage materializes while you are still somewhat in a state of shock. If you like to meditate, do so when going through your phase of solitude.
Anger. Often you will feel anger not only toward the other person but also toward yourself or perhaps to any surrounding circumstances. Anger can be let go through reflection and detachment but you need to acknowledge the anger first.
Bargaining. At this point you may try to regain control of the situation by thinking about ways you could have handled it differently. Typical thoughts include: ""If I only were more attentive to his or her needs"", or ""If I had only found him funnier.""
Depression or feeling low. Nearly everyone who experiences a break-up may feel some level of depression or the blues. Be aware of how deep your depression dips––if you wallow for more than a month or two and have thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else, you must seek psychological attention immediately. Be especially alert if you're already prone to depression, in which case, see the doctor after two weeks if your mood isn't lifting.
Acceptance. The stage where you feel at peace and accept the break-up is when you can finally move on.

, Dive bombing into a large bottle of wine, accompanied by Ben and Jerry’s ice cream may sound like ideal way to handle a break-up; however, the sugar and alcohol will only make you feel crummier. When experiencing the break-up doldrums, you want the endorphins to start pumping so you can start to feel better. Ways to reinvigorate yourself include:


Ditch all alcohol, sugar and greasy food in the pantry. This may sound insane but you need to eat a clean diet in order to start feeling physically (and mentally) better. Go and buy healthy food and grab a really cool, appetizing healthy food cookbook to get you started.
Hit the gym hard. Exercise can help you to conquer the blues, as exercise releases endorphins, those important “happy hormones” that help us to think a little more clearly and maintain a sunnier outlook toward life.
Keep good friends close. An afternoon seeing your favorite comedy film with a close pal can keep you from wallowing in sadness. Also, talking it out over dinner with a group of buddies will remind you that you are loved and have a secure support system.

, Deep breathing and visualization can take you that Zen place and help you recover from a hard break-up. Some types of relaxation techniques to explore include meditation, deep breathing, visualization and brainwave audios. Practice these techniques whenever you feel anxiety creeping up on you or every morning before you face the day.

, From Buddhist thinking, the idea of attachment and non-attachment is equally applicable to all walks of our life where we have pinned our hopes too much to someone and need to find ourselves again, as well as letting go of that person's influence on our lives. Spend time reading about the ideas of attachment and non-attachment and see how to apply this to your current path forward. In particular:


See your feelings for what they are––often ways to block ourselves from moving on because it is more comfortable to wallow in sorrow and suffer than to acknowledge the feelings but then let go of that familiar way of coping. Ultimately, causing yourself to suffer is not coping, it's hurting your chances of a full recovery.
Don't hold onto the old relationship. If you do, you are trying to hold onto the past, to something familiar but now illusory.
Seek to enjoy the present, to be in the moment.
Let go, in order to let happiness back in.
Realize that letting go takes daily commitment and recommitment; it isn't meant to be easy but if you're consistent, it will eventuate.
Learn to spot those negative moments and stop them. When they threaten to overwhelm you, openly acknowledge the thoughts and then redirect your thoughts toward letting go. Dwelling on trying to get back what has gone is an attempt to stay attached; seek to control only what you can control––your own thoughts.
Stop justifying. Let go of the ""if only's"" and ""I can't live without's""; realize just how destructive these thoughts are, in that they are fantasies that limit and imprison you. Start believing that you're strong enough to face the future and do things to show this to yourself, such as enrolling in something, seeing your friends or writing it all out in a novel and getting it published.
Allow yourself to grow. See yourself as a fluid––the person you were when dating your ex has gone. You are now moving on to another stage of your being, realizing more self-discovery and ways to keep finding your true self.

, Romantic love tends to suggest that we become enmeshed and ""we two are one"". Not only is this setting up two individuals for a potential co-dependent mash, it's just not realistic. You do not complete someone else, just as they do not complete you. You are whole, separate and real whoever else is in or out of your life. If you've let this wholeness slip during the breakup, restore it by accepting that you do not need to be with someone to be whole. Love is not about saving each other; it's about celebrating each other for who we are and who we keep becoming through our own inner exploration and external compassion.


Treat this breakup as a learning experience in how to hold people lightly. There is always a risk that if you hold too tightly, you suffocate. And while there is a risk that a person let go may never return, it is better that they make the choice to stay around based on truly loving you than feeling bound to you.

, Get out there and meet people, not because you want to date them, but because you genuinely want to connect with others. This isn't the time to pursue a ""replacement""; instead, celebrate who you are in relation to other people and realize that whether or not you're in a committed relationship with one person, there are many other people out there who need your love, motivation and compassion. By connecting more widely, you'll learn how it's possible to love without controlling, clinging or neediness so that when that right person does walk into your life again some day, you will already be a fulfilled person, ready to have a relationship of equals.

, You can make the difference simply by choosing to see the future in a more positive light and to regard this relationship as a lesson in your life rather than a weight you cannot bear. See things for what they were, keep practicing letting go and allow the space to grow for the rest of your life. Ultimately, wish your ex the best in your thoughts and truly mean it, thereby setting your thoughts to Zen.

Carefully consider whether this method is right for you.,
Start becoming more selfish.,
Don't give him the sympathy or pity he's looking for.,
If he cries on your shoulder anyway, stand there and hug him, but don't comfort him.,
When he says ""I love you"" try not to say it back.,
Become irritable and moody.,
Stop being as affectionate.,
Try not to talk to him.,
If he hates listening to stories about your previous partners, tell him loads, and add a bit of extras in to make him feel even more insecure.

,
Become busy with everything except him.,
At this point, your boyfriend should be quite annoyed and sad with where this relationship is going, and is probably having a lot of depressed moments himself.,
With the break up done, get out of there as fast as you can.",How to Get Your Overly Sensitive Boyfriend to Dump You," The steps below will cause your sensitive boyfriend a great deal of pain and trauma, much more than ending the relationship directly. It may even scar him permanently. Your mind must be made up that you want to cause this pain and trauma, or you may be unable to go through with it. This is also a good time to consider whether this is right for your relationship. Consider a direct break up. Using these steps as a first resort could backfire on you, causing strain between yourself and others, who may perceive you to be creating an abusive relationship. Make sure you actually want to end the relationship. If you have a good relationship, try talking to him first before take these steps. Tell him how you feel but politely.;
, When he tries to tell you about how horrible his day was, casually change the subject with something you suddenly remember you have to tell him. At first, do this occasionally, then start doing it more often until every conversation becomes all about you.

, Maybe you can just shrug and say ""Yeah, that's a bummer."" The idea is to gradually stop giving him the emotional support he's used to getting from you. You don't have to be cruel; just don't give him the shoulder-to-cry-on that he's wanting.

, Don't say anything like 'Come here baby' or 'there there'. Just stand there emotionless. Don't even think about bringing up conversation relating to what he is so upset over.

, If you've made a habit of saying it, though, taper that off. If he starts making a big deal out of it, just murmur it back, quickly, So its not understandable.

, Don't make it seem like it's his fault, but that you are just mad at the world and want to be alone because you don't want to snap at him. Do this more and more often if possible.

, If he makes the initiative, don't make it obvious that you don't want to, but do not make the first move yourself. Get to the point where you accept the affection, but don't give it back. And eventually, pretend to be annoyed by his affection. If he puts his arm around your shoulders, for example, you can say your shoulders are sore, you're not sure why, could he not do that for the next few days?

, Make as little conversation as possible. If he talks, reply with short answers, like ""hmm"" or ""yeh"".

,, Spend as much time at work as you can, or with family. After all that work, of course you only want to go to bed.

, When he finally goes to break up with you though, apply the following:


Just be quiet and listen when he is talking, don't interrupt him or make arguments.
When he makes statements about his confusion regarding your attitude and behavior, don't offer an explanation, just shrug and say you don't understand it either.
Don't cry. You knew this was coming, so even if it does hurt your feelings, keep a straight face and deal with it.
Don't smile either. Victory may be at hand, but you need to finish the battle first.
Do not console him. Don't hug him and say this is probably for the best, and don't do ""one last kiss"". Ever.

, If he tries to call or get back with you, maintain that icy heart that you've had since the start of this quest.


Or just be a grown-up and tell him it's not working, and you both need to move on. This is best way and it will prevent all the trouble and harm to him.

Don’t drag it out.",How to Break up With a Girl After a Really Short Relationship," Even though you have made the decision to break up because it's what's best for you, you should take some time to consider how the other person might feel about the break up. Ending a short-term relationship might come as a shock to the other person, particularly if they think things have been going well. If you plan accordingly, you can minimize this discomfort., There a lot of reasons that breaking up with someone can be hard, even if you haven’t been with them very long. In fact, our brains process breakups very similarly to how they process physical pain. So the phrase “broken heart” is pretty accurate! Even if you are initiating the break up, you will likely feel a variety of emotions: sadness, guilt, regret, and (sometimes) relief. This makes it hard to break up with someone, and recognizing that will help you deal with it., You shouldn’t stay in a relationship because you feel guilty about causing the other person pain, but you also shouldn’t break up with them the minute you’re sure if the timing is bad.


Wait a few days after your partner has received bad news – like getting fired from work –to deliver your own news. You should also never break up before or during a date or on someone’s birthday or another holiday.
The worst time to break up with your current partner is after you’ve already started seeing someone else. If the relationship isn’t working, tell your partner before you start looking for a relationship that does., You can use technology – text, social media, or email – to tell your partner you’d like to talk to her, but you generally shouldn't use these communication methods in place of actual conversation. You can try saying something like ""Hi Linda! I want to talk to you about something important. When can we talk in person?"" Or you could say ""I really want to talk to you about our relationship and where it's going. When are you free?""Although you should generally avoid using technology to have the actual breakup conversation, this could change depending on the length and nature of your relationship. If a majority of your relationship took place over the phone, or if it feels completely unnatural to talk to her in person about this, then a phone call might suffice (this is particularly true if it is also a long distance relationship). It could save her time as well.

, If you’re dreading the in-person conversation you need to have, you might be tempted to choose a very public space to break up. This can make the whole experience more embarrassing and painful for both of you.


Choose somewhere semi-private. Don’t choose somewhere like a party where she could embarrass herself by crying in front of her (or your!) friends. But do keep in mind that once the conversation is over, you’ll be broken up, so don’t invite her to your place if you live far away from her.
Avoid places with sentimental value. If you haven’t been in a relationship very long, you probably won’t have many places that have meaning in the context of your relationship. You should still avoid any such places however, like where you had your first date or first kiss., Be up front about why you’re breaking up: maybe you just don’t share a world view or you didn’t realize she was allergic to cats, which you love. Being honest and authentic will make a difficult situation easier.


Start by saying something positive. For example, you can say ""I really enjoyed the time we spent together,"" or ""I think you're a really good person.""
Be clear about what isn't working. You can say, ""...but I just don't have time for a serious relationship right now,"" or ""but I'm not having fun anymore"" or ""but I just feel like it won't work in the long run.""
Clearly state that you want to break up. Say something like ""So I want to break up,"" or ""So I want to stay friends but I don't want to be boyfriend and girlfriend."" This helps you avoid a situation where she thinks there's a chance to patch things up.

, If you don't want to be friends after the breakup, don't say you will be. It can be tempting to make such a promise because it can soften the impact, but making a promise and then not keeping it is worse in the long run., Saying “It’s not you, it’s me” doesn’t make anyone feel better and no one believes it. Instead, say something like “I know you want something serious out of our relationship and I’m not ready for that kind of commitment.” Be as straightforward and clear as possible., Be firm about the break up, but also make sure she knows that you appreciated and enjoyed the time you spent together. Saying something like “I really enjoyed the time we spent together but I just don’t see us working out in the long run” doesn’t leave room for hope that you’ll get back together, but it doesn’t tell her you think she’s a terrible person, either.,

She might agree with you that the relationship isn’t going anywhere. Or she might cry, ask questions, get angry, or walk away.

You will know best how to respond, but you might consider holding her hand if she cries or answering her questions as kindly as possible. You can also say something like ""I know this hurts you and I'm sorry.""
If, however, she gets more upset rather than calming down, set a specific time to talk to her later and then walk away. Say something like, ""I know you're very upset right now, so I will call you tomorrow so we can discuss this when we're both a little more calm."" , Recognize that this is a difficult conversation and might take her by surprise. Don’t resort to name-calling, fighting, or bringing up past mistakes. You want her to think of you as the one who just didn’t work out, not the mean jerk she was glad to get rid of., It can be tempting to “ghost” a relationship – slowly disappear until your partner realizes it’s over. This is not only immature, it also makes a difficult situation worse by inserting uncertainty into the relationship – you know it’s over, but she doesn’t. Instead, make time to talk to her and clearly end the relationship. It will allow both of you to move on much more quickly., You shouldn’t drag out a relationship that you know is over by disappearing. You also don’t want to continue to see your partner on a regular basis as if nothing is wrong when you know there is. Once you’ve thought everything through, break up as soon as possible. "

Talk with someone you trust.,
Ask for help.,
Surround yourself with supportive people.,
Practice self-love.,
Create a safety plan.",How to Avoid Committing Suicide Due to Rejection from the Person You Love2," There are people that care about you. They will help to support you through this time. Trust that they may have advice about what you're feeling, and the rejection you've faced. You are not alone. Being with people that you care about will uplift your spirits.You may feel as though you want to be alone all of the time, but make an effort to interact and socialize with other people. While wanting to be alone is a natural response, you'll feel better in the long term if you keep socializing with other people.
Don't be afraid to let out your emotions in front of the people you trust. It's okay to cry and be sad.
If you are feeling like hurting yourself, talk with them about if they have been depressed about a loss before or had thoughts of suicide before. See if your friend can stay with you until those thoughts of suicide subside.

, We all have been sad, afraid, lonely, frustrated, and annoyed at one point or another. Difficult times happen, and it’s about what you do when they occur. Taking control of your life and your emotions often means being willing to ask for help.


Asking for help can mean a lot of different things. It’s not just about someone to talk with.
Be with others when you’re feeling down. Ask them to visit or if it’s okay to visit them.
Ask for time off or help with chores so you can focus on your own needs. Be with people you trust when you need some time off. See if others can help with chores while you focus on self-care.

, Finding a support system during tough times is key. If you have been disconnected with friends or family after this break-up or recent rejection, then find ways to reconnect with those other important people in your life.Hang out more with your good friends or family on the weekend.
Talk with close family members. Do things that you both enjoy.
Avoid unsupportive, judgmental, or toxic people during this time.
Consider finding new people to develop friendships with. Maybe someone who has been going through the same thing as you.

, While a recent break-up or rejection may feel like the end of the world, give yourself some time to heal. It's okay to be sad, but know that you can and will find other things or people that can make you happy again. Your worth is not based on one relationship or one person.Love yourself. You are worthwhile, and have many things to offer.
Make a list of all of your best qualities. Keep them positive. Do you make other people laugh? Do you have any special talents?
Remind yourself of how important you are to other people. If you are struggling with this, ask your friends and family for their input.

, Suicide eliminates hope. And there is hope. By creating a safety plan if you have suicidal thoughts, then you will be more in control of your feelings. Here is an example of a safety plan, from the first to last plans of action:Create or read through a list of positives about yourself. Address the positive things in your life that you have to live for.
Use various distractions to avoid suicidal thoughts.
Get a good night's sleep.
Delay any attempt for suicide. Wait 48 hours and continue with your safety plan.
Have at least three people to call when feeling depressed. Call a friend/family member you trust. Call another person that you trust. Call your therapist or healthcare provider. Call the National Suicide Prevention Helpline if still in crisis: 1-800-273-8255.
Go to a place where you feel safe.
Call an ambulance or go to an Emergency Room.

Separate yourself from your ex.,
Grieve rejection as a temporary loss.,
Focus on the future.,
Find new interests.,
Adopt healthy habits.",How to Avoid Committing Suicide Due to Rejection from the Person You Love3," Avoid contact with your ex. While you may feel like you want to call, text, chat, email, or see the person you love again, this will not likely help you to heal. After rejection, learn to reduce your thoughts of your ex. Find health ways to redirect your thoughts, so that you are less likely to contact your ex.Consider these ways:


Delete their phone number, and block them from all of your social media profiles.
Do something for 30 minutes when the thought enters your head to contact your ex. Watch TV, go for a walk, do household chores, or anything that can hold your attention for 30 minutes.
Create a list of reasons why it's better to move on and be without this person who rejected you. Brainstorm three things that will help you see the bigger picture about the relationship.
Find a “phone friend.” Talk with someone you trust who you can call, text, or chat with instead of your ex.
Create a ""distraction"" box that helps you to remember good times before your ex. Fill this with things that are not associated with one person or group of people. This could be music, movies, funny pictures, or simple things.

, Everyone has experienced loss from one time or another. Rejection or the end of a relationship is connected to feelings of grief and loss. You may be going through this ""grief process"" but that does not mean it will last forever. Understand that committing suicide is permanent, and but these feelings of loss are temporary.Rejection or loss can feel like a rollercoaster of emotions. But this rollercoaster can end with you safely getting off the ride and moving on.
The pain of loss can feel personal, but remember that you can get better and find new love. Remember that love starts with yourself.
Look back at your life, and consider other times when you were disappointed, held back, or unsuccessful. Consider how you have moved on since then and the successes that you have had despite those encounters. Realize that these feelings may eventually pass.

, Rather than dwelling on the past relationship, take control of what you can do to learn and heal from this experience. When you've been hurt, you may feel like hurting yourself in return. Remember that you can make it through this and heal your wounds.


Don't become fixated on the past and your relationship. It will take time to feel better and know that you can if you break from the past.
Each day is a new day to start fresh and to find new meaning in life. Take it one step at a time.
Learn how your past can act as a guide to find new roads, but the past does not define your future.

, There are many positive things that you can enjoy, even without the person you care about. Explore new things and do the things you're most passionate about. Avoid isolating yourself. Share time with others by doing things like:Take a class such as drawing, robotics, music, or martial arts. Find something that interests you. See what options are available in your community.
Go to the gym. Join a fitness class. Participate in an intramural sports team.
Go shopping. Find creative boutiques. Thrift stores. Bookstores. Interact with people with similar interests.
Get outdoors. Find activity groups. Go to a local park. Walk a nature trail.

, Be healthy in mind and body. Taking care of yourself also involves the basics of being healthy with your daily habits. Avoid habits that may make you feel worse about yourself. Love your body and do these things:Follow the treatment plan developed by your doctor and mental health professional. Sticking to this plan is your best chance to get better.
Eat well. Drink lots of water. Avoid junk foods.
Limit alcohol and drugs. Avoid the temptation to smoke or drink. They may make you feel worse long-term.
Get a good night’s rest. Your body needs rest in order to heal. Create a bedtime routine that helps you to relax. Avoid using sleeping pills regularly.
Use breathing exercises to relax you. Meditate. Pray. Try muscle relaxation techniques.
Talk with a trusted friend or family member who makes you feel relaxed and happy.

Be open to new love.","How to Avoid Becoming a ""Psycho Ex"""," Depending on the nature of the break-up, you and your ex need to establish some ground rules about communication going forward. While you may want to talk or contact them still, listen to what your ex says. If they are ignoring you, they likely do not want to communicate.Consider asking questions to find out what the boundaries are. Ask, ""Is it okay if I call or text you?"" Listen to what they say or how they respond. Your ex may be ignoring you at this point, which is a passive ""no"" in these situations.
See if you and your ex wish to remain friends on social media. Ask, ""Can we still keep in contact through social media?"" If they end up blocking you on social media, this is a sign that they are trying to move on.;
, After a break-up, some people want to separate themselves from their ex, no matter how wonderful the times were before. If you ask your ex about keeping in touch, and they say “no,” be willing to respect this answer. If you continue to pester them, they may become even more irritated.


The act of saying “no” is not meant to disregard the relationship that you both had. It’s a sign that it's time to move on for both you and your ex.
Even if you’re upset with your ex’s actions, learn that he or she is human too. We all have the right to say “no.”

, While you may want to talk with them and find out how they're doing, accept that both you and your ex's lives won't simply stop just because your relationship ended. They will continue their lives and you will continue yours. Allow your ex the space and privacy to find their own path after the break-up. Invasion of someone's privacy is both emotionally unsettling and legally violating someone's rights. Each person has a right to their own privacy.
Once your relationship ends, if you continue to go into their home, text them throughout the day, or follow their every move, this is an invasion of privacy if the interactions are unwanted.
If you feel that what you're doing may be wrong, take a step back and find support elsewhere. Don't seek out your ex for support after a break-up.

, If you have been hurt by your ex, you may want to seek ways to ""hurt"" them by sharing secrets or sensitive information. By in truth, when you are trying to ""get back at"" someone, you are simply expressing your pain and rejection in public. This will not make you any better, happier, or stronger. Doing hurtful things to your ex out of spite will likely make you feel worse in the end.
Protect your image and yourself in public spaces like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other social media sites. Resist the urge to use social media as a way to vent your heartache. Avoid the need to ""overshare"" the details of your life on social media.
Don't find ways to ""stalk"" your ex through social media. Treat your ex's social media pages like their home, work, or favorite hang-out spot. Though it may be public, it is their private space at the same time.

, Trust is the key to any healthy relationship. If you break that trust, the relationship has little room to grow. Deception in order to get back with your ex will ultimately be harmful to you and your ex.


Stop and think about what you're doing and how you're acting. If you're emotionally overwhelmed, take a step back before deceiving someone to feel better.Resist temptations to get revenge or ""make them suffer"" by lying about a situation.
Avoid snap decisions that impact other's lives. When you feel overwhelmed by emotion or are having difficulty with what to do, redirect your thoughts of your ex to positive people or things outside of your relationship.

, Breaking up is tough, emotionally and physically. Learn to open up to friends and family that you trust about the hurt and pain you’re feeling. Avoid sharing your various emotions with your ex after a break-up. You need to find other outlets to let go of your hurt, anger, and sadness. Consider these outlets:Talk with a friend or family member by phone or in person about your relationship. You can choose how much to tell them about what you're feeling. See if they have advice about moving forward.
Write in a journal or other private space about your feelings. Avoid using social media for this.
Don't feel ashamed about what you're feeling. Sharing can help you feel less alone. Everyone has had a loss at some point in their lives.

, You and your ex may have mutual friends that you both see. Avoid trying to destroy your ex’s friendships with others. You may find that some friends stand by you, while others stand by your ex. And that’s okay.Avoid trying to get information about your ex’s relationship status through mutual friends.
Resist the urge to bad-mouth or trash talk about your ex. Avoid spreading gossip or half-truths.
Don’t seek dates with your ex’s friends as a way to simply make your ex mad or jealous. Having a genuine interest in your ex’s friends is one thing. Using your ex’s friends for your own agenda is another.

, A break-up can feel like you're going through grief. If you have been with someone for many years, the end of the relationship can be a shift in your way of life. Like the loss of a friend or family member, when a relationship ends, you may feel like you're losing that person.Grieving a break-up can go through stages of desperation, denial, bargaining, anger, acceptance and hope. These stages may last a few minutes, days, months, or years, depending on your situation.
It's okay to have different emotions, but avoid acting on emotions of anger and desperation.
Acceptance will take time, but understand that it is possible to find hope and learn to accept this transition.

, Try to avoid unnecessary reminders that connect your thoughts to your ex. Find things that you love to do that don't involve your ex. Do those things with friends, family, or on your own. Consider these positive ways to redirect your thoughts: Put away pictures or things that are reminders of your ex. Limit your time on social media that could lead you to think about your ex more.
Try new things with friends. Reconnect with people who are not associated with your ex.
Do something relaxing. Take a hike into nature. Go to a spa. Get a massage.
Get active. Exercise at the gym. Take a walk. Ride a bike.
Be creative. Use your time and energy to vent your emotions in a positive way. Draw. Paint. Build. Write.

, Accept and love yourself for who you are. While all people have faults, avoid dwelling on them in yourself or others. Avoid seeing yourself in a negative light as worthless. Learn to forgive yourself.Think about three things you love about yourself. Focus on both your personality and your body image.
Use positive affirmations each day. Say to yourself, ""I am a whole and worthy individual"" or ""I love and trust myself.""By loving yourself, you will be better able to move on. You will be less likely to act ""crazy"" or ""psycho,"" and instead act ""caring"" and ""loving.""

, Reach out the positive and caring people in your life. Talk with them openly about your feelings and actions. If they have concerns about what you are doing, listen first rather than acting defensive.


Avoid assuming the worst in yourself and others. If you have concerned friends, give them a chance to support you.
Consider meeting with a close friend one-on-one over the phone or in person rather than in large group settings. This may help you to feel more safe and secure when talking about a difficult break-up.

, If you're going through a difficult breakup, and find yourself still upset, sad, and in pain, seek help. There are many outlets to help you find ways to cope, teach yourself how to move forward and find your own self-confidence. Getting a professional's advice and support will help you to find strength and avoid any bad habits after a break-up.Talk with a counselor. Find a mental health professional in your community who specializes in break-ups and divorce. There may be options through your health insurance or private pay options. Many counseling centers also offer sliding scale fees.
Join a support group. There are many support groups through counseling centers and places of worship. They may focus on relationships, divorce, depression, or other life transitions.
Seek medical advice. Talk with your healthcare provider if you have severe anxiety or depression for many weeks or months. Be open about your family's mental health and medical history. They may offer medication for any severe symptoms.

, Just because a previous relationship did not work out that does not mean all future relationships will fail. Heartache is a part of life, but there is hope. Open your mind and heart to new love. Think about what you can do to change yourself for the better.


No one is perfect. Accept that you have faults, and so do other people. But that does not mean that you can't work towards a happier and healthier relationship for the future.
Be positive that love can grow with time and effort.

Avoid being combative.,
Limit emotional communication.,
Set aside anger.,
Make requests, not demands.",How to Have an Emotionally Healthy Divorce1," Because of what you might hear/see on TV and from others who have gotten divorced, you may think that getting divorced has to be a big fight. The truth is, however, that it doesn’t. Keeping this in mind can help you from being defensive.Try to get on the same page with your ex. If you can be on the same page then it will make the whole process easier.
Understand that this doesn’t mean that you can avoid experiencing negative emotions. Divorce is almost always painful, so you’ll have to deal with those feelings of loss. Most people experience anger, grief, fear, and anxiety when going through a divorce.If you are able to find a way to be civil and productive together, you may even be able to finalize your divorce without wasting time and money on a lawyer.;
, There are likely many things that have happened in your relationship that you haven’t been able to work out with each other. There is little point in going through it over and over again. Agree to let the past stay in the past, and consider this a new beginning for whatever relationship you might have with your ex.If you have no reason to communicate with your ex after the divorce then this should be easy. Keep your communications with your ex strictly business. Don’t talk about how you’re feeling or ask how your ex is feeling. Take care of the details of the divorce and move on.
If you want to have some type of friendly relationship with your ex (for whatever reason), then agree with one another that all past hurts and disagreements are to stay in the past.
It may be easier said than done, but do your best to keep your communication in the present tense, and try to keep your talks as positive as possible.

, You will no doubt be feeling a lot of different emotions when you are going through a divorce. Many of these emotions may be very negative. Do your best to stay positive when communicating with your ex.This is especially important if you have children together. Move the focus off of your failed relationship, and focus on how you can work together to raise your children.
Anger, shock, and blaming the other spouse for the failure of the marriage are all common reactions to divorce. You shouldn't ignore them or suppress them, but try to put them aside when you are communicating with your ex, then work through them with the assistance of a therapist or using healthy coping tools, like journaling.

, When you are negotiating the divorce with your ex, try to remain civil. If you want something, don’t demand it. Even if you mean it as a request, stating something that you want without wording it carefully can lead to misunderstandings and anger.For example, if you want to sell the home you bought together then don’t say, “We are selling the house.” This sounds like a demand even if you didn’t mean it that way. Instead, try saying it like this, “What do you think about selling the house and splitting the money from the sale 50/50?” This gives your ex a chance to express their feelings about it rather than feeling that they need to defend themselves.

Make time for yourself.,
Allow time to heal.,
Consider therapy.,
Lean on friends and family.,
Give yourself a break.,
Get involved in something positive.",How to Have an Emotionally Healthy Divorce2," Especially if you have children, you may neglect yourself during your divorce. You may be too worried about helping your children or other family members understand the divorce to think about yourself; however, it is important that you make time to care for yourself.Find time to do something that you find enjoyable, whatever that may be. If you really like going to the movies, then do that. If you like to paint, then paint. If you want to get a massage, then do that. It’s important to find a bit of happiness during this time.
If you don’t have much time or money, don’t worry. Making time for yourself can be as simple as making yourself a good cup of coffee or taking a relaxing bath.

, It’s important to understand that a divorce is a loss, and the feelings may be similar to those you might feel when someone close to you dies. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of this relationship instead of thinking you have to stuff the emotions down.Remember that going through the grieving process, no matter how difficult, is important for healing and moving on.
You may experience a range of emotions that range from denial and anger to sadness and acceptance. Don’t beat yourself down for feeling any of these emotions as they are simply a part of the process of grieving.Allow yourself to feel these feelings and process them however you need to. For example, you might simply want to lay in bed and cry, or you might want to write down everything you’re feeling in a journal, or you might talk about how you’re feeling with someone you trust., Talking about your divorce and your feelings about it with a trained professional can be an excellent way to get through the divorce. It may feel weird at first to talk with a stranger about such an intimate topic, but therapists are trained to help you deal with difficult emotions.One big advantage of talking to a therapist is that you are talking with someone who is trained to be objective about the situation, and who is also outside the situation. Talking with friends and family members is good too, but these people will have a more difficult time being objective because they may know your ex, and have their own opinions about the divorce.
A therapist may also be able to help you find ways to communicate with your ex effectively.

, In addition to seeing a professional, talking with family and friends that you trust can be very helpful. People who have strong support systems are typically better able to deal with difficult situations.You can also look for a local or online support group where you can listen to the stories of others, and ask for advice from fellow divorcees.
Some people feel like they have to give you their opinions and advice in order to show that they are interested in what you are saying. If all you want to do is get it out, then say that. Most people will be happy to simply listen and say, “I understand.”
If you don’t feel comfortable talking with anyone about your emotions, then at least try to spend some time writing about how you feel. It is important that you get the emotions out somehow.

, If you have the time and money, treat yourself to a spa day or a vacation. If you don’t, then just let yourself off of the hook for a day or two. This doesn’t mean you should neglect your children or not show up to work without telling anyone, but you can give yourself a little break from all of the responsibilities you normally worry about.For example, if you have a few extra vacation days, then consider taking them to just relax and do something you enjoy.
If you are normally very strict with yourself about eating healthy and going to gym, then allow yourself to forget about it for a day or two. Eat what you want and be lazy. In general, these things will help you move on, but giving yourself a little break can feel like a treat.

, After you let yourself go just a little bit, try to re-commit yourself to something good. This can be whatever you want it to be, but try to choose something that will be beneficial for your well-being. Finding the positive aspects of your divorce will help you find happiness again.For example, if you love animals, you could start volunteering your spare time at a local shelter. If you enjoy art, you could take a class in painting or sculpting. If exercise helps you work off stress, then consider joining a gym.

Reassure your children.,
Avoid saying negative things about your ex.,
Let them express their emotions.,
Ask your children questions.,
Be happy when they go see the other parent.",How to Have an Emotionally Healthy Divorce3," When you tell your children that you are getting divorced, they may experience a range of emotions; however, the biggest emotion is likely to be a feeling of insecurity and uncertainty. Explain to them that the divorce is not their fault and that both of you still love them a lot.For example, you can say, “Together, we have decided that the best thing for everyone is if we don’t live together anymore. This will be tough for everyone at first, but we’ll get through it as best we can. The most important thing you should understand is that we both love you very much, and our decision is nobody’s fault.”
If you and your ex will be sharing custody, make sure that your children understand that they aren’t being asked to choose between you and your ex.
If one of you will have sole custody of the children, one of you will need to explain why this is. For example, if you will have sole custody of your children you can say, “Right now, Dad (or Mom) has some things (s)he needs to work on so you won’t be able to see him (or her) too often. Try not to worry. He (she) loves you very much, and is doing his (her) best.”

, When you are dealing with a lot of emotions, you may unintentionally say bad things about your ex. Focus all of your efforts on not doing this in front of your children. It is important to recognize that your children may be struggling to understand what divorce means for them. If you say negative things about their other parent, they will feel as though they have to choose.Even if your ex has really hurt you, try to remember that your child loves them. Your ex may have hurt you, but that doesn’t mean your child should be hurt, too. If you feel the need to say something to your children about how you’re feeling, you could say something like, “Mommy and daddy both tried very hard, but in the end, we just couldn’t make it work. I feel very sad about how things worked out, but you don’t need to think that you can’t love both of us.”
You should also avoid using your children to communicate with your ex. For example, saying ""Tell your mother that she needs to come get this last box of her stuff"" is not appropriate. Your children are not couriers and are not there to pass information along to your ex. If you need to talk to them, text, call, email — reach out to them directly.

, Your child may experience a whole range of emotions, just like you are probably experiencing. Try to listen to what they are expressing before reacting.For example, if your child gets angry and yells at you, don’t react before giving yourself a chance to see where this emotion is coming from. Don’t just scold them and send them to their room. Instead, say something like, “It seems like you’re pretty angry. What is making you feel so angry?”

, Your child may want to talk about the divorce, but may not know what to say or where to begin. To help them, try asking open-ended questions about how they are feeling or what they think about the divorce.You can also ask them about any concerns they might have. For example, they might be concerned about how often they will get to spend time with the other parent, or if they will have to change schools.
It’s important to keep questions open-ended. For example, if you want to ask them their feelings about the divorce, don’t say, “Are you feeling sad about the divorce?” Instead, say, “What feelings do you have about our divorce?” If they give you a one-word answer (e.g. “sad,” “mad,” “scared”) try respond with another question. For example, if they say they are sad, then say, “What about the divorce makes you feel sad?”
Don’t push it. Though you should try to regularly ask questions to help them process their thoughts, if they seem reluctant to talk, then don’t keep pushing them. If they don’t want to talk, then come back and ask again another day.

, If you are sharing custody with your ex, then don’t let your child see you upset when they leave, even if you are. If your child sees that you are upset, they may feel guilty and unable to enjoy time with the other parent.Be sure to smile when they leave. If you want to say something, then you can say, “Have a great time with Dad (or Mom)! I know they can’t wait to see you!”

Resolve logistical issues.,
Process your emotions.,
Set goals.,
Make specific plans.",How to Have an Emotionally Healthy Divorce4," There are a lot of practical matters that you’re going to have to deal with during the divorce, especially if you have kids together. Work on getting these matters resolved as quickly and smoothly as possible so that you can focus on the process of moving on with your life.For example, if you have kids together, you’re going to have to figure out how you’re going to share custody (or if you are at all). Until this is managed, it’s going to be difficult to move forward.
If you have a home that you’ve purchased together, you’re going to have to figure how to split the things inside the home (e.g. furniture, electronics, etc.), and what to do with the house. Will one of you continue living in the home, or should you sell it?

, As you move forward, you will probably have good days and bad days when it comes to dealing with your emotions. You may feel fine and think you’re finally healing, and then wake up one morning feeling hopeless. This is all part of the grieving process, and you should expect to have some setbacks along the way.Keep in mind you and your ex will likely be processing your emotions at different times. It often happens that the spouse who initiates the divorce began the process long before the legal act of divorcing — possibly even years before. The spouse who did not initiate the divorce, however, will likely just start processing the emotions (shock, anger, disillusionment, fear, etc.) when asked for a divorce. Try to understand that you and your ex may not be on the same page emotionally while going through the process and have empathy for whatever your ex is experiencing.
Remember that processing emotions is an active process, not a passive one. While you can just sit and stew in your emotions, you’ll probably do better if you find ways to actively deal with your emotions. For example, through talking with a professional or with a trusted family member or through journaling. You can also try other methods such as expressing feelings through a creative activity (such as painting or music).
Many people find exercise to be a great way to deal with negative emotions. A tough workout that gets you sweating and out of breath will help you work off some steam. Try taking a boxing class where you can let out anger in a healthy way.

, Now that you are divorced, your life is different. You may have more free time, and you now have one less person to answer to. Take this new life you have and set goals for it. Although divorce is difficult, try to look at the positive. You now have an opportunity to reinvent your life.These goals can be very small goals or big life goals. Setting lots of goals that are both small and big will help you develop a sense of achievement.
You could set a goal for yourself to join a new social group where you can meet new people who didn’t know you when you were married.
Set new goals related to travel. Travelling solo can be scary, but many say that it is very rewarding.
If you want to, you can also set a goal related to when you’d like to start dating again (if you think you’d like to again).

, There are new challenges you may also have to face now that you are divorced. Make plans about how you will deal with these new challenges so that you don’t panic when, and if, they arrive.For example, you may have to deal with feelings of loneliness. Make a plan about how you will deal with this. You could make a plan to get involved in local social groups, or decide who you can call to talk to when you feel lonely.
Another example involves finances. If you and your ex shared your income, you may need to make plans about how you will cover your costs. If you didn’t work before, think about how you will find a job.

Communicate openly.,
Find a new routine.",How to Have a Rebound Relationship1," Starting a new relationship is a big step. It can be especially daunting if you are recently single. Take some time to think about your needs and wants before you jump in.Make a list of your relationship priorities. Are you looking for someone who shares your interests? For example, do you want someone to go hiking with? Write it down.
You can also write down your relationship expectations. Ask yourself whether you want to keep things casual or if you want someone who is interested in a long-term commitment.
Reflect on your emotional status. Are you feeling fragile? Do you still feel unsure of yourself? You might want to take some more time to be on your own before you start a new relationship.;
, The first step towards having a successful rebound relationship is to reenter the world of dating. If someone you are interested in asks you on a date, go for it. Don't feel like you have to go on a date with someone you are not interested in.Initiate a date. Do you always flirt with the same person after yoga class? Find out if they are interested in you.
Try saying, ""I was wondering if you would like to have dinner on Saturday evening."" Be specific and clear.
Go on a date. Find an activity that you are comfortable with for your first date.
If you're nervous, try doing something active. A fun activity like bowling can be a great ice breaker.

, While you are dating, start actively trying to find the right person for your rebound relationship. Ideally, you will find someone who is looking for the same level of commitment that you are. When you are on your dates, think about whether this person is right for you.There are several questions that you can ask yourself. First consider whether you find the person attractive.
Physical attraction is an important part of any relationship. Ask yourself whether you can imagine being intimate with the person.
Look for someone you can trust. Does the person seem honest? Does he or she openly discuss their work and family life? That's a good sign.

, New relationships are fun and exciting. Once you have started dating again, you might find yourself swept up in the thrill of the newness. Just don't forget that communication is an important part of any relationship.Be honest about your background. Don't try to hide the fact that you were recently in another relationship.
Have an open conversation about where you want the relationship to go. Try saying something like, ""I really like you. I'm not sure exactly where this is headed, but I do know I'd like for us to be exclusive.""
Listen carefully. Take time to acknowledge your partner's feelings and respect any differences of opinion.

, One of the comforting things about long relationships is that you have mutual habits and routines. One of the benefits of a new relationship is that you don't yet have rituals as a couple. That means you can enjoy being spontaneous and keeping things fresh.Make it a goal to explore new places. Pledge to try a new type of cuisine together once a week.
Mix it up a little. Try having a date night on a Monday instead of the traditional weekend outing.
Be willing to go with the flow. Your new partner likely has a pretty established routine. Don't be afraid to do things on a different schedule than you are used to.

Fall in love again.",How to Fall Out of Love," Falling out of love is a process of grieving a lost relationship. It is normal to feel that loss deeply. If you try to act normal and pretend that you're not hurt, you will have a greater emotional struggle. The healthy way to begin to fall out of love is to be sad for a little while. Give yourself time to process your feelings of loss.If you can, take a few days off of work, and do whatever brings you comfort (as long as it is not harmful). Watch sad movies, sleep, or eat some ice cream. If it becomes unbearable, remember that pain does eventually get better.;
, To let go of the relationship properly, you need to acknowledge that there were good things and bad things about being in love with that person (because there always are). Appreciate the good things but remember the bad things too; you'll need to think about the new opportunities that will be open to you now.


In the heat of grief, it's likely that you are romanticizing the person and forgetting about his or her flaws and weaknesses. It's important to remember both.
Try to be grateful for the ways that your love changed you and helped you to grow as a person, but also recognize if there are areas where it hindered your growth or made you into someone you don't want to be. These are lessons you can take with you as you grow and learn., Don't rush into another relationship or distract yourself constantly with friends and activities. You need to process and deal with the pain you're in if you want to be able to fall out of love in a healthy way. Balance your time between thinking about what you want and what you need and then pursuing those things, and seeking emotional and social support from friends and family.


Of course, if you feel that you need someone to talk to, it's okay to spend time with close friends. Find someone understanding who will let you vent about the relationship, but who will also tell you the truth about what they see from their perspective on the outside. If you're open to advice, the good advice of a trusted friend can help you to reassess your loss and think about your future. Don't spend too much time dwelling on the breakup, what went wrong, or what your ex is up to. Instead, focus on yourself and how you can move forward., A big part of the healing process can be expressing your feelings. You don't need to share these feelings with anyone unless you want to, but at least getting them out will help you.You can keep a journal, write poetry or short stories, draw a picture or a painting, write or learn to play a song, or take up spoken word poetry. These creative efforts will let you express your pain while also making something beautiful out of your experience.If you feel uninspired or are not the artistic type, visit a museum, theater, or concert. Sometimes seeing or hearing other artists' interpretations of heartbreak helps you to understand it as a universal experience that binds you to the rest of humanity and, as painful as it may be, makes life worth living.After all, if you never experienced loss, then you never truly loved.

, When you are trying to move on and get back to life, an important thing to do is to not over-react and get rid of everything that reminds you of that person. Keep a few reminders of the best part of your experiences with that person, such as that shell you found on the beach or a photograph of you together at that New Year's party, in order to keep a positive and healthy perception of that relationship.


While keeping these things is a good idea, you may not be ready to see them right now. Put the items you keep together in a single location and then put them somewhere out of the way. You can take them out again when you've emotionally recovered.
This includes digital items, which can be similarly saved and stored out of the way on your computer.

, Once you've picked out the things to keep, you'll want to get rid of everything else. In order to truly get over someone, you need to be able to avoid seeing constant reminders of that person in your day-to-day life.


If you have a bunch of the other person's stuff, give it back. Untag yourself from pictures with him/her on Facebook, delete the pictures off of your own Facebook that remind you of him/her, and generally do away with extra digital items as well (saved voicemails, for example). Keeping items like this has been found in studies to prolong the grieving process and make it more difficult to recover., In order to get over someone, it's important to sever ties, at least until you are in a safe emotional place and can be friends again (if you decide that's what you want). In addition to being an emotional state, love causes chemical changes in your brain similar to a drug addiction, and every time you see your ex or are reminded of him/her, it satisfies the craving just enough to reinforce the addiction.Don't go out for coffee, don't call, don't text, don't ask your friends about what the other person is doing. Stop thinking about the other person and start thinking about you. Experts recommend at least a 30-90-day break from all contact with the other person.Unfollow/friend the person on social media. Keeping an eye on him/her, intentional or not, is not healthy and will make it more difficult for you to fall out of love with the person. Break your social media ties with him/her (at least for now) so that you can think about more healthy things, like taking care of yourself.

, Hanging out with mutual friends so soon after trying to cut ties will make it harder for you emotionally.


Explain to them that you need a bit of a break and to spend some time away from them until you feel a little more stable. Good friends will understand.
This may include mutual friends on Facebook, especially if you have friends who tend to post a lot of photos of your ex. Seeing or hearing little reminders of your relationship is likely to prolong the grieving process. If you can't cut off ties with mutual Facebook relationships, just temporarily block them from your newsfeed or take a social media break until you've had time to heal., If you had a really good relationship and things ended on good terms, or even if you were just always good friends, it's probably a good idea to still give it some time before you two act like friends again. Spending time together immediately will make it very difficult to force yourself out of love with the person.


For many people falling out of a very intense love, it may take several years before you are able to be close friends again. You may find that you have to wait until both of you are in love with someone else and in committed relationships before you are comfortable being friends again.
For others, it's impossible to ever be friends again, especially if the break-up was not mutual.

, Without this relationship to cloud your judgment, you'll be able to get a much better picture of who you are as a person. Explore your strengths and weaknesses. You might want to rethink your priorities or goals in life. Maybe you thought you wanted one thing when you thought you'd be with that person for the rest of your life, but maybe now you'll want something else.


Friendships are a good thing to explore in this instance. You may find that while you were in love you let certain friendships lag that you really don't want to lose. This is a great time to try to repair them.
Think about who you were before you met your ex, and reclaim your single self. Maybe he or she was not into theater, and you are; maybe he or she liked your hair long, but you preferred it short. You may have put hobbies, friends, or parts of your personality on the back burner while you were with your ex, and now that you are single again, you should feel free to choose which aspects of your former self you want to hold onto., Being in love tends to make you very dependent on that person, but if you want to be happy and have better luck in future relationships, you'll need to improve your ability to be on your own. In being more self-reliant, you'll have more confidence and remind yourself that you're strong and capable all on your own. Do things for yourself now. Think of yourself as free. Do things that you have always wanted to do but never got the time.


Try taking yourself out for dinner or a movie. This is even better if you eat food or see a movie you want, but you know your former love would have hated.

, These new things to do will not only make you happy because you're getting out and enjoying new things, they'll also help you forget your former love and learn to be happy on your own. You can pick up a new hobby, volunteer, or teach yourself a new skill. Or learn something new from the internet. You never know what you might love to do next.


Travel as much as you can. Traveling is a sure way to build new memories and experiences, both positive and negative. In having these new experiences to focus on, you'll begin to forget (or at least become less focused on) your past experiences and troubles.
Remember, travel doesn't have to mean hopping on the next plane to Paris; you can travel locally too! The important part is to get out and go places and do things you've never done before.

, An important part of moving on is to accept that it wasn't meant to be. You have to understand that if that person couldn't love you or if that relationship was making anyone unhappy, then things would not have gotten better and in the end you would not have been happy. You deserve to be in a relationship where that person loves you as much as you love him or her and that you fulfill each other like no one else can.


Be thankful for the good things that came out of the relationship, like a chance to know your own heart better and to learn what you need in a partner. Then, when you are grateful that you had the chance to love this person, you will be able to truly heal from your grief, because you will know that the grief served a purpose., Unless you are content with being single, you must put yourself out there if you want to find a better match for yourself. This can take time and you shouldn't rush it. Don't force anything; just go out when you feel like going out and don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable.


You can meet new people by going to bars and clubs, joining a church or civic group that share your interests, or volunteering. Also, keep your eyes open at work, school, or in the community for people you may have overlooked in the past. Be friendly and open to new people.

, Falling in love, or at least realizing that there are other people to fall in love with, is an important part of learning to leave that other love behind. You don't have to date seriously; in fact, it's better if you date casually for a little while. Many people will need a rebound period and it is better if you don't break someone else's heart by being unable to commit.


You will know you are ready to date again when you can say that you truly love and respect yourself. The truth is, we attract people to us who will treat us like we treat ourselves. If you are full of self-pity and self-doubt, it will be impossible to attract the kind of person who will love you for who you are., While not having love work out can be very painful, this doesn't mean that you have to fall out of love. If it was true love, you may very well never be able to fall out of love. However, you can move past that love, live your life fully without being dependent on it, and find new love to enjoy.


Don't let your heart fill with hate or negative feelings. Under no circumstances should you attempt to move on by trying to make yourself dislike the person you loved. If s/he hurt you or harmed you, you are perfectly allowed to be angry. However, it is healthy to forgive the other person, not for him/her, but for you. Letting all that hate into your heart is toxic and may ruin both your enjoyment of your life and your ability to have healthy future relationships.Don't go looking for faults in the other person. Certainly don't make lists of everything that was wrong with him or her. Don't make yourself hate the other person. Don't force yourself to think that you're better off. These things will only create negative emotions within you, not open you up for positive experiences.

, Falling in love again will be the final piece in letting your heart heal. New love will renew your faith and show you just how wonderful love is. More importantly, you should find love with someone who can return your feelings in a way your former love couldn't. This is what you deserve!


When you've finally met someone who knows you and loves you for who you are, don't feel bad about falling in love with someone else. You are not betraying or belittling your past feelings by finding new love; even books of fairy tales have more than one story in them, and our hearts are books with many pages.
That said, if you don't fall in love again for a long time, this doesn't mean that something is wrong with you. Some hearts take longer to heal. Just focus on making yourself happy.

Keep your distance.,
Organize your space.,
Remove painful memory triggers.,
Get out and do things.,
Beware of rebound relationships.,
Continue to take care of yourself.",How to Get Over a Break Up1," Even if you and your ex have decided to stay friends, break away completely from each other right after the breakup. This means not seeing each other, not being around his/her family members, no phone calls, no e-mails, no text messages, no Facebook, and no IMs.You don’t have to have stop talking forever, but you do need to cut all communication for as long as it takes to get completely over your ex.


If he/she tries to convince you to see him/her, ask yourself honestly what the point would be. If you're reliving the past by seeing him/her, it's not hard to get caught up in the moment and it will be harder to let go again.
You may have to have some contact in order to deal with the practical aspects of things like moving out, signing papers, etc., but try to limit this to what's absolutely necessary, and then keep such calls/meetings short and civil.;
, A breakup can signify a new beginning. Therefore, cleaning and organizing your personal space will leave you feeling refreshed and prepared for the new things to come. A mess can be overwhelming and depressing, and will just add to your stress level.Keeping busy with tidying your space doesn't require a lot of brain power, but it does require just enough focus to keep you from recycling pain.


Clean your room, get some new posters, clean up the icons on your PC desktop. As insignificant as cleaning up sounds, it'll make you feel better.

, There are all kinds of things that remind you of your ex––a song, a smell, a sound, a place. Having these items around can make it harder for you to recover from a breakup. Remove all of the things that make your heart ache or your stomach turn. It can work wonders to clear your space of all these triggers.If you have a keepsake, such as a watch or piece of jewelry that was given to you by your ex, there's nothing wrong with keeping it. But for the time being, try putting it away until you have gotten over the relationship.

, After a relationship ends, it is okay to have some time to yourself at home. Just make sure that you get back out in the world aft you have processed your feelings. Make plans, go out with your friends, and have fun! It might seem awkward at first, but it will get easier and it will help you to feel better. Getting out and doing things is also important because you need to grow and maintain your social network after a breakup. Doing so will help you to move on with your life.Don't feel like you need to go out with other people all of the time. Take yourself out to do things and enjoy the freedom to do what you want. Go to your favorite coffee shop, go shopping, or take yourself on a mini-vacation.

, Often people will quickly enter a new relationship following a breakup; this type of relationship is called a rebound relationship. Rebounding may be common, but it is not always a good idea. When you enter into a relationship too soon after breaking up with someone, you may be masking your negative emotions with the excitement of a new relationship. If that new relationship does not work out, you may have to deal with the pain of two breakups at once. Consider remaining single until you have fully processed your emotions and gotten over the breakup., It is common for people to put less effort into self-care after a breakup, but doing so will not help you to feel better. Make sure that you are seeing to your basic needs for mental, physical, and spiritual well-being. If you were not taking good care of yourself before the relationship ended, now is a good time to start. Make sure that you are eating well, sleeping enough, making time for relaxation, and getting regular exercise to feel your best.Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Avoid junk food, excess sugar, and excess fat.Get between 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Keep in mind that some people may be okay with less than 7 hours per night or require more than 8 hours of sleep per night.Exercise for 30 minutes five times a week. Go for a 30-minute walk, ride your bike around town, or hit the pool and go swimming.Relax for at least 15 minutes per day. Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga to help you relax."

Maybe one person is contributing more than the other, or maybe you just aren't connecting. You should look for signs and symptoms of the problems you're facing. Here's what you should look for:You feel like your partner wants you to be a different person than you are, such as your partner is not wanting you to do certain things you normally like doing, is wanting you to change your personality, or is trying to be controlling of your person and actions. The reverse is also true; that is, if you feel like you keep wanting to change your partner, that could be a sign of a problem.You are having the same arguments over and over or your arguments never reach a resolution.You find you aren't together as much as you used to be or would like to be.One person has more control of the resources in the relationship or one of you just doesn't feel like the relationship is equal in some way.;
, Bring up the fact that you think there is a problem with your relationship.Be as specific as you possibly can when talking about what you think the problem is, but also make sure you are not angry when you decide to bring it up. In a calm tone, discuss what you think is going wrong with the relationship.


For instance, you could say, ""Honey, I'd like to spend some time talking to you about our relationship. I think we've had trouble connecting lately, and I'd like to discuss how we can fix it.""
Studies have suggested that talking about what's wrong and what's right on a regular basis can help lead to a better relationship in the long term because you aren't bottling up small problems into a much bigger problem., That is, it's easy to blame each other for problems. You might find yourself saying ""I hate it when you leave dirty dishes in the sink,"" which essentially blames the other person. Instead, look at the patterns. For instance, you could say, ""When I forget to unload the dishwasher, you tend to leave dirty dishes in the sink. Then I get behind on the dishes because they pile up. How can we work to change this situation?"", If little things are bothering you and you shove them down, they are just going to turn into an explosion at a bad time. If you deal with them as they happen, it won't be as big of a deal., If you find yourself starting a discussion while angry or getting angry while in the middle of a discussion, you may need to spend some time calming down. You know what calms you down. Maybe you need to take a short walk, listen to some music, or take a relaxing shower. You can also try counting to ten or taking a few deep breathes. Whatever you need to do, take a few minutes to calm down before continuing the discussion.Look for warning signs. If you find yourself feeling like you absolutely must win an argument, it's time to take a break. At that point, you're likely to say something you regret or keep the argument going long past the point that it's wise to do so., When you're angry, you're just thinking about how you've been wronged. However, as soon as you start forcing yourself to think about what the other person is going through, you start to pull yourself out of that mindset. Being empathetic can help drain your anger.It's important to respect what your partner is feeling, as he or she has a right to feel and express his or her emotions, whatever they are. Whether or not you think your partner is right about the problem, you should still validate what the person is feeling., Listening to what the other person has to say can help you develop empathy for what he or she is feeling. Don't just let the words pass over you. Actually think about what the person is saying, and maybe try to understand what is behind the words, as well.One way to show you are listening is to try to summarize what the other person is saying. For example, you can say, ""What I hear you saying is you get frustrated when you do more than your share of the housework.""
Another way to show you're listening is to ask relevant follow-up questions to make sure you understand what the other person is saying.

, You also have a right to discuss what you're feeling and thinking. The key is to keep a calm head. It's also important to be clear about what you're thinking and feeling. You can't expect your partner to read your mind when it comes to your thoughts and emotions.Keep to talking about what you think about the problem, rather than placing blame. In other words, start with ""I"" instead of ""You."" For instance, you could say ""I get anxious when the house isn't clean. Can we work on making a schedule for house cleaning so we can stay on top of it?"" instead of ""You never clean house with me!"", The key to any relationship is learning to compromise. You can't just expect to win every argument, as relationships involve give and take. Compromising is about finding common ground and both of you giving a little on the issue.Discuss your needs and wants.If you can decide on what both you need, you can give a little in the ""wants"" section. Basically, you need to decide what areas are least and most important to you and learn to give in the areas that aren't as important.
If you hate cleaning the bathroom but your spouse wants you to help out around the house more, maybe you can divide chores into ones you find more tolerable and ones he or she finds more tolerable.

, When you're arguing, it's tempting to name-call or make unfair remarks that drag up the past. You know how to push your partner's buttons because you know him or her so well. However, all that will serve to do is make everyone angrier, and may even damage the relationship irrevocably. Keep to the task at hand., Apathy can be a problem in your relationship. Over time, you become accustomed to being in a relationship, and you stop putting as much effort into it as you once did. Once you understand how it can be a problem, you can work to change it., Being mean towards each other can easily damage your relationship further. If you work hard to be kind and gentle with one another, it can help you reestablish the connection you once had., When you're in a new relationship, you spend time talking to each other and learning what the other person likes. You discuss your fears and your interests, what you love and what you hate. If you've been in a relationship awhile, you may stop doing this together. If that's the case, you need to consciously work at rebuilding that connection by making time each day to talk. Make time for just the two of you, and when you do spend time together, try to dig deeper than just the day-to-day dramas that fill your life., Another way to reconnect is to actually make plans to go on dates. Making a plan means you have something to look forward to, plus you're setting aside special time to spend just with the other person., Touch is such an important part of a relationship, and it doesn't mean just having sex. Kissing, holding hands, touching your partner's arm, and cuddling on the couch of all ways of being intimate. Touch provides a connection with your partner., Once you've figured out what some of your problems are together, talk about solutions together. How can you solve the problem in a way that both of you can live with? In other words, you need to look for common ground.Start with the place you both agree on. Maybe you can both agree on the problem at least, or maybe you can agree on the first step to the solution. For instance, maybe you agree that you are feeling disconnected. Maybe you can take it one step further and agree that you need to spend more time together., Once you've agreed to solutions, it's time to put them into concrete terms. For instance, if you both agree you need to spend more time, then maybe the agreement will be that you should make a date at least once a week., Everyone responds to situations differently, meaning that everyone has different emotional needs. For instance, maybe your partner needs more together time after things have been tough, so try to be there for him or her., When you feel the need to snap at your partner, examine what you're feeling. Instead of snapping, communicate how it is making you feel and why. In other words, you need to continually work on how you communicate with your partner, as your partner cannot be expected to guess what you're thinking or feeling.For instance, if your partner mentions going out to dinner at a place she likes, you may want to snap at her for spending money if your budget is tight. Instead, say something such as, ""Spending money right now makes me anxious because we've had a hard time making it to payday. Can we compromise and take a picnic out somewhere?""

, While it can be tempting to focus solely on your relationship, you also need to spend time developing your own interests. You bring more to a relationship when you are your own independent person, so spending time away from each other is important., Even if your partner doesn't want to join you, counseling can still help your relationship. It will help because you're starting to change yourself and the way you interact with other people, including your partner. If your partner is willing to join you, even better."

Let time take care of the rest.",How to End a Relationship Without Losing Mutual Friends," There are two sides to every story. Save your side for telling to your family and those friends you knew prior to starting the relationship.;
, Just because you're not talking about the breakup doesn't mean you can gossip about your ex behind his/her back, your talk being unrelated to the end of the relationship. When you trash your ex to people who are his or her friends as much as yours, you're putting those friends between a rock and a hard place. They want to be loyal to both of you.

, Since these are mutual friends, remember that anything you say to them may get repeated to your ex. This can really botch up any headway you've made in terms of establishing a less contentious relationship with the ex.

, It's hard sometimes, because those friends are so powerfully connected to the old relationship in your mind and heart. If you want to keep these friends, realize they may not know how to approach you, so give them a call or send an email to them to let them know you want to continue your friendship. As mentioned, be careful that you don't reveal things you wouldn't want your ex to be privy to, but do tell them enough about how you're doing that they feel like they're still a part of your life.

You can say things like, ""I'm doing pretty well, all things considered. Yes, it's tough starting over, but hopefully the worst is behind me now, and I'm ready to move on.""







, There may be resentment or a pre-disposition not to like the new love, simply because s/he isn't your old love. This is because your friends might feel like they're betraying their friend (your ex) by liking the person who took his or her place. For awhile, keep your new love interest to yourself. Wait until the dust settles and you all feel like you're on more solid ground before bringing someone new to gatherings.

, Some of your friends will not want to deal with the ""who do I invite?"" feeling that forces them to choose between the two of you. They will simply invite you both and let you settle how you handle it, thinking that as you're both adults, you will be okay. In a large group, this may be all right. At a small dinner party? Awk-warrrrrd. Avoid the situation when invited to a small gathering by asking straight out, ""Is ________(your ex) coming?"" There is a strong likelihood it will be answered truthfully. Don't pitch a fit that makes your host feel guilty, simply give your regrets right then, ""Oh, okay. I probably won't come, then, because that's a pretty small gathering. No worries, we'll just make it a time when there will be more people and distractions."" Smile and be gracious, and thank your host for thinking of you.

, In a misguided attempt to assure you that they are on ""your side,"" your friends may even take a shot or two at your ex. Don't join in or take pleasure at jokes made at his or her expense. Remember - they're probably making the same kinds of jokes about you to him/her.


Instead, just take it in stride and say something to the effect of, ""You know, I did get angry during the breakup, but now I just feel sorry and sad. We had a lot of good times together, and even though it's time to move on, I don't regret the time we spent together. I would never have met you guys if not for __________(your ex's name here)."" And then don't say any more. They'll all nod and admire your class.

, Remember the saying ""time heals all wounds"". A breakup is like a broken arm. It hurts like hell, and there's nothing you can do about it once it's been set and cast, except give it time. You just have to endure the pain and deal with the changes it causes in your life. As time passes and you still refuse to badmouth your ex or take part in shooting matches with him or her as the target, your friends will realize you've moved on.

If you say it, be prepared to back it up with the action, or else take the threat off the table before you make it. Discuss problems openly and directly with your partner before you make up your mind. Many men and women suffer for years and never bring problems up with their partners, which is what leads to many breakups.If you really want to end the relationship, then you should make a list of all the reasons you're unhappy in the relationship -- and all the reasons those things can't be fixed.;
, Don't decide to break up with your partner in the heat of the moment, when you're feeling unstable, or after you've had a bad week and are blaming your relationship for all of your problems. Before you make this important decision, take the time to get input from trusted friends and parents, people who may have helpful insight into your relationship issues.


Once you've decided to break up with your boyfriend or girlfriend, don't go around telling your close friends, or anyone at all, or it may get back to that person. It's okay to come to a close friend or family member for advice, but once you've made your decision, the mature thing to do is to tell your boyfriend or girlfriend next.

, Choose a time and place that will allow for both you and the person that you're about to dump some privacy.Don't break up with someone right before they have a big test or are about to go to work. Fridays are a suitable choice if it gives your soon-to-be-ex the weekend to recover somewhat.


Don't break up with your girlfriend or boyfriend in your favorite restaurant, bar, or your favorite spot in a park. Pick a neutral location that has no special meaning for either of you.
Pick a time when you know you'll be in a relatively calm emotional state. Don't break up with your partner after you know you'll be staying late for a stressful meeting at work.

, To give your significant other the respect that he or she deserves, you should end the relationship in person, no matter how much you're dreading it.


The only time it's acceptable to end the relationship over the phone is if you're in a long-distance relationship and know you won't see each other for a while, or if you're in a controlling or manipulative relationship. If your ex is prone to outbursts, violence, or manipulative behaviors, it is much safer for you to end the relationship at a distance.

, Be firm in what you say––being wishy-washy in the vain hope that you'll let the other person down ""easy"" will only cause more hurt in the end. A break-up does not need to be a dramatic, escalating event. Get to the point and say that you don't want to be in the relationship anymore, that it isn't working for you. Doing otherwise leads the door open for argument.Avoid any comment that gives the impression that this is a trial separation and that you might resume things after a break.
You may think that it'll ease the pain to tell your partner ""I'm not ready for this right now"" or ""Maybe this can work down the road..."" but if you don't really mean it, then that will only be adding to your partner's pain.

, You don't want your partner to walk away feeling unsure about why the relationship was over, but you don't want him or her walking away knowing the top 20 things you don't like about him or her, either. Just be honest about why the relationship needs to end, whether it's because you're feeling suffocated, manipulated, or disrespected. Don't waste time beating around the bush.The hardest reason for a breakup is if you're just not in love anymore, because it's not that person's fault. In that case, you should still be honest, but say it as gently as you can.
Once you've given your main reason, you don't have to go into all the details and rehash old arguments, unless the person is genuinely confused. There's no reason to bring up past problems and add insult to injury.
Don't put the person down and make him feel insecure and worthless. Don't say, ""I just want to be with a real man"" -- instead, say, ""I think you still have to work on developing your confidence.""
Whatever the reason is, it shouldn't be a complete surprise to the person. If you kept up open lines of communication, then it won't be coming out of no where.
Avoid making a long list of reasons as to why you're dumping him or her. Boil down your well-thought through reason to the essential problem: ""We are not compatible enough in key areas,"" ""I don't feel supported by you in my career path, and I don't want to change my path,"" ""I want children and you don't,"" or other similar and specific details.

, The person who is getting dumped will typically react with anger or with wonder, shock, or panic. If he responds with anger, try to remain calm and attempt to calm him down. Keep your voice at ease, even if he begins to yell. If it gets too out of control, just leave and let him cool down––but be sure you assure him that you will be willing to come back later, when he is calmer. Don't just say, ""Oh forget it, I'm outta here.""


Comfort him if he needs it, but don't take this too far. Voice your opinions if things are getting too uncomfortable or inappropriate. You don't want to be drawn down the same path that led you to this moment. Be compassionate, but be firm and cut the contact short if it seems to be escalating.
If you're worried about leaving your ex alone, call a friend of his and explain what happened, where he is, and what you're concerned about, and what you want the friend to do. Apologize for the pain the situation has caused and thank this friend for helping and leave it at that.
If your ex is furious to the point that nothing will get through to him just then, say, ""It's not productive to just yell at one another. I've made my decision, and I won't change my mind, but I will talk with you if you can remain calmer. Take some time to settle down, and then call me - we can talk again then."" If your ex does call, keep your word. Pick up the call. If there are questions, be honest and kind with your answers, but keep the conversation short and civil so you don't prolong the pain.

, Once you have begun the process, be polite but firm about these boundaries, and make it clear that they are non-negotiable. It is permissible to cut him or her off without a chance to discuss what went wrong. Try to make the failed relationship as valuable as possible by turning it into a chance to learn and grow and as to what type of people to avoid.


If you have mutual friends and want to avoid each other for a while, make a ""joint custody"" plan to see your friends without running in to each other.
If you both have a favorite coffee shop or go to the same gym every time, try to set a schedule that helps you avoid each other. You don't have to be too rigid or organized about this, but it can help you avoid the pain of running into each other.
If you have each other's things or even live together, make a plan for sorting out your belongings as soon as possible so you don't have to keep seeing each other.

, One of the biggest mistakes made in ending a relationship is allowing the final death throes to go on and on. And on. And on. And on. It's one thing to finalize shared expenses, disentangle community property, etc. It's another thing to beat a dead horse endlessly.


When discussions become circular––in other words, you just travel around and around the same points without coming to a point of resolution––stop. That's the moment to say, ""I think we should continue this later, or not,"" and leave.
If the person doesn't understand why you're breaking up with them, you can try to make things clearer in a letter or message. Say what you need to say, let the other person explain him or herself in a message so they feel that they've been listened to, and leave it at that. It can be easier to disentangle when you're doing it while apart.

, Trying to ""be friends"" can prolong the agony of a breakup. Most often, it is best to make a clean break and spend time apart. After a time, perhaps three months, perhaps a year or more, when you see one another, it won't hurt as much, and maybe then you can try to be friends with a clean slate. Even then, be sensitive and respectful about what your ex needs––she or may need more time than you. If that's the case, don't just foist yourself on the ex in an attempt to become friends some time later.If your ex asks ""Can we still be friends?"", say, ""No, we can't still be friends. For now, though, I think it's best we just let things end."" If pressed, say, ""Look, we started out as friends and went past that. To be friends, we'd have to go back, and frankly, I don't want to go back. We need to go forward now. That means we need to put some space between our broken relationship and any new relationship we might form. Let's take a break, take some time, and give each other the space we need to heal and move on. At some later point, when we meet again, we might be able to put our anger aside and be friendly. Let's leave it at that."" However, make this the last contact between you two. Make the break final with no further contact ever.
If there are mutual friends that are shared by the both of you, inform them of the breakup and also inform them that you will not appear at any functions that your ex-lover will be present at and if that means they have to choose sides, so be it.

, Sure, you're the one who did the breaking up, but in most cases, that doesn't mean you want to have a night on the town to celebrate your new freedom. What people don't understand is that the person who did the breaking up is often in just as much pain as the person who was dumped. In some cases, the person who does the breaking up feels even more pain, because he may also be plagued with feelings of guilt, even if he knew it was the right thing to do.After the break-up, take some time to yourself to reevaluate your life and think about what you can do to be happy in the future.
It's okay if you want to spend a week or two crying, writing in your journal, and just holing up in bed. But after that, it'll be time to get out in the world again and to slowly start to get back into the swing of things.
Calling a good friend in your time of need can make you feel better. Going out to the clubs to get obliterated off alcohol the night after your breakup probably won't make you feel better.

, After a few weeks, or a few months have passed, you will slowly start to enjoy your life again. By now, you and your ex should have separated your things and have found a way to avoid each other, which should already be helping the healing process. Once you're starting to feel like yourself again, you should take pleasure in your friendships and your close relationship with your family, and pursue your old hobbies as well as pick up some new interests.


If you want to start feeling like your old self, you should avoid doing the things that you and your ex loved to do together for a while, whether it's going hiking in your favorite spot or having drinks at a certain bar.
Make some changes. To feel new, rearrange your furniture, clean your car, and pick up a new hobby you've never done before, such as volleyball or art class.

Just remind yourself that it is normal to feel this way after a breakup and that you need to feel these emotions in order to move on., It may be necessary for you to take a short break from your normal routine after a relationship ends. Having this time may help you to process your feelings and function better in the long run. Just make sure that you do not do anything that will threaten your other relationships or your livelihood.For example, you may be able to skip your normal exercise class for a week without consequence, but you can’t skip work for a week. Use good judgment and explain your situation to your friends if you need to cancel any plans while you recover.

, The end of a relationship can leave a big hole in your heart, which may require a significant grieving period. Make sure that you give yourself permission to grieve this loss and experience the pain that it causes. Otherwise, it may take longer for you to feel better and move on. Let yourself cry, scream, yell, or whatever you need to do to get your negative emotions out.Try setting a daily time limit for grieving the loss of your relationship.

Reflect on your relationship.,
Write about your feelings.,
Deal with your anger.,
Stand by your decision.,
Remind yourself of your ex’s negative traits.,
Consider the reasons why you are better off without your ex.",How to Get Over a Break Up3," Consider all of the reasons that you and your ex broke up. Try to keep in mind that even if that you enjoyed being together for a while, something was not working. Thinking about the reasons why the relationship ended can help you understand why you need to move on. You may also be able to avoid making the same mistakes in the future if you can identify areas where you contributed to the demise of the relationship. Ask yourself some of the following questions:Did I contribute to the end of the relationship? If so, what did I do?
Do I tend to choose the same sort of people to date? If so, what are they like? Are they good for me? Why or why not?
Have I had similar problems in other relationships? If so, what is causing me to have these problems? What can I do differently in future relationships?

, Write in a journal or try writing poems. The most important thing is to be honest and don't edit yourself as you go. One of the best results of writing it all down is that sometimes you will be amazed by a sudden insight that comes to you as you are pouring it all out onto paper. Patterns may become clearer, and as your grieving begins to lessen, you will find it so much easier to understand valuable life lessons from the whole experience.


Try writing down your feelings every day after your breakup until you feel better. For example, you could start each of your journal entries with “It has been __ days since we broke up and I feel _____” Then go into more detail about how you are feeling. Using this prompt will help you to see the progress of your emotions over time and process some of those emotions as well.Try writing a letter to your ex, but do not send it. Sometimes it just helps to get all of your feelings out. However, sending it is not a good idea. This letter is just for you, so write out everything you wish you could have said and be done with it. It doesn't do any good to rehash the breakup over and over again, so just pretend you are telling them how you feel for the last time.
Try writing a story. Think back to when your relationship with this person began, and document it from beginning to end. This may be very painful, but it will give you a broader perspective. When you get to the final chapter, finish off on a positive note and write ""The End"".

, Feelings of anger occur when we feel we have been wronged or there has been unfair treatment. In a situation where you will not contact your ex-partner, the best way to deal with anger alone is to relax.


Take deep breaths and focus on allowing your muscles to voluntarily relax. Soft music can often help.

, If the breakup was your decision, keep in mind that focusing on the good times you had with your partner may cause you to forget the reasons why you broke it off. By the same token, try not to second-guess the situation if the decision to end things was not yours. It's very common to romanticize the good parts of the relationship and convince yourself that the bad parts weren't so bad after all. Don't play this game with yourself. Accept the situation and work on moving forward.

, Focusing on all of the things that you don’t like about your ex can help you to get over the breakup faster. Try making a list of all of the things your ex did that you did not like. For example, maybe your ex often burped loudly after dinner, or made plans without you, or forgot your birthday. List every little thing that bothered you about your ex., In addition to reminding yourself of everything that bothered you about your ex, you can also benefit from thinking about the positives to your breakup. Make another list of all of the reasons why you are better off without your ex.For example, maybe your ex discouraged your efforts to eat healthy, so now you feel more empowered to follow a healthy diet and take better care of yourself. Or maybe your ex never wanted to do any of the things that you wanted to do, so now you have the freedom to do all of those things. List all of the reasons why you are better off without your ex.

You may think your partner is just a bit moody or needy when in fact, that person has slowly taken over every aspect of your life. Here are some signs that you're in a manipulative or controlling relationship:


If you've noticed that the person has slowly begun to take over every aspect of your life -- from how often you see friends to where you go for dinner -- then you're being controlled.
If the person you're with has angry or emotional outbursts followed by telling you how much he or she needs you or loves you, then the person is trying to control you with his or her emotions.
If you've tried to leave before and the person has threatened violence or even suicide, then you're being threatened and manipulated.
If the person you're with is extremely jealous and hates it when you hang out with your friends, especially with people of the opposite gender, and makes it difficult for you to hang out with other people, then you're being controlled.
If your partner has put you down in front of friends and family, has discouraged you from speaking too much in public, and gives you a scary look that makes you keep quiet, then you're being controlled.
If you find yourself giving in to your partner time and time again because you're afraid of how he or she will act if you don't, then you need to get out of the relationship.
If you're being pressured to do things you don't want to do, especially sexually, then you're being controlled.
If you find yourself desperate to please that person at any cost, then you've stopped thinking about yourself.
If the person makes you feel like there's no way out of the relationship and that you'll never find someone else who wants you, then you're being manipulated into staying in the relationship.;
, Once you realize you're in a controlling or manipulative relationship, you need to start thinking about how much better your life will be when you're done with it. This will motivate you to leave and to start making a game plan for getting out. Write these reasons down to firmly plant them in your mind, and to make you see that you need to get out ASAP if you want to start enjoying your life again. Here are some reasons why you need to leave:


You can start being your own person again. Write down all of the things you loved doing before the relationship, from grabbing fro-yo with your friends to spending hours taking long walks by yourself, that your partner no longer ""lets"" you do.
You can start enjoying your other relationships. Remember how you used to hang out with your buddies before your girlfriend stepped in and said every night would be date night? Write down your favorite memories from hanging out with your friends and family and think of all the fun and fulfillment you can have once you start enjoying those again.
Your self-esteem will skyrocket. Right now, your self-worth may be based on how good your partner may make you feel at a given moment, and once you're out of there, you can assess yourself on your own terms. And if your self-esteem is low because you know you're letting yourself give in to an emotional or unstable person, you'll feel better once you stop doing that.
You can stop living in constant fear and anxiety. Instead of worrying about how your significant other will react to something you'll do or say, you can just enjoy your life.
You can even have a good friend help you generate some reasons -- a friend may have an insight into your relationship that you don't have, and he or she can motivate you to leave.

, You should keep it short and sweet and not leave room for the other person to try to reason with you, to beg you to change your mind, or to promise that he or she will change or do anything you want to stay in the relationship. You don't have to give a million reasons for why you're leaving or to list all of the times the person has disappointed you -- that will only make things more difficult.


Just say, ""This isn't working for me"" or ""It's time to say goodbye,"" and give a few more statements, but keep it brief.
There's no point in being vindictive or accusatory. That will only make your partner more emotionally volatile.
Be as calm as you can when you deliver this news. Don't yell, cry, or pace around. Keep it almost matter-of-fact, even if you're hurting inside. If you're obviously emotional, your partner will see that you can be manipulated.
Once you've figure out what you'll say, you should practice how you'll say it. This will help you be comfortable with the words.

, The method of delivery is very important when you're dealing with an unstable or controlling person. The most important thing to think about is that if the person is at all violent or if you're truly afraid of how the person will react, then you should give the news in a public place, where you feel safe -- bring a friend if necessary.


If you really don't even want to face the person, just write him or her a note or email. If it's gotten so bad that you're afraid to talk face to face, then just get out whatever way you can.
Though once you've decided to end the relationship, you should act quickly, give some thought to the timing. Don't end the relationship after you and/or your partner have been drinking, or in the middle of a very stressful event. Try to pick a time when your partner is likely to be a bit more stable -- even if that isn't saying much.

, If you live with the person or if you've just left a lot of things at his or her place, you should think about how you'll get back your stuff. You can try to be sneaky and get it out before you break up with the person, so you don't have to go back after you do it. Have a few friends come and help you get the stuff, whether it's behind the person's back or after the break-up. This will make you feel safer and more motivated to leave.


If you do live with the person, you should also find a place to stay before you initiate the break up, so you're not stranded and tempted to go back.

, Before you say what you have to say, tell yourself that it's really over and start dealing with the natural mourning that comes after a serious relationship is over. If you start already thinking of yourself as broken up -- without telling your significant other -- you'll feel stronger when you say what you have to say because you've already made up your mind.

, This is the most important thing to consider as you tell the person you're breaking up. Once you've said it, you've said it, and there's nothing the person can do or say to make you change your mind. Say the words you've practiced, and get ready to leave. Even if the person is crying or looks absolutely pathetic, just remember all those reasons why you need to leave.


The person may say, ""But you haven't given me a chance too explain!"" That's too bad -- actually, you've given him or her way too many chances.

, Don't linger around to give in to your partner's emotion or list the forty things he or she did to ruin your life. The shorter your explanation, the less likely your partner will be to argue with you or to nitpick. Remember -- this is not a negotiation, so don't be open to a dialogue. Say your piece, and get out.

, Stand or sit away from the person -- don't let him or her try to touch you, hug you, or just trap you into staying in the relationship. If the person tries to hold your hand, you may feel tempted to just be tender with the person again instead of doing what you intended to do, which is walk away.

, If you've been manipulated throughout the relationship, then it's very likely that you'll get manipulated during the break-up. Don't let the person try to sway you with his emotions, tell you that you'll never find someone else, or bribe you with all of the things he can do for you if you stay, whether it's to marry you, buy you a house, or go to anger management classes.


Remind yourself that you're leaving the relationship because you're tired of this exact behavior. It's not going to work on you anymore.

, It may be obvious that you're going to stay with your parents or at your best friend's house, but don't mention it. Don't give the person an opportunity to follow you to try to win you back, or even to start stalking you.

, Once you've said what you had to say, just go. If you have a friend waiting in the car, or with you, walk out with that friend. Don't look back for one last tender gaze at your former significant other -- he or she made you feel miserable and worthless, and you're done with all that. Hold your head high and walk out the door and don't ever look back.

, Don't let the person call you, text you, Facebook you, or even show up in places where you're likely to be -- get a restraining order if you have to. Talking to the person will only make you feel more confused and hurt, and things could get ugly. Don't be tricked if the person says that he or she just want to chat, or that he or she misses you -- your ex will only try to get you back in whatever way possible.


If you need to talk the person for any reason, like to get back more of your things, or work out something practical related to mutual belongings, bring a friend with you and do it in a public place.
If you and the person have a lot of mutual friends, you'll have to cut off contact with them for a while. Don't go to places where you know your ex will be, even if that means laying low for a while.

, It's natural that you'll feel sad and lonely without your significant other. If he or she controlled every aspect of your life and you're suddenly on your own again, having to make decisions for yourself, it's logical for you to feel unable to handle the smallest decisions, and to feel completely alone and overwhelmed. But this is exactly how your ex wanted you to feel -- like you couldn't possibly live a day of your life without him.


Keep telling yourself that it will get easier -- it really will.
Remind yourself that, before the relationship, you were perfectly fine on your own, and that you can be that person again.

, Though it's helpful to spend some time to reflect on your own after a break up, this is not the time to spend all of your time alone. Instead, lean on your friends and family and spend as much time with others as you can. Though the last thing you want to do may be to go to a party, force yourself out and try to have some fun.


Though you should spend more time alone during a more standard breakup, spending a lot of time alone after ending a manipulative or controlling relationship will make you more likely to want to go back to your ex.
Your friends and family are your support system. Talk to them about how bad the relationship was -- having them confirm your thoughts will make you feel stronger.
Don't be afraid to reach out. Maybe you lost touch with some close friends because of your controlling partner. Just be honest and say you know you made a mistake for cutting your friends out of your life, and they should take you back.

, If you spend all of your time wallowing in your room or watching TV by yourself in the dark, you'll never be able to get over the relationship. Try to stay as busy as you can by hanging out with friends, pursuing your interests, and immersing yourself in your work or studies. You can even find a new hobby to try to pursue on your own, which will give more meaning to your life.


Whatever you do, just try to get out of the house. This will make you feel less alone, even if you're only reading by yourself in a coffee shop.
Plan your week. Leave some time for reflection, but make sure you have something to look forward to every day.
Think of this as an opportunity to try something you never got to do with your ex. Maybe he hated something as simple as eating sushi or going to the movies -- do those things to your heart's content.

, This part may take a while, but you'll slowly see how much better you are on your own and away from the terrible relationship. Every night before you go to bed, think of one thing that you're now able to do away from the relationship. You can even make a list of all of the ways that your life is better and how great it is to feel in control of your thoughts and actions.


Whenever you have a moment of weakness, review this list, or recite all of the reasons why your life is better. Give it time and you'll see that you were right for being brave and making the right choice.

Plan the breakup surreptitiously, quietly even.,
Depart as planned and scripted.,
Continue subterfuge, and secretly prepare for the discussion which eventually will happen, despite your careful planning.,
Disappear.,
Plan for a second party to be present at the inevitable day of reckoning.,
Host the final event in a neutral location, such as a counselor’s office, a restaurant, or a park bench.,
Survive the aftermath, not the afterlife.,
Consider resorting to the legal system to speak his or her language.,
Know when the game is over.,
Once you have regained your sense of humor, particularly if you do have that sense of “battle humor” (reference Star Wars quote by Qui-Gon Jin), or enjoy life’s challenges, you might be tempted to indulge yourself again with the same or another attorney.,
Realize that your experience and the author's experience are not necessarily the same.",How to End a Relationship With an Attorney," With an attorney, there is a risk that he or she will have you on the floor in tears discussing the definition of “break up”, because he or she thinks of you in the genitive case, in which case the term “breakup” would have no meaning. So the first step is to not mention it, and do the unmentionable in disguise.


Depending on how creative you are, you may have already done a similar exercise in another context, but this is different. What you don’t want to do is get him or her excited. Use a preponderance of words to confuse and distract, so that he or she will not be able to ponder your real purpose until later––after you're out the door.;
, “This is just an ordinary day, dear, but I’m not sure that I won’t be delayed tonight due to an unforeseeable dependency in the latest meeting schedule. And oh, look it’s spring, so I need to take all my clothes to the dry cleaner today. All this black stuff – oh, I can’t wait to go shopping and get something in red and white. Caroline told me the other day that Nordstroms is having this sale and… “. You get the idea. At this point, he or she has no idea you will be delayed indefinitely, perhaps permanently, so that’s not something he or she can argue about. You can expect to proceed with your day as usual.

, Find a word for “breakup” which he or she can’t negotiate about because he or she doesn’t know what it means. That means you have to make it up. Make up a word like... disbaration. Shhhh! Don’t tell your attorney date the word yet––you have to spring it on him or her at the right time as a surprise, leaving no time for prior preparation.

, Find places you have to be. Not want to be but must be. Stay with a friend who needs you. Shop for new clothes because your wardrobe needs attention. He or she likes your wardrobe, so the thought of this will please your attorney date, especially if you can allude to undergarments or his or her favorite color, or both at the same time. A charitable or spiritual event. Family matters that must be attended to. Attorneys do understand your other commitments, provided they are short and don’t interfere with your total commitment to them.

, That way he or she knows that you know that they know what you actually say. And you know that he or she knows that they know what he or she actually says.

, Tell your story and stick to it. The less words you use, the less words he or she has to argue about, and the less you have to know that he or she knows you said. Your breakup speech should be succinct, and magnificent. Look him or her in the eye, pause significantly, and then sweep out haughtily, leaving him or her speechless in admiration, and burning left brains on what is the right question to ask. Suggestion: “With this final act of disbaration, I am hereby regaining my lawful state of peaceful solitude whereby solicitors are not welcome, and the private entrance has been sealed.”.

, You haven’t gotten there yet. This is the stage where you think you are done but he/she…, though no dunce, doesn’t get it:


Don’t bother being reasonable. Any reasons will be discussable. Resolute will get you through it faster with less bother.
Don’t give up. Faster and bother are relative terms. This stage is more like a siege than a skirmish. You’ll need lots of chocolate, red wine, and guy or gal friends who aren’t afraid of your ex-attorney date.
Don’t even try to be nice. Nice to an attorney is like chewing tobacco – he or she will chew it up, spit it out and then smile ready for the next bite.
Try to stay detached, have a sense of “battle humor” and enjoy the show. At some point, you’ll probably even admire his or her ingenuity and wonder why he or she didn’t exert that much energy to amuse you when you were ready to be amused.

, If your ex-attorney date's continued courtship becomes exceptionally tedious, the courted may need to go to court. Depending on how creative he or she is, and the availability of other game which could work in your favor to distract him or her, you may need to start a new game. Don’t waste any time outs, and remember, if you were a betting person, who would you put money on to win a match with a tennis pro? That’s right – a tennis pro. So put your money down on… another attorney. Yes, it’s frustrating - you started out with one, but now there are two. Hang on. There’s likely going to be a third, but it’s a good thing! Once there are three of them, they can dispute the score amongst themselves and you can drink martinis on the sideline! Legal vehicles which may get you back on the road to happiness are anti-harassment orders or orders of protection. See your local court system for further information.

, Eventually, the score will be Love Nothing, with the attorneys splitting the take. You are now free to take your life and go home to a peaceful afterlife.

, Don't. There are plenty of professions that aren't invested in proving you wrong and plenty of non-combatant sorts awaiting your love. On the other hand, there are plenty of combative non-attorneys, too, so consider that in your search for a mate.

, Not all attorneys are the same--just as not all non-attorneys are the same. Some attorneys are very passive at home because they've been fighting other people's battles all day long, while some non-attorneys seem to want to pick a fight, no matter the situation. Keep an open mind and an open heart in relationships. Don't stereotype."

Take care of yourself.",How to Command Respect from Other People," Remember that it’s not how you feel that is important–it’s how the person watching you thinks you feel. This is a common problem with body language: often your non-verbal signals don’t convey what you intended them to. You may be slouching because you’re tired, but others might read it as a sign of disinterest. You may be more comfortable standing with your arms folded across your chest, but others will see you as resistant and unapproachable, and keeping your hands stiffly by your side or stuck in your pockets can give the impression that you’re insecure or hiding something – whether you are or not.


To show confident body language, you need to stand tall instead of slouching, look ahead of you or at the people you're speaking to instead of the floor, and keep your hands relaxed and ready to gesture when appropriate.
Don't fidget with your hair, clothes, or hands, or you'll look either bored or insecure. Keep your body alert and active, giving yourself more presence.;
, Have you ever been asked a difficult question in a group? Probably you wanted to come across as knowledgeable, confident, and likable, but what if you clenched your jaw, raised your eyebrows or grimaced as you searched for the answer? Or did you sigh, smile condescendingly, and shake your head? And what do you think the people around you made of that? So take care about how you react.


Keep your facial expression positive and confident, by smiling slightly, not looking down, and avoiding furrowing your brows or biting your lip.
When you speak, make sure that you look like you believe in what you're saying instead of having an expression that says, ""I cannot believe the stuff that's coming out of my mouth.""

, We are programmed to feel closer to someone who has touched us. The person who touches also feels more connected. Firm touch is more effective than light touch, which can actually make someone less comfortable. It’s a compelling force and even momentary touching can create a human bond. A touch on the forearm that lasts a mere 1/40 of a second can make the receiver not only feel better but also see the giver as being kinder and warmer.


Even with adults in business settings, a study on handshakes by the Income Centre for Trade Shows showed that people are twice as likely to remember you if you shake hands with them., When your body language is out of sync with your words, people believe what they see. It is crucial to communicate congruently – that is, to align your body to support, instead of sabotage, an intended message. Mixed signals have a negative effect on performance and make it almost impossible to build relationships of trust. Whenever your non-verbal signals contradict your words, the people you are addressing — employees, customers, voters — become confused. And, if forced to choose, they will discount your words and believe what your body said.


For example, if someone is talking to an audience about how much he or she welcomes their input, but stands behind a lectern, or leans back away from the audience, or shoves their hands in their pockets, then the audience will believe the non-verbal signal that that person is not interested in the audience, and couldn’t care less about them!

, As a leader, you are always communicating. People are unrelenting leader-watchers, and your “off-record” behaviour is being closely monitored. In the words of one savvy leader, “What I do in the hallway is more powerful than anything I say in front of an audience.” You can't give a forceful, commanding speech and then walk off the stage and start rebuking an employee or family member over the phone without losing respect.


If you say something to a few people and then are seen contradicting your own words shortly after, then how can you expect to have their respect?

, Have you ever wondered why men are more likely to be perceived as leaders than women? They tend to use fewer, lower, and slower movements. In research, on average, women made 27 major movements when entering a room to a meeting, compared with only 12 for men. Women who do make it to be leaders use fewer, slower movements, on a par with men. So if you want to command respect, slow down and don’t wave your hands about.

, If you want to command respect, then you have to be a good role model for people. They should see the way you live your life and feel inspired. Though this may sound a little general, you just need to live your life the way you think an ideal life should be lived. Be kind to people in the service industry, achieve your goals, give your work your all, and make time for kindness and generosity in your life.


If you are a person who lives your life with class, dignity, and grace, then you will be respected for your strong character.

, Commanding respect does not mean taking advantage of other people. If you want to command respect, then you have to be respectful and kind to people, instead of trying to make them your minions or your puppy dogs. Don't take advantage of people in your office in a lower position, or of needy friends or acquiescent siblings. This won't make you look awesome because you have people doing everything for you; instead, you'll look like a person who doesn't care about anyone else, and nothing will make you lose respect faster than that.


If people respect you, then they will be happy to work with you to achieve mutual goals. But if you're just using people for money, rides, and favors, they'll catch on pretty quickly.

, Even if you're the CEO of your company, it doesn't mean you have the right to be mean to the mail carrier. You should be grateful for whatever position you have and to treat people above and below you with kindness and care. This means that you should respect people in positions of authority and pay attention to the people who work under you; if you snap at a waitress or are mean to a new employee, then people will see that you don't give common courtesy to other people.


Sure, rising to the top at your company can earn you some respect. But giving the guy who delivered your company lunch an extra tip will earn you even more.

, You may be so desperate for other people to respect you that you feel the need to flaunt every little thing you've ever done, from earning your first tennis trophy in middle school to winning the New York marathon. However, if you work hard enough and maintain your modesty, then people will learn about your achievements and will be impressed by them anyway. If you're the one who has to bring up all of the great things you've done, then your achievements will begin to lose their luster.


It may take time for people to notice all of the great things you've done, but once they do notice, it'll be worth it.

, If you want to command respect, then people have to see that you are so invested in the more important things in life to care about who hooked up with whom over the weekend. Instead, start a trend by saying something nice about people ""behind their backs."" People will be impressed that you have so much good will and that you aren't nasty, jealous, or conniving. They'll respect you for not giving in to idle gossip and for not spreading rumors.


And who knows, they may even follow your trend, and you will not only command respect for being kind, but for starting a positive movement.
Additionally, it never hurts to compliment people to their faces. Resist the urge to snap at people or to be mean if you're in a bad mood and focus on being nice to people instead. People will tend to like -- and to respect -- you more if you make them feel good about themselves.

, If you want to command respect, then you cannot live selfishly. Take time out of your busy schedule to volunteer in your community, to help a classmate or co-worker understand a difficult task, or to help your parents around the house. The act of selflessly giving your time, even if you don't have a lot of it, will not only make people respect you more, but it'll make you feel better about yourself as well. If you're so focused on achieving your goals and impressing everyone that you have no time for helping others, then you will certainly lose respect.


Of course, you shouldn't volunteer or help others just so people will respect you more. It should be a natural impulse.

, Another way to get people to respect you is to be truly excellent at something. You could be amazing at your job, write beautiful poetry, or be the best goalie your college team has ever had. You can even excel at making anyone laugh in under a minute, no matter how terrible they are feeling. Find what you're good at and take it to the next level. If you're truly going above and beyond in some aspect of your daily existence, then people will notice.


Again, this doesn't mean that you should brag about how amazing you are at something. If you go about it the right way, then people will notice.

, Being a man or woman of your word is the key to showing strong character and commanding respect. How can people respect you if they think you'll flake on them or go back on your word within minutes? If you say you're going to do something or make a promise, then you better back it up. And if you're not sure if you can really do it, then don't make empty promises that will only temporarily make people feel better. Work on being someone people can depend on and the rest will follow.


Know your limits. Don't say you'll do twenty different things if you only have time for five of them.

, A big part of having self-respect is being comfortable with what you're doing and who you are. And if you don't have that, nobody will respect you, either. So, stop apologizing for needing some me time, for not going to your friend's party because you'd rather hang out with your family, for not meeting your boss's unrealistic expectations, or for not being able to hang out with your family because you have a final exam coming up. Own your actions and don't make excuses for them, and other people will see that you're worthy of respect.


This doesn't mean that you shouldn't apologize for anything. If you've done something wrong, you'll gain a lot more respect if you admit your mistakes than if you to to brush them under the rug.

, A person who has no self-respect is always saying yes to people because it's simply easier than turning them down. You may say yes to pet sitting when you have no time, yes to giving your friend a ride when you'd rather be getting some rest, and yes to taking on more work because you don't want to upset your boss. If you want to have self-respect, then you have to learn to say no when you mean it without feeling bad about it.


Don't make excuses for why you can't do it or apologize profusely unless the situation really calls for it. Be comfortable with your decision.
If you really do feel bad about a situation and would still like to help in some way, you can offer the person who is asking for a favor another alternative.

, You need to let people know exactly where you draw the line from the get-go. If you're always giving in to people and doing whatever they want, then they will push you further and further. For example, if you watch your sister's kids for five hours a week but say that you just can't help out any more than that, then she won't take advantage of you; but if you give in and help out over the weekend, too, then she'll see that she can get you to do anything. If your team thinks they can get away with asking you to do more of the work, then they'll quickly push you further than you really want to go.


State your expectations from the start and stick to them, no matter what, and people will see that you respect your own value and your time.

, If you want to have true self-respect, then you have to hang around people who make you feel good, not people who put you down and make you feel small. If the people around you are always making fun of you or making you feel ugly, poor, stupid, or just generally worthless, then how can you expect anyone in your orbit to have respect for you? If you allow yourself to be treated with flagrant disrespect by your closest friends, then other people will think it's okay for them to treat you that way, too.


It's time to reevaluate your relationships. Are the people you spend time with making you feel like a more worthy person or like someone who is completely worthless? If they're not with you, then they're against you, and it's time to find people who treat you like you deserve to be treated.

, People who don't respect themselves beg for help, favors, attention, and a lot of other things that lose their appeal after they are begged for. If you respect yourself, then you can ask for help with a difficult task, but you should not degrade yourself by begging for help from people who don't want to give it to you. If your girlfriend isn't paying enough attention to you, don't make her respect you even less by begging for it; instead, let her see how much you should mean to her by being your best self, and if that isn't enough, it's time to cut ties.


Not only does begging for help show a lack of self-respect for the person you are speaking to, but people around you will see you as desperate if you look like you can't do something on your own.

, If you want to command respect from other people, then you have to take good care of yourself. This means that you shouldn't let people see you getting overly intoxicated and that you should show up to work or school looking well-groomed and well-rested, instead of stumbling out of bed after three hours of sleep with your hair sticking up. You should make sure you eat three meals a day and have time to do the things you love; all of this has to do with taking care of yourself both physically and emotionally.


If you're happy and proud of who you are, then you are a person who is taking good care of yourself. And if you're taking good care of yourself and show that you deserve respect, other people will give it to you.

Don't overthink it.,

Appreciate cultural differences.",How to Blow Your Nose in Japan," In almost every major city in Japan, vendors, advertising agencies and businesses hand out pocket tissues. You will find pocket tissues on almost every corner. These pocket tissue packs almost always have advertising inserts, and are a great way for advertisers to get the word out about their products. You get free tissues and companies get to market their businesses — everyone benefits., Handkerchiefs are typically reserved for wiping sweat off of your head, tears from your eyes, or drying your hands. They are never used for nose blowing. Because of this, you need to use a tissue to blow your nose. Often, people who live in Japan will carry a tissue and a handkerchief with them – one for drying and one for nose blowing., In Japan, mucus is as vile as other body excretions are in the Western world. So, you’ll want to take care that you dispose of your tissue properly. Find a trash bin, typically located near the exit to every restroom or building, and make sure that your tissue is fully in the waste receptacle.If you miss the bin and the tissue falls to the ground, pick it up quickly and try again.
Wash your hands immediately after disposing of the soiled tissue.

, Never use a tissue more than once, and certainly don’t save all or part of a tissue to use later. This is the equivalent of reusing toilet paper in the Western world. Use a clean tissue every time, and remember that tissues are readily available throughout Japan, should you need more., If you absolutely must, you may discreetly wipe your nose with a tissue. You still don’t want to face anyone while dabbing your nose, and you definitely don’t want to make any sound. Remember to use a tissue, not a handkerchief, and excuse yourself if a discreet wipe isn’t sufficient.Fortunately, the need to blow your nose rarely sneaks up on you, which will give you ample time to find an appropriate place to resolve the issue.

, You might find yourself in a position in which you’re unable to excuse yourself to blow your nose. Your companions will understand your predicament. Simply turn around, ensuring that you’re not facing anyone, and blow your nose as quietly and quickly as possible.Facing someone while performing a crude action like blowing your nose is considered disrespectful.
It’s best, of course, to excuse yourself to a restroom and return to the table after you’ve blown your nose.
As an adult, you don’t need to offer an explanation for leaving the table. Simply say, “Excuse me, I’ll be back shortly.”

, In Western cultures it is considered rude to sniffle, but this is accepted and expected in Japan. You might encounter people snorting loudly or sniffling repeatedly, and both are acceptable alternatives to blowing your nose in public. So, if you find yourself without tissues or in a public space, sniffle as much as necessary to keep your mucus at bay.If you’re not in a public space, it isn’t necessary to sniffle. Instead, simply excuse yourself and blow your nose.

, It is expected that you will wear a surgical mask if you are sick. This is so that you don’t spread germs to others, and also so that others will not see your runny nose. Masks are abundant in Japan and you will have no difficulty finding one. Remember that masks are an expected courtesy in Japan, and you will stand out more if you have a runny nose and don’t wear one.Wearing masks is pretty commonplace in Japan, and they aren’t just for colds. Some people wear masks for fevers, to block out pollen, and to avoid getting sick from others.

, Sometimes, the more you focus on not being able to do something the way you're habituated to can cause it to become more of an issue than it ever need be. Blow your nose (or not) discreetly, politely and get on with your day.

, There are a multitude of ways to apologize in Japanese that are based on how well you know the person to whom you’re apologizing and how severe the offense is.Blowing your nose in front of people is considered quite rude, but not isn’t the worst social offense that you could commit. If you feel that it’s appropriate, apologize for your behavior, but understand that it isn’t expected.


You could say, “Shitsurei shimasu,” which means “I’ve been rude.”People in Japan don't say ""bless you"" or ""gesundheit"" after a person sneezes — usually nothing is said. Still, you may wish to apologize if you sneeze.

, You may come from a Western culture that finds sniffling and snorting to be the height of rudeness. Or you might come from a culture that finds wearing masks to be a bit strange. Your reaction may be to give reproaching glances to those who are sniffling, or wearing masks, or handing out pocket tissues, but you must be mindful of Japanese culture and appreciate cultural differences."

Remain attentive.,
Try to contribute.,
Don’t interrupt too abruptly.,
Involve more people.",How to Be Polite in a Boring Conversation1," Even if you are completely uninterested in the topic of a conversation, you should think about your body language and try not to look bored. No-one wants to bore anybody else, and you will make the person you are talking to feel bad if you are visible not paying any attention. Be sure you are facing the person and keep some eye contact.


Don’t slouch or fidget. This kind of body language shows that you are bored and looking for a way to escape.Crossing your arms across your chest will make you look disinterested, and of course looking at your watch or checking your phone is a clear signal that your mind is elsewhere.;
, Try not to just respond with monosyllabic noises, such as “yeahs,” “umms,” “ahhs.” Make an effort to engage more meaningfully in the conversation and you might find that it becomes a lot less boring. When you do try and get involved in the conversation, try to avoid relying on simple questions that betray your lack of real interest in the topic.


Don’t just ask things like “Where did you go?” or “What happened next?”
Try to ask more complicated questions that might open up to the conversation to other topics, and allow you to steer it in a different direction. For example, try asking questions that ask ""why,"" such as ""Why do you think things happened that way?""By asking more complicated questions you are showing curiosity and interest that goes beyond simple politeness., Measured interruptions can actually indicate that you are interested in the topic and have something to contribute, but don’t try to suddenly change the subject altogether. If you do this you will appear to be rudely dismissing what the other person has to say.

For example, if your friend is talking at length about the latest baseball game they went to see, don’t blurt in with “So, how’s school?”
Try to intervene in a way which acknowledges the other person, but still enables you to subtly shift the conversation.
For example, you might say something like “Yeah, it was a great game. That reminds me, did you manage to get all that school work done beforehand?”

, One way to try to liven up a conversation is to bring more people into it. You can do this in a polite way if you are not too abrupt, and you keep in mind what the other person was talking about. For example, perhaps you are being told about cars and you really are not interested in them, but you know someone who is.


You might say “My friend John is really into cars, I’d be interested to hear what he thinks about it.” You can then bring the friend into the conversation.
This can be a way to excuse yourself, but it can also be a way to broaden the topic and take some pressure off yourself.
Generally, if there are more people involved in the conversation it won’t be such hard work for you.

Preserve the bridges.",How to Be Nice to a Mean Person," If the person has just said or done something mean to you, it’s important to cool off before you react.In the heat of the moment, it’s easy to spew harsh words and react out of anger. If you’re expected to give an immediate response, choose your words very carefully. Speak slowly and calmly, despite what you may be feeling. You can unpack your emotions later, but don’t make a scene before you have time to fully consider the situation.;
, This is easier said than done at first, but it’s possible! If a stranger was rude to you, just remember that’s all they are— a stranger. Their words and actions have no bearing on your life. By reacting pleasantly and with kindness, you avoid making the situation a bigger deal than it needs to be. If it was a friend who was mean, don’t let that one unfortunate moment ruin a foundation of friendship. It’s important to separate the person from the behavior, and remember that their rude words or actions are not who they are.By separating the words and behaviors from the person, it also becomes easier to not see something as a personal attack against you.

, If you don’t take the time to step away and consider the different possible ways you can react, you may act in a way that you will later regret.If necessary, give the person some sort of neutral excuse for stepping away. Tell them you have a scheduled phone call, an appointment, or an errand to run. You can even just say you have work to do, and need time to focus. Don't tell them you need time away from them, because that will make them defensive right off the bat. Then, go do something that always makes you happy, whatever that might be. It’s pretty hard to be mean to someone if you’re feeling really happy.


Exercise, talk with a good friend, watch something funny on TV, meditate, or do anything else to get your mind off the mean person and cheer yourself up. Get to your “happy place.”
Don't return to the tense situation until you only have good intentions. In other words, wait until you are completely calm and ready to be kind.

, This may sound crazy, but it’s actually a great rule of thumb when you’re trying to speak kindly and mind your manners. You probably wouldn’t curse someone out in front of your grandmother, even if you really, really want to. This is great when you absolutely have to be nice to someone but don’t even know how to start.

, Whether or not you agree with them, they have got to feel heard. People often lash out at others because they feel like that is the only way they will be heard or taken seriously. Maintain eye contact and nod to convey that you’re taking in their words.Say things like, “I understand what you’re saying.” This does NOT mean that you agree with it, but that you are taking in everything.
Do not interrupt. Do not speak over them. Just let them say what they need to say.

, Tell them that you can see that they’re angry or upset, and simply ask what you can do to alleviate their stress. Just offering this can help the situation immensely.If you cannot do what they ask of you, try to find a compromise. Make effort to end the tense situation by being helpful.
By asking them what they need, they also may realize that there isn’t anything you can do personally. This might help them realize that they’re taking their anger out on the wrong person.

, It’s great to keep calm and speak kindly to them, but you can take it one step further to alleviate any tension or friction that may exist in the relationship. The most important thing is to be genuine and gracious, and a random act of kindness or a spontaneous favor can go a long way.If you’re dealing with a grumpy coworker, pick up an extra coffee for them in the morning. Not only will they appreciate the gesture, but the caffeine may improve their mood as well!
Deliver sweet treats or flowers to a callous neighbor. It’s a lovely favor that is outside of your comfort zone, and it will show them that you want a friendly relationship.
Give them a handwritten note. Let them know what you appreciate about them or simply wish them a great day. Handwritten notes are less common nowadays, and they show the person that you’ve put in time and effort to brighten their day., The easiest way to be genuine is to be transparent with the other person. If you're doing them favor or giving them a gift because you want to improve your relationship, just say that! Clarify that your kindness is wholeheartedly sincere, and eliminate any suspicion of sarcasm or ulterior motives.

, Were they trying to give you advice that was simply worded poorly? Were they insulting you because of their own insecurity? Try as hard as you can to place yourself in their shoes. See if you can figure out the real reason they spoke or acted poorly towards you.


Changing the way you frame their words can help. For example, don’t make a sweeping generalization about the person. Instead of thinking, “This person was mean to me because they are a rotten person,” try thinking, “This person was mean to me because they must be struggling with something.”

, Think about your reasons for doing that. Were you having a terrible day and were they at the receiving end of your frustration? Did you feel insecure, jealous, or excluded? It’s easy to judge others without judging your own actions, but try to remember that everyone has bad days and acts poorly.


Always remind yourself that, “hurt people hurt people.” Being mean is not fun or enjoyable, and genuinely happy people aren’t mean. They may have said or acted cruelly towards you, but odds are it was just a symptom of an internal issue they are having.

, Mean people act mean to others, who are then mean in return. If you offer them kindness that they don’t often get, you could break this chain for them. You could make all the difference in how they end up treating people later.

, Anything. Maybe you went to the same school, have mutual friends, or live in the same part of town. Try to find a common thread that can remind you they are a human not much different from you. They acted badly, but they are still deserving of your compassion.

, Sometimes, no matter how mature and kind you are, you come across a completely vile person and you cannot find a reason they deserve your kindness. This is when you just need to do it for your own selfish reasons. Do you want to look like a huge brat? Do you want people to see you as a rude, volatile person? Even if you have every reason in the world to give them a piece of your mind, there will always be two sides to the story. In their version of events, you will always be the villain. Just bite your tongue, show them kindness, and know that you look like the better person.

, Being a crabby, rude person takes a toll on your health. Don’t let the mean person have that power! Anger can increase your risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular issues.On the other hand, states of happiness have been correlated with lower stress hormones and better immune functioning.

Kindness also simply makes us happier. Being nice to another person can cause an increase in dopamine in the brain, giving us what some people call a ""Helper's high."", Life is unpredictable and you have no idea who you may run into again. The fewer people you butt heads with in the course of your life, the more potential connections you’ll have later.Everyone you meet can potentially offer you something, so at the very least, you should stay cordial for selfish reasons!


Can you imagine sitting down to get your hair cut and your hairdresser was a person you just cursed out on the subway? What if someone you fought with in college is interviewing you for your dream job in ten years? Don’t risk it!

Get more exercise.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Rest up.,
Avoid excess alcohol.",How to Be Less Irritable1," Not only is it great for your physical health, but exercise can actually improve your mood. Exercising frequently can make you feel less stressed, which can lessen the likelihood of you becoming irritable. Hitting the gym is also a great way to blow off steam, if you do find yourself feeling cranky during the day.Get in a routine. Doctors recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise six days a week. Try scheduling your exercise the same way you schedule other appointments. By making it a priority, you'll be more likely to make time each day for some physical activity.
Choose an activity that you like. Have you always enjoyed swimming? Find a gym or a nearby park with an indoor pool. If you choose an exercise that feels like fun for you, you'll get added mood boosting benefits.
Head outside. Being outdoors can lighten your mood and ease feelings of anxiety. Take a long walk and enjoy exploring a new neighborhood or local hiking trail.;
, The foods you eat can have a big impact on your mood. If you eat too much sugar or a lot of processed foods, you will likely experience more symptoms of mood swings, including irritability. Instead, reach for whole foods, especially lots of fruits and veggies. When your body feels better, you will likely be in a better mood.Aim for at least five servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit each day. Leafy greens such as kale have a ton of nutrients that will help your overall health.

This will help your body regulate its internal clock and you will sleep better. This will also help regulate your mood.
Power down the electronics before bed. Try to avoid having the tv on or checking your e-mail within an hour of bedtime. The glow from the screen can interfere with your brain's ability to shut itself off.

, While a glass of wine after work can make you feel relaxed, drinking much more than that can have adverse effects. Research shows that because alcohol lowers inhibitions, it can lead to you saying things that make you sound angry or irritable. For example, if you have several drinks, you are more likely to be very irritated that your partner forgot to do the dishes--and you won't be afraid to make your irritation known. Women should try to limit their alcohol intake to one drink per day, while men should stick to two.Be aware of how alcohol makes you feel. If you know that drinking often leads to you feeling emotional or angry, try to avoid it altogether.
Alcohol can also interfere with your sleep. Avoid drinking within 2-3 hours of your bedtime.

Excuse yourself.,
Try to change the subject.,
Give the conversation an end-point.,
End it positively.,
Say goodbye.",How to Be Polite in a Boring Conversation2," No matter how patient you are, sometimes you will have to try and work your way out of a boring conversation. This can be difficult and a bit awkward, but it’s always important to try to be polite and not hurt the other person’s feelings. You can politely excuse yourself by saying that you have another commitment, or that you had lost track of time. Depending on how you say it, and your body language, these excuses can seem genuine or forced. Examples of way to politely excuse yourself could include:


“Oh, I’m sorry. I completely lost track of time, I really have get going. It was great talking to you, though.”
“I’d love to keep chatting, but I have to go and meet my husband.”
“I’m really sorry, but I’m running late and have to go.”, If you find yourself stuck in a conversation about something you don't know about and aren't interested in, you could try to politely change the topic. You can make this clear to someone without sounding rude or impatient. Just point out that you don't really know much about the topic of conversation, and offer an alternative topic to discuss.


You might say ""I'm not really an expert in this and it's kind of hard to for me to follow.""
Perhaps you could say ""Wow, you sound like a real expert on X! I don't really know a lot about X but I am really into Y. Do you like Y?""
You might find that the person talking to you isn't so interested in talking about this other topic and the conversation may come to a swifter end.

, You can politely make it clear that you are only free to talk for a limited time, by referring to something you are doing which you will be finished with shortly. For example, if you are in the break room at work and a colleague starts talking to you, you can say that you are just making a quick cup of coffee. When the coffee is made you can excuse yourself without seeming rude.

, You can try to sugar the pill a little by ending with a positive note. You could show that you have been listening and plan to follow up on what you have been talking about, or say that you will pass on the information to someone you know. For example, if someone has been telling you about a film they really like, you might say “I’ll definitely watch it, thanks.”


Alternatively, you might say something like, “My girlfriend really loves horror movies, I’ll tell her about it. It sounds like she’ll love it.”
You can point out that you have learned something from the conversation, and thank the person you were talking to.
You might say, “I’d never really thought about it like that, thanks.”, However boring the conversation might have been, it’s polite to say a warm and friendly goodbye. Walking off without saying goodbye is rude and unnecessary in any situation, after all the person you were talking to didn’t bore you on purpose. Saying goodbye with a positive and upbeat tone will help both you of leave the conversation without feeling awkward or uncomfortable

A simple and positive goodbye could just be “nice talking to you, take care.”
A friendly and casual goodbye could be “I’ve got to run, take it easy.”"

Make time for yourself.,
Practice patience.,
Meditate.,
Let it go.,
Allow for the unexpected.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Organize your surroundings.",How to Be Less Irritable2," Feeling irritable might be your mind's way of telling you that you need to take a break. When you feel a mood change coming on, make it a point to step away from the situation and take some time for yourself. This can be as simple as taking a quick walk around the block to calm yourself down.Make it a habit to set some time aside your yourself each day. Maybe you can reserve the last half hour of each day to read a book. Or you could wake up a little early to enjoy having your first cup of coffee in complete silence.
When you notice yourself being irritable, give yourself a break. Take some time to listen to music or do a few relaxing yoga stretches.

, When you are impatient, you are more likely to feel irritable, overwhelmed, and stressed. Try to practice patience in your everyday life. It's not easy, but it will have positive benefits for your overall mood.Try to slow down. Research shows that by moving at a slower pace, you will feel less hurried, and therefore less impatient. Try to eat more slowly, breathe more slowly, and take time to appreciate your surroundings.
Be flexible. It's important to know that things won't always go your way. Be prepared for things to go wrong or take longer than expected. For example, maybe you only scheduled thirty minutes to get your kids dressed and off to school. Try building a little flex time into your schedule. That way, if it takes a little longer than expected, you won't feel like your entire day has been thrown off course.

, Meditation can having amazing emotional benefits. Reports say that it can cause decreased irritability, greater ability to deal with conflict, and more emotional balance. Try adding meditation to your daily routine. You will see definite changes in your mental health.You can mediate by choosing a quiet, comfortable place to sit.

There are many guided meditations available. Try downloading one to your phone. They are available in many time increments, from two minutes to two hours. Guided sessions are great for those new to mediation.

, You may feel that you are chronically irritated about something. For example, maybe your child can never seem to remember to make his bed before school. Instead of letting this ruin each and every morning by causing irritation, talk to yourself about reasons to just let it go.This is also known as ""dropping the story"". Instead of letting the messy room invade your thoughts all day, practice some self-talk. Whenever you think of the unmade bed, remind yourself that your child is sweet, caring, and humorous. Eventually, those will be the thoughts that your brain instinctively focuses on.

, Anxiety is one of the primary reasons we become irritable. Often, unexpected events can cause that anxiety, leading to an overall irritability. Think about what happens to your mood when a traffic accident causes you to be 20 minutes late for work. That unexpected delay can cause ripple effects throughout your whole day. You can't stop the unexpected from happening, but you can definitely take steps to handle surprises better.Take a deep breath. Calming yourself with slow, conscious breathing can help you stay calm and stave off irritability.
Allow your anxiety to exist. Don't cause yourself to feel worse by being angry at yourself for being anxious. Instead, acknowledge your emotions, make a plan to fix the situation, and move on. If you're going to be late for work, maybe just acknowledge that you'll have to eat lunch at your desk to make up for lost time.

, It's possible that you are irritable because you are surrounded by people who are negative. Moods are contagious. If you want to be in a good mood, one of the best things you can do is surround yourself with those people who make you happy and relaxed.You cannot always choose who you spend time with. For example, if you have a negative co-worker, you obviously can't just cut her out of your life. You can, however, make a conscious choice to not allow your own mood to be affected by her negative attitude. You can also limit your interactions with her as much as possible.
Think positive thoughts. Throughout the day, take some time to focus on something good. It can be as easy as appreciating the smell of your morning coffee.

, If your home is cluttered, chances are your mind is, too. Having disorganization in your daily life can lead to greater stress, which can increase feelings of irritability. Try keeping your environment neater. You'll feel better mentally. Take 10 minutes each evening to do a general straightening-up of your living space. Your mind will feel relaxed as you go to bed, and you'll wake up feeling better prepared to calmly face the day.
Try keeping your desk neat. You'll end up feeling calmer at work, and less likely to be crabby.

Set boundaries.,
Try new tactics.,
Ask questions.",How to Be Less Irritable3," Other people are the cause of many day-to-day annoyances. If you work on improving your communication skills, you can help yourself cope with irritating people. By setting boundaries and conveying those boundaries to others, you can limit irritating interactions.Make your feelings clear. For example, if you have a co-worker who regularly asks when you are going to have children and you feel that his questions are an annoying invasion of privacy, you could say ""My husband and I are very happy with our lives."" Then move on.
Say no. We are often irritable when we feel overwhelmed and worn down. This tends to happen when we are too busy. Try saying no when someone asks you to do something that you don't have time for. Say, ""Actually, I'm not available to fill in for you at the client dinner this Thursday. I have a lot of my own projects that I need to focus on.""

, When you are feeling irritable, there are several steps you can take to avoid taking it out on other people. One of the most effective methods is to take a break, or a time-out. If you're irritable during a meeting, excuse yourself for a minute. Grab a drink of water, take a few deep breaths, and give yourself a minute to process your emotions. This might avoid helping you snap at someone.Try using ""I"" statements. Instead of getting mad and exploding when you come home to a sink full of dirty dishes, phrase your annoyance productively. Say ""I would appreciate having some help cleaning up,"" or ""I feel overwhelmed when I come home to a messy house at the end of a busy day"". This way, you are explaining your emotions without using a blame-placing statement.
Consider the other person's point of view. Before getting mad, take a minute to think. Did the other person have a hectic day? Is that why the household chores aren't done? Maybe take that into consideration before jumping immediately to irritability.

, Sometimes your view of a situation might not consider the whole picture. We have a tendency to assume that other people's actions are focused on us. In reality, they probably have their own reasons that might have nothing to do with you. Try asking some questions to figure out the situation. It can be irritating when your partner doesn't remember to take the trash out. Instead of immediately thinking, ""Why doesn't he care about me?"", try to assess the situation by saying, ""What's the situation with the trash? Were you running late to work this morning?

"

Learn the cause.,
Consider treatment.,
Make a lifestyle change.",How to Be Less Irritable4," If you find yourself being irritable on a regular basis, you need to determine the reason. Irritability can be a symptom of underlying health issues such as anxiety and depression. In women, hormonal imbalance can lead to irritability.Irritability can also be a symptom of serious illness such as cardiovascular disease or lung disease.
Certain medications can also cause irritability. Ask your doctor to help you find the cause of your problem.

, Consult your doctor on the best way to treat your irritability. If it is a symptom of a physical ailment, such as chronic pain, it is time to be more aggressive in treating your illness. Ask your doctor to suggest changes in your medication or lifestyle.If your doctor concludes that your irritability is the result of a mental health issue, such as anxiety or depression, ask him to refer a counselor. Talk therapy can be very effective in helping you deal with these issues.

, If your irritability is not the result of a physical problem, it is likely situational. That means it is caused by something going on in your life: stress at work, or problems in a relationship. Spend some time trying to pinpoint what it is that is making you unhappy. Then take steps to try to make positive changes in that area.If you find that work is one of the major causes of your bad mood, consider making a career change. Make a list of the things you consider most important in a job: pay, creative challenges, security, a positive work environment. Then spend some time brainstorming what sort of career would best suit you.
If you are having a problem with a personal relationship, try to communicate your thoughts to the other person. For example, if you find yourself constantly frustrated with your partner, ask to have a conversation about your feelings. Clearing the air can make you feel emotionally better, and can result in positive changes.

Put others before yourself.,
Be ready to act when others are passive.,
Perform random acts of kindness.,
Volunteer your time.,
Volunteer your talents.,
Ask if you can help someone.,
Use small gestures.,
Promote the good.Being a hero is not just about working to put down the bad things in life like poverty, inequality, and oppression, it is also about working to promote and advance the good things in life like charity, kindness, gratitude and love.,
Be on the lookout for opportunities.,
Learn from your own heroes.No one becomes a hero all on their own.",How to Be a Hero," A real hero knows that their actions might go unnoticed and that’s okay. Make sure you are trying to be a hero for the right reasons. You’ll need to be willing to help people who might not even know you have intervened in their lives. You’ll have to be focused more on the feeling you get from doing the good deed than the praise. Find the joy in seeing the smiles on other people’s faces.
Think about how you would feel having a good deed done for you. That will help you connect to the joy or change you’ve created in another person’s life.;
, A true hero isn’t all talk. They are constantly thinking about how they can take action and help. You may be inspired to be a hero for a certain cause or issue, or you may try to be a hero to someone in need.For example, if you are passionate about the environment, don’t just preach to people that they should recycle. Try to start an environmental club at your school or get your friends together to help you build a compost bin in your backyard.
Maybe you are passionate about helping the homeless in your area. Rather than giving one homeless person money, you may get involved at your local homeless shelter and hand out food and basic supplies to the homeless in your area instead.

, Think about what other people might need before you consider your own needs. When you are making decisions at work or at home, take some time to think about how your actions will affect someone else. If you take the day off of work, what kind of workload will that put on your coworkers?

Remember that people think differently. What seems comfortable or easy for you might not seem that way to other people. You might feel really confident going to a karaoke night with a bunch of strangers, but your friend or date might not. Consider what other’s want in addition to what makes you happy.

, People lead busy lives. Often a typical person is so focused on themselves, they don’t notice or care to act when something is wrong. But a hero will be willing to take action and confront injustice straight on. Stick up for a friend, classmate, or coworker you feel is being treated unfairly. Buy a meal for the homeless person everyone keeps walking by on the street. Notice someone who is the underdog or who is less fortunate and give them a helping hand.
You can also focus on creating safe spaces for individuals who suffer from injustice or prejudice. This could be advocating for a space on your campus for queer-identifying students, or a club for women of color to network and connect.

, A hero doesn’t just intervene when they see wrong being done. A true hero is out to do good at any time. This might mean taking some extra time out of your day to look for a good deed. You can do anything from paying for the coffee of the person behind you in line at the coffee shop to helping some lost tourists find their way around the city. Other random acts of kindness you can do include:


Raking your neighbor's leaves for them.
Helping to pay a student's tuition.
Buying lunch for the office.
Washing a friends car for them.
Buying groceries for someone in need.

, There are many charities and nonprofit organizations across the country that simply need people to volunteer a few hours each week to help them reach their goals. Offer to work for a local 5k marathon that is raising money for breast cancer or another cause you feel passionate about. You can also volunteer your time in other ways:Help build houses for low-income families.
Join a community garden.
Get involved with your neighborhood watch.
You don’t always have to volunteer in such an official way. You can offer to help a friend move or give up some time to listen when a family member is in need of emotional support.

, First think about the things you are good at or skills that have come in useful in the past. You can ask your friends and family what they think you are good at. They may already have a good idea about your strengths and how you can best utilize them to be a hero.

Think about how you can use your talents to help others.

Perhaps you are a great public speaker, or maybe you have a talent for making things with your hands like craft projects or furniture. Maybe you are a great listener and are good at being empathetic to the needs of others.
You can also use your professional skills and knowledge to help others. If you are a teacher, you might volunteer some time to help tutor students who are having trouble in school. If you are an artist, you might volunteer your time and skills to help teach senior citizens how to paint or sketch.

, Sometimes people need help but don’t know how to ask for it. Become the type of person who isn’t just waiting around for opportunities to be a hero. Make your own by asking others if there is anything you can do for them.


Think about what you had a hard time with when you started your job. Offer to assist new employees with working the copy machine, getting to know certain procedures, or setting up their email.

, A hero understands that the little things in life can add up to big things. You can do small gestures like holding open the door for people or offering to take a friend out to lunch. You could give someone a ride to the airport or pay for someone's laundry at the laundromat.


Even offering someone kind words can help you grow as a hero. Say thank you to service workers. Tell a friend you appreciate them.
Give a friend a hug.
Write your teacher a thank you note.
Send a family member a surprise email or text telling them you love them.

, Speaking out against injustice is important, but speaking out in favor of peace is just as valuable.


Think about things in terms of “Pro” instead of “Anti”. Be pro-peace instead of antiwar. Be pro-environment instead of just antipollution.Be a good leader. If you are a teacher or in charge of a team at work, know that you have people that look up to you. Lead them by example. If they see you thanking people for their hard work, highlighting the achievements of others, and going out of your way to do favors, they are more likely to do the same.

, A good hero is vigilant. They are aware of their surroundings and constantly on the lookout for situations where they may be of help to others. Start small. Think about the people you come across regularly in your daily life. The coworker in the cubicle next to you or the student who sits behind you in English class. What do you know about them? When might there have been an opportunity to be a hero to them in the past? How can you be ready for a similar opportunity in the future? If you are in line at the grocery store and the person behind you seems like they are in a hurry, let them cut in front of you.
If you recognize that a fellow classmate is struggling in a class you excel at, offer to study with them after school.
Watch for people on the subway who may need your seat. The elderly, a pregnant woman, someone on crutches.

, Think about the people in your life who have acted like heroes. What were times when you felt lost or scared only to have another person come along and help you through a tough time? Maybe they were strangers. Perhaps a teacher or relative was there for you when you really needed someone. Think about what they did and how it made you feel.You can ask some of your own heroes for advice. Ask them how they are able to put others before themselves.
Don’t be afraid to imitate..Chances are that the way someone helped you will work for other people as well. If a friend helped you by being a good listener, you can do the same for someone else.

Be annoying on public transportation.,
Be a clown during sporting events.,
Act like a fool at a museum.",How to Annoy People Around You1," People on public transportation are prime targets for your annoying behavior. They are often tired after a long day of work or weary after a frustrating day of travel. Here are some ways to really get under their skin:


If you're on an airplane, try to take up as much space as possible. Stick out your arms and elbows and make a point of stretching your arms so far that they get in the way of your seat mate.

If you're sitting by the window, get up often so the other people in your aisle have to stand. Announce, ""I have such a small bladder!"" You can also make them get up for you, and once you're in the aisle, say, ""Whoops--never mind!"" and make them get up again so you can be seated.
If you're sitting next to someone who is particularly nervous, keep asking if they think the plane is making a funny sound. When it takes off, pretend to pray or hyperventilate.


If you're on a bus or a train, sit right next to a person even if there are plenty of available seats.

Have a loud one-sided conversation on the phone. Make sure everyone can hear you. If someone asks you to shut up, whisper loudly.
Strike up a conversation with someone who is obviously tired and wants to be left alone. Say annoying things like, ""Hey, why do you look so tired?""
If there aren't many available seats, throw your bags over an extra seat. If someone asks you to move your stuff so he can sit down, shrug and say, ""Sorry, I'm saving this for a friend.""
Interject into people's conversations. Some people will actually let you, but most will get really irritated.

;
, Sporting events are full of people who are excited to be there and eager to see their teams win. Many of these people will consider it the best part of their week. What better place to be annoying?


Cheer loudly--for both teams. First, cheer loudly for just the away team, until the fans around you get annoyed. Once you've sufficiently annoyed them, start cheering for the other team! Cheer any time anyone does anything.
Bring lots of annoying props such as bullhorns, vuvuzelas, or even maracas to make as much noise when you cheer as possible.
Be disruptive. Get up as much as possible, especially if you're sitting in the middle of a long aisle. Stand up to block the view of the person behind you during crucial moments in the game. Talk loudly during key moments.
Spill your food. Spill your popcorn, soda, or even your nachos all around you. Your fellow audience members will love that. Bonus points if you blame them for making you trip.
Pretend you don't know the rules of the game. This is a sure-fire way to annoy devoted fans. Cheer wildly when nothing is happening in the game, and ask the people around you to explain the rules multiple times.

You'll be especially annoying if you mix up the rules of different sports. For example, if someone kicks a goal during a soccer game, scream, ""Touchdown!"" If someone scores during a football game, cry, ""Home run!""



, Museums are places where people like to be quiet and respectful. They come to admire great art and take themselves seriously. Here are some ways to undermine their sober demeanor:


Be loud. Laugh to yourself, talk on your phone, or send loud text messages. Everyone will love this.
Loudly shush people. Until you get thrown out, pretend to be working at the museum and ask people who aren't talking to be quiet.
Do you want to know the number one way to annoy people at a modern art museum? After spending a long time inspecting a strange sculpture or a confounding painting, loudly exclaim, ""I could do that!""

Have Good Manners



 

;
, Looking the part of a prince can be quite costly, but luckily there are things you can do today that will dramatically improve your wardrobe. For starters, opt for more refined, mature pieces rather than tawdry graphic t-shirts and other clothing. Avoid piercings and have tattoos in spots where they can be easily covered. Having some bespoke goods will do you some good, but ultimately find clothes that fit your body type. You can draw sartorial inspiration from real life princes such as British Princes William and Harry, or perhaps some Scandinavian princes such as Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark, Crown Prince Haakon of Norway, Prince Carl Philip of Sweden, Prince George of Cambridge etc.

, As you will be coming into contact with a lot of people, this Is paramount.

, Finding the balance between being approachable, but also being regal and noble is tricky, but overtime you will find what works for you.

, Many royals are patrons for various charities. Getting involved and helping your community will definitely help not only you, but those around you.

Don't argue.,
Avoid hot topics.,
Stay calm.,
Look bored.,
Agree without agreeing.",How to Annoy Argumentative People1," It can seem difficult to avoid being drawn into a debate. When faced with a very argumentative person, it is important to remind yourself that your antagonist does not likely want to hear your opinion.Nothing you say will be convincing enough to settle the argument, and an argumentative person will likely not admit it even if they are wrong. Save yourself a headache and just say you're not going to debate the topic.;
, When talking to an argumentative person, it's best to keep the conversation as trivial as possible. If a topic comes up that often causes disagreements or that many people debate, like gun control or abortion, say that you do not want to talk about it or that topic doesn't interest you.


Change the subject. If you sense an argument coming, instead of disagreeing try to steer the conversation in a different direction.

, Don't let yourself get riled up. Letting an argumentative person see that the argument is getting your emotions going will likely give him the sense of victory or superiority he secretly craves and urge him to keep arguing. If you appear to be unaffected by the disagreement, the other person will feel unsatisfied with the results. Eventually he may even give up arguing with you and seek out a more excitable target.


Keep your voice quiet. When one person raises their voice, the other feels compelled to be louder. Speaking quietly may even make you seem wiser, which will annoy your opponent.

, Check your watch or the messages on your phone. Let him know you have more important things to do and excuse yourself. Disputes give argumentative people a sense of superiority. By displaying your lack of interest in discussing the topic you will seem superior yourself.

, Say something like, ""You're probably right, but I like my way."" Once you have done this there is nothing left to argue about. You can also nod your head without agreeing. Let him state his opinion and then move the conversation onward as though an agreement was made.


Make noises of agreement without agreeing.This helps to slow down his statements and keep the conversation low-key.

Use words in dangerous situations.,
Move through doors.,
Navigate steps and staircases.,
Use caution near curbs and roads.,
Help with seating.,
Guide a blind person into a car.,
Assist them in the airport.",How to Walk With a Blind Person2," You may encounter a dangerous situation when walking a blind person. There may be a speeding car, for example, or a loose dog. In such situations, remember the blind person cannot see the threat. Do not simply move him or her out of the way. Use your words to say something like, ""Stop!"" or ""Move!"" After you've gotten the blind person out of harm's way, explain the threat., When guiding a blind person, you may have to help him or her through doors. In such a situation, make sure to take special precautions to make sure everything goes smoothly.


Make sure the blind person is on the hinged side of the door. If you need to change sides, do so following the instructions listed above.Explain which way the door opens as you near the door. Open the door and proceed to walk through with the blind person you are guiding. Have the blind person close the door behind him or her when you finish passing through., Steps and staircases can be somewhat difficult to navigate. It's important you take safety precautions to avoid accident or injury.


First, verbally inform the blind person when stairs are coming up. Tell him or her whether the stairs go up or down.Get to the edge of the stairs. Allow the blind person to let you know when he or she is ready to proceed. The blind person may want a moment to calibrate before proceeding up or down the staircase.Walk up or down the staircase, remaining one step ahead of the blind person. Go slowly to avoid injury. When you reach the top or bottom of the stairs, let the blind person know., Curbs and roads are very dangerous, even with a guide. If you are guiding a person who is blind, make sure that you can use the Accessible Pedestrian Signals, which can provide tactile arrows and audible explanations about when to cross. You will need to push a button to activate the system, and may be able to adjust the sound.

Cross the street at the narrowest point.
Warn the person about curbs by saying ""curb up"" or ""curb down.""
Approach a curb together., In addition to walking, you may need to help a blind person sit down. Tell the blind person which way a chair is facing. Walk up to the chair and place your guiding arm on the chair. Let the blind person know which part of the chair you are touching. The blind person can move his or her arm down yours, feel the chair, and figure out how to sit down from there., If you lead a blind person to his or her car, offer to help him or her into the car. Make sure you ask if the blind person needs assistance before helping.


Let the blind person know which way the car is facing and which door you're opening. For example, say something like, ""Okay, the car is facing forward and I'm going to help you into the passenger's seat.""Take your guiding hand and place it on the door handle. Instruct the blind person to feel down your hand to find the handle.From here, you can usually let a blind person get in the car on his or her own. However, if it's an unfamiliar car you should place your arm inside the car on the roof. This can help the blind person feel how big the car is, avoiding bumping his or her head. Once the blind person is safely seated inside the car, allow him or her to close the door., Help them navigate through the airport, which will likely be busy and offers multiple opportunities for getting lost. Guide the individual to their seat, or ensure that they are partnered with personnel who have clearance to enter the plane if you are not travelling with them.

Tell the airline that the passenger is blind when you book the ticket so that they can provide support services, such as pre-boarding.Individuals who use a cane are permitted to carry a white cane onto an airplane as long as it goes through the x-ray machine.Guide dogs are permitted aboard aircraft in some areas, including the United States and Canada, excepting Hawaii. If the passenger is travelling abroad, check the destination to see if they will permit the guide dog entrance or require special documentation, such as confirmation of rabies vaccinations.
If you are traveling with a guide dog, ask to have the metal detector wand used instead of going through the tunnel. The dog's harness will set it off."
"
Approach, ask, and then assist.,
Do not be overprotective.,
Describe the passing scene.,
Give directions verbally.",How to Walk With a Blind Person3," Many well-intentioned people see a blind person on the street and assume they should help. While it's a good idea to be helpful to those around you, you should never help someone without checking if they need assistance first. Approach and ask before you assist.


Approach the blind person first. Greet them and introduce yourself. Say something like, ""Hi there! I'm Michael.""From there, politely ask if they need help. Try something like, ""I noticed you're trying to cross the street and I was wondering if you needed any help.""If the person needs help, he or she will usually let you know. Not all visually impaired people need assistance, so do not be offended if your offer is declined. Simply wish the person a good day and move on., Many blind or visually impaired people have been dealing with their disability for a long time. They are often used to navigating potential threats. While it's important you let a blind person know of a coming car or a low-hanging tree branch, try not to be overly protective. Only advise a blind person to move or duck when it's absolutely necessary.

, Just as you might enjoy observing the scenery when you walk, many blind or visually impaired people enjoy having scenes described to them. When guiding a blind person, it can be nice to tell them about anything noticeable or interesting as you're walking. However, use discretion. Some people may prefer to walk in silence or may find excessive chatter distracting. It's a good idea to ask first before you describe the scene.

, Many people use non-verbal cues, like pointing, when giving directions. You may do this without even thinking when giving directions to a blind person. However, try to remember you need to give out specific verbal directions for a blind person to understand. Say, ""You walk three blocks forward on this street and then take a left."" Do not point forward and say, ""It's three blocks that way.""

Talk about your ex as much as possible.,
Pick fights early and often.,
Sabotage your dates.",How to Annoy People Around You2," This is absolutely the best thing you can do to annoy your loved one. Make a point of always mentioning your ex, saying how great your ex is, and boasting about all of your ex's accomplishments. Some other ways to annoy your significant other when you talk about your ex include the following:


Make a point of texting your ex and giggling at everything he or she says. Loudly say, ""He's the best!"" This works especially well if you're on a dinner date with your significant other.
Invite your ex to come out with you. Surprise your significant other by inviting your ex to hang out with you when you're supposed to be on a date. You can also invite your ex to small parties because then you're significant other will find it harder to kick him out.
Always compare your significant other to your ex. Say things like, ""This soup is pretty good, but (insert ex's name here) was the best cook ever!""

, Nothing is more annoying than a person who is always fighting, especially if it's for no reason. You can annoy your honey in less than a minute by picking a fight about nothing. Here are some ways to be extra annoying:


Pick a fight during an inappropriate time. Some great times to pick a fight include Valentine's Day, your special someone's birthday, or around your significant other's parents.
Pick a fight for no reason. Pick a fight just because you're in the mood. Get mad at your special someone for spilling a tiny drop of water or being only one minute early to your date.
Refuse to listen. State your side of the argument and then walk away. If you can't leave, stick your fingers in your ear and say, ""La La La!"" until your significant other gives up.

, Your honey has worked hard to plan the perfect date. What better way to annoy him than to completely ruin the occasion? Here are some great ways to really tank your dates:


Be very late. This is especially annoying if you're going to a movie or a show. When you show up, act aloof. Say, ""Whoops, am I really late?"" or ""Sorry, I got caught up chatting with my ex!""
Complain about whatever it is you're doing. If you're watching a movie, keep talking about how boring it is. If you're out at a special restaurant, keep complaining that the food is dry or bland. If the food takes more than a minute to arrive, tap your fingers loudly on the counter and sigh.
Flirt with anyone around you. If you're at dinner, ask the waiter for his phone number and giggle.
Spend the entire evening on your phone. Nothing says annoying like the sound of a text message.

Be flaky.,
Tell them all about your problems and don't listen to theirs.,
Be a jealous friend.",How to Annoy People Around You3," Your friends will really love it when you make plans to do something, act really excited, and then tell them you can't make it at the last possible minute. This is a fool-proof way to annoy your friends no matter how nice they are. Here are some ways to be extra-flaky:


Cancel on them after they're already on their way to meet you. Wait for them to show up to the place where you planned to meet. Tell them you can't make it over text message--with no explanation.
Before you flake on them, say, ""I know I'm really flaky, but I swear I'll come this time!""
If you were their only ride to an event they were really looking forward to, tell them you can't make it because you found something better to do.

, Nothing is more annoying than a one-sided friendship. You should practice complaining for a really long time and then ignoring your friends or running away when it's their turn to talk. Here are some ways to perfect this strategy:


Complain about really insignificant things. This tactic will be especially annoying if you complain about something extremely minor, like an A-minus on a term paper, or about someone cutting you off on the highway. The longer you can discuss this mundane topic, the better.
Repeatedly say ""I have no-one to talk to! I feel like no one cares!"" after moaning for hours on end.
Don't take their serious problems seriously. If something actually bad happened to your friend, brush it off and then leave. For example, if your friend's car was stolen, you can say something like, ""It's not the end of the world!""

This is especially annoying if your friend has been dumped by her boyfriend of seven years. Saying something cliched and frivolous like, ""There are other fish in the sea!"" Comparing the situation to your relationship with your boyfriend of two days is a sure-fire way to annoy your friend.



, Nothing is more annoying than a friend who is jealous about anything his or her friend does. This can get annoying incredibly fast. Here are some things to be jealous about:


Your friend's significant other. Spend your time talking about how your friend's boyfriend just ""isn't good enough"" for her. When you're hanging out with the two of them, try to ignore the significant other. If you join them at the movies, sit between them with a tub of popcorn. Chew loudly.
Your friend's other friends. Constantly complain that your friend's other friends are ""completely annoying."" Pick the nicest, most un-annoying friend to repeatedly say this about.

"
"
Spend all of their money.,
Blame them for ruining your life.,
Don't follow their rules.",How to Annoy People Around You4," This is a sure-fire way to annoy them. Your parents work hard for their money and not taking their hard work seriously is not only disrespectful, but it's extremely annoying. Here are some ways to really drive the point home:


Talk loudly about the frivolous things you have spent their money on, like designer clothes or expensive meals.
If you're way too old to be spending your parents' money, pretend like you're only ten years old. Keep asking your parents for your allowance money and ask them why they don't support you more.
If you're old enough to work a real job but just don't feel like it, keep saying, ""I'm an artist, okay? I am above the rules."" If they insist that it's your duty as an adult to have gainful employment, cry, ""You're trying to crush my soul!""

, This will really annoy your parents. Chances are, they've done nothing but try to make your life as easy as possible. Here are some other ways to be incredibly annoying in this fashion:


Loudly say, ""I didn't ask to be born, okay?""
If they nicely ask you to do something small like take out the trash, say, ""Why are you doing this to me?""

, Your parents have made rules for a reason and nothing is more annoying than disregarding them completely. Showing a complete and utter lack of respect for the way their household works is incredibly annoying. Here are some ways to really drive the point home:


Act completely oblivious about your chores. If they ask you why you haven't done the dishes or cleaned up in the living room say, ""Who, me?""
When they ask you to clean up your own mess, say, ""What am I, a slave?""
Bring home annoying people at annoying times. Bring your new creepy boyfriend home during your dad's birthday dinner.
Throw parties without asking your parents. This will be most effective on a weeknight.

"
Don't follow your teacher's rules or directions.,
Disrupt the classroom.,
Be a know-it-all.",How to Annoy People Around You5," Your teacher has worked hard to create rules for his or her classroom, and nothing is more annoying than a student who undermines them. Acting completely oblivious of the rules is just downright annoying. Here are some ways to really get under your teacher's skin:


Waste class time by asking your teacher things that he clearly told you several times. This works best if you ask him something that is clearly written on the board or on the syllabus.
If you missed class, instead of looking at the syllabus or asking a classmate, ask your teacher, ""What did I miss?""

If you really want to annoy your teacher, say, ""Did I miss anything?""


When your teacher reprimands you for doing something you were instructed not to do, act really oblivious. Say, ""I'm sorry, my last teacher said that was okay!""

, Absolutely nothing is more annoying than a student who not only doesn't pay attention, but also creates a disturbance and distracts the teacher as well as other students. Here are some ways to create a racket:


Show up late--loudly. Run into the classroom loudly and pant, ""Sorry I'm late!"" Huff and puff and drop your things everywhere, creating a noisy mess. When you finally take your seat, repeat your favorite phrase, ""Did I miss anything?""
Talk to other students. Actively talk to other students while the teacher is talking, even if they don't want to talk to you. This is especially annoying if you are asking them a question that you should just ask the teacher.

If you want to reach astronomic levels of annoying-ness, ask your teacher a question, and then talk to your classmates while he or she tries to earnestly answer you. That will go over really well!


Use your cell phone throughout class. Let it sit on your desk and vibrate repeatedly. Don't bother putting it on silent. Or you can have an incredibly loud and obnoxious ring tone. Let it ring while your phone is buried deep in your bag so it'll take forever to turn it off. This will surely disrupt the class and will make your classmates crack up! Your teacher will love it.

, All teachers love a student who thinks he knows more than they do. This works particularly well if your teacher is a true expert on a subject and you know absolutely nothing about it. Here are some ways to be a true know-it-all:


After everything your teacher says, say, ""How can you be so sure?"" If your teacher plays along and tries to explain to you why something is true, grunt or say, ""I guess that makes sense,"" but look obviously unconvinced.
If your teacher reprimands you, roll your eyes and sigh. That will work wonders!
Constantly reference your other teachers, your parents, or even your friends as true expert. After everything your teacher says, say, ""But my dad says...""
Let your teacher know if you think you deserved a higher grade on a mediocre assignment. That will earn you lost of brownie points.

Tell him he is wrong.,
Demand proof.,
Point out bad grammar.,
Patronize him.,
Cite ridiculous, irrelevant sources.,
Point out pettiness.,
Make it personal.",How to Annoy Argumentative People2," Don't back this up with any facts that can be debated. Just tell him he is wrong and refuse to provide any further explanation. Nothing will anger an argumentative person more than hearing they are wrong, especially if they are right.

, Even if the other person's argument seems to be valid, demand proof for any claims that they make. Refuse to debate the issue further until he proves his claim to you. Try to create as much legwork as possible for your antagonist. Make it too exhausting and time consuming to continue to have an argument with you.

, If your opponent happens to use words incorrectly while arguing, be sure to stop him and point it out. This will not only disrupt his momentum while speaking, but make him feel intellectually inferior as well.

, Be as condescending as possible to make yourself seem superior. For example, you can offer to use smaller words so he can understand you better.


Roll your eyes. Look up and to one side and slowly move your eyes until you see the opposite side of the room. It helps to shake your head slightly while rolling the eyes. This expression will show that you find your opponent ridiculous and stupid.

, Cite movies, television shows, or other completely unrelated figures as authoritative voices.Quoting song lyrics also works great. This method is very difficult to combat as he will first have to figure out whether you are serious or not before he can come up with a response.


For example, if someone is trying to start an argument of American foreign policy, a possible response could be, ""Well, as Billy Joel said, 'We didn't start the fire.'""

, If the argument is over something that is not important, be sure to point out that your antagonist is blowing it out of proportion due to their mean nature. Argumentative people like to act as though every argument is important because it is really just about being right. If you show your opponent how their arguing can be viewed as a fault in their character, it may make them more reluctant to engage you further.

, Forget whatever topic the argument might be about and focus on becoming insulting and rude.For example, if you begin to lose a debate about poverty you could say, ""You should spend less time worrying about poverty and more time figuring out a new hair style."" This kind of attack does nothing for winning the actual argument, but hurling insults can often quiet down and humiliate aggressive opponent. Of course, it could also end up turning into a physical fight, so watch out.

"
"
Stay calm.,
Ask questions.,
Know when to walk away.",How to Annoy Argumentative People3," Argumentative people will often argue out of a desire to see an emotional response from their opponent. Don't show if the interaction is making you upset or angry.


Smile. Show your antagonist you aren't going to let an argument bring you down. Sometimes that's all an angry, argumentative person is looking to do.

, Instead of trying to convince an argumentative person to see things your way, ask them questions to explain their viewpoint. Often this can help you get to root of the argument.For example you can ask ""What is your reasoning behind that idea?"" Aside from not having to justify your own position to your opponent, you are allowing them an opportunity to vent and feel their voice is heard. Many times this will be enough to calm an argumentative person, even if it doesn't resolve the disagreement.

, If you feel a situation is not going to be resolved in a positive manner, just step away from it. You can always pick up the topic again at a later time when you feel it can be discussed in a reasonable manner.

Face the repercussions of being annoying in public.,
Face the repercussions of being annoying to your significant other or friends.,
Face the repercussions of being annoying to your parents.,
Face the repercussions of being annoying to your teacher.",How to Annoy People Around You6," Sure, you might have had a great time annoying people in public places, but that doesn't come without consequences. People in public places expect to be left alone, and may not react the way you expected when you annoy them. Here are some things that could happen:


People on public transportation will be prone to anger. These people have most likely worked or traveled all day and their patience will be worn extremely thin. They can yell at you, report you, or even get violent.
People at sporting events may be especially touchy. If their team loses, or if they've had a lot to drink, they may hurt you and do irreparable damage. Remember that you're playing with fire when you annoy people you don't know.

, While being annoy to people who care about you may be fun if you're in the mood to be a jerk, the people who care about you can quickly give up on you, and you may find yourself completely alone. Here are some other things that may happen:


Your significant other can leave you at any time. Being annoying may not be as much fun if you're rolling solo.
Your friend can stop hanging out with you. You can easily be friend-dumped for being a jerk. Being annoying won't be so much fun if you don't have anyone to annoy.

, Your parents are supposed to love you more than anyone in the world, but they are still only human. They work hard to give you what you need, and if you continue to act bratty and ungrateful, you'll have to face the music. Here are some things that can happen:


Your parents can cut you off. If you annoy them enough, yes, they can really leave you hanging once you reach a certain age--it's their right.
Your parents can stop wanting to spend time with you. As you grow older, they may not want to see you on special occasions or call you up. That will sting.

, You may have fun bugging your teacher, but your teacher can fight back by failing you. Remember that your teacher has power over your grades, which can affect your professional future. Here are some things your teacher can do:


Your teacher can flat-out fail you. This can keep you from moving on to a new grade, or even graduating.
If your behavior is bad enough, your teacher can even have you expelled. Try explaining that to a college admissions officer.

Smile and make eye contact.,
Keep it simple.,
Be sincere in your thanks.,
Write a thank you note or card.,
Avoid delegation.",How to Thank Someone1," If you’re saying 'thank you' in person, remember to smile and make eye contact with the person whom you’re thanking. These small gestures add a massive amount of sincerity to the 'thank you.', Showing your gratitude to someone else is awesome. Gushing over them and falling all over yourself to say 'thank you' is overdoing it, and could end up embarrassing the person you’re trying to thank. Keep your gratitude simple, to the point and pleasant., You should be thanking someone because you honestly and sincerely are grateful for something they did. You shouldn’t be thanking someone because you were told to do it, or because you felt it was somehow required. Insincere gratitude is obvious and unappreciated.This is especially important for those who work in a retail environment where they may feel obligated to thank customers on a regular basis. If you aren’t actually sincere about the thanks, the customer can tell. Even if it’s your job to thank a customer, you can still make it sincere.

, There are certain situations that require more than just an in-person ‘thank you,’ such as being treated to dinner, being giving a present, etc. When these situations occur, a written ‘thank you’ is vital. Whomever treated you to this extra-special kindness deserves the same in return, and writing a 'thank you' note or card is the best way to show how much you really do appreciate what they did.If you decide to use a card, blank ones work best in these situations. Blank cards allow you to write a brief, but custom, note inside.
Whatever form your ‘thank you’ note takes, it should specifically mention the reason you’re saying ‘thank you.’
While emails can obviously be personalized, avoid sending an email in these situations. Emails just aren’t as sincere and well-meaning as an actual note or card.

, Do not ask someone else to send someone a ‘thank you’ on your behalf, do it yourself. It isn’t a sincere ‘thank you’ if it isn’t coming from you directly.If you’re a really busy person who doesn’t have a lot of extra time, have some custom ‘thank you’ cards made for you and keep them handy. Or buy several boxes of blank cards to keep in your desk.

Watch your vocabulary.,
Pay attention to whose story it is.,
Resist shifting the focus to you.,
Keep references to yourself brief.,
Find constructive ways to get your thoughts and opinions heard.",How to Stop Talking About Yourself1," If you're using the words I, me, and my in your conversation, then you may not be having a conversation. You may only be talking about yourself. Actively concentrate on this when you're speaking to others. After all, the only way to stop a behavior is to recognize it.


An exception would be statements such as ""I agree,"" or ""I hear what you're saying,"" or ""I would suggest approaching the issue this way."" Using appropriate ""I"" statements show you're engaged and interested and recognize conversations are a two-way street.
A great way to remember this is to keep a rubber band around your wrist. Every time you catch yourself using any of these words, snap the rubber band. It may hurt a little, but it's a proven psychological method. Start practicing these steps when conversing with friends. Ask them to tell you if you've missed a step, as friends will always be the most supportive.;
, If a person is telling you a story about something that happened to him, remember that it's his story, not yours. Remember, he's sharing something that's important to him.

, This transition to the next phase is natural. After learning not to use ""I,"" ""me,"" and ""mine,"" and instead replace them with ""you"" and ""yours,"" it’s only natural to work on conversational transitions. It’s easy to fall into the trap of shifting focus to yourself.


If your friend's telling you about her new SUV and how it makes her feel safe, don't immediately begin talking about how you prefer a more elegant vehicle and then go off about your Mercedes.
Instead, try saying something like, ""That’s interesting. I prefer the safety, style, and elegance of a sedan. Do you think SUV’s are safer than sedans?"" This shows you're engaged and curious about your friend's opinion.

, Sometimes within the course of the conversation, it’s impossible not to talk about yourself. That's natural, however, you shouldn't be talking about yourself 100% of the time, yet you should be listening 100% of the time. When this happens, try redirecting the conversation away from yourself and putting the subject back on your conversation partner.


For instance, if your friend asks what kind of car you drive, you may say something like: ""I drive a hybrid. It really saves on gas and there are other perks like rebates and no parking meter fees. Have you ever thought about owning one?""
This response keeps your position brief and throws the question back to your friend. In doing so, you’ve made your friend the conversation's gatekeeper.

, It's important to be a good and active listener, but you need to express your own thoughts and opinions, too. If you are trying to lessen talking about yourself, try things like journaling, open mic events, and submitting essays or reports, which may provide the opportunity. This also encourages you to focus thoughtfully on what you want to say, rather than talking just for the sake of it.

Understand when it is inappropriate to laugh.,
Check to see whether or not others are laughing, or at least smiling a lot.",How to Stop Laughing at Inappropriate Times1," They say that ""laughter is the best medicine,"" but if the occasion is a serious one, others may not appreciate your laughter. If you go into a situation knowing that it's not laughable, it'll help you maintain a more serious demeanor. Typical times when it's not okay to laugh include:


At a funeral or during the exchange of vows at a wedding
A crash, injury or death scene
At jokes that demean people
When layoffs are notified around the office.;
, If they aren't, then remind yourself not to laugh unless they do. Or, if you see someone else laughing inappropriately (and everyone else giving that person dirty looks) then get away from them as quickly as possible, because inopportune laughter can be infectious.

Use a ‘thank you’ template.,
Make a list of who you need to thank.,
Write out what you’re thankful for.,
Plan when you send your thanks.",How to Thank Someone2," If you’re struggling with exactly how to say ‘thank you’ to someone, or what to say in a ‘thank you’ card, try using the who, what and when template., Start the ‘thank you’ process by making a list of everyone you need to send a ‘thank you’ card to. For example, if it was your birthday and you received several gifts, write a list of everyone you received a gift from (and what they gave you). This list should also include the names of anyone who helped you plan an event (e.g. birthday party)., There are six basic parts to any personal ‘thank you’ note — the greeting, the expression of thanks, the details, the next time, the restatement, and the regards.The Greeting is simple. Start the ‘thank you’ note with the names of the people you are thanking. If it’s a formal ‘thank you’ note, greet them formally (e.g. Dear Mr. Smith), if it’s family or a close friend, greet them informally (e.g. Hey Mom).

The Expression of Thanks is where you thank whomever for whatever they did. The easiest thing to do is start this part with the words ‘thank you.’ But you can be more creative if you wish (e.g. It made my day when I opened my birthday gift from you).

The Details is where you get specific. Adding specific details about why you’re thanking the person makes the note much more sincere and personal. You might want to mention the specific gift you received, or what you spent gift money on, etc.

The Next Time is where you mention something about the next time you’ll see or speak to this person. For example, if you’re sending a ‘thank you’ note to your grandparents and you’re going to see them shortly at Christmas, mention that.

The Restatement is where you wrap up your ‘thank you’ note with another message of thanks. You can write another sentence (e.g. Thank you again for your generosity, I’m so very much looking forward to college and this money is going to help significantly) or you can simply say ‘thank you’ one more time.

The Regards is similar to the greeting except this time you’re signing your name. Depending on who the thanks is for you may want to be more formal (e.g. Sincerely) or less formal (e.g. With love).

, You should send most ‘thank you’ cards and notes within a month of the event, but sending them sooner is definitely better. If you fall behind you can always start your ‘thank you’ note with an apology for taking longer than anticipated.If you’re sending ’thank you’ cards for a large event with lots of attendees, plan to spend a certain amount of time every day writing ’thank you’ notes until they’re all done.

Be aware of ‘thank you’ etiquette.,
Send wedding ‘thank you’ cards within 3 months.,
Write a ‘thank you’ note for an interview immediately.,
Create a personal ‘thank you’ to the donors of a bursary, grant or scholarship.",How to Thank Someone3," Different occasions and events call for different types of ‘thank you’ etiquette. While there’s no rule that says you must follow these guidelines, they have become tradition. It is typical to send a ‘thank you’ note or card for the following reasons:Receiving any type of gift, including money. The gift may be for your birthday, anniversary, graduation, house warming, holiday, etc.
Attending a dinner party or special occasion (i.e. Thanksgiving) at someone else’s house.

, It is customary to send a handwritten 'thank you' card to anyone who has done one of the following things for your wedding. It is also customary to send the card within 3 months of the event, although it is much easier to keep yourself up-to-date if you send cards when you receive gifts instead of waiting until after the wedding is over.Someone who has sent you a gift for your engagement, wedding shower or wedding, including money.
Someone who was a member of your wedding party (e.g. bridesmaid, maid of honour, flower girl, etc.).
Someone who hosted a party of some kind in your honour (e.g. wedding shower, engagement party, etc.).
Someone who helped you plan or execute your wedding, including the vendors and suppliers who made your wedding a success (e.g. baker, flower arranger, decorator, chef, etc.).
Anyone who went out of their way to help you while you were preparing and planning your wedding (e.g. the neighbour who mowed your lawn, etc.).

, If you have been interviewed for a job, internship, or volunteer position, you should send a ‘thank you’ note or card to the interviewer as soon as possible after the interview is finished.Make sure you personalize the card or note to be specific about the job for which you were interviewed, and even mention something specific from the interview.
Ensure that you’ve spelled everyone’s name properly. There would be nothing worse than sending a ‘thank you’ note after an interview and spelling the interviewer’s name wrong.
Use formal greetings in your ‘thank you’ note unless the interviewer introduced themselves by their first name and insisted you call them that.
In the case of interview ‘thank you’ notes, it is not uncommon to send a personal email rather than an actual card or letter. Logistically this might be the better option if physically getting a card or a note to the interviewer is difficult or might take too long.

, Receiving any type of financial assistance in university or college is awesome. Many of the scholarships and bursaries provided to students come from donations. Whether donated from an individual, family, estate or organization, sending a ‘thank you’ note for providing you with the funds is a great way to show your appreciation.If the scholarship or bursary was awarded via your school, the department who choose the recipients should be able to assist you in obtaining a mailing address for where to send the ‘thank you’ note.
Since these are not people you know personally, keep the ‘thank you’ letter formal and elegant, rather than casual.
Before sending the letter make sure you check (and double-check) that there are no spelling or grammar errors. You may even want someone else to read it over for you in case you’ve missed something.
‘Thank you’ notes like this are best sent via formal business letter on nice paper, as opposed to a handwritten note or card.

Understand what gratitude is.,
Write in a gratitude journal.,
Express gratitude at least 5 times a day.,
Looks for new ways to show your gratitude.,
Teach your children to be grateful.,
Avoid showing gratitude only to those who are nice to you.,
Recognize that gratitude comes with benefits.",How to Thank Someone4," Gratitude is a little different from a simple ‘thank you.’ Gratitude is about being thankful and polite, but it’s also about being courteous, generous, and appreciative. It’s about being concerned for people other than yourself. Expressing our gratitude towards others can help influence a situation positively and even change the behaviour of others., The first step to expressing gratitude towards others is being able to understand what you are truly grateful for. Writing down the things you’re grateful for in a journal is a great way to help yourself understand how you feel about yourself and others. Writing in the journal can take as little as a few minutes a day to list the 3 things you’re grateful about at that moment.You can use the idea of a gratitude journal to help kids develop a better understanding of gratitude and being grateful. Help them write 3 things they’re grateful for every night before bed. If they’re too young to write, have them draw a picture of the things they’re grateful for.

, Challenge yourself to express some form of gratitude 5 times every day. Your gratitude should be expressed towards everyone, not just your family members and close friends. If you think about it, there are a lot of people who help you out every day that probably almost never hear words of gratitude, like bus drivers, receptionists, telemarketers, people who hold the door open, people who give up their seat on the bus, cleaners, etc.When expressing this gratitude, remember to use the person’s name (if you know it), what you’re grateful for and why you’re grateful for it. For example, “Thanks for holding the elevator Sue, I was concerned I’d be late for my meeting, now I’m going to be right on time!""
If there’s a practical reason why you can’t express your gratitude in person, express it in your head or write it down., Gratitude doesn’t only have to be shown the typical way (e.g. saying thank you), it can be much more. Every now and again look for a new way to express your gratitude for someone by doing something you haven’t done before, or haven’t done in a long time.For example: making dinner one night when you notice your partner is exhausted; taking care of your kids one night so your partner can go out with friends; volunteering to be the designated driver; offering to host the family Christmas party one year, etc.

, You probably have memories of your mom or dad reminding your to tell someone ‘thank you’ when they gave you a treat or a candy when you were little. Being thankful or grateful isn’t always the first thing on a kid’s mind, but it’s important for them to learn. The following four step method can work great to teach your kids about gratitude:Tell you kids about gratitude, what it means and why it’s important. Use your own words and give examples.
Demonstrate your gratitude skills for your kids. You can do this as an exercise or in ‘real life.’
Help your kids practice giving gratitude to someone else. If you have more than one kid, have them each give examples and provide feedback to each other.
Don’t stop encouraging your kids to be grateful. Give them positive reinforcement when they’ve done a good job.

, As hard as it may be to do, you need to also show gratitude towards people who might upset you or drive you a little crazy. Remember to be patient when doing this, and avoid sounding like you’re being sarcastic.People who drive you up the wall might have completely different perspectives on some things. While you may not agree or like those perspectives, they’re still valid opinions. Be grateful for the fact that they’ve shared these opinions with you and you’ve learned to look at a situation from a different perspective.
Even if these people drive you crazy, there’s probably still something about them that you admire. They may be annoying, but maybe they’re always punctual or really organized. Focus on these positive aspects when talking to these people.
Consider the fact that dealing with this annoying person is actually teaching you some new skills. Be grateful that you’re learning to be patient and calm in frustrating situations.

, Being grateful and being able to express gratitude can really have an amazing effect on you and those around you. Gratitude is linked to happiness — those who are happier tend to be more grateful. Having someone be grateful towards you can make you feel great. Thinking about what you’re grateful for helps you focus on the positive things in your life, not the negative.Spending time writing down what you’re grateful for right before bed can help you sleep better. Not only do you spend the last few moments before you go to sleep thinking about positive things, but you’re able to get your thoughts out of your head and down on paper.Being grateful tends to make you more empathetic. This may be because grateful people focus on positive emotions instead of negative ones, so they don’t get as upset when someone is mean to them.

"
Practice cooperation instead of competition.,
Look for what you can learn.,
Ask probing questions.,
Show how the world looks through your eyes.",How to Stop Talking About Yourself2," A conversation shouldn’t be a struggle to see who gets to talk about themselves, or does the most talking. Think of it this way: when you were a kid, you took turns on toys or games. A conversation is the same thing. If it’s your friend's turn, let him talk. You'll have your turn, since a conversation is a two-way-street, but allow your friend equal time to talk about himself, giving him your full attention.


Don’t approach it as if trying to convince the person that your idea or way of seeing/doing things is right. Instead, try to learn and grow from what he's saying.
Don't manipulate the conversation to serve your own agenda and steamroll your counterpart.
Consider this approach: you’re on the same team, trying to find an answer. Conversations like sports are more fun when you’re interacting with each other, rather than against each other., There's an old saying, ""you can’t learn anything new if you’re talking."" You already know your perspective. To broaden, change, or confirm that point of view, you must let others state theirs.


For example, when discussing dinner, you might say: ""I prefer ordering tapas to entrees, because I get to taste a variety of the chef’s offerings. Which do you prefer?"" (Then, let them respond.) ""That’s interesting; why do you think that is?""
Obviously your responses would depend on what the person says, but you can continue to probe her reasoning, so that you get a thorough understanding of why she thinks, feels, or believes what she does.

, You can’t talk about yourself if you’re asking well-thought-out questions. It requires the other person to be the focal point. This takes “look for what you can learn, not say,” to an entirely new level. Not only does this keep your conversation partner as the focal point, it allows him to delve more deeply into his knowledge/feelings/beliefs which, in turn, strengthen the connection.
Be in the moment, listening, when he answers your question. Invariably, this will lead to a mindset allowing further questions, resulting in a very positive experience for all involved.

, This may sound like the exact opposite of what you’re trying to learn, but there's a difference between talking about yourself and your world view.


Try stating your opinion, such as ""I see the two-party system as limiting our choices and narrowing the potential for alternative voices and points of view in our political system."" Then follow this with something like: ""How do you see this working in our government?""
Once you’ve put your unique point of view out there, use what you’ve learned in your conversation thus far to get your conversation partner to expound on his viewpoint. Then probe his point of view with questions geared to learn more. This is how to converse about ideas on a higher level.

"
"
Offer credit.,
Compliment other people.,
Engage in the art of listening.,
Try active listening techniques.,
Ask questions.,
Validate what your conversation partner says.",How to Stop Talking About Yourself3," Think of it like a credit card. How happy would the person you’re talking to be if you gave them money for their guidance or opinion? They’d probably feel pretty good about themselves. They’d feel just as good if you gave them the credit.


Thank the person for their recommendation or advice. If your friend recommends a restaurant, tell the people you're with, ""X suggested we come here. Isn't it great?""
Always give credit for success when it's warranted. If you did well on a project at work, you might say something like: ""I have a great team working with me; they make it all happen.""

, It takes selflessness and an ability to recognize the strengths of others to do this. Doing so makes your conversation partner more engaged and feel good about speaking with you, because she knows you'll also be saying good things about her.Some examples of compliments include:


""Doesn’t Gina look stunning in that dress? Just incredible. And, it actually pales in comparison to her wit!""
""I think Evelyn's thoughts on the global warming issue are incredibly insightful and full of potential solutions. Why don’t we go join her? I think you’ll find her fascinating.""

, Listening, really listening, is an art. It requires you to let go of yourself and your thoughts, and focus solely on what the other person is saying. This effort allows you to truly melt away. Your need to talk about yourself dissipates, then disappears.


Make a pact with yourself that you won't speak unless your conversation partner puts the ball in your court. Then make another pact: you'll put the ball right back to her and go back to listening.

, This means fully concentrating on what the other person is saying and requires you respond to the speaker by paraphrasing or restating his main point(s). You can also add a little something when you finish paraphrasing by using different phrases: which means that; so then; that would require; you would then; etc., and then add your thoughts on what happens next.
Non-verbal cues like nodding your head, smiling, and other facial/physical expressions let the other person know you're engaged and have feelings about everything he's saying.., Additional questions that give your conversation partner more time to talk about her subject are also key, and there are several different types, including:Closed questions. These are often “yes or no” questions. They're answered in one way or the other, and the line of questioning stops there.
Open-ended questions. These give your conversation partner ample room to expand on what she's already been talking about and gives you a more well-rounded knowledge of her subject. These questions often start with phrases like: ""How do you see..."" or ""What/why do you think...""

, It depends on the situation and topic you've been talking about. Think of it as either a personal or general validation.You (Personal): ""Wow, it takes a lot of courage to look at yourself so openly and admit things like that.""
You (General): ""That is one of the most insightful analyses of the issue I’ve ever come across.""

If you feel the urge to laugh or say something completely irrelevant, excuse yourself immediately, if possible.,
Think before you laugh.,
Think of something sad and depressing.,
Try pinching yourself or causing some other strong physical sensation, such as biting your inner cheek or your tongue (don't bite too hard!).,
Use your breathing to control the laughter.,
Focus on your mouth to ease the laughter.,
Bite yourself.,
Distract yourself.",How to Stop Laughing at Inappropriate Times2," Feel free to excuse yourself to the restroom and try to stifle your laugh.

, If someone says ""My mother just died,"" your reaction may be to laugh. Not to make fun of the person or act like you do not care about their loss, but the sudden change of subject to something sad is awkward for you, so you feel like laughing or getting out of the conversation. Although you may not notice it, something triggers you to do so. Think first, then react. Listen closely to what the person says. Imagine immediately if you were in their situation. What would you do? Would you want someone laughing at you if your mother died? Listening to the person, then putting yourself in their place will help you realize that it's not something unimportant and funny.

, If you need inspiration, the daily news is usually full of unfortunate events that will suffice to calm you down. Think about something that makes you want to cry. Although this can be unpleasant, it usually takes care of the uncontrollable urge to laugh. If sadness doesn't work, fear is also extremely effective. Think of a scene from a horror movie you just saw or a car accident. This is physically proven to work because the adrenaline (the fear hormone) released from your brain when you have these thoughts will block out the endorphins (the happiness or laughing hormone). It may take some practice to convince yourself enough of the fear, but once you have mastered it, it's very effective.

, Bite each side of your mouth together, so that the edge of your lips aren't rising up to make you smile or laugh. Hold your breath when you are about to laugh. This can act as a distraction, helping you beat the urge to laugh out loud. If you still squeeze out a smile which other people tend to notice, press your lips together so it doesn't look like you're smiling. Sometimes when you hold your breath though, it just squeezes the laugh out even louder or you laugh at yourself, so be cautious.

, Try exhaling as much of the air as possible from your lungs. This removal of the air will not allow the laugh to continue and make it stop. This usually works best when combined with the coughing technique mentioned above. A combination of techniques is often the best!


Close your mouth and breathe heavily through your nose, as if you are laughing, just without opening your mouth. It can be covered up as a cold or something of that nature.







,

Open your mouth wide and let the laughter out silently without smiling; this may look odd but it works.






Push your tongue against the top of your mouth, and at the same time pushing your mouth shut slightly.






Exercise your jaw muscles to relieve any tension and wear out the muscles.







, Do it gently, of course! Here are some biting techniques that may work for you:

Try biting down on your lower lip. Then, laugh all you want without opening your mouth. People will think you are crying and trying to hold it back. Try scrunching up your face, too. But, after you are done, don't just stop. Inhale a few times as if you are hyperventilating.






Bite your tongue and pull your cheeks back or, if you are at a funeral or something serious, hold your hands up to your face, and smile and laugh as much as you want but, try to make the laughing sound like you're crying.






Bite the inside of your cheeks.







, Try a method for thinking about something else, or self calming. Some approaches that may help include:

Count backwards from 10 to 1. If this doesn't work, try again. Even forward counting can help.






Do a multiplication table in your head. This is guaranteed to work, but it may require some practice. In case if you never noticed, when we hear a joke or see something funny, we keep recreating the joke/scene in our minds over and over, and that's why we keep laughing. So the best way to stop laughing is to get the joke out of your head. Doing some mental calculation will, undoubtedly, require all your attention. Just try doing a multiplication, reading a book or thinking about anything else at the same time, you'll see it's impossible. However, if you're trying to hold laughter in a school play or something of that sort, where you still have to think about what to do next, you're going to have to learn not to look down or look distant while you're doing the math, and, also, to start doing the calculations again as soon as you feel like laughing, but without stopping what you're doing.






Try to remember something, anything. Try to remember the names of all your friends and relatives, for instance, or trying to list all the songs of your favorite music album. Whatever uses your brain capacity and takes your attention away from the joke will help.






Use reverse psychology on yourself. By telling yourself something like, ""This is funny! Laugh some more!"", you end up finding that whatever you were laughing at, is not so funny anymore.






Sing a song to yourself and concentrate on the lyrics.

Disguise a smile or laugh with a coughing fit.,
Force yourself to turn your laugh into a cry if the occasion is something sad such as a funeral.,
Pretend to pick your teeth.,
Laugh in a moral way.,
Practice the cover-ups with a friend or close family member.",How to Stop Laughing at Inappropriate Times3," If a grin or chuckle slips through, quickly cover it up by putting your hand over your mouth and coughing. Move away from the crowd, even if it means stepping out of the room or going to the restrooms. If they see you are coughing, they will understand.

, Some people sound like they are laughing before they cry.


If it gets really bad, hold your nose and cover your mouth with that hand. Then people can't see your grin, and you can laugh as hard as you wish inside yourself. You may start shaking, but that's okay, it can be covered as crying. Try not to let any sound out, but if you do ease up by accident, it sounds much like a sneeze or a strange snort.







, Open your mouth wide and pretend to pick away at something stuck. Not only does it totally hide your smile, you also clean your teeth at the same time! Be careful though because the face made is funny enough to make others start laughing when they see what you're up to.

, If your friend just got insulted and the insult is funny, then you know you will have to laugh. What is found most effective is to turn it into a pity laugh. You laugh but without fully smiling, then look to the ground and either mutter under your breath or tut noticeably, then start to shake your head. This works really well!

, Ask them to say things that may cause you to laugh. If you work at it, you can master not laughing and be serious at the right times, yet funny at the right times, as well!

Consider how often you say ""I don't know"".,
Resolve to find a replacement phrase for now.,
Recognize that it is perceived as lazy because it is lazy.,
Listen actively.,
Think about what you're being asked.,
Recant it if it comes out.,
Accept that responding to people with ""I don't know"" is a bad habit and will take some time to break.","How to Stop Saying ""I Don't Know"""," Keep a journal or log of how often you use this phrase. It doesn't have to be elaborate--just somehow mark every time. The back on a notebook, in a notepad, or whatever works for you.


The idea is not to somehow feel terrible about yourself; by knowing how often you do this behavior, you can both become more aware of your words as well as track your successful progress over time.
Remember: focus on awareness of this habit...you do not have to punish yourself in order to break this pattern.;
, Tell yourself that you will not say ""I don't know"" - unless you have listened carefully and really do not know. Instead, try saying something - anything - else.


It might be helpful to come up with several different phrases to say instead, to avoid slipping into making any of the replacement words becoming a habit as well. Some examples include: ""Hmmm."" Or, ""Not sure."" Or, ""Maybe"". Or, ""What do you think?"" Or, ""I would like to hear more about that before I commit to an answer"". In the latter case, asking a question back to the person can cause them to think a little more about what they've said, buying you some thinking time, too!

, The person you're talking to will know instantly that you simply don't want to think about what they've said, or that you're not even interested in talking to them. Once you say ""I dunno,"" you've killed the conversation. Where does the other person go with that? Does s/he explain whatever it is that ""you dunno""? You would find it rude, probably. Just as rude as shutting down the conversation with ""I dunno.""


If you really don't know what to say about the subject, why not say ""I'm not comfortable talking about that right now (you can follow with ""I just don't know enough about it"" or ""I haven't had time to think it through""). Can we talk later or talk about it tomorrow/next time?""

, Instead of thinking about other things, staring off into space, or figuring out what you want to talk about next, try really listening to your conversation partner. Ask a question or two about what s/he's saying - anything is good. Try, ""Is that right?"" when you notice that the other person seems to be waiting for you to say something. In addition, consider asking questions that help you learn. For instance:


""So what do you think about the plot of the movie?"" ""I'm not sure I understand why X chose to do Y. Did you catch that?""
""What do you know about that cutie in Calculus?"" ""Not much..didn't he say he was from Nebraska?""
""Why was Tamara so upset last night?"" ""Did you ask her? She ran right by me!""
""Zack, what did you get for question 3?"" ""I had trouble, Miss Sanchez. I had trouble understanding what Hamlet meant here..."" (You show that you've thought about the work, and your teacher will likely not give you a hard time. Listen close to the sigh of relief from other students around you!

, If you don't have an answer immediately, rather than saying ""I don't know,"" instead, just pause. Think. If you're really flummoxed, beg your conversation partner's pardon by saying something like, ""You know what - I don't think I ever really thought about it until now."" At least this lets your partner know you heard him or her, and that you are actively thinking about the question rather than just automatically popping out with ""I dunno.""

, ""Recant"" means ""take it back"". And don't get flustered over it. If you blurt out the unthinking ""I dunno,"" just immediately say, ""Wait... I think... Let me think about that for a second."" Just take it back. Your conversation partner will be very generous about it, especially if s/he thinks you want to consider whatever it is that s/he was saying. Nothing is better in a conversation than making the other person feel as if you think whatever they're talking about is very important and worth thinking over.

, Don't be too tough on yourself if you find yourself still saying it from time to time. Read wikiHow's article on how to break a habit for more ideas.

Start noticing when you laugh after people's comments, especially the clearly not funny comments.,
Consider how others view your constant laugh, especially given that it comes at the tail-end of their usually ordinary comments.,
Discern between the annoying, nervous laugh and the good, genuine laugh.,
Become more assertive.,
Find constructive ways to cope until you've overcome the habit of laughing at the end of everyone's comments.,
Provide genuine outlets to release your laughter.",How to Stop Laughing After Every Comment," Try to be consciously aware of what the triggers are that cause you to laugh at these inopportune moments. Consider how you feel when it happens – are you feeling nervous, edgy, bored, argumentative, antipathetic to new ideas, uncomfortable or confused? Any negative feelings that bring about the need to laugh are an indicator that the laugh is serving to cover up or stand in for your true feelings. And those feelings will need to be tackled as well as the laughing habit (or compensation for nervousness).



Keep a journal of laughing triggers for a week. Can you see a pattern forming? Do you notice particular triggers?;
, As noted in the introduction, there are different ways that your constant need to laugh after comments may be interpreted by people but eventually it's likely to wear thin and to cause some people to not take you very seriously. In a professional or working environment context, this is a serious outcome because it means that you'll risk being overlooked for promotions, plum roles and possibly even a pay raise. And when it comes to dating and love, nobody likes to hear someone laughing all the time they say something; it soon leads to them wondering if you're taking the relationship seriously and they may call things off. And all these interpretations occur just because you can't stop guffawing at casual comments! Tell yourself that you're definitely worth more than being seen as a lightweight by other people.


A good test is to think about is how the other people in the room will view you if you continue to laugh as they speak. If you are certain that it's fine to join in an obvious funny moment, then enjoy yourself. If they're likely to think that you are weird or out of sync with the situation, then try as hard as you can to control yourself.

, This article isn't about repressing a good sense of humor and all laughter. There are clearly times when it remains both appropriate and tension-relieving to laugh. But it's important to know the difference between the habitual laugh and the real laugh born of genuine humor or happiness. You should know the difference just by feeling – a real laugh results because something is genuinely funny and the laughter leaves you feeling good and happy. The other kind of laugh is a compensatory mechanism aimed at covering up your unease. If you're not sure yet, ask yourself:


Does this laugh make me feel good or am I using it as a crutch to cover up negative feelings? Is something about the situation making me feel uncomfortable or pressured?
Is my laughter infectious or do people look at me awkwardly while waiting for me to stop?

, Uncontrolled habitual laughing at the end of people's comments may be a sign that you feel inferior to other people and that you don't feel able to stand up for your own opinions and preferences. By laughing, there is a desire to seem inoffensive and even comforting to the speaker, as a way to mollify them so that they don't see you as an adversary. However, this will never bring about an enjoyable way of interacting with others and only serves to keep making you feel worse. Instead, learn to stand up for yourself and to be assertive, which is a non-confrontational, non-aggressive and non self-effacing way to interact with others. In learning to assert your needs with others in a fair, considerate and polite way, you will find that you see yourself as equal to every person and the inferiority sense will abate. And with it too, the trigger for the awkward laughter.


Think of witty or thoughtful replies that you could make to people instead of laughing. This might take some effort on your behalf but is well worth the trouble. Read up on the witty responses of people who say what they really want to say but in ways that are polite or clever. Learning some of their one-liners might help you to overcome the feeling of laughing and give you a real sense of finally voicing the things you'd rather say than simply cover up with giggling. If wit isn't your thing, try tactful truthfulness instead so that you can speak your mind without hurting the feelings of the other person.

, It takes time to change a habit, as well as determination but what do you do while you're aware that others are noticing your laughter? As you're working on stopping yourself from laughing after every comment, it's helpful to find some things to do that will cover up your laugh. For example, if you feel the urge coming over you, simply turn away and cover your mouth. Pretend it is a bit of hiccups, a sneeze or that there is a frog in your throat if anyone asks after you. Other ideas include:



Take deep breaths before allowing any sound to come out of your mouth. You can control laughing by deep breathing. This really works. Practice with friends.
Simply smile or nod your head.
Dig your fingernails into the palm of your hand to remind yourself that laughing is a habit that needs to be overcome, not indulged in.
Think of something serious if that works for you. Think of the unfinished in-tray, the dog poop you've yet to scoop off the back lawn or the time your boss threw your work back in your face. Those sorts of thoughts should put a dampener on the giggles.

, It's important that you don't swing to extremes and become dull and overly serious! Find opportune, appropriate moments to thoroughly indulge your laughter. Spend time with happy, funny people cracking jokes, sharing funny stories and watching comedies together. Be prepared to see the lighter side of life all the time but learn to laugh on the inside when it's not appropriate to laugh out loud. Be a ray of sunshine in people's lives reminding them that laughter is a good tonic by being a source of funny things instead of hiding behind other people's comments – there is a world of difference between been a genuinely funny person who has a great sense of timing and a saddened soul with an inferiority complex who laughs out of neediness. Strive to use your real sense of humor to warm the hearts and minds of others and provoke their laughter. It's the best way to keep your laughter and to share it around!

Remember the word can be used effectively in moderation.Any word has its use in the right context.,

Find a speaking role-model.People who have a problem with overusing the word ""dude"" tend to use a lot of filler language as well.,
Control your pace.Most filler language is a result of the person trying to talk too fast.,
Record yourself speaking.Get a voice-recorder or cellphone and record yourself speaking about something.,
Join a public speaking club.A public speaking club (such as Toastmasters) will give you a big head-up with conversation.","How to Stop Saying the Word ""Dude"" So Much"," It's used in film and rock music, and it's a staple word for a lot of subcultures, including skate and surfer communities. Consider what your circumstances are. Do you hang out with a lot of people who use that word? Did you start using it after seeing it on TV? Knowing that use of the word is a habit that was picked up somewhere is a good place to start if you want to control your use.;
, In social situations, people tend to speak without consciously thinking about it. This isn't good if you're saying words you'd rather avoid. If you're in a setting where you think you might call someone ""dude,"" give yourself an extra moment to prepare a line.


The use of ""dude"" is mostly reserved as a name or title. This makes greetings and goodbyes more important to plan for than regular chatting.

, Whenever you use the word, you should repeat the sentence the way you should have in the first place. The extra effort (and mild embarrassment) of repeating a sentence will help to steer you on the right path and make you more aware of its use in conversation.


Acknowledge the issue in mid-sentence if you catch it early: ""Hey dude-- I mean, Jesse, how's it going?""

, Although the word was popularized by TV and pop culture, chances are likely that your habit with this word was influenced by the people you spend time with. A lot of language is picked up through our interactions with friends. Hanging out with a broader spectrum of people (including people outside your age group) will help loosen the influence your go-to social circle has on your language.

, Even on the best of days, we're not always aware of the things we say. It's helpful to have the friend (or whomever) you're with to catch you if you ever say the word ""dude."" Asking someone to help you to stop saying something brings up a level of accountability. Your friend will feel a certain level of responsibility in making sure you stay true to your word.


Because the word ""dude"" is a mostly American phenomenon, moving to another country can help remove this influence.

, ""Dude"" on its own isn't a bad thing to call someone per se, but it does get irritating when it's used a lot. Calling someone a dude should feel edgy and casual. You should use the word when the situation calls for an effect like that.


Calling someone ""dude"" is more fitting if the person is a male. Although it's sometimes used to refer to anyone, it is technically a gendered term.
If you're having a hard time gauging how much is too much, limit your ""dude"" usage to once an hour. This should free up enough space in between for the word to regain its value.

, As with anything, your progress isn't going to happen overnight. Depending on how bad your ""dude"" usage is, it can take weeks of effort to limit yourself properly. If you ever say the word accidentally, don't beat yourself up over it. You should take solace in the fact that you're going out of your way to improve yourself. Bad habits are hard to break, but it's get easier the longer you try.

, Words like ""um,"" ""hmm,"" ""uhh"" and ""like"" are thoughtlessly added to a conversation as a way for the brain to catch up with what the mouth is saying. Looking up speeches of great speakers (such as Orson Welles or Barack Obama) will give you an idea of what good speaking looks like.


You don't need to base your speech around a speaking role-model. Just be aware of the pace and confidence with which they say things.

, This can be avoided by simply slowing down the rate at which you speak. If you've never put any thought into how fast you talk, this will feel awkward at first. However, you'll probably be surprised by the way a little extra patience can transform the way you talk.


People who talk more slowly actually tend to appear more intelligent.

, Record a few minutes of an impromptu conversation. After you've recorded something, play out the recording and listen to yourself. Are there any things you notice about your voice that you'd like to see changed? How much filler language is popping up? Being aware of the way other people hear your voice will give you extra motivation to cut down on filler.

, In these clubs, people will get together and practice speaking formally. If you get into something like this, you'll cut down on the excess filler. If you're worried about using the word ""dude"" in conversation, you can bring this up with the club and they'll be sure to guide you through it.

State the observations that are leading you to feel the need to say something.,
State the feeling that the observation is triggering in you.,
State the need that is the cause of that feeling.,
Make a concrete request for action to meet the need just identified.",How to Practice Nonviolent Communication1," These should be purely factual observations, with no component of judgment or evaluation. People often disagree about evaluations because they value things differently, but directly observable facts provide a common ground for communication. For example,


""It's 2:00 a.m. and I hear your stereo playing"" states an observed fact, while ""It's way too late to be making such an awful racket"" makes an evaluation.
""I just looked in the refrigerator and saw that there's no food, and I'm thinking that you didn't go grocery shopping"" states an observed fact (with an inference explicitly stated), while ""You wasted the whole day"" makes an evaluation.;
, Or, guess what the other person is feeling, and ask. Naming the emotion, without moral judgment, enables you to connect in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation. Perform this step with the aim of accurately identifying the feeling that you or the other person are experiencing in that moment, not with the aim of shaming them for their feeling or otherwise trying to prevent them from feeling as they do. Feelings are sometimes hard to put into words.For example, ""There's half an hour to go before the show starts, and I see that you're pacing (observation). Are you nervous?""
""I see your dog running around without a leash and barking (observation). I'm scared.""

, Or, guess the need that caused the feeling in the other person, and ask. When our needs are met, we have happy, pleasant feelings; when they are not met, we have unpleasant feelings. By tuning into the feeling, you can often find the underlying need. Stating the need, without morally judging it, gives you both clarity about what is alive in you or the other person in that moment.


For example, ""I see you looking away while I'm talking, and you've been speaking so quietly, I can't hear you (observation). Please speak up so I can understand.

""I'm feeling uncomfortable (feeling) because I'm needing connection right now. Is now a good time to hang out?""
""I saw that your name wasn't mentioned in the acknowledgments. Are you feeling resentful because you're not getting the appreciation you need?""
Note that ""needs"" have a special meaning in NVC:they are common to all people and not tied to any particular circumstance or strategy for fulfilling them. So, wanting to go to a movie with someone is not a need and a desire to spend time with a specific person is not a need. The need in that case might be companionship. You can meet your need for companionship in many ways, not just with that specific person and not just by going to a movie., Ask clearly and specifically for what you want right now, rather than hinting or stating only what you don't want. For the request to really be a request—and not a demand—allow the other person to say no or propose an alternative. You take responsibility for getting your own needs met, and you let them take responsibility for theirs.


""I notice that you haven't spoken in the last ten minutes (observation). Are you feeling bored? (feeling)"" If the answer is yes, you might bring up your own feeling and propose an action: ""Well, I'm bored, too. Hey, how would you like to go to the Exploratorium?"" or perhaps, ""I'm finding these people really interesting to talk with. How about we meet up in an hour when I'm done here?""

Keep conversing.","How to Start a Conversation with Someone on the Train, Bus or Subway"," Everyone is just trying to get from point A to point B, and they may get off the bus, train, or subway at the next stop. Thus you can't hesitate if you're going to talk to someone. Keep in mind that few people actually want to talk to strangers on their trip, but some will, especially if you seem nice and interesting. Be decisive, but don't be aggressive.;
, Bring some reading material that you can pretend to read. It will make you feel and appear more comfortable. Don't wear headphones unless you want to appear unapproachable.

, OK, so someone has caught your eye. Before you try to initiate a conversation, make sure they're not with their significant other. If they're with anyone at all, proceed with caution, but remember, their companion may just be a friend or relative, or he or she may be a complete stranger who has the same idea that you do.

, If you see the person while at the bus stop or train station, wait until he or she gets on the bus or train before trying to converse. Follow them in discreetly and sit opposite them if possible. You'll have a good chance to make eye contact this way, and besides, you might appear somewhat invasive if you sit down next to them. If they're standing, stand near enough to them to be able to speak with them, but don't get too close for comfort.

, Making brief eye contact can show the person that you're interested and help you gauge whether he or she is interested in you. Glance at the person (don't stare) and try to hold their gaze for just a second or two. Don't look away before she does! This shows confidence. Try to make eye contact again after about 30 seconds. If the person makes eye contact with you again, they probably find you attractive. Don't be too obvious, but make sure the person can see that you're looking at them. If they can't see you, you can't expect them to make eye contact.

, A small, but genuine smile makes you appear interested, friendly, and approachable. If the other person smiles back, you're probably in luck.

, Don't cross your arms or turn away from the person. Make yourself appear open and comfortable, and exhibit good (but not freakishly good) posture. Don't look at your watch or a clock constantly, as it will give the impression that you are in a hurry and the person might not talk to you, because they don't want to bother you.

, If he or she exhibits open body language toward you, that's a great sign. If the person turns away or buries his or her head in a book, that's not so good.

, A question is a great way to start a conversation, but not just any question will do. Ask an open-ended question that requires more than a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. For example, ask, ""How do you get to the Eiffel Tower?"" instead of ""Does this bus stop at the Eiffel Tower?"" What you ask isn't really important, as long as it's not invasive, insulting or insane, e.g. the Eiffel Tower questions might seem dumb in New York.

, Listen attentively to the person's response to your question and then just make small talk. If the person is interested in you, the conversation will probably flow fairly naturally (unless he or she is shy) and you may be able to get a phone number or email address. Then casually be the first to leave. This will establish a self confidence in both of your minds. If the person isn't interested, you'll probably be able to tell pretty quickly.

Make sure a person is open to nonviolent communication.,
Recognize that no one is responsible for someone else's feelings.,
Be aware that nonviolent communication can be abused.,
Recognize that some people may not care about your feelings.",How to Practice Nonviolent Communication2," NVC uses a type of emotional intimacy that not all people are comfortable with all the time, and they have the right to set boundaries. If someone is not open to expressing their feelings, do not push or manipulate them into doing so.Do not start psychoanalyzing someone without their consent.If at any time someone no longer wants to talk about their feelings, they have the right to do so and can leave the conversation.
People with intellectual and developmental disabilities, especially when stressed, may have trouble speaking in and interpreting NVC style. If this is the case, use clear and direct communication., You are not required to change your actions just because someone else doesn't like them. If someone is asking you to bend over backwards or ignore your own wants and needs, you are allowed to say no.


If someone is behaving aggressively, you can ask yourself what they need. However, this can be emotionally draining work, and it is okay to avoid them and say ""their negativity is not my problem.""
People are not obligated to cater to your feelings. If someone says no to your request, avoid getting angry or guilt-tripping them.

, People may use NVC to hurt others, and it is important to be able to recognize when this happens. Sometimes you don't need to meet someone's ""needs."" It's important to remember that tone is less important than what the person has to say, and some feelings should not be shared.


Abusers can use NVC to control others. For example, ""I feel disrespected when you don't check in with me every 15 minutes.""Criticism of tone can be used to derail a conversation about someone's needs (e.g. ""I feel hurt when you say you're upset with me"" or ""I feel attacked when you use that tone"").People have a right to be heard, even if they can't say things in a way that will please everyone.
No one should be forced to listen to deeply negative feelings about them. For example, it is not appropriate for a parent to tell their autistic child how horrible it is to put up with them, or for someone to tell a Muslim that they feel all Muslims should be deported.Some ways of expressing feelings can be abusive.

, Saying ""I feel humiliated when you make fun of me in front of my peers"" isn't going to do anything if the other person doesn't care how you feel. Nonviolent communication can work wonders when people are accidentally hurting each other, but not when it is done on purpose, or when one party doesn't care whether they are hurting someone or not.In these cases, it's better to be clear by saying ""stop it,"" ""leave me alone,"" or ""that hurts.""


Sometimes, if someone is upset with you, it isn't because you are doing something wrong. If one person is attacking another, both sides are not equally valid.
Placing value judgments like ""she is being mean"" or ""this is unfair and not my fault"" is sometimes necessary, especially for abuse victims, oppressed people, bullying victims, and other people who need to protect themselves from others."
"
Decide upon the solution together, if possible.,
Listen closely to what the other person says.,
Take a break if one or both parties are too stressed to handle the conversation.",How to Practice Nonviolent Communication3," When you do something together, you want it to be because you both voluntarily consent to it, as a way of fulfilling your own genuine needs and desires, not out of guilt or pressure. Sometimes you can find an action that meets both your needs, and sometimes you just have to amiably go your separate ways. If you're not ready to ask in this spirit, that's OK, you probably just need some more empathy yourself.

, Don't assume that you know how they feel or what is best for them. Instead, let them express their thoughts and feelings. Validate their feelings, slow down to ensure they feel heard, and make it clear that you care.


If you spend too much time labeling their needs, they might feel like you are trying to play therapist instead of actually hearing what they have to say. Put the focus on what they are telling you, not on what you have decided they ""actually"" mean.

, If you're getting too upset to speak thoughtfully and clearly, the other person is unwilling to talk openly, or either one of you wants to end the conversation, stop. You can have it at a better time, when both parties are willing and able.


If conversations consistently end badly with someone, take a close look at the situation, because there may be a deeper problem.

, Most people love to talk about themselves; it's your place as the conversation starter to get them going. An open question requires an explanation for an answer rather than just a simple yes or no. Open questions tend to begin with who, when, what, why, where, and how, whereas closed questions tend to start with do, have, and is/am/are.


Closed questions: ""Do you like books?"", ""Have you ever been to this university?"", ""Is spring your favorite season?"", ""Am I intruding?"", and ""Do you come here often?""
Open questions: ""What sort of books do you like?"", ""What did you study here at this university?"", ""Which is your favorite season? Why?"", ""What are you doing right now?"", and ""Where's your usual watering hole?""

, Since either one of these might be awkward or out-of-place on its own, combine them for maximum effect. For example:


""That's a nice handbag, where did you get it?"" This lets the handbag owner talk about the day that they went shopping and all this funny stuff happened, as opposed to: ""I like your handbag!"" ""Thank you."" (The end.)
""What an amazing buffet! Which is your favorite dish?"" Asking an opinion is especially useful, as it can be followed up with the classic open-ended question: “Why?”
""Fantastic turnout! Which of the lecturers is your favorite?""
""I love your costume. What are your favorite sci-fi movies?""

, Animals are often common ground with people you have nothing else in common with. If you like animals in general, it's easy to relate to other animal lovers whether they prefer dogs, horses, birds, cats or wildlife. While talking about your own pet might be annoying to some people, asking them about their pets is a great way to get people to open up and start having fun.

, Chances are they'll know about it too and if they don't then that's a good thing to talk about! Read or watch the news and when you're ready to start a conversation with someone, say something like, ""Hey, did you hear about that helicopter crash? That was pretty crazy.""

, If you know the person, review a mental list of topics you’ve discussed previously and continue on one of them.  For example, their kid’s milestone, one of their projects, or some bad news that they shared with you. This not only gives you something to talk about, but it also shows that you pay attention when you talk to them and you care about their problems and experiences enough to think about and remember them.

, Some questions are a little harder to answer than others.  Has someone ever asked you your weekend plans and you thought, ""I don't want to think about my weekend plans... do I really have to answer that?""  Most people prefer easy questions, like ""what are you up to today,"" or ""is school killing you these days?"" This should make conversations flow better and feel more comfortable.

, Keep your questions non-invasive. Be sure you're not asking them questions about topics they'd rather not discuss. For example, some people might be very uncomfortable discussing issues that they feel touch on them personally, such as weight, lack of having a degree or qualifications, lack of having a steady date, etc. Try to be as thoughtful as possible even though you don't really know them yet.

, When you suddenly feel that you're not able to engage in conversation with another person, it's likely that you're telling yourself a few negative things, such as worrying that you're boring, not good enough, too unimportant, intruding, wasting their time, etc. This can leave you feeling tongue-tied. Feeling self-conscious when carrying on conversation with others is not unusual but it's also not productive.


Relax. Chances are that whatever small-talk you're making isn't going to stick out in anyone's mind a few months from now. Just say whatever comes into your head, so long as it's not offensive or really weird (unless, of course, the person you're attempting to converse with is into weird stuff).
Try to keep in mind that everyone has these self-doubts from time to time but that it's essential to overcome them in order to engage with fellow human beings. Reassure yourself that the other person is not judging you. Even if they are, it's unlikely to have any real impact on your life, so just relax.

, If you don’t know the person, breaking the ice is very simple: look approachable, tell the new person your name, offer your hand to shake, and smile. This is not only polite but it also is a good way to start a conversation. Sometimes introductions might be saved until after a conversation is started, however.

, This keeps the conversation light and simple, which is especially useful for people who are still getting to know one another better. Use small talk to establish rapport and similarities rather than set each other up for an opinionated argument.


Small talk encompasses such topics as your blog or website, the purchase of a new car, house renovations, your kids' artwork prize, vacation plans, your newly planted garden, a good book you've just read, etc.
Small talk is not politics, religion, nuclear disarmament or fusion, or criticizing anybody, especially not the host or the event you're both attending.
Although talking about the weather is a cliché, if there's something unusual about the weather, you've got a great topic of conversation.

, Once your partner-in-conversation has started talking, follow his or her cue to keep the conversation going smoothly. Use active listening to reflect what they're saying and to summarize their possible feelings.


Answer questions when they ask, ask them questions about what they're talking about, change topics when there is a pause in the conversation, and make sure they get the chance to talk at least as much (if not more than) you.

, Not only does it help you to remember them but it's a warming sign of respect and will make them feel more comfortable. It shows a more personal approach and makes the conversation feel more real and intimate. Once every other conversation ""turn"" and at least once per conversation is a good rule of thumb.

, You don't even have to say things a lot of the time; you can nod, say “ah-ha” or “wow’ or “oh” or “hmm,’ sigh, grunt convivially, and give short encouraging statements such as ""Is that so?"" and ""Goodness!"", and ""What did you do/say then?"" and ""That's amazing!"", etc.

, Nod in agreement, make occasional genuine eye contact without staring, and lean in toward the other person. Place your hand on your heart now and then, and even touch them on the upper arm if you're a touchy-feely person. This makes people feel more at ease and leads to more natural conversations.


Keep a reasonable bubble of personal space if the person you're talking to is a stranger or someone that you don't know well.

, Stay interested in the other person and focused on them. Keep your curiosity piqued rather than withdrawing back into yourself. This is important for keeping conversations comfortable and finding new ways to continue the conversation. It may even lead you to find openers for future conversations with the same person, as you can ask for an update on some aspect of their life that they're talking about now if you pay attention the first time around!

, Smile and laugh when the other person makes a funny comment or a joke. Don’t force laughter, as this is cringe-inducing; smile and nod instead or smile, shake your head, and look down.

, You may feel a little clumsy at first, but with practice it can become easy to start good conversations. Every time you're in a situation where you're called upon to converse with others, see it as part of your ongoing practice, and note how you're improving each time that you try it.

, If he or she appears interested, then continue. If he or she is looking at a clock or watch, or worse, looking for an escape strategy, then you've been going on for too long. It's important to try to follow their cues in order to make conversations as pleasant as possible and to leave them feeling like they'd want to talk with you again.


This can sometimes feel like a hard skill to learn, but just practice. It's really the only way to improve.

, These are words such as ""see"", ""imagine"", ""feel"", ""tell"", ""sense"", etc., which encourage the other person to keep painting a descriptive picture as part of their conversation. This can make conversations more engaging and will also leave an impact on your conversation partner. For example:


Where do you see yourself in a year's time?
What's your sense of the current stock market fluctuations?
How do you feel about the new plans for renovating downtown?

, As the person who started the conversation, the responsibility initially rests with you to maintain the momentum. So what happens when the other person starts practicing active listening and open questions back on you? You have several options:


Relish it as their cue to let you start talking about yourself. Just don't overdo it; remember to keep engaging them back with open questions and active listening at the end of your own recounting.
Deflect it if you'd rather not be the center of conversation attention. Say something like: ""Well, I like Harry Potter books, and I especially loved the last one. But you don't want to hear about me all night! What were your favorite moments in the Harry Potter series?""
Answer questions with a question. For example, ""How did you manage to get away so early?"" could be responded to with, ""Well, how did you?"" Often the other person will be so intent on filling you in on their side of the story that they'll forget they asked you the question first!

, Pauses can be used to change topics, re-energize the conversation, or even to take a short breather. Letting a pause hang is the only time you should worry about silence in a conversation. As long as you move naturally to the next subject or excuse yourself from the conversation, then it's fine and you shouldn't stress.

, Respond respectfully to someone who remains awkward or uncomfortable in your presence. If your conversation partner appears withdrawn and uninterested in sharing information with you, don't persist too much. Try a little more before making a decision to move on.


Don't ask too many questions if your conversation partner continues to appear unresponsive.

, A great entry into starting a conversation is to mention you can only talk briefly as you're meeting up with other friends or have a meeting to get to. This relieves your partner of a feeling of being trapped or obligated, and gives you both an easy out if things don't progress well. If the conversation does progress well, you can always delay leaving your partner for as long as you like.


Remember not to overdo it, because they might think that you don't want to talk to them, but prefer to be with your friends. Just use this trick once or twice.

No matter how witty you are, launching into a conversation with a humorous story or a joke can come across as overbearing.Practice the ""Observe-Ask-Reveal"" method of being a conversationalist.Begin by making it clear that you're interested in conversation. In social situations, its important to look approachable by giving nonverbal cues, such as adopting open body language and smiling.Get a conversation going by engaging in strategic small talk. Every conversation needs to start somewhere. Begin with innocuous questions or comments about things around you to get a conversation going. Are you outside? What's the weather like? Are you at a party? What kind of food is being served? If you're speaking to a stranger, pivot from small talk to personal introductions and let the conversation develop from there.;
, In order to know what the person you’re talking to will find amusing, you need to know more about them.


Most people are happy to talk about themselves, provided you give them the opportunity. Avoid ""yes"" or ""no"" questions. Instead, keep them open-ended. For example, when someone tells you their occupation, ask their favorite part of their job. When in doubt, ask ""Why?""Let your conversation partner know you're genuinely interested in what they have to say by maintaining eye contact and subtle interjections like ""Really?"" ""Yeah?"" and ""Uh huh.""Avoid interrupting your conversation partner, even if you think of something to say.

, Too often, if you’re trying too hard to be witty, you’ll neglect to listen, because you’re trying to think of your next comment.In order to be witty, though, you need to pay close attention to what your conversation partner is saying. Listen attentively to your conversation partner's words.Don't interrupt. Even if something your conversation partner says sparks an idea for a comment, don't speak until there's a natural break in the conversation. Even the best comments, if made in the form of an interruption, can come across as rude.Note the rhythm of the conversation. Witty banter depends on timing. Listen closely to understand your conversation partner’s speech patterns so that you’ll know when to jump in with a comment. If you miss the moment, an otherwise witty rejoinder will fall flat.

, Once you know more about your conversation partner, you can begin to decide what you have in common and what might be the best mutual topic of conversation.


Think of amusing experiences you’ve had that relate to your conversation partner's interests. At the appropriate time, bring your experiences into the conversation.Sometimes, all it takes is one experience. For example, if the person you’re talking to enjoys fishing but you’ve only been fishing once, think about what novice mistakes you made that your conversation partner might find amusing.
Know your audience. British author Somerset Maugham once said “quotation…is a serviceable substitute for wit.”Indeed, cultural references — from books, songs, films, television, politics, etc. — can provide a shortcut to wit. However, in order to ensure your references don’t fall flat, you need to know your audience.
For example, if you’re talking to a Baby Boomer, inserting a Beatles lyric into the conversation likely will be more effective than referencing a Taylor Swift song.

, Everyone enjoys a funny story. But it's hard to elicit laughs from a meandering or vague anecdote. Instead, you should strive to have several crisp, well-worded stories ready to tell at parties and other social events.


Think of the most amusing or odd stories from your life. These should be your go-to stories in conversations.
Consider the likely audience for your anecdotes. If your goal is to see witty in conversations at an accounting convention, stories related to accounting might be appropriate. However, if you’re looking for witty stories you can tell anywhere, nes involving common experiences, such as school or parents or pets or children, are best, since more people will be able to relate to them.

, The same basic story can either be confusing, boring, or gut-busting. In order to make sure your story brings the laughs, you’ll need to polish it.


To get an idea of what makes a story funny, study the humorous phrasing and selective exaggeration employed by autobiographical humorists like David Sedaris.Begin outlining your story. Try to remember details. Revise your anecdote crisp, clear, and humorous. Then work on memorizing and fine-tuning your verbal delivery so that it comes across as funny in person as it does on the page.

, If other people join the conversation, feel free to make fun of them.

Make fun of celebrities, singers or politicians. Just make sure that the other person is not a great fan of the celebrity your choosing to pick on.
Don't go over the top. Don't make fun of someone's appearance, family situations, sexuality or disabilities (if any) unless you know it is something they are quite open about. Even then, even though they make self-deprecating jokes, they might not want to hear it from other people.

, Few things come across as wittier in a conversation than clever wordplay. Even if wordplay doesn't come naturally to you, you can improve with practice.


Know your vocabulary. Most wordplay depends on having a wide vocabulary. Consider vocabulary-building books, smartphone apps, and games, like crossword puzzles, to improve your command of words.Know the types of wordplay. Spoonerisms (“It's roaring with pain” instead of “It's pouring with rain”), malapropisms (“dance a flamingo” instead of “dance a flamenco”), puns (“She had a photographic memory but never developed it”), and portmanteaus (“Chrismukkah,” a combination of “Christmas” and “Hanukkah”) can all be wittily inserted into conversation if used well.Study examples of good wordplay. Everyone from Shakespeare to George Carlin to Kanye West employs wordplay in their writing and performances. Keeping your audience in mind, consume examples of good wordplay to help you understand how to employ it yourself.

, People often want to be witty because they think they aren’t good conversationalists. But insecurity is the enemy of wit.


Good delivery often is the difference between a comment eliciting a laugh and falling flat. If you seem nervous or timid, your witty comment will not come across as well.It’s important to remember that your perception of yourself is often inaccurate. You’re probably not as awkward as you imagine, and by letting yourself feel insecure, you’re actually hampering your ability to be witty., Paradoxically, the only way to overcome insecurity in conversation is to have more conversations!


The key is engaging in low-stakes interactions (banter with a barista while you're waiting for your latte) as often as possible so that in high-stakes conversations (talking with the coworker you'd like to ask out) you're able to be witty.

, If face-to-face interactions make you nervous, try practicing your stories, puns, and other newly developed wit skills on social networking websites.


Giving yourself a chance to work on your wit when you have more time to think might help you build your confidence so that you can be more relaxed during in-person interactions.

, As you become more confident, you’ll not only be able to move on when an attempt at wit falls flat, you’ll also know when to stop trying to be witty.


Shakespeare said “Brevity is the soul of wit.”Once you believe you’re witty, you won’t feel the need to try to make every comment witty — an effort that is bound to annoy or bore your conversation partner.
Likewise, as you gain more confidence in your wit, you’ll learn when to quit. It’s always best to end a conversation on a high note.

Make sure to listen.,

Allow silences to happen naturally.,
Be aware of your body language.,
Watch the other person's body language.,
Introduce a new topic to smooth over silences.,
Apologize if you make others uncomfortable.,
Make sure you're letting the other person talk.,

Ask questions.,
Encourage the other person to share more about something.",How to Keep Awkwardness out of a Conversation," If you're shy and nervous by nature, you may end up not listening in conversations. This is not necessarily because you're intentionally being rude. You may simply be hung up on what you'll say next. To prevent awkwardness, do not worry about how to respond when someone else is talking. Simply focus on the speaker.Practice active listening. This means maintaining eye contact at all times and smiling and nodding when appropriate. You should also give verbal cues, such as saying, ""I see"" on occasion.
If you're unsure how to respond to something, listening can help. You can ask a question regarding what the speaker just said. For example, ""That sounds like an interesting career path. Can you tell me more?"";
, Compliments can prevent a conversation from getting awkward. Compliments can help a conversation maintain a positive feel, making the other person feel comfortable with you. This can prevent awkwardness from arising.Make sure to keep your compliments honest. People can usually detect when your'e not being genuine, and may feel uncomfortable and annoyed. You should also avoid vague compliments (i.e., ""Oh, that's cool."") as these also may come off as disingenuous.
When you think of something positive to say, say it. Allow compliments to occur organically. For example, ""Wow, teaching sounds so hard. I really admire how much work you put into your career.""

, Silences are a normal part of any conversation. If there's a temporary pause, do not panic and immediately try to fill the void. This is likely to turn the situation awkward. You also may say the wrong thing if you get nervous immediately after things get quiet. Instead, allow silence for a few seconds.Remember a conversation pause is natural. The other person may feel slightly awkward as well, so take comfort in the fact you're not alone. Try to accept things may be quiet for a few moments.
Think of a new topic to introduce that you're genuinely interested in. If you immediately start talking about something you don't care about to fill the void, this will only make the situation more uncomfortable for everyone. Give yourself a few moments to think of something to say that will carry the conversation forward in a meaningful manner.

, Good body language can lead to a smooth conversation. If you're awkward by nature, you may accidentally send body language cues that make another person feel you're uncomfortable. Work on being aware of how you're carrying yourself and strive for open body language.Do not slouch or look away from the other person. Always stand up straight and face the person head on.
Maintain eye contact most of the time. Look away on occasion, however, as too much eye contact can come off as intimidating.

, You want to make sure you do not talk too much or introduce the wrong topic. You can tell if someone's uncomfortable or bored by their body language. If someone is sending non-verbal cues indicating they're not enjoying the conversation, switch gears to avoid awkwardness.Someone may fold their arms if something you said made them feel defensive. If you, say, express a political belief, folded arms could indicate the person does not agree.
Watch eye contact. If someone breaks eye contact, they may have lost interest in what you're saying.
If someone's tone gets louder, you may have said something that's making them emotional. You may want to introduce a less emotionally charged subject to the conversation.

, When silences do occur, allow a few seconds to pass naturally. Then, introduce a new topic to keep things going. Pause and think about new material you can bring into the conversation.You can return to a previous topic. For example, ""So, you said you teach college classes?"" You can also introduce a new subject altogether. You can make conversation by looking to things in the room or drawing on topics from the outside world. For example, ""I can't believe it's going to snow this week. It's March already.""
It may help to have a few topics on hand that you use to continue a conversation. Before a social event, for example, make a mental list of conversation starters.

, Sometimes, despite your best effort, a comment may be ill-conceived. If you say something that halts the conversation, offer an apology and continue onward. Everyone slips up sometimes, so try not to let yourself get too hung up on a comment that did not go over well.Don't make a big deal out of a poorly timed comment. Try to laugh it off. Say something like, ""Sorry. That sounded better in my head.""
Other people feel awkward as well over a strange or inappropriate comment. They will feel more at ease seeing you're able to laugh at yourself.

, If you're nervous by nature, you may have a tendency to accidentally talk over someone. Try to avoid doing this. During conversations, make a point of pausing on occasion and letting others talk.Make a point of consciously pausing after every sentence. Give the other person a chance to respond.
Avoid talking over people. Make sure someone has finished a sentence before interjecting.

, Conversations come to a natural end. If you seem to have exhausted all topics, it's okay to wrap up the conversation. It can be awkward, however, to know how to end things. Find a natural way to excuse yourself. For example, if you're at a bar, say something like, ""I'm going to grab another drink.""
You can also join another conversation. For example, say something like, ""Do you want to come meet some of my friends?"" Integrate the person you're talking to into an existing conversation.

, People are drawn to those with similar interests. If you want to keep a conversation going without awkward pauses, look for common ground.If the speaker mentions something you're also interested in, make that the focus of the conversation. If you both, say, have an interest in horror movies, strike up a discussion about this.
You should also strive to subtly mimic someone's body language. The speaker will unconsciously think of you as similar to them if you have the same mannerisms. This will make them want to continue the conversation.

, If there's a lull in conversation, you can always ask questions. People love talking about themselves and a conversation will almost never go stale if you're moving things forward with questions. For example, say something like, ""So, what kind of hobbies do you do?"" or ""What brought you to this city?"", People will be flattered and encouraged if you seem interested in what they're saying. If you can't think of way to move the conversation forward, ask the person more about what they just said. For example, ""So, how did you get into skiing anyway?"""
"
Perfect your timing.,
Comment on your surroundings.,
Remember people.,
Offer a compliment.",How to Have a Great Conversation1," Timing is key to starting a great conversation. No one likes to be interrupted if they are busy or preoccupied. When you are trying to start a conversation, keep in mind that timing is key. If you need to have an important conversation with your boss, for example, try scheduling time in advance to talk. This will ensure that you both have the time to devote to having a productive conversation.Timing is also important for impromptu conversations. Maybe you have been looking for a way to meet your new neighbor. You probably don't want to strike up a conversation if they are entering the building soaked with rain, looking exhausted, and carrying a bag of take-out food. At this point, a simple, ""Hi, how are you?"" will suffice. You can save getting to know one another for a better time.
If someone is making eye contact with you, it might be a good time to strike up a conversation. For instance, if you are browsing in a bookstore and the person next to you glances over frequently to see which book you are considering, try talking to her. You could say, ""This one looks interesting. Do you like biographies?""
If you want to talk to your husband about adopting a new puppy, make sure to approach him at a good time. If you know he's not a morning person, don't bring up the subject before he has had his coffee and a chance to wake up.;
, Having spur of the moment conversations is an excellent way to improve your skills as a conversationalist. Take some time each day to try to start a conversation with someone you encounter in your everyday life. For example, you could try talking to the person in line behind you at your local coffee shop. Make a comment or ask a question about your surroundings. This will seem natural and is a great way to start talking.Try saying, ""I love the coffee here. What's your favorite roast?"". This shows that you are interested in talking and you are beginning the conversation in a completely natural way.
Strike a positive tone. Offering a cheerful comment is usually more effective than saying something negative. You could say something like, ""Isn't this weather great? I love when it's cool enough to wear sweaters.""

, Many of us encounter a very large number of people each day. Whether you work for a large company, or simply see a lot of people in your neighborhood or at your child's school, it can be difficult to put the right face with the right name. However, research shows that making a point to not only remember people's names, but to call them by name can help increase the personal connection between you.When you first learn someone's name, repeat it in conversation. When someone says, ""Hi, I'm Emily"", you should say, ""It's nice to meet you, Emily."" The immediate repetition will help you imprint the name in your memory.

, Saying something nice is a great ice-breaker. Most people respond positively when you offer them a compliment. Try to choose something specific to comment on, and make sure that you are being sincere. Your tone of voice and facial expressions often convey your thoughts, so make sure you are being honest in the compliment.Try saying something encouraging to a co-worker whom you would like to know better. You could offer a statement such as, ""I really admire the way you delivered that presentation. Could you give me some tips on how to organize an effective pitch?""
This type of statement not only starts the conversation on a positive note, but you are opening the door for follow-up.

"
Ask good questions.,
Practice being an active listener.,
Be genuine.,
Find common ground.,
Stay current on the news.,
Monitor your body language.,
Avoid over-sharing.",How to Have a Great Conversation2," It takes at least two people to have a great conversation. Make sure to do your part and actively participate in the discussion. One of the best ways to do this is to ask questions that will allow the discussion to develop naturally.Ask open-ended questions. Instead of saying, ""It's a nice day, isn't it?"" Say, ""How are you planning to enjoy this beautiful weather?"". The first example only requires a yes or no answer, which could be a dead end for the conversation. Ask questions that require more than one word.
Ask questions that clarify what the other person is saying. If you are having a talk about rules with your teenager, try saying, ""I hear you saying that you're frustrated because you feel like you don't have enough freedom. What can we do to find a solution that works for both of us?""

, Being an active listener means that you are responding to your conversation partner and demonstrating that you are engaged in the discussion. You can indicate that you are actively listening through both physical and verbal cues. Active listening makes the other person feel valued and respected, which is very important when trying to develop effective conversations.You can let someone know that you are listening by using positive body language. Make sure to make eye contact throughout the conversation. Also, try nodding or shaking your head at appropriate times.
You can provide verbal cues to let someone know that you are engaged in the conversation. They can be as simple as ""That's interesting!"" or more substantial, such as ""I didn't know that. Can you tell me more about what it physically feels like when you're running a marathon?""
Another way to indicate that you are actively listen is to restate some of the conversation. Try paraphrasing. For example, you can say, ""How interesting that you are exploring some new volunteer opportunities. It sounds like you are really excited about trying something new.""
Remember that actively listening is about retaining and thinking about what the other person is saying. Instead of trying to formulate your response, focus on hearing what they are saying and absorb the information.

, When having a conversation, try to demonstrate that your interest in the other person is sincere. For example, maybe you want to get to know your boss better. She probably has a lot of demands on her time, and does not have a lot of time to make small talk with her. Instead of chit chat, try to make an actual connection. If you're working on a project for her, ask for her advice on dealing with that client. Be sincere and show that you value her opinion.Maybe your neighbor has a college flag hanging outside of their house, and you're curious about why. You could sincerely say, ""I notice you have a Kansas flag outside your house. Are you a fan of college basketball?"" This is an organic, genuine way to start a conversation. You can branch off into other topics once you get to know the person.

, Having a great conversation requires you to think about the other person's interests. If you can find something that you have in common, that can be an excellent ""getting to know you topic"". You might have to ask several questions to find your common ground, but it will be worth your efforts.Maybe you are trying to relate to your new sister-in-law, but you are very different people. Try talking about a new television show you've seen or a book you've read. Maybe you'll find that you have similar tastes. If all else fails, go for something that people typically like. For example, most people like good food. Ask what her favorite dinner is, and go from there.

, Try to be aware of what is going on in the world. This will help you be prepared if someone tries to talk to you about current events. Take a few minutes each morning to scan the headlines. Being knowledgeable will allow you to be a much better participant in conversations.Another technique is to be aware of what is happening in pop culture. Talking about the latest books, movies, and music is a great way to have fun chats with your friends, co-workers, or even the other travelers on your morning commute.

, Your physical behavior is an important component of any face to face conversation. Eye contact is particularly significant. Holding someone's gaze indicates that you are engaged in the conversation and that you are paying attention.Remember that eye contact doesn't mean you should just stare at someone. Instead, try to maintain eye contact for 50% of the time when you are talking and 70% of the time when you are listening.
You can use other non-verbal cues when participating in a conversation. Try nodding your head to show understanding, or smiling when a positive response is called for.
Also remember never to just stand there as still as a statue during a conversation. Move your body around (not like a maniac, as this'll be unexpected and cause the other person to have uncomfortable thoughts about you). Cross your legs if you have to, but also make sure your body stays moving in a way it's interested in the conversation! Remember: your body is a more powerful form of communication than words!

, Over-sharing means that you are saying something that either embarrasses you as the speaker or worse, your listener. It can be awkward. There are many times when people blurt something out and then almost instantly regret it. Offering too much information can make both you and the person that you are talking to feel awkward. To prevent over-sharing, try to be aware of situations where it most often occurs.Over-sharing happens a lot when you are nervous or especially eager to make a good impression. For example, if you are going to an important job interview, take a few deep, calming breaths before you enter the room. Also take a moment to think about what you're going to say before actually verbalizing your thoughts.
Evaluate your relationship to the other person. Before sharing information, ask yourself, ""Is this the appropriate person to discuss this with?"" For example, you probably don't want to discuss your hemorrhoid flare-up with the person in line behind you at the coffee shop. They don't need that information, and will likely be uncomfortable hearing about it.

Strengthen your personal relationships.,
Improve your work relationships.,
Feel happier.",How to Have a Great Conversation3," Communicating is one of the best ways to strengthen your connection with someone. Talking is one of the most effective forms of communication, so it makes sense that connecting verbally can help strengthen your personal bonds. Try to have in-depth conversations with those people you really care about.One way to do this would be to implement better dinner table talk. For example, if you live with a romantic partner, avoid watching tv while you eat. Instead, try to have an interesting conversation several times a week.
Ask fun questions such as, ""If you won the lottery, what would you do first?"" These sorts of questions can help you connect and get to know one another better.

, Having good conversations is an excellent way to make your work life better. Not only can it help you advance in your profession, but it will make your day-to-day routine more enjoyable. Try talking to your co-workers about things other than work. This will help you connect on a personal level. Then, when you are working on a project together, you will naturally communicate more effectively.Perhaps you've noticed that your cubicle mate has several pictures of her cat on her desk. Try to ask her questions about her pet as a way to get to know her better. This will lead to more in-depth conversations down the road.

, Research tells us that people who are happy about their conversations are generally happier people. Mostly, this refers to in-depth conversations, but surface level chats can raise your endorphins, too. Basically, try to put effort into each conversation that you have during the day and you'll start to feel good about life in general."

Ask for his opinion. You could tie it to what's currently happening in the room, current events, or whatever else you may want to discuss.

Delve into ""life story"" topics. Ask where your conversation partner is from, how he grew up, and so on.;
, The kinds of questions you will ask someone depend on how well, or whether, you know him. Here are some openers for two other types of people you'll converse with:



People you know well: ask him how he is, whether anything interesting has happened this past week, how his project or study is coming along, how his children are and whether he's seen any good TV shows or movies lately.

People you know but haven't seen for a while: ask him what has happened in his life since you last saw him, find out if he's still working in the same job and living in the same area, ask about his children and whether he's had more (if relevant); perhaps ask if he's seen a mutual friend lately.

, You know the old rule: never talk about religion, politics, money, relationships, family problems, health problems, or sex with people you don't know incredibly well. The risk of saying something offensive is too high, so just stay clear; these are often emotional charged issues as well.

, People are complex, with different interests, hobbies, likes and dislikes. There are several different kinds of questions you can ask about interests and hobbies, many of which will themselves will near-automatically lead to further follow-up conversation. Questions you could ask include:


Do you play or follow any sports?
Do you like to hang out online?
What do you like to read?
What do you do in your spare time?
What kind of music do you like?
What kinds of movies do you like to watch?
What are your favorite TV shows?
What's your favorite board game or card game?
Do you like animals? What's your favorite animal?

, Your safest bet here is siblings and general background information (such as where he grew up). Be sure to respond enthusiastically to encourage him to share more information.Parents can be a touchy subject for people who had troubled upbringings, have estranged parents or whose parents have recently passed away. The topic of children can be uncomfortable for couples who are having fertility issues or disagreements about whether to have children, or for a person who wants to have kids but hasn't found the right person or situation. Some questions you might ask include:


Do you have any siblings? How many?
(If he has no siblings) What was it like being an only child?
(If he has siblings) What are their names?
How old are they?
What do your siblings do? (Modify the question based on how old they are. Do they go to school/college or have a job?)
Do you look alike?
Do you all have similar personalities?
Where did you grow up?

, Ask your conversation partner where he's been. Even if he has never left his hometown, he will likely be happy to talk about where he would want to go. Specifically, you could ask:


If you had a chance to move to any other country, which one would it be and why?
Of all the cities in the world you've visited, which one was your favorite?
Where did you go on your last vacation? How did you like it?
What was the best/worst vacation or trip you've ever been on?

, Food is a little better to talk about because there's always the chance of bumping into someone who has had issues with alcohol abuse or doesn't drink. Be careful that the conversation doesn't stray into someone going on about their diet or how they're trying to lose weight. That can take the conversation in a negative direction. You might instead ask:


If you could only have one meal for the rest of your life, what would it be?
Where do you like to go when you eat out?
Do you like to cook?
What's your favorite kind of candy?
What's the worst restaurant experience you've ever had?

, This one can be a little tricky because the conversation could end up sounding like a job interview. Still, if you can handle it carefully and keep it short and sweet, it can lead to an interesting discussion. And don't forget that the person may be studying, retired or ""between jobs"". Here are some suggested starters:


What do you do for a living? Where do you work (or study)?
What was your first job ever?
Who was your favorite boss in the past?
When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?
What do you like best about your job?
If money was no object, but you still had to work, what would be your dream job?

, If you've never met him before, there are plenty of unknowns to explore just surrounding why you're both at the same event. Ask such questions as:


So, how do you know the host?
How did you get involved in this event? (Or, when relevant) In fundraising? In triathlons?
How do you find the time to be involved in events like this?

, Try to make it a compliment that involves something he did rather than something he is. This will allow you to carry the conversation forward by asking him about that skill. If you tell your conversation partner that he has beautiful eyes, he will thank you and the conversation will likely end there. Be sure to remain enthusiastic when you give a compliment so that you come across as sincere.Here are some good lines to use:


I loved your piano performance. How long have you been playing for?
You seemed really confident during your speech. How did you learn to put together such great presentations?
Your run was absolutely amazing. How often do you train each week?

, You can't expect miracles to take place in the initial interactions with someone. All you can hope for is an initial rapport to be created. Your best chance at this is to stick to topics that are interesting and entertaining to talk about; it can help to interject some light humor into the conversation as well. Avoid talking about problems in your life or other negative situations. If you've experienced people's eyes glazing over when such topics are raised, it's simply because few people expect to have to deal with heavy situations or problems in a casual, conversational context.
Most people are looking for polite, interesting, and lighthearted topics to discuss and a negative insertion can really put a blight on the moment, bringing to a halt any further conversation.

, Silence doesn't have to be awkward — it allows you to gather an opinion on the other person or to think up conversation topics he would enjoy. It gives both of you a breather and a moment of refined pause. Silence can become awkward, however, if you get nervous or try to cover up the silence because you're worried about it.

, If you find that you both like running, for example, spend more time talking about this shared interest. However, do be aware that you will eventually have to move on from the topic at a certain point. A 45-minute conversation about running would be awkward for most people. Discuss others who share your interest and their achievements. For example, you might both know the marathon winner from last season and one of you might be able to expand on what this person has been up to since winning.
Talk about new gear, new equipment, new insights, new tactics, etc. to do with your shared interest.
Suggest new things that you could both try in your shared interest, perhaps even making a date to catch up and try something new together.

, This may feel foreign at first, but give it a go and see just how the conversation opens up dramatically. Here are some thought-provoking questions to inspire more conversation:


Given all you have accomplished so far, what do you think has been the most important to you/beneficial to your community?
If you could be rich, famous, or influential, which would you choose and why?
Is this the best time of your life?
If you could only own 10 things, what would they be?
If you had to to choose only five foods and two drinks for the rest of your life, what would they be?
Do you believe people make happiness or stumble across it?
What would you do if you could wear an invisibility cloak?
Do you believe in free will?
What sort of animal do you think you would be if someone could change you into one?
Who is your favorite superhero and why?
Which five people out of all history would you choose to invite to an intimate dinner party at your house?
If you won a few million in the lottery tomorrow, how would you spend it?
If you could be famous for a week, what would you be known for? (Or which celebrity would you choose to be?)
Do you still believe in Santa?
Could you live without the internet?
What's your dream vacation?

, Return to these ""winning"" conversation tactics time and time again as long as they continue to work for you.


Equally, remember the topics that seem to make people feel uncomfortable or bored and avoid these in the future.

, Dig around into what's going on in the world and try asking your conversation partner his thoughts about the latest big incident in the news (remember though, in most cases it is best to avoid politics).Keep in mind funny new stories that could get you a laugh as well as remind your conversation partner of funny news stories he has read recently.

, Coming up with good conversation topics is part of what makes for good conversation, but how you convey the topics of conversation that you do come up with matters also.Be sure to get to the point of the topic without meandering about aimlessly.


Try to not digress into tangents as you are bringing up a conversation topic or you risk losing your conversation partner's attention!

Choose a good person.,

Choose a good topic.,
Don't lie.,
Be ready to accept anything that the other person may say.,
Look at them.,
Don't mumble.,
Don't get distracted.,
Honestly Try to Listen.",How to Have a Meaningful Conversation," A friend, family member, or close acquaintance should suffice.;
, When talking, you don't want to be interrupted by surrounding noise. Because of this, choose proper times for sitting outside so the noises of cars and birds will not overwhelm you. If you choose to stay inside, remember to have a private setting for the conversation and have a chair/seat that is comfortable so you won't be interrupted by awkward pain.

, As long as you don't focus on yourself and brag, any topic could be good. If you have any difficulties expressing feelings, you should inform the other person. A conversation like this one is a great opportunity to confess anything wrong that you have done or any secrets that you hold.

, A lying tongue is one of the most reviled characteristics that anyone can have in almost all cultures, and it is condemned by most philosophers as a vice. Many an argument will end with one person exaggerating, being hostile/defensive, or showing unnecessary anger only for that person to be proved wrong. Don't let this be you; avoid letting your emotions take you over.

, True confessions of deeply-held feelings can be painful, but no matter how staggering, keep your cool.

, Unless your culture condemns it in certain situations, try to look directly into the other person's eyes, because this builds trust.The eyes are truly the window to the soul, and your sincerity can be confirmed by your trustworthy expression. Avoid sending mixed messages by speaking seriously while having a playful or non-caring expression.

, Mumbling is a sign of covert anger, resentment, disrespect, or sadness. If you feel awkward in the discussion, say so without resorting to mumbling; it is better to avoid any confusion.

, If there is a television playing in the background, turn it off if you know that you can't focus with it on. Put away your cell phone, and for goodness sakes, do not wear earphones of any kind while the other person is talking. Eliminating these distractions should help you focus.

, The general tendency of most people is to keep thinking of what they have to say when the other person is talking. Try to genuinely understand what the other person is trying to communicate. That will make the conversation a ""conversation"" and prevent you from interrupting too much and boring the other person.

Help the guy to feel relaxed.,
Learn to relax yourself and this feeling will reciprocate.,
Don't be put off by stern and unfriendly expressions.,
See past the opinions and judgments of other people.,
Create a non-threatening opening conversation.,
Choose your topic of conversation carefully.,
Be persistent but not to the point of annoying the other person.,
Always remember that not everyone verbalizes their opinions.,
Enjoy finding out more about someone.",How to Create Relaxed Conversations with Quiet Men," While this may seem like a tall order initially, the simple trick is to be yourself and to avoid trying to fall into his way of being or rhythm. Use humor to break through the hostility and tension, and to break the ice. Once you've created space by smiling and encouraging his laughter, you'll be helping him to relax more and increasing your chances for talking longer.


When using humor, make sure that it is about inoffensive things or that funny self-deprecating sort of humor that relies on making yourself the point of the joke. That way you won't accidentally tread on sacred ground and make things worse or cause him to feel threatened.
Be careful with conspiratorial humor, such as saying ""Look at us two dopes waiting for a drink at this bar filled with beautiful people"". Trying to draw him in to seeing what's funny about the activity you're both currently doing can sometimes work but it can also backfire if he doesn't see the funny side of things or if he feels that you're poking fun at a serious choice of his.;
, It's hard to expect a relaxed conversation if you're not relaxed as well. Try your best to approach the conversation in a relaxed manner, and to not fear talking with the guy. He will soon pick up on your vibes and let down his guard. When the tension breaks away, there will be a lot more room for significant interaction and conversation.

, Most often, when a male has adopted these types of expressions, it is done as an attempt to highlight their ""manliness"", ""macho"" status, or cowboy or tough guy type dispositions. The reality is that deep down, a soft and gentle soul lies hidden, waiting to be conversed with in a kind and understanding way.


Consider pointing out something that you've noticed about him, such as his great hat, his funny T-shirt, or the kind way in which he just helped some kids get their balloon back. It's the little things (that add up to the softy that he is inside) that are worth noticing.

, While you may have prior conceptions of the guy courtesy of a well-meaning (or not so well-meaning) friend or colleague, be prepared to make your own judgment. Every single interaction with a person is unique. We may all experience different sides to the same person and this means that every opinion has the potential to differ greatly. Make your interaction or conversation with this guy your own personal experience. One man may be a good son, but poor in friendships, another man an ideal husband but a monstrous elder brother. As you can see, each context is very different, and yet it involves the same person. This simply means making up your own opinion about the person in terms of how the two of you click or get along.

, A male is most likely to bring the conversation to an abrupt end or make an excuse to get away politely, when he feels threatened or when you start to get too personal. Leave the curious inquisitive urges for some other time, when he gets to know you better and is more comfortable talking to you and hanging around you. Stick to topics that don't require a great deal of effort, such as sports, the weather, general comments about impressions of the place you're both in or the food you're eating, etc.

, Find out as soon as you can what he likes talking about by asking questions aimed at eliciting this kind of information. Once you've formed a quick idea of what he likes and dislikes, keep on those lines to ensure that the conversation remains interesting to him. And use your own common sense when summing him up – for example, it would be pointless talking to a pensioner about the benefits of kick boxing, or to a hairdresser about cardiac surgery, etc. There has to be some common ground that both of you can pursue.

, If you feel that this attempt at conversing is going nowhere or is becoming too torturous for you, break away politely and try again some other time. You may also not want to close all doors or reach a dead end on your first attempt, though. Leave avenues open for future contacts or meetings. This will also very much depend on how you feel about the situation but it can be worthwhile slowly chipping away at a reserved guy's defenses in small but gradual chats here and there, until he feels he can trust you and open up a lot more.

, Focus on the other's body language to assess if you're on the right track. This should give you some indication as to whether you should keep quiet or continue speaking. A grimace or deep sigh is obviously not a good positive indicator. It shows boredom or a lack of interest in what you are saying. However, an intent direct look in your direction or even a simple smile may suggest that you should go on and keep the pace. Also, it can help to know whether the person you're speaking with is visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, as knowing this can help you to direct your conversation so that they'll really gel with you:Visual conversationalists are often well dressed, neat, and talk fast when they do talk. They talk about things visually, such as pictures in their mind's eye, and they tend to look around a lot. This person tends to like to be in control because he has a ""vision"". A conversation with a visual person can be improved by painting word pictures and using a lot of words that are visually stimulating, such as ""How do you see yourself?"", ""I see eye to eye with you on that point"", and ""Can you imagine?"". Think of yourself as describing so that this person can ""see"" your conversation points.
Auditory conversationalists tend to be people who respond to sound. Conversation is something they love but it needs to be something they can tune into to awaken their interest. They're word lovers and often seek harmony in the sounds of words and they're always listening for the rhythm. A conversation with an auditory person can be improved by using terms that resonate with their hearing sense, such as ""Sounds familiar"", ""Let me tell you how."", and ""That had me tongue-tied and I heard her message clear as a bell"".
Kinesthetic conversationalists tend to be the most sensitive and things need to feel right for the conversation to proceed well. A trademark of this conversationalist may include slow, easygoing talk and a need to take their time to get to the point. Most of what they discuss will be couched in terms of feelings, and improving a conversation can be as simple as resorting to feeling language, such as ""How do you feel about that?"", ""That must have shaken you up!"", and ""Keep in touch"".

, One last way to approach a conversation with a guy who seems reticent is to remain genuinely interested in learning something new, something undiscovered about him. If you can look past how difficult it feels to hold the conversation and how much you wish you could escape and do something less demanding, you can find yourself genuinely amazed at finding out things about this guy that he only reveals to people who take the time to care enough to break through his tough exterior. What a reward to learn something about a fellow human being that might otherwise have gone unknown! Ultimately, this can really turn around your perception of the guy, so persevere and you might gain a trusted friend for life.

Mirror their body language.,
Mimic their tonality.,
During the conversation, breathe like they breathe.,
Match their rate of speech.,
Repeat and approve.,
Assume you already have rapport.",How to Build Rapport,"


Posture/Body Movement: Wait 10 seconds, and then shift your body in the same way.
Gestures: Use the same hand gestures they use, but only when it’s your turn to talk.
Facial Expressions: Match their facial expressions instantly. If they raise their eyebrows, raise yours to acknowledge their emotion.
Head Nods: When they nod their head, nod yours instantly to signal agreement or affirmation.;
,


Accents: Copy their accent slightly. You don’t want to come across as mocking them, but listen to how they pronounce words. Mimic them just enough to hint that you might have lived in their part of the country at some point in your life. Many people do this naturally to some extent, and saying that accents rub off on you easily may be a sufficient excuse if they react negatively to it.
Do they talk loud or soft? You’ll want to talk at their volume level at all times.
Mimic the depth of their voice. People talk in one of three ways: through their nose, throat, or chest. Figuring it out won’t be too difficult. Compare them to the descriptions below and shift the depth of your voice a little bit closer to theirs.

Throat: A very throaty person will sound similar to Kermit the Frog
Nose: A person who talks through their nose will sound a bit like they’re congested.
Chest: People who talk to their chest usually sound very deep and loud.



, This will create a hypnotic synchronization.

, Some people talk really really fast, and some people talk very s-l-o-w-l-y. If they talk slow and you talk fast, what’s the first thing that might come to someone's mind? Usually when you hear someone who speaks really fast, your brain links them to a slick fast talking sales person. We automatically go into defense mode: “warning, warning, salesman, salesman!” The opposite scenario would be when you talk slowly to someone who speaks fast. They might think that you're not very intelligent. Another thing to listen for is their cadence, or the rhythm, of their speech. Do they speak in bursts, or at a steady rhythm?, This is so simple yet but probably one that most people often forget. After they speak, make sure you repeat a very brief synopsis of what they say and then approve (excellent, great, amazing, that’s exciting). This shows that you are indeed listening. For some odd reason, people like it when you listen! Learning How to Be a Good Listener helps establish empathy, which is crucial building block of rapport.

, Talk to the person as if they're a close friend whom you completely trust, and who completely trusts you. If you act in this manner, you will send out subconscious signals encouraging the other person to view you the same way."
"
Compliment him.,
Watch him in his element.,
Chat via cell phone or social media.,
Ask him for help.",How to Bring a Shy Guy out of His Shell1," Usually, compliments make people feel good and boost their self-esteem. If you notice something about the shy guy or something he is doing that you really like, give him a specific and sincere compliment. This should help him feel better about himself and also get communication going between you two, which will make talking to you a little easier for him.


You might say something like: “I read your blog post last night about history class and it was so funny and well written! I can’t wait to read your next one.”;
, If he plays soccer, go and watch him score a goal. If he plays the violin, attend his orchestra concert. When a shy guy is ""in the zone,"" he will probably be happy to see you witness his strengths. He might not yet feel like he can be bold or straightforward around you, but he may feel empowered by seeing you in an environment where he’s successful and confident., He might feel too intimidated and pressured to say the right thing face-to-face. He might feel more confident talking to you behind the safety of a phone or computer screen. Conversations online and through text message move a little slower, which will give him time to compose his thoughts and encourage him to open up., Men often feel more strong and masculine when they have the opportunity to help others. Ask him to fix your computer, your car, your bike, or anything else you think he might know how to fix. Helping you out will make him feel good, and he may even be more talkative in this kind of setting, so don’t hesitate to ask questions about the steps he’s taking to make the repair.Not all guys know how to fix things. Make sure that he’s knowledgable about what you’re asking of him or else your plan may backfire and he might up feeling embarrassed.

"
"
Ask open-ended questions.,
Ask about his interests.,
Be direct.,
Make subtle physical contact if you like him.,
Say his name often.",How to Bring a Shy Guy out of His Shell2," These kinds of questions can help a shy guy open up and talk about himself and can also lead to him feeling known, liked and comfortable with you. Avoid asking questions that can be answered with a quick “yes” or “no” because these may create awkward pauses and make the conversation feel forced. Good examples of open-ended questions include:""How did you get interested in carpentry?""
""What brought you to live in San Francisco?""

, When you ask about all of his favorite things, such as sports, movies, books, and more, you’re showing him that you’re interested in getting to know him better. Once you’ve talked a bit about each others likes and dislikes, you’ll most likely find some commonalities that you can discuss further and bond over.Make sure to show interest in him and not just his role or activities. Hobbies and interests are good, neutral places to start, but when you're both ready, be sure to look deeper.

, If you hang out together, make sure to tell him you’d like to see him again when you part ways. Verbal clarity will make him more sure of your feelings and wants, which will ease his uncertainty and draw him out of his shell. Also, pay attention to his reactions when you say things that directly communicate your interest in him. If he smiles or agrees enthusiastically, you can assume that he may be interested in you too., Making physical contact releases oxytocin, the bonding hormone, so initiating touch may quickly start making him feel liked and close to you. Touching him breaks through a kind of barrier that may lead him to feel less nervous or unsure about holding your hand or putting his arm around you later on.Ask permission first, and make sure he's open to that sort of attention and affection.
Try lightly and briefly touching the outside of his arm to communicate assurance while you’re having a conversation with him.
If you aren’t interested in him romantically, be cautious with physical contact. Giving him frequent hugs, for example may be friendly to you but he may interpret it as a romantic gesture.

, People love to hear others say their own name because it brings a personal touch to an otherwise general situation or conversation.Not only will saying his name strengthen the bond between you and the shy guy, but it will also quicken the bonding process. You can also give him an endearing nickname to make him feel especially liked and noticed.If you give him a nickname, make sure that it’s positive and that he’s comfortable with being called that name.

"
"
Initiate and arrange plans.,
Be patient with him.,
Make the first move if you’re interested in him romantically.",How to Bring a Shy Guy out of His Shell3," Shy guys often have a hard time reaching out to make plans because it makes them feel pressure and puts them in a vulnerable position. Save him the stress and just make the plans yourself. Try to cater to his comfortability by suggesting interaction that’s less communicative early on, such as going to see a movie together., He's not going to open up to you overnight, so don’t get frustrated if progress seems slow. Rushing may only intimidate him, so as your relationship grows, suggest the next move, but try to keep things at his pace. Building trust and comfort takes time. If you really want to show that you care for him, make it clear that you’re okay with that.He may seem awkward around you at first. Be persistent and compassionate.

, Don’t let your pride get in the way of making the first move. Especially if he’s really interested in you, it may come as a great relief to a guy who's a bit reserved if you ask him out or tell him you have feelings for him first. He may have really wanted to tell you, but his shyness just kept him from putting himself in a such a vulnerable position."

Tell a story where a different woman bought you a drink.,
Follow up with a challenge, laced with presuppositions: ""I doubt if when you buy me a drink it'll be that exciting but I'm sure that with a little creativity we can think of something..."" If you look closely, this is a sentence made up of presuppositions.,
Assume her generosity.,
Play the 5 questions game.,
Play the #17 game.",How to Convince a Girl to Buy You a Drink," Of course, you can’t say, ""So I was in this bar and this woman bought me a drink"" and then smirk like an idiot. The story needs to accomplish a few things:


Show that women have offered to buy you drinks in the past. Some women will think that a girl buying a guy a drink is an outlandish idea. Talking casually about how it's happened to you in the past can make her wonder ""Oh, maybe it happens more often than I thought..."".
Show that you're selective. When you get to the part where the girl in the past offered to buy you a drink, say something like ""So I agreed."" It implants in the woman’s mind that you don’t just let anybody buy you a drink.
Elevate the other woman's status. By saying that the woman who bought you a drink was attractive, smart, and cool, you're showing that she wasn't doing it because she was pathetic or desperate. You're also making it clear that you still respect her, if not more so, after she bought you a drink.
Compare her to the woman who bought you a drink. Since you already spoke highly of the other woman, by comparing the two, you're giving her an underhanded compliment. Plus, people are more likely to do something if they know that others who are similar to them have done it already.
Here is an example of a story that weaves in a few of these elements:

Check this out. I was at this bar the other night and I met this really cool girl and we hit it off so she offered to buy me a drink. So I agreed and we walked over to the bar and I told her since she's buying, she has to choose the drink. She gave like this evil smile that made me worried, kind of like your smile, and she ordered something I can’t even pronounce from the bartender. Then the bartender started smiling and I was like, holy $#&#. This cannot be good. So the bartender mixed a bunch of stuff up and put it together and then I swear, he lit it on fire, and while it’s still on fire this girl tells me to down it! So we both downed it and I felt fine - till like 30 seconds later - I don’t think I've ever been that drunk from one drink in my entire life! A great night though!

;
, A presupposition is a statement where you assume that the person is going to do something. Here are the presuppositions in this sentence:


That she will buy you a drink. Study the syntax closely. Saying ""...when you buy me a drink"" assumes just that. The ""if"" right before it applies to if it'll be exciting, and having that ""if"" in there keeps you from sounding too sure of yourself.
That she is creative.
That you two, together, will think of something.

, If a girl happens to say something like, “Do you want to go get a drink?” or “Let’s go get drinks” say: “Yeah! That sounds great, I’ll take a jack and coke” or whatever drink you want. If you say this with conviction as if you really mistook her meaning, it'll probably work, because most people won't say ""No, I meant YOU buy"" or ""Give me the cash for it."" If it doesn't work, fall back on ""You get the first round and I’ll get the second."" You'll end up paying for the next round but hey, you still got her to treat, rather than you buying everything.

, This is a common game played by pick up artists, but there is no reason you cannot use it to just have fun. Here is how you do it...


You: Hey, we're going to make a little bet. We're going to play a game- basically I'm going to ask you five questions and you have to answer each one of them falsely! If you answer it truthfully then you lose and you buy me a drink. If you win I buy you a drink. Deal?
Her: Deal!
You: Excellent. So where are you from?
Her: Jersey.
You: How old are you?
Her: 75.
You: Okay, what kind of car do you drive?
Her: A Honda.
You: How many people are in your family?
Her: 25.
You: Dang! (Reach for your wallet as if you are about to buy her a drink) Have you ever played this game before?
Her: No.
You: And I got you on the fifth question. (Unless she claims that she really has, in fact, played this game before. Then you get to prove she hasn't!)

,


You: We're going to play a game. Basically you can't say the number 17! If you do you buy me a drink. Deal?
Her: Deal.
You: Excellent. What’s 2+2?
Her: 4.
You: What’s 4+4?
Her: 8.
You: What’s 8+8?
Her: 16.

Understand what a TV close down is.,
Consider if you want to create a mock-up of an already existing channel, or if you want to invent your own.,
Film your closedown.,
If you like, put it on video sharing sites.",How to Make a Fake TV Closedown," Back in the later half of the 20th century, television channels went to bed at night, and would play a little sequence before it did. An example is showing a clock with the time, a voiceover wishing the viewer(s) a good night, playing the national anthem, showing tomorrow's programs, and then a test picture. The test picture would usually be the coloured bars, or the Indian head. However, there could also be static (also known as snow).;
, If you want your own, then get creative! Put up unique programs (real or fake) on the TV guide. Play the national anthem of your nation if applicable. If you want to make a closedown from the 1990s, then don't put Happy or Work for the music. However, in the end it's your call what you do about it all.

, Film the clock, yourself saying ""good night, don't forget to turn off the TV set"" etc. If you want an American-styled TV closedown (or sign-off), then state lots of technical jargon. Play the national anthem. Show an advert for a radio station (if the TV channel is related to it). As stated before, it is your choice what you put there.

, This is a good way of getting feedback from others.

Mount the multiswitch(es) and connect the dish coax cables to the dish input connector, and the antenna or Cable TV coax to the antenna input connector.,
At the receiver end, connect coax cables(s) to each tuner input(s).,
Check picture quality at each location.,
Securely tighten the coax connectors along each cable where ever they appear with a wrench, starting at the TV, receiver, multiswitch and ending at the ground block or dish.",How to Install Satellite Coax Cable in a Home," ""RG6QS"" for longer runs) coaxial (coax) cable for installation between the dish and each tuner.
, In the case of the DTV High Definition DVR or DTV High Definition TiVO, consider three cables if you wish to connect an ""off air"" antenna to receive local channels that are not available from DTV. If DVRs are not planned, installing one cable will supply a simple DTV receiver. More on this below.
, It is permissible to locate the ground block inside the home, but it should be as close to the point of entry as possible. If unable to purchase a ground block to accept all inputs and outputs, it will be required to add additional ground blocks as needed to accommodate all the connections.
, and the grounding terminal screw of the new ground block. These two points must be connected together. Use a clamp designed for the purpose to connect the #10 wire to the house's ground point. Do not under any circumstances disconnect or loosen existing ground connections to install the new #10 wire. Leave enough ground wire to ""thread"" through each ground block(s) ground terminal. Route the cable and secure with staples to the mounting surface. Securely tighten the ground terminal screw to the ground wire.
,,, A utility closet, a point near the telephone distribution block or electrical panel area is ideal. Label the coax cables ""dish"" or other meaningful manner. Be sure to label the coax from a roof top antenna if extended from the ground block.
, Affix labels to each of the cables - if two cables are connected to a single set top box, such as the case for a TiVO or DVR in a living room, label the cables ""LR1"" and the other ""LR2"" or some other meaningful term.
, The number of inputs equals the number of LNBs on the dish plus one. A dual LNB dish would require a three input multiswitch. The extra input is to mix in an ""off air"" antenna or CATV signal. The number of outputs of the multiswitch equals the number of tuners (not the number of receivers or set top boxes) in your system. A system of three set top boxes consisting of two DTV receivers and a DTV DVR or TiVO with two tuners would require a four output multiswitch. Of course, if you add another receiver later, you'll need a multiswitch that has additional outputs. Try to buy a multiswitch with enough extra outputs to allow your system to ""grow"". Cascadable multiswitches can be installed ""down line"" from other multiswitches, but must be identified for that use.

, DTV will install as many as needed free of charge when they add or change equipment such as receivers or antennas. It's best to let DTV do this, but there is no reason why you can't if the cost is not an issue.
, Connect the coax cables from the receivers to the the multiswitch output connectors. Snug the connectors to ""finger tight"" for now.
, The satellite cables connect to the satellite inputs - it does not matter which one. If you ran only one satellite cable, connect it to satellite input 1. If this is a location that will need an off air antenna input as well, instead of connecting a cable directly into the tuner, connect it to a ""diplexer"" input instead. The diplexer will have a diagram indicating satellite and UHF/VHF connections. The diplexer ""satellite out"" connects to the DTV receiver tuner, and the UHF/VHF can connect to the ""antenna"" or ""CATV"" input of the DTV set top box OR even an FM Stereo receiver.

, Change channels to test both tuners for TiVOs and DVRs. Alternatively,use the receiver's set up pages to view signal strengths of each satellite and tuner. Check connections and hardware until satisfied.

, Do not over-tighten.

Be aware that pretty much ALL HDTV's are ""horizontal rectangles"" otherwise known as widescreen and have an aspect ratio of 16x9 as opposed to traditional 4x3.,
Burn-in is not really an issue with plasmas anymore.,
Plasmas are not obsolete.",How to Learn About Plasma TVs," Most good 42"" plasmas cost about the same as a good 50"" DLP or LCD rear projection TV, and they tend to cost less than flat panel LCD's of the same size.;
, The larger (40"" and up) flat panel LCD's most often have the highest resolution. While this is important, it is not the MOST IMPORTANT part of a TV.

, This is occasionally a concern of people, but really most people buy a plasma because they want to wall mount a TV.

, This includes high-def LCD's, Plasmas, CRT's, and Projections.

, It can happen, but it is difficult to get, even with video games. If burn-in does occur, it is usually reversible, which is why most experts in the electronic industry now call this ""image retention"" rather than ""burn-in.""

, You may have to drill holes in your walls and caulk them accordingly. Make sure there is no important piping, wiring, or other obstructions when making holes in the wall.


You should ground the dish by wrapping some satellite wire on a screw on the dish stand. The other end of the wire should be run outside the residence and wrapped around some kind of metal object on the building. This will help prevent damage in the case of lightning storms.

,, You can access the signal strength menu on your TV to see the proper coordinates, including azimuth (direction), skew (rotation) and elevation (angle), for your location.

, Since your dish is inside behind a window, you won't have as much range as a dish that was mounted outside. You will need a compass to position your dish correctly and a friend to monitor your signal strength menu to achieve the best possible position.

Hide the wires.",How to Install a Flat Panel TV on a Wall With No Wires Showing," A simple option is to hide the wires behind furniture like wall cabinets and curtains, while a more permanent option is to conceal the wires in the walls behind the flat screen TV wall mount. The latter option needs pre-existing power outlets especially if the walls are solid. In case of dry or wooden partition walls, a bit of drilling and cutting will enable you to hide cables effectively while installing your flat screen TV wall mount.


An increasingly popular option used today is to hide the wires in decorative moldings which look good while blending easily with the wall. This involves less of drilling and can be done quickly within an hour or so. The decorative moldings or raceways as they are also known can be painted to match the wall color.
If you wish to run the cables through the walls, then a few things need to be kept in mind.

Firstly, a hollow drywall is the best option for this method rather than solid concrete and brick walls.
Secondly, a drywall within the house is more suitable instead of an exterior wall. This way you won't have to deal with insulation blocks and other wires embedded in exterior walls.
Thirdly, a visit to the hardware store will be necessary for a cutter, drill, cable sockets, extensions as well as bolts and a screwdriver.

;
, There is no set advice on this; just what is most comfortable for you and the distance where you sit to view TV. If you do mount higher than 5' off the floor, plan on a TILT mount.

, Better than marking it up with pen or pencil.

, Most homes are built with wood studs 16"" centered from another. NOT ALWAYS, but it is a rule of thumb to use.


If you have metal stud framing, brick, or any other masonry materials on or inside your wall, other than regular drywall, contact a professional from this point forward as there are special methods to secure safely.

, Always purchase cables longer than you think you'll need.

, DO NOT RUN THE TV POWER CORD OR AN EXTENSION CORD INSIDE YOUR WALL. Really, it's against all building and the National Electric Code (NEC) if you do. Either hire an electrician to install an outlet up on the wall, or if you're handy, you can install a special designed outlet yourself.

,,


Using your stud finder, make sure you know exactly where your stud framing is. Use your stud finder vertically between the marked studs, up and down the wall to determine there are no obstructions in the wall between the studs, expect fire blocks at approximately 8' off the floor if you mounting that high. Some areas of the country have them lower, so make sure. Insulation inside the wall is usually no problem just that it can make it more challenging to route the wires.
When you have determined no obstructions, drill or cut a 1-1/2 hole below or next to your wall mount, about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) away from the nearest stud. Use a bent coat hanger and insert in the hole and feel around for any obstructions around the hole, if all is good, proceed to drilling/cutting a second hole in line with the hole above.
Use your new fish tape or glow rod and insert in the top hole and run it down the wall to the lower hole, you'll have to use needle nose pliers to grab it through.
Use black electrical tape to tape the ends of you cables, staggered, to the glow rod/fish tape. Pull back the cables from the top CAREFULLY. If all went well then you have your cables.
Use a wall plate with a hole drilled out of the middle or just leave the hole open and secure the cables so they don't fall back.
If you are running cables through stud framing: Determine where you need to run through the stud and cut away an area of drywall directly over the stud. Save that piece to use to re-patch later. After you have removed drywall over the stud, use a 1-1/2"" bore bit to cut into the stud about an inch an a half deep in. Run your cables in that new cut out in the stud to the next ""bay"". Replace the saved drywall you cut out and use drywall screws above the stud cutout and re-patch with drywall putty and repaint.

, It will usually slide off or unscrew. Later, you will use these screw holes to mount the TV., You will attach the TV brackets with different processes depending upon this feature., These are different sized screws and washers, designed to mount to any flat-panel TV. You should also find a hex key that will install the screws., These are usually labeled B and C and have holes that allow you to install the brackets to many different TVs. They will run vertically down the back of the TV over the existing screw holes.

Make sure you install the left and right brackets in identical holes, so the TV will fit squarely into the mount.

, Test the kits out to see what fits into the screw holes. Use the hex key to tighten the screws.

Accept that romantic love isn't usually a conscious decision.,
Eradicate any sense of neediness.,
Distance yourself.,
Enjoy being single.,
If you want to stay friends, follow the steps in How to Deal With Being Dumped when You Want to Remain Friends.,
Practice unconditional love.",How to Deal With Unrequited Love1," So, if a person knows that you love them, but doesn't feel the same way about you, don't view it as some kind of betrayal or deliberate withholding. They might want to love you, but simply don't, for reasons they don't understand, and may never understand. Sometimes the feeling just isn't there. Try not to take it personally.;
, If you're feeling upset, depressed, or bitter, it's probably because you feel you need that person's love in order to be happy. But, the research on happiness says that all you need is a healthy dose of optimism. You may also find that it's a sense of neediness (which you may be conveying without even realizing it) that's turning off the person you love, perhaps by making them feel like they are on a pedestal that they don't want to be on.

, You won't want to, but staying close to someone you want but can't have just isn't healthy. Don't tell the person or anyone close to them what you are doing, as they might try to convince you otherwise. Just try to get away for a while. Don't call them, don't go places where you know they frequently visit, and make yourself scarce. If you must have some contact (such as work) respond to messages slowly after a few days. Only call back when you have a good excuse to get off the phone after a few minutes. Take the time to reflect on your situation and learn more about yourself.

, Dealing with unrequited love is a lot like getting over a break up, except you feel a sense of loss over something you never had. Still, you have to learn how to enjoy life without someone, which can be hard in our couple-centered society, but it's do-able.

, While you weren't dumped, you were rejected, and following that advice will help preserve your friendship with this person.

, If you feel that you really, truly love this person, then perhaps you can love them unconditionally. You'll know you've reached that point when you can genuinely feel happy for them, even if that happiness does not include you. With unconditional love, there's no sense of loss, because it's about deriving all your happiness from the act of giving - not from receiving.

Get on with your life in a more positive and self-thoughtful manner.",How to Cope With Liking a Person Who Disrespects You," Sometimes it is easy to fall for the role, position or the status that a person represents, rather than the actual person and their true character. This confusion of identity can be hard to untangle if you're struck by the glamor of what they ""do"", but if you don't try to separate the person from the position, then you might be falling for something that isn't even real. To elaborate, if this person is in a position of authority, power or respect in something that interests you or matters a great deal to you, whether it's a work, hobby, club or sports role, you might have confused the role or position of the person with who they really are. This is a common misunderstanding in a world where we overvalue what people ""do"" instead of who people are by way of their ""character"".


For example, Jenna's got a crush on Gary. He is the top debater for the year and has an incredible way with words, which is something she wishes she had the courage to stand up and do too––indeed, hearing his delivery just causes her to melt inside. He is also the President of the debating society and has a lot of influence within the English faculty. He seems to have endless people surrounding him wanting a piece of his time. Jenna especially wants to be a debater and to be noticed for her word skills too. She knows Gary is not very nice to her and has even outright insulted her on a number of occasions but she thinks this is almost charming because it's a sign he's clever, witty and one day, may come to realize that she's good with words too. Jenna is sorely mistaken––she loves what Gary stands for, not the prig that Gary actually is.
George is falling deeply for his boss. She is smart, clever, sassy and there is constant talk that management is so impressed with her that she's slated for promotion to a top role shortly. Yet, she is always snarky and cutting in remarks she makes to George and insists that he redo his work constantly, even though George has always been a top performer and other people recognize that he has excellent work outcomes. Yet, George is ready to put his own work down because he thinks that his boss is smarter than him and that if he does as she asks, she'll come to realize that he's special and will agree to go out with him. As with Jenna, George is sadly mistaken––he is struck by the glamor of his boss's role and the accolades she gets and downplays her rudeness to him in the hope she'll change. She won't change and he'll just keep on putting himself down.;
, Continuing to like someone who disrespects you will often be grounded in your own insecurities and lack of self-respect. In some ways, you may see this insulting and rude crush as someone who could fill what you perceive as the empty spaces inside of you. In reality though, nobody can complete you; only you can complete you and if you have low self-esteem, low self-respect and a ton of insecurities, then you'll need to focus on yourself and your own needs rather than continuing to chase after someone who knows how to zero in on your weaknesses and turn the knife. Be prepared to stop putting yourself through this and start improving your own sense of self worth instead. Remind yourself that no person who insults you or puts you down deserves to form a part of your life.

, Likely they're the way they are because of 1001 reasons, from their own insecurities through to attention-seeking. However, ultimately you should reach a point of saying to yourself ""who cares""? You're not their guardian angel, you're not their health professional and you're not their personal trainer. If they have problems, you are not there to save or change them and you risk making up reasons to excuse their behavior if you over-analyze what impels them to behave in a certain way. If the way they behave toward you is getting you down and is hurtful, that should be enough of an alert for you to start extricating yourself from your one-sided crush on them.


If you're suffering from trying to be a people pleaser, see How to stop being a people pleaser for tips on overcoming this self-respect-destroying behavior.

, A healthy relationship between two people is not possible if one lacks respect for the other. While this is the hardest part of the process, it's the most essential part. If you're unwilling to put your feelings for this person behind you, then you'll continue to long after this person and not put your own needs and respect first.

, Once they have shown a disrespectful attitude towards you on several occasions, this should be sufficient warning to you that they're not going to stop and that their view of you is always going to be unfriendly and unkind. If you keep excusing their behavior or treating their attitude as something other than what it is, you continue to let their rudeness and disrespect occur and allow them to get away with atrocious behavior toward you. Ask yourself how they're putting you down or insulting you. For example: Does this person embarrass you in public? Tease you relentlessly? Annoy you to no end? Throw barbs your way, especially when others are there to hear them? Mock you? Knowing why you should not desire to be linked with this person romantically or otherwise is an essential part of getting over a misplaced crush.

, Possibly you've been putting yourself into a position of being in their presence as often as possible, enduring their rudeness and insults for the sake of spending time near them, just to be in their presence. Whatever your current behavior toward them, it must end––for your sake. It is suggested that you pull away from this person completely and start pulling yourself together instead. Here is what to do next:



Do not speak to this person. They clearly do not deserve your attention.






If you have their phone number in your contacts, their e-mail in your address list, or their profile on a social networking site, delete every source of contact and connection. (You can even go as far as blocking them.) This will let the person know that you will not accept their past actions and won't put up with any future rudeness.






If the person attempts to talk you, do not respond. Simply walk away. If saying nothing feels too rude to you (after all, you don't want to dip to their level), simply say one polite thing to excuse yourself and then leave.






If you have no choice but to talk to them (such as at work), be perfunctory and say only what needs to be said, all in a professional tone and manner. Consider keeping a record of any insults relating to you personally or your work performance, to raise with your boss or someone else. Turn this type of situation right around in your mind from being a tolerable crush to being an intolerable harasser.







, Do not gossip or insult them behind their back. That is simply playing their game and failing to strengthen your own self-respect and character. When someone asks you what happened between the two of you, say something along the lines of ""I was tired of dealing with him/her."" Or simply say that both of you agreed to disagree and that you're not interacting much these days. Ultimately, it really isn't anybody else's business, so you're free to say ""Why do you want to know? It's not something I care to discuss.""

, Cutting someone off hurts, especially if you've been fantasizing about their potential future role in your life and you've been expending endless energies trying to get them to come around to seeing you in a better light. You may still have some feelings for them afterward and that's natural but it's not a reason to fall back into old patterns of behavior. Arrange a gathering for a few friends in order to get your mind off this person, spend time hanging out with people who see and acknowledge the good in you and be with people who are supportive of you, whether you're a success or not at any endeavor. Let yourself feel what it's like to be around people who respect you and don't give you grief.

, Be mindful in future of how you'll interact with the people who cross your path and don't allow your heart to run away with crazy ideas of saving or redeeming anyone. People will only change who they are of their own volition. Moreover, fantasizing that someone will come around and see the ""real you"" means that the ""real you"" isn't shining forth enough to begin with and spending time polishing the ""real you"" should now be your current focus. We attract and are attracted to like people, so sometimes we are attracted to a person who reveals something we've disowned inside of ourselves. It's important to learn from the fact that you've been attracted to someone deeply negative because it says a lot about how you feel about yourself inside. You do deserve more and you need to remind yourself of this constantly until it becomes second nature, as well as working on those aspects of yourself that you need to nurture with greater kindness.


Stand tall and have confidence in yourself. You will attract like-minded people who share your positivity and who appreciate your strengths and personality when you choose this path. It may seem hard now but this is the only genuine way of attracting a person who sees the ""real you""––by being a person who is unafraid to express yourself and to expect respect back from others.

Remember that it's not a conscious decision on their part.,
Consider whether you are blocking out their love.,
If you're sure you don't love this person, be firm.,
Reduce contact or end the friendship if the boundaries can't be clarified or upheld.",How to Deal With Unrequited Love2," They aren't trying to make you feel uncomfortable, and are probably feeling even worse; no matter if you are the closest of friends, they have more on the line emotionally than you do.

, Sometimes we feel undeserving or suspicious because of our past experiences, but if you reject love just because you can't trust someone, you're selling yourself short. See How to Receive Love if you feel this might be your conundrum.

, Don't let the person believe that you're on the fence, that if they just do this or that they might be able to convince you to love them. The longer you wait to tell them, the harder it is to do. One thing you can say is ""I don't feel the same way about you as you do about me. I don't know why, but I'm sure that's how I feel, and I don't believe it's going to change."" They might be angry, bitter, depressed, but they will recover most quickly if you convey that this is non-negotiable.

, If the person is attracted to you as more than a friend and can't seem to put that attraction aside, it's probably best to take the friendship down a notch. Keep contact casual, conversations short, and get-togethers brief. If the friend continues to press or yearn for a romantic relationship when you've made it clear that you don't want one, if they constantly trash talk your significant other (without good reason), or if they let their own significant other demean you, then perhaps the friendship isn't worth keeping, and this person should just be more of a friendly acquaintance.

Don’t be discouraged!",How to Cure a Heartache," Having your heart stomped on is going to be painful. You can't get around the fact that it is going to hurt. This means that you have to give yourself time to feel the emotions associated with heartache. Your brain is telling you that you've been injured so don't try to suppress those feelings.Create a healing space for yourself. You need time and space to process your emotions and to grieve. When the first heartache comes through, try to find a quiet place to deal with the immediate tidal wave of emotions. This can mean going for a walk, going to your room, making yourself a cup of tea.
You will tend to cycle through emotions like anger, pain, grief, anxiety, fear, acceptance. It can feel a bit like you're drowning at times, but you'll find as you go through each cycle of feelings that you deal with them more easily and more quickly.
Avoid wallowing in despair, however. There's a fine line between giving yourself time to deal with your emotions and being completely overwhelmed by them. If you find that you haven't left your house in weeks, haven't showered, and aren't interested in anything, you should seek professional help, because this is not healthy coping with heartache.;
, If you try to deal with all the emotions and all the fall-out from the heartache all at once, you're going to completely overwhelm yourself. Instead, go from moment to moment and stay present.


A good way to focus on the moment is to practice staying present. When you find your thoughts leaping ahead or straying into the past, stop yourself. Look around you; what do you see? What can you smell? What does the sky look like outside? What can you feel with your hands? Is there wind against your face?
Get little things done. Sweep, clean, organize, sort. Menial chores like this help your mind focus on positive things rather than negative things. Television, books and movies are good therapy in small amounts, but they don't affect your sense of accomplishment like marking things off your To-Do List. As the small things get done, you can shift to bigger things like redecorating, rearranging, remodeling. When the bigger things get done you will actually boost your attitude and brighten your outlook.
Don't start in on a big plan to get over the person who broke your heart. Instead, just focus on dealing with your grief over how things worked out.

, When a relationship ends or you get rejected you will probably feel like there's this great big hole inside of you, a black hole that wants to suck all happiness out of you. A lot of people make the mistake of immediately trying to fill that hole, because they can't stand it. Yes, it is going to hurt and you are going to feel empty. Give yourself space from the other person. Delete them from your phone so you aren't tempted to drunk text them, hide or block them on social media so you don't end up cyber-stalking them at two in the morning. Don't ask mutual friends how they are and what they are up to. The cleaner the break, the easier it will be for you to heal.
Don’t try to immediately fill the hole left by them. This is one of the big mistakes that people make when it comes to curing heartache. Jumping into a new relationship means avoiding the pain and black hole feeling of the previous one, but it doesn't actually help to work through those feelings. They'll come back bigger and meaner later on.

, You need to make sure that you have a support system for dealing with your heartache. A strong support system of friends and family, and even a therapist can help get you on your feet faster than anything else. They aren't filling that hole that the person you loved did, but they are helping make it easier to deal with that emptiness.Have a trusted friend or family member you can talk to, especially at odd times of night. try to find someone, or more than one someone, who can help take on the emotional support that the other person used to fulfill. Ask your friend if you can reach out to them when you get the urge to talk to the person you're trying to stay away from.
Journaling can be incredibly helpful. Not only is it a good way to get your feelings out, especially if you don't want to over-burden your friends, but it's a good way to check your progress. You'll see when you think about the heartache less, or when you start to become interested in dating again (really interested, not just ""filling in the hole left by the other person"" interested).
Sometimes you also might need to talk to a licensed therapist. There's nothing wrong with needing some professional help!

, Hanging on to mementos is only going to slow down your recovery process. Unless you absolutely must keep that ratty old pair of sweatpants your ex left behind, then send it all away.


You don't need to ritually burn everything, especially if it could be given to someone who needed it, but you do need to make sure it's out of your life. And depending on how the relationship ended a ritual burning can release a lot of pent-up feelings.
With each item, think of the memory you associate with it. Then imagine putting that memory in a balloon. When you get rid of that item imagine that balloon drifting away, never to trouble you again.
Donating the physical items that are in good shape can be a great tool for getting rid of them. This way you can imagine the good new memories that the items will make for their new owner.

, Helping someone who is struggling with pain, especially a pain similar to yours, can help you forget yourself for a moment. It also means that you aren't wallowing in grief and self-pity.


Make time to listen and help with the troubles of your friends so that you aren't monopolizing everything with your own heartache. Let them know that they can always talk to you and get help from you if they need it.
Do some volunteering. Work at a homeless shelter or a food bank. Offer your time to the Big Brother, Big Sisters program, or something similar.

, You are going to fantasize about that person coming back to you and telling you what a fool they were for letting you go. You are probably going to fantasize about being intimate with that person, about kissing them, and being close to them. That's totally normal.


The more you try to shove away those fantasies, the more stuck they're going to get in your mind. When you're not supposed to think about something, especially a self-imposed something, that's all you're going to think about.
Give yourself a specific time for fantasies so you don't spend all your time fantasizing. For example, give yourself 15 minutes each day to think about your ex wanting to get back together with you. When it isn't the designated time and those thoughts pop into your head, put them aside until it's the right time. You aren't ignoring them, you're simply going to deal with them later. Also focus fantasies of your ex on things that don't inflame your grief. Instead of dreaming about what the relationship could have been, imagine your ex doing good things for the community, or recommending you for a job. These constructive fantasies are much more possible, and far more helpful than imagining what could have been.

, Getting rid of mementos from the first section will help you avoid triggering memories. There are, however, other triggers that you should be mindful of. You're not going to always be able to avoid them, but doing your best not to seek out mental triggers will help you heal in the long run.


Triggers can be anything from the song that was playing when you two started your relationship to the coffee shop where you spent so much time studying Latin with one another, to even a smell.
You will encounter triggers, even when you aren't seeking them out. When you do, acknowledge the trigger and the memories it brings up, and then move on from it. Don't linger over the feelings and memories. For example, if you see a picture of the two of you when you're on Facebook, acknowledge the sadness and regret that you feel and turn your attention to something positive or neutral (like what you're wearing tomorrow, or the new kitty you're getting).
The point isn't to avoid all triggers all the time. You can't do that. What you're trying to do is minimize the things that will hurt you and remind you so you can get on with the healing process.

, It turns out that music can have a therapeutic effect and help your healing process. So put on some feel-good, up-beat songs. Science has shown that listening to them can trigger the release of endorphins, lifting your spirits and combating stress.Avoid sappy sad romantic songs. These will not trigger good chemicals in your brain. Instead, they will feed into your feelings of sadness and heartache.
When you find yourself falling into a pit of sadness and anger, that's a good time to put on good tunes to help lift your spirits. Putting on dance music can couple the endorphins from listening to the music with endorphins from dancing.

, After you've gotten over the initial process of giving yourself space to grieve and deal with your emotions, you should spend some time distracting yourself. When your memories of the other person start to bubble up, distract yourself with another thought, an activity, and so on.


Call that friend who said you could call them when you needed. Read a book you've been wanting to for a while. Put on a funny movie (an added bonus, because laughter can help with the healing).
The more you make not thinking about your ex and the heartache, the easier the healing process will be. It takes work, though. It takes actually redirecting your thinking and being vigilant about how much time you spend thinking about your heartache.
Don't take too many ""painkillers."" These are the things that can help you numb out for awhile. Sometimes you really do just need to take a break, but you have to be careful that you don't abuse these numbing routines, especially in the beginning when you really do need to deal with those feelings. ""Painkillers"" can be things like alcohol or drugs, but it can also be things like watching obsessive amounts of t.v. or never getting off the internet, or eating food for the comfort it brings.

, Part of dealing with heartbreak is coping with a break in certain habits you've formed to do with the other person. By doing new things and changing how you do things you'll be paving the way for new habits. There won't be any room in this new life for the person who broke your heart.You don't even have to do make huge changes to help shake yourself out of your old routines. Simply do things like go to the farmer's market on Saturdays instead of lying in bed, try out some new music, learn a new hobby like quilting or karate.
It's best not to do something really drastic unless you've weighed all the pros and cons. Especially avoid doing something drastic in the beginning of the healing process. Once you're further along and you want to show that you're changing, then it's a better time to do something like get a tattoo or chop all your hair off.
If you can try to get a little time off so you can go on vacation. Even taking a weekend and heading somewhere new can give you a new perspective on everything that happened.

, You're probably going to backslide when you are working on healing. That's okay, it's part of the process! But there are some things that you can watch out for to help keep that backsliding from sending you too far back.Be careful about the language that you use. When you use words like ""terrible"" or ""awful"" or ""nightmare"" you're going to be stuck viewing things through the negative. This will color your thoughts. If you can't find the positive, then stick to neutral thoughts as much as possible. For example: instead of saying ""This whole breakup is so horrible"" say ""This breakup has been really hard on me, but I'm dealing my best to work through it.""
Don't put yourself in an embarrassing situation. Don't drive past your ex's house each night to see if they're dating someone new, don't drunk call or drunk text them, etc. These things will make it harder to let go of what's past.
Remember that things change. People change, situations change. What you're feeling now is not what you're going to be feeling in a week, in a month, in a year. Eventually you will be able to look back on this time of your life without feeling physically ill.

, Part of curing your heartache, of finding acceptance for how things happened, is to realize that blaming yourself or the other person simply isn't useful. What happened happened and there's nothing you can do or say now to change that, so let the blame go.


Try to feel some kindness towards them. Whatever they did or didn't do, try to find some compassion for their issues, for what they're going through. It doesn't even mean you have to forgive them, but it does mean that you don't keep holding on to your anger at them.
Likewise, don't place blame on yourself. You can accept and deal with the things you did in the relationship that made it not work and pledge to yourself to do better in the future. But don't spend lots of time agonizing over what went wrong.

, Everyone heals at a different pace. There's no set time period for healing from heartache, but there are some signs that you're getting to a healthier place.


You stop wondering if it's them calling every time a number pops up on your phone that you don't recognize.
You've stopped having fantasies about them coming to their senses and coming to beg your forgiveness on bended knee.
You don't identify so much with songs and movies about heartbreak. You're finding that you enjoy reading and listening to things that don't deal with relationships at all.

, One thing that tends to get left at the wayside in a relationship and in the initial grieving stages when it ends is just being you. For a long time it's been about you as part of a partnership and then you as someone grieving that partnership.


Work on personal growth, internal and external. Get into shape, or change your look. These things can greatly help to boost your confidence, which will probably have taken a hit from the heartache. Figure out what areas of your inner self need work. For example: you might have a bad temper that causes you to act passive aggressively, then you would need to work on finding healthier ways to express that anger.
Develop what makes you unique. When you spend so much time with another person and dealing with the breakup fall-out, you tend to focus less on important aspects of yourself. Reconnect with people and activities you didn't have time for when you were dealing with this relationship and breakup.
Try out new things. This can help introduce you to different people, people who have never met the person who caused you such heartache. Learning new things will help to keep your mind off the heartbreak and on the present.

, Just as you don't want to sabotage your healing, you don't want to do things that make you relapse into the heartache. Sometimes you can't avoid this, but you can minimize the risk.


Don't let that person back into your life too soon, or at all. If you do it can cause a resurgence of unhappiness and heartache. Sometimes being friends with an ex just isn't possible.
If you do relapse don't panic. The work you've already put in to getting over the heartache hasn't gone to waste. It will payoff. Don't give up. Everyone has to deal with setbacks especially with this sort of thing.

, Doing things that make you happy or that you enjoy help to ramp up the dopamine levels in your brain. This is a chemical that helps with happiness and lowering stress (which heartache can ramp up to eleven).Do things that you don't associate with your ex. Try out new things, or do things that you stopped doing when the two of you were together.
Learn to be happy. People are attracted to happy people, because happy people make them feel happy. While you won't feel happy all the time, work on doing things you enjoy and living a life that you enjoy.

, After a breakup and the long process of healing from heartache, you may find it difficult to open up to other people again. Don't allow what happened in the past to negatively affect what's in your present or in your future.


Recognize that you might be hurt again if you open up, but that you should do it anyway. Closing yourself off is a surefire way to encourage issues with your health, both mental and physical.

, It's important to remember that healing from heartache is a process. It won't happen right away. You'll have setbacks, you'll encounter problems, and you'll feel a wide range of less than enjoyable feelings. After all you did give a piece of your heart away. The pain is proof you are human, made with compassion and imperfections like the rest of us.


Encourage yourself by celebrating the small victories. If you've gone an entire day without thinking about your ex, celebrate that with a celebratory drink or a cookie.

Whether you got dumped by your girlfriend or were denied a job offer or rejected from your top choice college, you can't let whatever happened let you feel like you're not worth it. Sure, being rejected is never easy or pleasant, but it only has to do with one specific situation at one given moment and does not define you as a person.


Instead of saying, ""I was rejected by my top college,"" say something like, ""I was denied acceptance."" Don't think of it as you being rejected as a person, but as you not getting the circumstances you wanted.
If the rejection makes you feel like a worthless loser, then it'll only make you destined to fail again. Instead, focus on the circumstances of what happened, not on the fact that it happened to you.;
, Another way to put a positive spin on rejection is to think about all of the people who never even got the courage to try what you attempted to do. Maybe you put your heart out there and asked your crush out on a date. Maybe you emailed a query letter to a literary agent to see if he or she wanted to take a look at your novel manuscript. Maybe you applied for a job that you knew was a reach. Even if it didn't work out the way you wanted, you should pat yourself on the back for having the courage to put yourself out there.


Don't be bummed that you got rejected. Be excited that you had the guts to embrace a unique opportunity. Think about what else you can achieve or try to achieve. The sky's the limit.

, People tend to take one rejection and let it make them feel completely inadequate, like it means that they can never do anything right in that arena again. If you got rejected by a girlfriend, you need to look at it as an isolated situation, not a sign that you will never find love. If your book proposal got rejected by three agents, don't let it make you think that the next thirty won't have any kinder words for you. Think of all the future husbands/writers/geniuses who never would have accomplished anything if they stopped after hearing just one ""no.""


Instead, look at it as an opportunity to grow and try again. If you let just one, or even just a few, or even a few dozen, rejections make you think that this is the way things will always be, then you'll have a hard time finding happiness or success.

, Okay, so let's face it: sometimes, rejection is just rejection, and there is nothing good about it at all. However, there are some times when a silver lining can be drawn out, if you look hard enough, or even if you don't look all that hard. You might have been rejected from a job, but told that you should apply again in six months because you were a strong candidate; though this is still a rejection, you can also think of it as a way of getting your foot in the door. It's all in how you choose to look at it — do you want to think of the glass as completely empty, or at least to search for a few precious drops of water that can help quench your thirst?


If you were rejected in a relationship, you may not think that there is anything good about this at all, at first. However, you can also choose to look at it as a chance you had to fall in love, and the opportunity to see that you can find it again. This is far better than just looking at it as a rejection with absolutely nothing in the ""plus"" column.
If an agent rejected your manuscript, maybe he also happened to tell you that you have a lot of talent and that you shouldn't hesitate to reach out again with a revision or a future project. Though you didn't land the agent of your dreams, you did get someone's attention, and have heightened your chances of getting noticed the next time around.

, Another way to be more positive when it comes to rejection is not to take things so personally. If you get rejected for a job, or if you don't get into your dream college, try not to make it all about something being wrong with you. You never know why you got rejected for a job — maybe someone was hired internally, maybe they were looking for someone who could relocate more immediately — and it's unlikely that it's because you're an unqualified loser with no future. Know that rejection happens to the best of us, and that it has nothing to do with you as a person.


Okay, so if you get dumped by your significant other, then it's hard not to take it personally. But try to step back and look at the bigger picture. If you were rejected, it's because something about the relationship just wasn't working. It doesn't mean that you're not right for anybody — it just means that you weren't right for this particular person, right now.

, Another way to be more upbeat when it comes to rejection is to always look to the future, instead of wallowing in regret or trying to figure out why the present is so awful. If you get rejected by a job, think of all other jobs and opportunities out there for you. If you get rejected in a relationship, think of all of the other exciting people you have yet to meet. If your first novel gets rejected by fifty agents and you feel like you're losing faith in it, think of all the amazing words you have left to write. If you let your rejection define everything in your life and don't see that there is so much more out there, you'll never be able to move on from it.


When you get rejected from something, think about all of the untapped opportunities still out there. Write them down and look at them. If you truly feel that there's really nothing out there, ask a friend to help you brainstorm. It's pretty unlikely that there's nothing else to look forward to.

, One way to look at rejection is to think that it is inevitable on your path to success. After all, how many actresses got the leading role after their first auditions? How many writers got their book published on their first attempt? You may think that success either comes naturally to people or it doesn't, but the fact of the matter is that rejections should be worn as badges of honor and signs of your commitment, not as indicators of your future success. Whenever you get rejected, just think of it as an inevitable step on the way to success.


If you're a writer seeking publication, tell yourself that you won't even have a chance to publish one of your short stories before you get 50 rejections. Every time you get one, just think of it as a step on your way to success.
If you're seeking a new job, you should consider the fact that you'll get at least 5 or 10, or even 15 rejections for every time you're asked for an interview. Be proud of all of those rejections because it means you're trying and that you're closer to acceptance.

, Use the rejection to help you think about your future and the next attempt you make at whatever it is you're trying to achieve. If you didn't do well in an interview, ask yourself if you can improve your communication style or your body language — or even if you can rack up more experience before you try to follow the same path again. If your novel manuscript was rejected, ask yourself if it could stand another revision that cuts some of the meandering scenes or sharpens the dialogue. Think about the improvements you can make before you try again the next time, and work to achieve them.


If you're lucky enough to get constructive feedback, then use it to help you move forward. If an employer told you you need to improve your writing skills, then get a tutor or ask a well-versed friend for help. If an agent told you your protagonist isn't original enough, see if you need to make him or her stand out.
Of course, some of the feedback you get may be worthless or completely missing the point. You don't have to change yourself or your work to meet another person's notion of success unless you agree with it.

, If this is your first time being rejected, then hats off to you — welcome to the club. Most of us have been rejected many times in one way or another, if you're anything like this, then you probably have a stack of rejections stored away somewhere. Don't look at this as something sad, but be proud of yourself for all of the rejections you've racked up. Then, take a look at some of your earlier rejections and see if you can chart how much you've progressed since then, whether we're talking professionally or personally. You'll see that you've grown so much as a student, writer, human, or whatever the case may be.


This works especially well if you're a struggling writer. Take a look at your earlier stories and compare them to the ones you're working on now. Sure, if you're still facing a lot of rejection, then you may have doubts about your work, but don't let it get to you. Instead, think about how much you've progressed since that first rejection, and be proud of yourself for plugging forward.
If we're talking about romantic rejections here, then yeah, it may not be easy to ""rack"" them up. Still, thinking about that first failed relationship, and consider how much you've grown as a person and how much you've been able to open up. Remember that not all rejections are created equal, and that you're always progressing, even if you feel like the rejection never ends.

, One of the hardest parts of accepting rejection is having to consider whether or not the thing you're pursuing is worth pursuing. Though you shouldn't let rejection get you down or keep you from fulfilling your potential, there's a time and a place for everything, and if you've had an endless string of rejection, it may be the moment to ask yourself whether the thing you're pursuing is worth pursuing, or whether you should go about it a different way. Insanity has been defined as trying the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. If you feel like you've been trying the same approach again and again and keep getting rejected, it may be time to follow a new path.


There's a really fine line between being persistent and being stubborn. If you really believe that your book is polished and ready for an agent, then you may keep trying to find the right agent for your work after the first sixty rejections. But if all of the rejections are telling you that the book needs a lot of work, then your time may be better spent in revising your manuscript than in facing the same form of rejection again and again.
If you've been asking out or trying to win back the same girl for months, and you feel like you're going nowhere, then it may be time to accept what happened and to move on. Use the experience to help you find a person who will like you for who you are instead of trying to force it.

, Sure, ""everything happens for a reason"" may be one of the most annoying things you can possibly hear, especially when you've just been devastated by a rejection. You may think that this is just an empty phrase that people use to comfort each other and that it has no real substance. Of course, there are times when something really crappy happens and you have to lick your wounds and move on. But if you think about past rejections or setbacks in your life, you may see that they actually led to something wonderful. Even if it may not seem that way right now, accept the fact that this rejection could lead to something positive that you can't yet imagine.


Let's say you got rejected from the tennis team. You may have been training all summer for it and banking everything on it, but now, you can still try out for the volleyball team. And who knows — this sport may be a better fit for you, after all.
You may feel like your college experience won't be the same if you don't go to University of Michigan like you always wanted, but once you do get to college, you wouldn't be able to imagine your life without any of your new friends by your side. You'll look back on the day when you thought that UMich was your dream school and you'll laugh. This may not be imaginable now, but really, it'll happen.
Maybe you'll get rejected from what you thought was your dream job. Well, the rejection may lead you to take your career in a slightly new direction — and to find a new path that you never would have otherwise considered.

, Another way to accept rejection a little more easily is to talk to a trusted friend about how you're feeling. If you're feeling low about being rejected, whether it's in a professional or a personal setting, sometimes nothing can make you feel better than talking to a trusted friend about it. Don't keep all of your angry or hurt feelings inside and stop dwelling on what might have been. Instead, call up an old friend or set up a coffee date and talk about your feelings. You'll instantly feel better and you'll be able to move on faster because you'll have someone to talk to about your problems.


You may feel that the rejection was a catastrophe. However, a friend can give you a more rational, down-to-earth take on the situation.
However, don't let this turn into you ranting about what happened to the five closest people within earshot. Having a friend's unbiased and helpful opinion can help cheer you on, but complaining and rehashing the same problems over and over again can actually just make you feel worse.
Make sure you're talking to someone who understands how much the rejection means to you. Having a friend say, ""It's not the end of the world!"" when you feel like it is may be the last thing you want to hear.

, Chances are that you're not the only person in the world who has ever dealt with rejection. If you're feeling completely low, talk to a friend, family member, or coworker about the rejection and see what these people have gone through and suffered. Sure, your friend may have an ideal marriage now, but you never heard about the ex boyfriend who broke her heart. Your writer friend may be at the height of his career, but you forgot about the four novels he had to write before having his work accepted for publication.


Talking to other people about their own experiences with rejection will make you feel like you're less alone, and that everyone else has felt what you're feeling, in one sense or another.

, The stories of how some of the most successful people in our culture faced one rejection after another before making it big. Knowing that you're not alone in the world when you face a rejection can help you get more motivated to push forward. Though, of course, not all people who face rejection become wildly famous, it couldn't hurt to reach for the stars. Here are some things to chew on:


Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind was rejected by 38 publishers before it found a home.
Marilyn Monroe was told she should quit acting when she first began. Modeling agencies told her she'd be better off as a secretary.
Walt Disney was fired from the Kansas City Star because he was told his stories lacked imagination.
Oprah Winfrey was fired from an early gig as a news reporter because she was told she didn't know how to separate her emotions from her stories.
Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team.

, Another way to accept rejection is to learn to get rejected early and often. If you don't get rejected very often, then that will make it sting so much more. But if you do it routinely, especially when you don't really care all that much, then you'll learn to accept it and to see it for what it is — no big deal. Depending on your situation, there are many ways you can regularly get into the habit of getting rejected — and therefore be able to accept it faster.


If you're upset about getting rejected by girls when you try to ask them out, make a habit of doing it more often. No, this doesn't mean you should ask out every girl in sight, but let's say you ask out girls 10-20% more often than you used to. If you keep getting rejected, especially if you know your heart won't really be broken, then you'll be getting into the habit of getting rejected and won't see it as such a big deal the next time it happens.
If you feel devastated every time you try to send your stories out to literary journals and get a big fat rejection, then you should send your stories out to even more places. Of course, this doesn't mean you should send them out before you feel that they are ready, but that you should send them out more often, so that you won't feel the burn after you get the next rejection you've been waiting on for months.

, If you want to accept rejection and move on, then you have to learn to stop dwelling on whatever bad thing happened to you. You should talk about it, write about it, make some pro and con lists about your future decisions, or do whatever you have to do to absorb and accept what happened. However, you should work on finding other enriching experiences, whether it's spending time with friends or pursuing your love for photography, to keep you going so you don't spend all your time dwelling on the rejection. Once you admit that it happened, the best thing you can do is to move forward.


Easier said than done, right? It's hard to stop dwelling on rejection, especially if you're feeling bitter, confused, or hurt. But the sooner you make a goal to find other fulfilling ways to spend your time, the sooner you'll be able to move forward.
That said, if we're talking about a breakup, you should avoid having a set grieving period. Let yourself feel what you feel, spend some time crying, writing in your journal, and just dealing with your emotions, and only move on when you're ready.

, Another way to be more accepting of rejection is to try to avoid banking absolutely everything in your life on one result. This can mean getting into the prestigious Iowa Writer's Workshop if you're a writer, getting married to your long-term significant other, or becoming the principal of the school where you work within five years. Though having goals, both personal and professional, is what keeps us motivated to move forward, you should avoid letting one thing matter to you so, so much that not getting it will truly crush you.


This isn't to say that you won't be deeply hurt if the person you've banked your future on rejects you. But it is to say that, while you can still be deeply in love, you should always feel like you have other things going on in your life other than your relationship. You can't let it be everything for you.
Okay, so you may really be dying to go to the Iowa Writer's Workshop. You may think it's your only path to being a published writer. But make sure you apply to at least a handful of other programs. You'll find that you'll be accepted somewhere, and that you'll still have an enriching experience where you get to explore your passion. If you think it's Iowa or bust, then yeah, you're going to be incredibly disappointed when it doesn't work out.

When you've finished it, store it away somewhere far.",How to Deal With Being Dumped when You Want to Remain Friends," Let's face it: done is done. You knew there was a risk getting involved with your pal, but you went ahead anyhow, and now she/he has cold feet, or wants to go back to the ex before you, or whatever. Take the news as gracefully as you possibly can. Cry over it if you need to. Just don't call names, express bitter regrets, or plead and beg for another chance.

, Let your friend know that you regret his/her decision, but will respect it out of love for your friendship. Tell him/her that you'll need him/her to respect your need for some space for a little while.

, View this as something that must simply be endured, like a broken arm. Time away from your friend will help you make a line between your hope for what could have been, and the reality that now must be.

, You know you're obsessing, but you can't help yourself and even though you see their eyes glazing over, you're helpless to stop. And you notice, after awhile, that talking about it doesn't really help anyhow. Do allow yourself to talk it out for the first two or three weeks, but if you're still hurting after that: Find one good friend - your sister, brother, or pal, and talk to her/him from time to time, although not every time you see them, if you can help it. This way, you will allow yourself one or two people you can occasionally vent to, rather than exhausting everyone you know.

, You have to go on with life, otherwise you will lose your job, flunk out of school, lose all your other friends, or have other personal failures in life. Knowing that you will give yourself at least half an hour at some point today to think about your loss will help you get through the rest of the day until you can sit alone with your grief.

, This is the Compartmentalizing part of the exercise. We're going to give these emotions a safe place to go so that you can get on with life as best you can. For some, it can be collecting images into a box and throwing them overboard from a ship. For our example, we will use a mentally conjured bonfire, on a mentally conjured beach, as described just below. It is here that you will allow yourself to feel and grind on your emotions over and over for the next little while. Try to confine your grieving to this scenario, while going through the rest of your day without dwelling on it excessively. Here is the mental imagery process to try:


Sit in a room alone, preferably a dark one, and begin building a mental image of being on a beach at night. Now you're all alone in your room, in the dark. You have the time to just sit and process your grief and loss, away from others, away from the world. Imagine every detail of that beach as vividly as you possibly can. Hear the waves pounding the sand and the cry of seagulls. Feel the sand, damp and slightly cold on your bare feet, let your toes squish down in it. See a fire pit in front of you. Hear the seagulls crying as they fly over. Imagine the smell of the salt water and sand. Feel the breeze coming from the ocean. Make it seem as real and vivid as you can.

Build a bonfire. Now light your bonfire in the fire pit. See the reddish orange glow illuminating the lifeguard stand nearby, feel the heat on your legs and body as the fire builds. Hear the crackling and popping. Smell the smoke.
Feed that fire now - images of you and your friend when you were together, snapshots in your mind of all the places you went, all the things you did as lovers. Add artifacts (gifts you gave, or were given) mentally, see these things go up in smoke, burning away. Watch as the photos you mentally lay on that fire burn up. Put gifts on the fire, let them burn. Favorite articles of clothing. Smells you associate with your friend.
Let it burn. Let it out. Cry if you feel like it. Let your tears flow as you watch these things burn away. It is key that you 'burn' only memories that have romantic attachments - not the things you do together as friends. You want to feel the love and affection of friendship when you're through, but you want to rid yourself of the unwanted romantic attachments and associations. Allow the fire to be as big as your love - let it be huge. After all, this is a mental exercise, you're not going to physically burn things (unless you really want to - and if that is what you wish to do, definitely do it in a firepit or other safe place).
Repeat as often as necessary until you feel ""Burned Out."" That's right. If you need a week, that's fine. If you need a month of nightly 'bonfires,' fine. Or a year. You take the time you need to repeat this process until you no longer feel a need to do it. 'Burned out' is a great way to look at it. This is the Processing part of our exercise. While some may consider this an obsessive approach, allowing yourself to feel your emotions obsessively, if necessary, to the extent described here can be healthier than keeping them boxed up inside, never faced. It allows you to give yourself permission to process your feelings, really feel them without repressing or suppressing them, and to symbolically purge yourself of them eventually, while still allowing you to go about your everyday life.
When you're done, let the fire die. As you realize you no longer feel a 'burning' compulsion to talk about it, dwell on it, or continue your meditations on your feelings, you will know it's time to let it go. Picture the fire getting smaller - you have run out of fuel to feed it. Allow yourself to continue watching as the fire dwindles and becomes small. It may be helpful for you to now think of the beach beginning to be lit by the coming dawn - imagine a pinkish tinge in the sky, and encourage yourself to feel the hope of a new day being born. As the sun rises above the sea's horizon, see the fire going out, and all the embers turning to white ash.
Send the ashes to heaven or upward to space. See yourself reaching into the pit and retrieving some ashes. This is the last time you're going to allow yourself to dwell on this - you want your friend back now. Not as a lover. As your friend. So it's time to let it all go. Take the ashes in your hands, and walk to the surf. Feel the waves lapping at your ankles, the cool of the water against your skin. Imagine the wind gently blowing at your back. Hold your hands out. They contain the ashes - this represents What You Leave Behind. Open your hands, and let the ashes begin to be blown. Lean forward and blow them into the wind, into the surf, let them fly to heaven. Let your tears flow if you need to - this is the end of this chapter in your life. To give it a more final feel, wipe your tears away, sense the ashes mingling in your tears. Then reach down into the clean water of the ocean, and wash them off. Splash some water into your face, feel the coolness, the feeling of being cleansed, taste the salt, smell the tang of the salt. Stand up, hold your head up. Think about your friend, and how you love him or her. Do not allow yourself to dwell on any painful feelings of attachment, only on your now friendly affection.
Walk out of the surf, turn your back on your fire pit, and walk away down the beach. This is the final, deliberate mental image you want - you have had your time to grieve. You've indulged your anger, sense of loss, and need to obsess by picturing every detail, every memory of that romance you ever had cross your mind burning away in that cleansing fire. Now you see yourself leaving it behind as you walk into the dawn of a new day. Picture your heart, no longer raw, no longer bleeding from a huge wound. Think of it with a little white spot - a scar; you were hurt, but now it's healing. Let yourself feel clean and ready to move ahead. If you need a little time to acclimate to this new feeling before contacting your friend again, take whatever time you need.

, When you feel tempted to remember the failed romance, replace that memory with a good memory of your friend as a friend. Remember a time you laughed together, or s/he came to your mom's birthday party, or you told him or her a big secret about some other crush you had. Allow yourself only constructive thoughts about that relationship - do not revisit the romance again. You're done.

, Tell him or her you're ready to resume your friendship. It's going to feel a little awkward when you first come together again. That's to be expected. Give it time. Meet someplace neutral, and keep it short for the time being. Have coffee or pie - maybe lunch, so it isn't open-ended. Keep the first few visits brief so you have time to re-establish 'normality' with your friend.


Plan semi-regular outings so you can get used to being friends again.

, Make it as long and sappy as you like.;
, This will let out some of your feelings and may help you understand them better. When you feel no need of it any longer, burn it in a fireplace or fire pit. Don't leave traces of a romance that will never be again behind to torment you (or embarrass you) later.

Some psychologists estimate that about 98% of us have experienced some form of unrequited love, whether it’s an unreturned crush or a nasty breakup. Knowing that you’re not alone probably won’t heal your broken heart, but it could make the pain easier to bear.;
, Don’t pretend you’re fine. Denying or minimizing your emotions -- like telling yourself “I’m really fine” or “It’s no big deal” -- will actually make them worse in the long run. You have to process how you’re feeling so you can move past it.Cry your eyes out if you feel like it. Crying can actually be therapeutic when you’re upset. It can reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and anger. So go ahead, grab some tissues and wail your heart out if it helps.Express your emotions through creative pursuits, like art or music. Write a song about how you feel, or play a track that comforts you. Draw a picture of your emotional state. The only thing here is to stay away from things that are too sad or angry (think death metal). These may actually increase your feelings of sadness and anger.It’s tempting to let your grief out by punching or breaking things, screaming, or shouting, but avoid this impulse if you can. Studies show that using violence to express your anger, even if it’s toward an inanimate object like a pillow, can actually make you feel more angry.To express your anger in a healthy way, try talking about your feelings to yourself or to someone you love.This will be easier with a family member or friend you trust. Find someone who has a shoulder you're comfortable crying on and let loose. They've likely cried on your shoulder at some point. Now all they're doing is returning the favor.

, Expressing how you feel, rather than bottling it all up or trying to ignore it, will help you accept that you’re in pain now, but it won’t always be this way.Writing about your feelings openly and honestly can help you understand them.The first step to coping with post-breakup loneliness is taking some time for introspection and reflection.Take 20 minutes a day for three days to let loose and write about your deepest thoughts and feelings about this relationship. Reflect on your experience while you were in the relationship, how you feel in the aftermath of the breakup, or what your worries are now that you’re not in a relationship anymore.Common reasons for breakups include a lack of independence, a lack of openness, or missing that “magic” feeling.Don’t worry about grammar or spelling when you write. You’re writing just for you, to express your feelings and thoughts.

, Writing your emotion journal is the first step. The next is to look back at what you’ve written and try to figure out why you’re feeling what you’re feeling. Thinking through your emotions will help you understand them better, and can also help you catch any distortions that might be unfair to yourself.For example, a very common fear after a breakup is that we’re undesirable, even unlovable. It can be easy to feel like you’ll never find anyone who wants you again.This is a natural reaction, but you shouldn’t convince yourself it’s true. Try looking for the evidence that plenty of people do love you, even if that one person you wanted most to love you doesn’t (or can’t in the way you wanted).
Look for global, internal, and irreversible statements in your journal. Research shows that these types of thought can lead to depression after a breakup and can make it harder to move on.For example, a global statement might look like “This breakup is going to ruin my life.” It probably does feel that way sometimes, but it’s probably not as true as it feels. Try rephrasing this as a limited statement: “This breakup hurts right now, but it’s only one part of my life.”
An internal statement blames yourself: “This is all my fault” or “If only I’d done things differently, we wouldn’t have broken up.” Remember that relationships involve two people. The chances of anything being 100% one person’s fault are very slim. And in general, breakups happen because of incompatibilities, not because one person is “bad” or “wrong.” Try telling yourself something like: “This relationship didn’t end up working out because we just weren’t suited for each other. People are different and have different needs. It’s okay.”
An irreversible statement is, well, irreversible: “I’m never going to get over him/her” or “I’m never going to not feel this way.” Remind yourself that all feelings are temporary. People change. Hearts mend. Try telling yourself: “I am in pain right now, and that’s all right. It won’t last forever.”

, Breakups can really do a number on your self-confidence. Showing yourself a little daily kindness can remind you that you are an awesome person with a lot to offer the right person. The next time negative thoughts about your breakup show up -- and they probably will, at least for a while -- challenge them with one of these helpful affirmations:I am worth love and care, and there are people who recognize that
I’m upset right now, but it won’t last forever
Part of my pain is caused by brain chemistry, which I can’t control
My thoughts and feelings are not facts
I love and honor myself

, Breakups can cause you to doubt your self-worth. It’s important to remind yourself of all the good things about you.Studies show that when you remind yourself that you’re worth loving, you handle rejection better.Make a list of the cool, great, interesting things about yourself. When you’re feeling down, whip out that list and remind yourself that you’re a remarkable person.


Think about things you can do (especially if they don’t involve the person you just broke up with). Do you skydive, paint, write music, dance? Do you enjoy long walks or cooking a great meal? List your skills and remind yourself that you’re strong and capable.
Think about the things you like about yourself. Do you have a killer smile? A fantastic fashion sense? Remind yourself that you have plenty to offer -- and that the only opinion that really matters is your own.
Think about positive things others have told you about yourself. Do your friends tell you how supportive you are? Are you the life of the party? Are you the caring person who gives up your seat on the subway or bus? Remind yourself that others see your value, too.

, When you break up with someone, it’s natural to feel isolated or disconnected.Reaching out to friends and loved ones will help you cope with these feelings and remind you that you have plenty of love in your life.Talk with your friends. Share your feelings with them. Ask them about their own breakup experiences. They can offer you support and advice.If your friends offer you feedback or advice, try to be open and listen to them. You don’t have to take their advice, but accept the spirit in which it’s offered. If you notice that over time they become reluctant to talk to you about the breakup, you may be dwelling on it too much. Remember to ask your friends about their own lives, too.
Sometimes, friends and loved ones may go too far. They may try to control your decisions or “fix” your problems for you. They may turn to bad-mouthing your ex, which isn’t always what you need. If your loved ones’ support is starting to go beyond helpful advice and conversation, show your appreciation for their support and let them know you can handle this on your own. For example, if a friend offers to give your ex a “piece of her mind,” you could say, “I really appreciate that you want to stand up for me, but I can handle this. Please don’t do that.”

, When you two broke up, it likely happened for a reason. Not contacting your ex is an important step in healing from a breakup.You may feel desperate to contact your ex, especially in the beginning, but remind yourself of the reasons you broke up.Stay strong and stay away from that phone!


Romantic love stimulates dopamine pathways in the brain, making you feel “rewarded” for your emotions. When you break up, your brain treats it the same way as it treats a drug addiction. No matter how hard it feels, don’t give in to the craving, or you’ll never kick it.Don’t call or text your ex. If you need to, delete his or her number from your phone and contacts. Don’t email or send messages on social media.
Cyberstalking is a real thing. Don’t look up your ex on Facebook or Instagram. You’ll only concentrate on the pictures of him or her being happy and having a good time. You’ll keep looking for clues and memories, keeping you from feeling better.If you have to, block your ex on your pages so you’re not tempted.
Don’t “vaguebook” (post vague statuses on social media) in a bid for attention. Focusing on the past will only keep you from moving toward your future.

, Holding on to treasured gifts from your ex or photos of the two of you will hold you back from healing and moving on. You may even find that having them around triggers feelings of sadness, loneliness, or anger.Delete photos of your ex from social media accounts (or at least crop him or her out of the photos).
Resist the urge to do things that you used to do together, like listen to “your song” or visit your favorite date spot. These things will keep you focused on the relationship you don’t have anymore, instead of allowing you to go out and form new relationships (and strengthen existing ones).
Memories aren’t always triggered by things. Even sounds and scents can trigger a memory or emotion.If this happens, don’t try to ignore or deny it. Acknowledge the feeling: “Oh, that smell reminds me of our pizza date nights. I miss those.” And then move on.

If you have things that seem too nice to throw out, consider donating them to a charity or thrift store. You’ll be able to let go of that t-shirt/coffee mug/teddy bear, and you’ll be making a positive difference in someone else’s life, too.

, It’s too easy to go out and slash your ex’s tires, key his or her car, or egg his or her house. You could spread rumors about him or her and start the gossip mill going, but don’t. This behavior will only keep you locked in the past instead of focusing on how you’re going to move past the breakup. It may even lose you some friends.


About half of people admit to stalking their ex in some way after a breakup, from making unwanted phone calls to threatening or even vandalizing an ex’s property. Carrie Underwood may make it sound like fun revenge, but this type of behavior just makes it harder to recover from the breakup.Stalking and destructive behavior is also illegal. Is your ex worth an arrest record? Didn’t think so.

, After a breakup, it’s common to want to get your hair cut or dyed or get a tattoo. This helps us feel like we're changing our identities and that we can be a whole new person, a person that didn’t have this relationship. Remember that your brain chemistry is altered during a breakup, and your judgment is more than likely impaired right now.Let some time pass. If after a few months you still really want that tattoo because it symbolizes something important, go for it then.

, Distraction is only a temporary cure, but it can really help take your mind off the pain from your breakup.Keeping yourself busy with things you enjoy, especially if they’re new and exciting, will help you realize that your life isn’t over after all.


Read that book series you’ve been meaning to get around to but never have. Join a book club so you can talk about it with others!
Take a class, learn a new skill, pick up a new hobby. Learning new skills will remind you that you’re capable of growth and achievement.
Call up people you’ve been meaning to chat with for months and haven’t. Remind yourself that you’re surrounded by people who love and support you.

, Exercise is a good way to vent your frustration and pain. It releases endorphins, those chemicals in your brain that make you happy. Regular moderate exercise can help you fight off anxiety and depression, too.Aim for 30 minutes a day to feel that rush.


If you think your schedule doesn't allow it, think again. Look into high-intensity interval training where you only need to work out in small, 15-minute chunks. Alternatively, do a bit in the morning and then at night. It doesn't have to be all at once.
Make less noticeable efforts, too, like parking far away from the entrance of where you're going or washing the car by hand.
Just don’t approach exercise as a way to “fix” yourself. This is an unhealthy way of approaching it, and can lead to body image distortions and other mental health issues. Exercise because it’s good for your body and mind, not because you feel you “need” to in order to be desirable to others.

, This may seem next to impossible, especially if you’re still raw after a breakup. However, having fun is great medicine for your brain. It reduces feelings of anger and increases your feelings of positivity.So go out with friends. See a movie. Go disco dancing. Sing karaoke. Do things you enjoy and let loose a little. You’ll feel better for it.


Laughter, it turns out, really is the best medicine. It releases endorphins, which are your body’s natural mood elevators. Laughter even increases your body’s ability to tolerate pain., “Retail therapy” can actually be good for you, if it’s done wisely. Research shows that when you go shopping after rejection, you tend to envision how your purchases will fit into your new lifestyle. Buying an outfit that boosts your self-confidence or replacing a piece of your ex’s furniture that isn’t your style can help you mend.Just remember: don’t use spending to mask your pain. Don’t go overboard with your credit card, either, or you’ll end up stressed out when the bills come in. Allow yourself just a few treats.

, Taking the focus off of yourself can help you avoid rumination, that “broken record loop” where the only thing you can think about is how much things suck.Studies show that showing kindness and compassion to others can boost your own mood and create a “ripple effect” of compassion in those around you.So go out there. Make yourself a better member of a better community.


Volunteering is a great way to get involved. Check with your church, school, or local volunteer organizations to see how you can make a difference.
Serving or giving to other people can also give you a sense of purpose. Studies have shown that when you make contributions to a cause you believe in -- especially if it’s in person -- you’re likely to feel like you’re making a difference in the world., Just because they broke up with you or doesn't want you back doesn't mean that you're worthless. There are plenty of other people who want you and would be willing to treat you even better than your ex. Find things that make you smile and laugh. Surround yourself with friends and people who care. You’ll feel better.


Happiness breeds success, after all.The happier you are, the more positivity you'll cultivate around you, leading to bigger and better things.
Humans are really susceptible to “emotional contagion,” or picking up on others’ feelings and moods. If you surround yourself with positive people, you’re way more likely to feel positive yourself. On the flip side, if you surround yourself with people who are negative and bitter, you’re likely to feel that way., After the initial phase of shock and grief has passed, you’ll find yourself in a place where you can let things go and remain cool. When you forgive your ex for everything that happened, the forgetting can start. That’s okay; it’s the natural cycle.Remember: forgiveness is something you do for yourself, not the other person.One way to forgive someone is to start by remembering what it is you want to forgive. Recall how it made you feel. Notice your thoughts about yourself and about your ex.Reflect on this experience. What can you learn from it? Perhaps there are things you would do differently. Perhaps there are things you hope the other person would do differently. What will you look for in the future? How will you use this experience to grow?
Remember that forgiveness isn’t an excuse for bad behavior. Forgiving someone doesn’t mean you have to reconcile with that person, or that you’re saying s/he was “right” to do what s/he did. It means letting go of the burden of anger. Forgiveness makes you free.
Remind yourself that you cannot control how others act. The only thing you can control is your own actions and responses.
Tell yourself that you forgive the other person for his or her mistakes. And remember that it can take some time for you to fully feel forgiveness -- that’s okay.

, Right now it’s likely that you’re dwelling on the past. Why is that? You can’t change it. It won’t do ""future you"" any good. What if you thought about the future? That would definitely make thinking positive much, much easier. Spend a little time reflecting on what you’ve learned from the situation, and then take some time to plan for the future.Use this time to consider what you can learn from this relationship to take into the future. What will you do differently?Make a list of things you learned didn't work in the relationship and things that did work. Then write down the attributes you would like your new partner to have, what type of person he or she is, physical attributes, characteristics, and so on.
Consider whether you can see a pattern in your past relationships. Sometimes, people repeatedly fall for people who just aren’t good for them. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including how you interacted with your parents as a child.Examine whether you seem to have a “type” that just doesn’t seem to be working out for you. Think about how you can break this unhelpful pattern next time.
Treat this as a learning experience. Breakups hurt. They suck. But they can also make you a stronger, more confident, more compassionate person, if you let them. Look for things you can learn about yourself and your needs.What do you know about yourself now that you didn’t before?, In a serious relationship, we often become half of the other person instead of a full and unique version of ourselves. This is often why breakups are so hard. But once you’re set free, you can find yourself again. You can spend time doing what you love, unhindered by anyone else’ opinion or constraints. Take some time to figure out what you value and who you want to be.When you were in this relationship, you probably made compromises. Now's the time not to make compromises and to listen to you. Have anchovies on your pizza if you like them. Sleep in on weekends if your ex was an early riser who always had plans. Wear favorite clothing your ex didn't like. Hang the art or posters your ex didn't like. Listen to the music your ex didn't like. All these are ways of regaining yourself, rebuilding your sense of self as a separate individual rather than half of the couple
What fell by the wayside when this relationship started? A friendship? A hobby? What time got taken from another aspect of your life and given to focus on this person? Think back about what you gave up. Is it still there waiting for you? Odds are, probably.

, It’s easy to stay inside our comfort zones because, well, it’s comfortable. However, it’s hard to really thrive without challenges.Take this opportunity to try new things and take risks you might not otherwise do.


Too much comfort kills your motivation. Since you’re probably already feeling a little uncomfortable after this breakup, use this uncertainty to your benefit! Use it to transform the areas in your life that need a little work.Learning to get outside your comfort zone has other benefits, too. For example, taking (reasonable, controlled) risks makes it easier to accept that vulnerability and the unexpected are just facts of life. Once you accept this, it’s much easier to handle the next unexpected thing that comes up.This doesn’t mean you should take up extreme sports with no training, or decide to move to a foreign country without any knowledge of its culture or language. Start with smaller challenges and work your way up.Think of this as much-deserved freedom. You can go to school, live somewhere else, or finally get that kitten you wanted. You can spend your Friday nights in that art class you've always wanted to take. If there’s a dream you always wanted to pursue, now is the time.

, You are heartbroken now, but you won’t be heartbroken later. It sounds cliche, but it’s cliche for a good reason -- time really does heal your wounds. You need time to get perspective on things. While it may be uncomfortable now to think of this person as a memory, later on s/he can be a memory you’re quite fond of and glad happened. People don't fade automatically, so don't be hard on yourself if the grieving process doesn't seem to go away. That's natural. But have faith that it will.The thing is that when it does pass, you won't really realize it. You'll wake up one day and realize that you haven't thought about this person for weeks. It happens slowly and under the radar. So just when you think nothing's happening, bam. It does. It always does.

If you think you have rejection sensitivity, you will need to acknowledge your tendency to overreact to certain social situations. Then, it’s necessary to remember that just because you feel a certain way doesn’t make it real.Think of it like you are adding an extra step to your usual response. As soon as you start to feel the emotions associated with rejection, turn up your self-awareness. Start analyzing the situation to determine whether it’s really a rejection or not.;
, Your sensors are trying to get a handle on the situation, and that’s good. It’s not healthy to act first and think later. People who are sensitive to rejection may respond in a more hostile way than others. Take some time to yourself in order to prevent your emotions from ruining your relationship or reputation.Take a deep breath and count to 10. Leave the environment for a few minutes, if needed. Do whatever you need to calm down and get a handle on your emotions before responding. Becoming hostile or ugly in response to perceived rejection will only make you feel more excluded in the long run.

, When you focus on your emotions, you may end up feeling worse. Try not to dwell on what you’re feeling. Instead, turn your attention to some non-emotional feature of the situation or your environment.For example, call to mind what the other person is wearing. Think about the décor and design elements of the room. Remember what you ate for breakfast earlier that day. Do whatever you need to detach from the situation and calm down.

, People who are sensitive to rejection always see themselves at the center of a situation. You might think you're being rejected because of something you did, but it may not be about you. Try to come up with other explanations for why the person may be behaving a certain way.For example, if you don’t have children and you’re trying to make plans with a busy mom, she may not have a babysitter to meet up with such flexibility like you can. Any rejection may simply be about her not having the freedom to make plans--it has nothing to do with you.

, People with rejection sensitivity are so tuned into their own emotions that it may be hard to consider another perspective. Talk with someone you trust about what is going on to get an objective view on the situation. A trusted friend or family member can help you see other possible points-of-view.Ask someone, “Hey, can I get your take on this situation? I asked Jan to meet up for coffee, but she keeps making excuses. How should I feel about that?”

, If, after calming yourself, you would like to gain a better understanding about the situation, pull the person aside to talk. Do so politely. This is not a confrontation, but a discussion to get a better understanding.


You might say, “Hey, Jan. I’ve really been working hard to make plans with you, but it feels like you don’t actually want to get together. What’s going on here? Can you help me understand?”Keep in mind that some people use rejection as a form of constructive criticism. The person might be using “tough love” to help you learn and grow. Try asking the person for clarification and you might find that their motives were actually positive.

, Becoming more aware of your feelings and the control they have over you can help you cope with rejection sensitivity. Mindfulness is a great starting place. Mindfulness is the practice of bringing your attention to the present moment. It decreases stress and can help with the anxiety that may arise with rejection sensitivity.Start with just 10 minutes of quiet, distraction-free time per day. You can set a timer to sound when your 10 minutes are up. You can also practice mindful meditation while driving, eating, or brushing your teeth.
Find a comfortable place to sit. Take several deep, cleansing breaths. Try to clear out your mind of any thoughts or judgments about what you’re doing. Focus completely on your breathing—in through your nose and out through your mouth. Let your attention follow the air as it travels from the environment into your lungs and back out again.
If your attention wanders, simply return to your breath. When the timer goes off, take a moment to notice how peaceful and relaxed you feel., Rejection hurts. You can cope by spending time taking care of yourself. Nurse your emotional wounds by practicing self-care. Do things that help you feel nourished.


Eat healthy, balanced meals. Engage in physical exercise. Call a friend. Go out to the cinema and see a new movie. Plant a garden with a family member. Or, check out a good book from the library.

, Experiencing rejection can negatively impact your self-esteem. You may start to talk negatively about yourself, saying things like ""I can't do this"" or ""I'm not good enough."" Start talking in a compassionate way towards yourself and you'll notice your self-esteem soar.Choose qualities about yourself that you consider to be positive. Then, think about ways in which others would benefit from these attributes you have. For example, if you are funny, you might uplift someone who is feeling down!
Now, create some compassionate statements about these awesome traits of yours. You might say, “I am an honest, caring person who deserves good friends.” Or, “I make people laugh - not everyone can do that! My friends are happy to spend time with me.” Repeat these statements aloud whenever you feel low on confidence.

, Coping with rejection sensitivity can be difficult, particularly when you feel all alone in your suffering. You might be tempted to turn to activities that allow you to escape or numb your emotions. Know that using drugs and alcohol, engaging in risky sex, gambling, or compulsive shopping habits won’t make you feel any better.


If you feel the urge to turn to self-destructive activities, increase your self-care practice. Treat yourself as gently and kindly as you would a friend in pain. Get a massage. Take a walk in nature. Run yourself a scented bubble bath.

, Try to put the criticism into context to determine if it is really worth worrying about. For example, you are just one out of seven billion people. Will anyone even remember you in a 100 years from now? How important is this criticism if you put it into the big picture of your life?


It might also help you to use a picture or video to remind yourself of how big the world is and to decrease the importance of the perceived criticism. Try looking at a picture or video of the earth from space., With rejection sensitivity, you can easily get caught up dwelling on people who reject you and forget about those who embrace you. Make a point to spend time with people who value who you are as a person.Whether it’s friends, coworkers, peers at school, or family members make an effort to connect with people who love and care for you. They can help balance the scales against any rejection you feel from others.
If you don't have strong relationships, meet some new people. Volunteer and help out in your local community. Join an organization or club. Strike up a conversation with the wallflower at a party. Become an advocate for those who are being bullied.

, People with rejection sensitivity often go into social situations expecting to get the cold shoulder. In many ways, this can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, you may start getting a more positive outcome by expecting to be accepted.When you’re entering a new social setting, tell yourself, “They’ll like me” or “I’m going to make so many friends.” You just might be surprised at the outcome.

, If you tend to receive many rejections in a particular area of life, such as in your career or dating life, you may need to examine your actions to see how you can improve. Think about it: you will never catch a fish if you’re using the wrong bait.


For instance, if you are applying for jobs that demand gregariousness and you’re shy, you may not impress the interviewer. Switch tactics and search for a similar job in which it doesn’t matter so much how outgoing you are. You may just get the position., People with rejection sensitivity often have histories of abuse or neglect in childhood. In addition, there are certain mental health conditions like depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that are associated with higher levels of rejection sensitivity.See an experienced psychologist or psychotherapist who can carefully evaluate your history and any other symptoms you might be experiencing.

Realize your time is your own.,
Take a spontaneous trip.,
Live in a tent.,
Change jobs, if you don’t like your current job.,
Focus on your friendships.",How to Enjoy Being Single1," Being in a relationship, while it can be wonderful, means sharing your time and life with another person. Being single, you do not have to worry about letting someone else know if you plan to be out for the evening, or you’re off to make a grocery store run in the early morning--or even if you’d like to take a weekend vacation to another city. Having your time all to yourself can be quite empowering.You do not have to fill up your spare time with activities. If being at home, or taking long walks on your own makes you happy, go for it. Having time to yourself means having time to do what you love.;
, Because your time is your own, you can take a spontaneous trip! You can take a day off of work to make a day trip to an unfamiliar city nearby, or perhaps a weekend trip in your own city, to explore freely.Being single also means you get to choose your destination. You don’t have to compromise or go somewhere you have no interest in being. The choice is all yours.

, If you’ve always wanted to live a vagabond’s life, now is your chance. After all, being a relationship might interfere with your desire to hop from campsite to campsite, or call the wilderness your home.This option is particularly great if you are young and love to travel. Living in a tent allows you to move about freely, without a house payment or rent, with only a few things to pack up before your next adventure.

, Being in a relationship typically requires you to share your decision-making with another person. This can mean that you are stuck in a job you don’t love in order to provide security or peace of mind for someone else. If you’re single, you just have to make sure you can take care of you, so leave that job you hate behind, and chase a position you’ll really love.If you do quit your job, make sure you have another job lined up first: being single and homeless is not quite as freeing as being single and financially stable.

, Being single doesn’t have to mean being free from all relationships. It can also mean that you have more time and energy to put into your existing friendships. If you have a friend in need, you can rush to their aid without checking in with a partner. If your friends want to go on a trip to a music festival, there’s no one holding you back.Some studies have found that single people can actually be happier. The key is in making sure you have strong, fulfilling friendships.
Remember that your friends are the family you choose. If you don’t have supportive, loving friends, make it a goal to find some.

Learn how to be on your own.,
Learn a new skill.,
Practice self care.,
Make (and meet) your goals.,
Focus on your career.",How to Enjoy Being Single2," Being on your own can be a wonderful thing. Learn how to take care of yourself properly, such as how to cook and clean for yourself, how to keep your home clean, how to wash laundry, and how to manage your time. All of these skills will be invaluable to you both as a singleton, and as someone in a relationship.This is not an easy task. You might have to start small, by making yourself breakfast each morning, or making a point to iron your work shirts.
Taking care of yourself properly means different things to different people. Find what works best for you.

, Take the free time you might otherwise be spending with your significant other and learn a new skill! Whether you sign up for one-on-one singing lessons with a professional, or you hop onto a site such as Skillshare to brush up on graphic design, learning a new skill will keep you busy and enrich your life.Being single is a great time to experiment. If you start learning something new and don’t like it, move on to something else.
Once you’ve found your new skill, indulge in it.

, Providing the basics for yourself is great, but self care is even more important. On top of making sure you are fed, groomed, and clean, you’ll need to make sure your “cup” is full. For some, that means taking time every morning to meditate and enjoy a slow cup of tea. For others, that might mean going to the gym four times per week to work on your physique.Self care will look different for everyone. When developing a self care routine, identify what it is that makes you feel complete and relaxed day-to-day. Make that a priority.

, Make goals as a single person, and budget your time to accomplish them. You can make small goals, such as eating at least three meals per week at home, or you can make large goals, such as having a promotion by this time next year.Make goals that matter to you, not anyone else. Doing so will get you further in life and will be far more important in motivating you to achieve your goals.

, Take the energy you may have spent on a relationship and pour it into your work. Even if you are not in a job that you hope to make a career of, you can improve your future career prospects by, perhaps, working your way up to manage your store, or building your body to fit the demands of a high-ranking labor position."

Reflect on past relationships.,
Work on your flaws.,
Evaluate your likes and dislikes.,
Seek help.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Enjoy Being Single3," Past relationships are great for teaching you about yourself and your future relationships. To prepare yourself for the possibility of a new relationship, identify any areas of your past that may have contributed to your break up. Notice anything you may have done to push your partner away, or actions you may have done to be controlling or manipulative. Search for ways you can improve your behavior as a partner.Don’t be afraid to take some time to yourself. You don’t need to jump from one relationship to another. Enjoy the in-between times and give yourself time to heal.

, Take some time to reflect on your character, and notice any flaws you might have. Work on those to be a better partner and friend. This can be hard--no one wants to think about their flaws. But identifying and working on them will make you a better person, and will likely even increase your happiness.Perhaps jealousy is a flaw for you. Practice being grateful for what you have.
Maybe manipulation comes easy to you. While single, practice saying what you actually mean, and being honest with yourself and others.

, Many people forego their loves in favor of whatever their significant other likes. Take some time to evaluate your likes and dislikes, including your musical taste, your preferences regarding food, drink, and lifestyle, and even what you absolutely require from a relationship or partner. This will make you an invaluable partner, as you will know yourself well, and will not bow down to make other people happy.This is another great time to experiment. Try new foods, music, or movies. Do activities you’ve never done before. You may discover things you really love.

, If your aversion to your single life is insurmountable or feels too overwhelming to sort out by yourself, seek the help of a counselor or therapist. Although you might feel like you are alone in your struggle with being alone, plenty of people struggle to be both happy and single. A qualified professional can give you strategies to cope with your frustration, and may also be able to provide you with a fresh perspective on your situation., Finally, make some room for gratitude and mindfulness in your life. While single, notice the way food feels against your lips and tongue, notice the sounds you hear as you take your dog for a walk, or tune in to your feelings on a particularly stressful day. Mindfulness helps you know your body and mind thoroughly, so that you can make more concrete decisions, and develop confidence and ease.Mindfulness can be difficult when you are in a relationship, as a lot of your time and attention are diverted.

Have a little fun with the occasion.,
Maintain eye contact.,
Use humor to ease the tension of the situation.,
Pace yourself.,
Leave your assessment of the situation for later.",How to Deal With the Discomfort when Meeting an Ex Lover," Control the expression on your face. Before anything else, remember to immediately change the expression of shock or disbelief on your face to one of calm composure and control. Under no circumstances let your past nightmares of what was your relationship together be reflected by the expression on your face, and even more by any other forms of body language such as fidgeting, crossing your arms, or turning away.



Be confident and friendly. These two approaches will ensure that you put aside past feelings and simply treat your ex-lover with the same thoughtfulness as anyone else you might happen to meet or bump into.;
, It is highly unlikely that this will develop into a lengthy heart-to-heart chat because your ex is probably about as thrilled to see you again as you are them. Seek to remain calm by not showing any outward signs of nervousness, such as fidgeting with your fingers or pulling your hair. Tell yourself that this encounter will be brief and that it will pass quickly, so remain calm and be polite.

, You've moved on and got your own life to lead without this person forming a part of it. While you're determined to prove this through your relaxed and controlled composure, there's no harm having a little fun knowing that your demeanor and friendliness is sending chills down the spine of your ex-lover. Try to adopt and maintain an amuse stance, and behave nonchalantly, even if the last thing you're feeling is amused or carefree! Grin in a relaxed fashion and know that it's both intimidating and surprising to your ex-lover to see you radiate such disinterest and a lack of concern for what the two of you once shared together. If you're really good with putting across the devil-may-care attitude, your ex-lover may actually start making excuses to look for the nearest exit!

, Even if you're not keen to talk, eye contact shows that you're neither scared nor perturbed by this encounter and that you continue to respect the dignity of your ex-lover as another person you just happen to know. Avoid looking away or finding distractions such as picking at imaginary fluff on your clothes or rhythmically stroking your cell phone in the vain hope it'll ring. Instead, stay in the moment and sustain the conversation by sharing small talk and giving confident updates about the entertainment, music, or food in the place you're currently in. You might even pepper the conversation with the things you're doing brilliantly in right now, and people you're spending time with but how much you reveal is up to you. It's usually best not to speak about really personal things and it's absolutely crucial to avoid any topic that drags up your intimate past with your ex-lover.



Be polite and ask your ex-lover what they're up to now and how life is treating them. Do it casually and boost their ego with lots of comments on how great they're looking these days but not in such a way as to denote interest. A simple ""You're looking really healthy/happy/bubbly/bright, etc. at the moment"" is sufficient.
Keep your small talk brief and to the point. After all, small talk is about simplicity.

, Being humorous can help to ease your discomfort and defuse the tense atmosphere between both of you. Humor also allows you to keep a deliberate distance between the two of you because it's less likely to get intimate or angst-ridden when you're being funny. Make funny statements to push aside questions or jibes that you can't or don't want to deal with, such as ""You do know that I can only deal with that issue/the Joneses/you in small doses"". Be careful not to offend though; it must be funny and you'll know whether or not your ex-lover will get what you're saying is humorous. More than anything, being self-deprecating to allow the laughs to fall on you can quickly ease you out of any sticky moments and have you on your merry way sooner rather than later.



Crack a few jokes to bring on a smile.
Ask them something out of the blue, like ""So how is Fido the leg-humping dog these days?"" or ""Yeah, I'm great although a bit tired; they're still collecting garbage at 3am singing loudly"".

, There will come a very distinct moment (be it 5 seconds or 5 minutes) into the conversation where all you'll want to do is leave or have the ground open and swallow you up. Stay relaxed and prepare to ease yourself out of the encounter. Avoid showing outward signs of agitation and discomfort; once you feel uncomfortable, simply look at your watch, explain that you'd better be getting on and make a polite excuse before departing their presence. Most importantly, leave knowing you've kept your dignity intact.

, Most often after a breakup, we tend to spend time imagining how the person we've broken up with is coping without us. This form of scrutiny should be dealt with when you are alone. Your disappointments or joy can be processed in whatever way you desire, but do this privately. Standing right in front of your ex-lover and forming the opinion there and then that they're miserable without you and that it's a good chance to beg them back is a sure way of looking daft and opening up a lot of hurt for yourself again. Above all, remember that there is a good reason why this person never made it into your future.

Look for signs of attraction.,
Tell him you have a boyfriend.In the vast majority of cases, the simplest way of telling someone you have a boyfriend is the best.,
Avoid sending mixed messages.,
Remember you live in the age of technology.,
Consider alternate approaches.Some women think that the ""I have a boyfriend"" approach reinforces the concept that a woman needs a man in order to be complete.",How to Act Like You Have a Boyfriend1," If you're out at a party or event and a guy is talking to you, you should be on the lookout for signs of attraction. Things like persistent eye contact, compliments, and assertive body language may indicate that a guy has his eyes set on you. If you want to reject someone, it helps to identify the early warning signs, and then pull the boyfriend card early on.Leading someone on makes things worse for the both of you. Your best bet is to tell a guy you have a boyfriend as soon as you think he's coming on to you. If you welcome the attention at first and turn it away later, telling him you have a boyfriend might not work as a proper rejection, as he may assume you want to cheat with him.
Say your boyfriend's just coming back from the bathroom if someone's coming on too fast.;
, If a guy makes an overt advance on you, you should say ""I have a boyfriend"" without trying to dress it up with any detail. If you're having a conversation and want to be less confrontational, you can work your would-be boyfriend into the conversation.


For example, if you're talking about music, you might say ""My boyfriend's favourite band is..."" This method is a good way of letting someone know you're taken without making it seem like you're rejecting him.
Be straightforward. Don't beat around the bush if you're trying to get someone to think you have a boyfriend. Even if you're trying to save someone's feelings, being straightforward about your rejection will minimize the risk of dragging it out longer than it needs to last.

, Mixed messages are a big problem if you're trying to reject someone. In fact, just being polite can indicate to some guys that you're at least somewhat interested in him. If he's into you, he may take any indication as a sign to keep going. If you're intent on saying ""No"" to a guy, make sure you're expressing it on all levels.


You should also be aware of your body language. While you don't need to be completely standoffish, you should keep your hands to yourself, even if you usually like to express yourself with touch.

, In other words, if the guy knows your name, he may have enough information to look you up online. If he can look you up, he can find your relationship status on social media. He can figure out you're lying if you have it set to ""single.""If someone does figure out you're lying, you could use an excuse like you just started seeing someone, and you haven't made it ""Facebook official"" yet.
If you use this technique often, you may want to keep your relationship status hidden.

, This tactic is also overused, often to the point where guys may suspect you're lying. Simply saying ""I'm not interested in dating anyone"" will leave no room for interpretation, as well as demonstrate to others that you're confident in your own decisions.

Listening to natural sounds like the sound of the thunder and rain, chirping birds, flowing rivers and such more sounds helps you clear your mind. It helps in relaxing and de-stressing, thus, leaves you happier and more calm when you are alone.

, Or, if you don't like singing, try dance. It really helps as you get engaged in something and research shows that exercising or dancing releases the bad emotions in person. Plus, if you think you are not a good dancer or singer, you are wrong since you aren't doing this for anyone else, it's for yourself, so just let go!

, Drawing is a fun and effective activity to be tried during one's leisure time. You do not have to be a Picasso to draw but can continue painting and drawing as you wish. It helps to relax, portray your feelings and de-stress. You can see the result at the end after being satisfied with your own drawing!

, Learning is the most important aspect of living alone. It helps to keep the boogeyman away, and also gives you something to talk about when you do have to actually enter society. Learning is also incredibly more efficient when you don't have social responsibilities like family to take care of, or a girlfriend or boyfriend to entertain.


Learning isn't just exclusive to books (although they are a great source of knowledge). You can learn to do anything by just practicing. Enrolling in classes is fun and also helps with the social life - you will meet new people in your classes. If you're not so much into the meeting people, the Internet is a great way to learn pretty much everything (That's what this site's for!).

, This might include:


Indoor activities, a foreign language, painting, yoga, mathematics, science, art appreciation, a musical instrument such as piano or flute.
Outdoor activities: Gardening, fencing, tennis, golf.
Or a combination: Meaning, things you can do indoors and out, such as photography or drawing.

, Reflect on life and greater meanings; be introspective. Contemplate or ponder things.


Above all, contemplation is one of the most important self-building things you can do. Think about what makes you you. What do you believe in? Why? Are there any things that don't seem right to you? What do you believe at face value (or accept as a matter of faith)?

, This is a great way to improve your thinking and reasoning skills. It will give you interesting topics that will stretch and bend your brain to help you understand your view of reality. Keep in mind that just because someone believes in something it doesn't mean you have to if you don't like it.


Philosophers: Socrates, Plato, Nietzsche, Descartes, Aristotle, Kant, Rand, Marx

, It is easy to read-into experiences, feelings, thoughts, and attitudes of others and make judgements that are really founded on nothing more than your own naive perception. This can quickly become a negative activity and get you down. Realize that you don't have all the facts and that's just fine.

, Humans need affection, without it there is a risk of becoming bitter and hating the world around you. Pets are often a source of affection and will give loads of it endlessly.


Pets also provide someone to talk to. No, it's not weird that you talk to your pet, it's weird if you don't. Just be cautious that your pet doesn't talk back (unless if it is one of the few types of birds that can do so). If so, seek professional help.
If you are aloof and self-sufficient, tropical fish, hamsters, budgies or finches are great choices. If you like a little interaction, but not a lot of maintenance, try a cat. If you want to be very hands-on, spend lots of time and get lots of feedback, a dog is for you.
Getting a pet doesn't mean getting a dog or cat right away. Often, if you are unprepared to deal with this level of responsibility, the experience will be terrible for both you and the animal. Don't be fooled into thinking a smaller animal like a rabbit or bird won't need lots of care - a rabbit needs daily human contact and several hours of time to run about a day, not to mention cleaning it out. Fully research any animal you are considering as a pet then go to your local animal shelter, there are hundreds of lovely animals there just waiting for a home! Some animal shelters will let you 'foster' a pet, which gives the animal a much needed break from the confines of the shelter and gives you the companionship you crave with-out a long-term commitment.

, Join forums or chat rooms to meet new people also. Take whatever you're interested in and find other people like you.

, Now is the time to get that body you've always wanted. Instead of just pigging out on junk food and sitting in front of the TV all night, do some push-ups or sit-ups.


Rediscover the fun to be had in simple exercises. Riding a bike around your neighborhood becomes less work and more fun as you do it.
Be consistent. Exercise takes willpower and diligence. Make a schedule and stick to it. Keep it easy at first and you will discover your limits. Or, join a gym and create new friends there.

, It's a big world out there, and you're only seeing a small fraction of it. Forget the people, just enjoy what life has to offer. Once you do that, then people will want to know and be with you. Frankly, you won't have a choice but to have friends!

, Do some charity work as it can make you feel good about yourself and gives you something to do in all your free time.

Identify the reasons why you feel lonely.,
Start a journal to track your thoughts and feelings.,
Practice meditation.,
Consider talking to a therapist about how you have been feeling.",How to Deal With Loneliness1," In order to make changes that will truly help you, you will need to take some time to figure out why you are feeling lonely.For example, say you assume that you are lonely because you don’t have enough friends and you go out and make more friends. You may still feel lonely after making new friends if your loneliness is the result of having too many friends and a lack of meaningful connections. Consider some of the following questions to help you determine why you are feeling lonely:


When do you feel the most lonely?
Do certain people make you feel more lonely when you are around them?
How long have you been feeling this way?
What does feeling lonely make you want to do?;
, Journaling can help you to understand your feelings of loneliness better and it is also a great way to relieve stress.To get started with journaling, choose a comfortable place and plan to devote about 20 minutes per day to writing. You can start by writing about how you are feeling or what you are thinking, or you can use a prompt. Some prompts you might use include:


“I feel lonely when…”
“I feel lonely because…”
When did you first start feeling lonely? How long have you felt this way?, Some research has suggested that meditation may ease feelings associated with loneliness and depression.Meditation is also a great way to get more in touch with your feelings of loneliness and start to understand where they come from. Learning to meditate takes time, practice, and guidance, so your best bet is to find a meditation class in your area. If no classes are available in your area, you can also buy CDs that will help you learn how to meditate.To get started with meditation, find a quiet spot and get comfortable. You can either sit in a chair or on a cushion on the floor with your legs crossed. Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. As you focus on your breathing, try not to get distracted by your thoughts. Just let them happen and pass by.
Without opening your eyes, observe the world around you. Pay attention to how you feel as well. What do you hear? What do you smell? How do you feel? Physically? Emotionally?, It may be hard to figure out why you feel lonely and how to move past those feelings. A licensed mental health professional can help you to understand and work through your loneliness. Feeling lonely may indicate that you are depressed or that you have another underlying mental health condition. Talking to a therapist can help you understand what is going on and decide on the best course of action.

Refer to your fake boyfriend by name.,
Think up a personality for your beau.,
Avoid trying to impress anyone too much.If you're already dating someone faithfully, you likely won't be going out of your way to impress other people as much, especially when they're the opposite sex.,
Feel secure and happy in yourself.Many people place a lot of their self-worth on whether or not they're in a relationship.",How to Act Like You Have a Boyfriend2," Friends are generally very difficult to fake a relationship around, particularly if you were planning on making it a long-term illusion. Although you'll always have to deflect the offer when they ask to spend time with him, you should put detail to good use. Refer to him by name, and treat it as if you're talking about a real human being.


The choice of name is important. Avoid outlandish or foreign-sounding names.
You should avoid giving out a surname as well. Your friends may be curious and try to look him up on social media if you do.

, Any illusion has a better chance of working if you put extra thought into it. Because friends are going to want to know more about your boyfriend, you should prepare a believable personality for him. What does he do for work? How did the two of you meet? What are his personality quirks? If you're going to act like you have a boyfriend around your friends, you'll need to dig beneath the surface and concoct a well-rounded story.


Believability includes not making your boyfriend seem too perfect. Although you don't need to list out his flaws along with the good things, you should limit the good things so you don't seem like you're exaggerating. Everyone has a complaint about their significant other from time to time.

, Even if you're regularly extroverted, you shouldn't go out of your way as much to spark conversation with new people.

, If you want to make it seem like you're with someone, you should do your best to exhibit this confidence in yourself. One way or another, you shouldn't let your relationship status affect how you feel on a normal basis.

Make statuses about your relationship.,
Act cheerful and upbeat online.,
Stage pictures that imply a relationship.Although people may be suspicious of a faked profile, a fake boyfriend will seem that much more real if you stage pictures in the real world.,
Try a virtual boyfriend service.There are virtual relationship services that will give you the experience of having a fake relationship for a monthly fee.",How to Act Like You Have a Boyfriend3," The easiest way you can act like you have a boyfriend online is by making posts about your relationship together. Publically compliment your boyfriend via your social media account, and keep your online social circle up to date about romantic nights you're not actually having.


Don't go overboard with these posts, as they often tend to be annoying to other people, especially to those who are having trouble finding a relationship of their own.

, Whatever your reason for faking a relationship, do your best to make yourself feel the way you would if you were really with someone. Visualize the thoughts and feelings that normally distinguish being single from being in a relationship, and try to emulate the latter as best as you can. For example, being in a relationship may lead to you making cheerier posts online, rather than unhappy ones.

, A picture as basic as two coffee cups on a table with an appropriate caption will make it seem like you're out doing things with someone special. Even if you won't have an actual boyfriend to photograph, the implication is often enough.


A caption is a vital part of creating the illusion. Make it affectionate and romantic. For instance, if you have two coffee cups set up, you can say something like ""Drinking my favourite coffee with my favourite guy.""

, Upon paying, you'll normally get custom-made voicemails, cutesy texts, and a believable backstory on how the two of you met in the first place. If you need a quick way to act like you have a boyfriend, delegating some of the creativity to professionals may be the very help you need.

Realize that you aren't alone.,
Move forward.,
Do social activities by yourself.,
Consider getting a pet.",How to Deal With Loneliness2," Loneliness is a normal part of being human, but it can make you feel like you are abnormal. Reach out to a friend or family member and talk with that person about how you are feeling. As you tell someone about your feelings, you can also ask if they have had these feelings too. This process of reaching out and sharing with someone will help you to see that you are not alone.Try saying something like, “Lately I have been feeling lonely and I wondered if you have ever felt this way.”
If you do not have a friend or family member to talk to, reach out to a teacher, counselor, or pastor., Instead of persistently dwelling on how alone you feel, do things to get your mind off of your loneliness. Take a walk, ride your bike or read a book. Explore activities and hobbies, and don't be afraid to try new things. Having experience gives you a basis upon which you can comment in more social situations (thus talk to more people) and strike up conversations that will interest other people.Keep yourself busy. Having down time is what causes feelings of loneliness to creep in. Throw yourself into work or extracurricular activities.

, If you don’t have someone to go out with all of the time, don’t let that stop you from getting out and enjoying yourself. For example, if you want to go out to dinner or to a movie on a date, then take yourself out to a movie or to a nice restaurant. Although, at first, it may seem awkward to be doing things by yourself that you might normally do with someone else, don't hold yourself back. It is not strange to be by yourself and out doing things! Once you remember why you did these things before, you can enjoy the activity for itself again.


Take a book, magazine, or journal with you if you go out to eat or have coffee on your own, so you'll be occupied when you would usually be conversing. Bear in mind that people do go out on their own on purpose just to have ""me"" time by themselves; it is not as if people will look at you sitting alone and assume you have no friends.
It may take some time to get used to the feeling of being out by yourself. Don’t give up if your first few attempts are a little awkward.

, If you're truly struggling without companionship, consider adopting a dog or cat from your local animal shelter. Pets have been domestic companions for centuries for a reason, and winning the trust and affection of an animal can be a deeply rewarding experience.


Be a responsible pet owner. Make sure your pet is spayed or neutered, and only commit to bringing a pet into your life if you're prepared to handle the daily tasks of caring for it.

Get involved in activities.,
Challenge yourself to take the initiative in social relationships.,
Spend time with your family.,
Be a pleasant presence.,
Join an online community.",How to Deal With Loneliness3," To make new friends, you will have to get out and get involved in things. Consider joining a sports league, taking a class, or volunteering within your community. If you are very shy, find a group for social anxiety, even if it has to be online. Look on places like Craigslist, Meetup, or local news websites for activities in your area.Don't attend functions with the sole idea of making friends or meeting people. Try to go with no expectations whatsoever and to enjoy yourself regardless of what happens. Look for activities that interest you and that also involve groups of people like book clubs, church groups, political campaigns, concerts and art exhibitions

, Making new friends often requires you to take the first step and invite others out to do things. Don't wait for people to approach you: you should approach them. Ask the person if they want to chat or get a coffee. You must always show interest in other people before they will show interest in you.Be yourself as you try to make new friends. Don’t try to impress a new person by misrepresenting yourself. That may lead to the end of the new friendship before it even gets started.
Be a good listener. Pay close attention when people are talking. It is important to be able to respond to what the person has just said to demonstrate that you were listening or they may feel like you do not care., Working to deepen the relationships with your family may also help you to stop feeling so lonely. Even if you don't have a great history with a family member, you can still try to repair relationships by starting with an invitation. For example, you could ask a family member that you haven’t seen in a while to go out to lunch or meet you for coffee.


When trying to rebuild or deepen your relationships with family members, you can use some of the same strategies you would use to gain new friends. Take the initiative to ask the person out, be yourself, and be a good listener., Draw people toward yourself by providing enjoyable company. Be complimentary rather than critical. For a casual comment, don't nitpick other people's clothes, habits or hair. They don't need to be reminded they have a small stain on their shirt when they can't do anything about it. They do need to hear that you think their sweater is cool or you like their personality. Don't make a big deal of it, but just casually mention it when you like something. This is one of the best ice-breakers around and it builds trust steadily over time as people come to understand that you won't criticize them., Sometimes connecting with people online can be easier than connecting with them in person, but keep in mind that online interaction is not an equal substitution for face-to-face connections.However, sometime online communities can be valuable ways for you to share your thoughts and experiences, or ask questions to those who are going through similar situations. Online forums often allow you to help others while being helped yourself.


Remember to be safe when online. Not everyone is who they say they are and predators feed off loneliness.

Differentiate between loneliness and solitude.,
Work on improving yourself and making yourself happy.,
Consider joining a gym.,
Learn a new skill.,
Do something big.",How to Deal With Loneliness4," Loneliness is when you are unhappy to be alone. Solitude is when you are happy to be alone. There is nothing wrong with solitude, wanting to, or enjoying being alone. Alone time can be useful and enjoyable.

, Usually, when we're devoting most of our time to other people, we tend to neglect ourselves. If you're going through a period of loneliness, take advantage of it by doing the things that you want to do for yourself. This is a wonderful opportunity and you deserve to be happy!

, Working out and taking care of our bodies is usually the first thing that gets tossed aside when we get busy. If you're spending less time with other people than normal, try using that time to exercise. If you exercise at a gym, you might even meet some new friends or a new special someone!, Taking time to indulge in a new hobby can help you to overcome feelings of loneliness, even if you are doing the hobby by yourself. You could learn to play an instrument, learn to draw, or learn to dance. Going and learning these subjects with others may help you meet new people but it will also give you a creative outlet for your feelings. Turn your loneliness into something beautiful!


Cook yourself a nice meal or make baked goods for friends or neighbors. Cooking up a meal is rewarding, you can channel your focus into something nourishing.
Consider joining a club to meet other people who enjoy this hobby as well., People oftentimes have something really big that they want to do and a thousand excuses not to do it. Have you ever wanted to write a book? Make a movie? Use your loneliness as an excuse to do something great. Who knows, maybe it will turn into something that helps others deal with their loneliness...

Listen to the person.,
Approach the issue gently.,
Be careful not to pressure them.,
Don't put your own agenda on the person.,
Ask how he or she wants to handle the situation.",How to Help a Proud Person1," First and foremost, to help a proud person, you should really listen to them. Hear them out and let them know you understand. You can say, ""I hear you, and I want to help."" Sometimes when you notice a proud person is struggling with something, listening for the small cues that something's wrong can help you get a better grasp of the situation.Give the person your full attention when you listen to them, such as by putting away your phone and turning off the television.
Nod and make eye contact while the person is speaking to show that you are paying attention. You can also try repeating a short phrase out of what the person says and then to show you are hearing what the person says.
Ask questions to clarify what the person says. For example, if something is confusing to you, then try saying something like, “I’m not sure I understand. Can you elaborate on that?”;
, After you have listened to the person and gotten a sense of what the person needs help with, then you might want to try to get the person to talk about it a little more in depth. However, it is important to avoid forcing them to tell you more. If you force it, they may not want to talk any more. They may even become angry with you and stop listening to you. They will then likely be further from the help they need than they were before you talked to them.Try saying something like, “It sounds like you have been having a hard time lately. Do you want to talk more about it?”

, Putting pressure on a person who is struggling can make them feel even less like seeking help.As you talk with this person, make sure that you avoid telling them what they “need to” or “should” do. Instead, try to work with the person to help him or her come up with solutions.


For example, instead of telling someone, “You should apply for WIC to feed your family,” you might say something like, “Have you considered applying for WIC to help offset your family’s cost of food?”

, You may want the person to change in a way that would be beneficial to you, but that might not be the best option for this person. If the person gets the sense that you're trying to change them to what you want, they are likely not to listen.For example, if you think a friend should look for a better job because there is no chance for her to get a promotion, then you might consider why the friend might like this job. Perhaps, she enjoys the extra time the job gives her to focus on her hobbies.

, Asking about what the person wants to do will allow him or her to preserve his or her pride. It will also allow the person to consider all of the options. To encourage the person to consider the options, try asking questions instead of telling the person what he or she should do or think. For example, instead of saying, ""I think that's wrong"" or ""You can't do that,"" try saying ""What if you did this instead?"" or ""Have you thought of trying that?""

Wait for the right time.,
Choose the right moment.,
Choose a good place to have the conversation.,
Do it in person.",How to Amicably End a Relationship1," If you've decided it's time to end your relationship, the first thing to figure out is when to do it. If you want things to end amicably, you'll want to choose a time when ending the relationship will result in as little disruption to the other person's life as possible.


It may be tempting to try to get it over with right away, once you've decided to end a relationship. Instead, try to pick a time--soon--when you can have this difficult conversation that won't cause any more trauma than necessary.If possible, avoid breaking the news on major holidays, right before the person has to go to some important meeting or function, or in conjunction with other major life setbacks like the loss of a job, parent, or pet. Be sensitive to these situations, and be willing to push the schedule back a few days if necessary.;
, Pick a time that you won't be rushed, setting aside a couple of hours for the conversation.


Having a time limit for the conversation in mind is a good idea, in case things get out of hand.Decide in advance how much time you will spend, and if you can, make plans that require you to depart at the end of that time.
By the same token, do make sure you have enough time to have an honest conversation about the topic and answer any reasonable questions the other person may have.

, Choose a good place to have this conversation. The best option is usually a place that is neutral and semi-private.You don't want to choose a place that is completely private, as this increases the possibility of the other person making a scene or giving emotional speeches that might persuade you to change your mind.By the same token, you don't want to do this in front of people you know or somewhere that every word you say will be overheard. This can be embarrassing and humiliating for the other person.

, Do not plan to end the relationship via text, email, a social networking site, or even via phone call if you can help it. This detached way of ending a relationship may be easier for you, but it is disrespectful to the other person.


Ending a relationship via text or email can also increase the possibility of misunderstandings, which could lead the other person to feel that there is still hope when there is not."

Set up roles and responsibilities in the home.,
Ask the perfectionist how they like things to get done.,
Find a middle ground and stick to it.,
Let the perfectionist know if there will be disruption in the household routine.,
Set boundaries around household space and household roles.",How to Live With a Perfectionist1," To make life easier for both you and the perfectionist, you should establish house roles and responsibilities so it is clear who is accountable for certain tasks. This will help to prevent any arguments about household chores and duties.You should sit down with the perfectionist and create a list of roles and responsibilities. Go room by room and note any tasks that need to get done, such as cleaning the bathroom once a week or sweeping the floor in the hallway once a day. Divide these tasks among yourselves and note when they need to get done so it is clear who is responsible for what and by when.;
, Often, perfectionists have a way they like things to be done and may get upset if a task is not completed based on their standards. Communicate with the perfectionist so you are aware of how they do things and how their way contrasts to your way.Have a discussion with the perfectionist about what they do when they clean the counter or sweep the floors. Allow them to show you how they do things so you can observe their expectations. This will give you a better sense of how they like things done and make you aware of their expectations.

, Once you have looked at how you complete household duties and how the perfectionist completes their duties, you should work together to come to a compromise over how things should be done. This way, you are less likely to get into arguments and will know how both of you will complete the duties in the home.For example, if the perfectionist prefers meals a certain way, you may agree that she cooks most of the dinners for you both as long as you take out the garbage and keep the kitchen clean. Or, you may both agree to sweep the floor a certain way so there are no issues when it gets done by either you or the perfectionist.
You may also discuss setting a routine where you compromise on wake up time in the morning or quiet time at night. If the perfectionist prefers getting up early but you tend to sleep in, ask her to be quiet in the mornings. If she wants to set quiet time at night to 9 pm and you would prefer 10 pm, compromise by setting quiet time at 9:30 pm.

, Many perfectionists get thrown off if their normal routine and established rules are changed or shifted suddenly. Rather than spring the change on the perfectionist, let her know ahead of time so she can prepare and adjust.For example, if you are planning to have a guest stay with you for the weekend, let the perfectionist know at least one week ahead of time that this is happening. If you are roommates, explain where the person will be staying in the home and how long they will be staying. You should also make sure the guest knows the house rules and agrees to follow them.

, Though you may try your best to stick to the household rules and routines, there may be times where you do not have the time or energy to do a household chore based on the perfectionist's expectations. You should discuss setting boundaries with the perfectionist so there are spaces in the home where you can follow your own rules and guidelines when it comes to cleanliness. Setting boundaries will help to prevent conflict later and allow you to be yourself in your space.For example, you may say to the perfectionist, ""I will maintain all shared spaces, like the kitchen, the living room, and the bathroom, according to your expectations. But my bedroom is my area and I do not have to follow your rules when I am in my bedroom.""

:

Reading
Watching television
Listening to music
Writing;
, You may have a difficult time sleeping alone at night because of feeling lonely, missing the partner you used to sleep with, or hearing strange noises.

:Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and food too late in the day
Avoiding stressful activities, like exercise, right before bed
Keeping the room lights on low
Playing soft music

Keeping the room cool
Using comfortable, soft bedding, like a body pillow
Wearing a sleep mask or using curtains to block out light
Getting up to read, take a bath, or drink hot tea if you find yourself tossing and turning

, Having a structured evening for yourself at home will help keep your thoughts from straying into loneliness when you’re alone at night. Having a routine can also help keep you motivated and feel fulfilled while being alone.For example, if you come home from work at 5 p.m., you can schedule time for relaxation, exercise, dinner, socialization, and perhaps a hobby before bedtime. It can be helpful to keep a regular bedtime, although a perk of being alone is that you can go to sleep whenever you want!

, When you live alone or are alone at night, it may feel like a waste of time to make yourself a meal and sit down at the table to eat. However, making your meals special and keeping your mealtimes consistent is a good way to ward off loneliness at night.For example, if you’re alone at night on a holiday, fix yourself the meal you typically would have had with your family or others. As you eat, you can relive special memories you have of that holiday and feel less alone.

, Although there may be many hardships or negatives to living alone and being alone at night, like having to take care of all the chores on your own, try not to dwell on those. Reminding yourself of the positives can help improve your state of mind. For example, being alone allows you to:Play whatever music or television shows you want to
Clean up how and when you want to
Decorate your house how you want to
Have silence and time to recharge the way you want to

, Although being alone doesn’t necessarily mean you’re lonely, it’s important to recognize and accept any feelings of loneliness or sadness you may be experiencing. Examine where they are coming from. Perhaps you’re feeling lonely and alone because you’re single, newly divorced, or widowed. It’s important to express and understand these feelings so that you can then begin to feel more comfortable when you're at home by yourself. Journal in a diary
Talk with a trusted friend
Seek counseling if you’re struggling with significant grief or loneliness from a loss or divorce

, If you fear being alone at night because of someone breaking in, because of a medical emergency, or because of a disaster like a fire, taking measures to ensure your safety will help ease some fear. You can take practical steps to prepare yourself in case an emergency occurs.Lock all doors and windows before going to sleep
Familiarize yourself with fire escape routes
Consider getting a security alarm
Make sure you have a working, charged phone nearby
Take a self-defense course
Know who to call in an emergency

, It's easy to give in to your fears and imagine the worst-case scenario when you're at home alone. You may be tempted to keep the lights on, keep the TV on, always invite a friend over at night, or compulsively check your locks before you go to bed. These ritualized behaviors will increase your anxiety about being alone at night in the long-run.Avoid asking someone to come stay with you too often
Find rational explanations for noises you hear in the middle of the night
Wear earplugs or use a sound machine to block out strange sounds
Go to counseling if you start to obsess over your fears or if they interfere with sleep

, Getting to know your neighbors is a good way to make sure other people know who you are and can keep an eye out for you. Befriending your neighbors is good for social connection, too! You might meet other people who live alone and set up a system where each of you agrees to check up on each other if you haven’t heard from each other in a few days.

, While you can learn to cope with any loneliness and frustration of being alone, there are some instances where being alone may start to be unsafe for you. This is especially true if you are an older adult or have any chronic health issues. Reach out to a trusted friend, loved one, or physician for help if you have:Difficulty managing your medications
Difficulty paying your bills
Difficulty bathing
Difficulty eating well
Difficulty with balance and falls
Difficulty keeping your house clean
Difficulty getting out to connect with other people

, Schedule regular social activities with friends throughout the week. This will give you structure, keep you connected to others, and help improve your mood. If you stay busy enough interacting with others during the weekday hours, chances are you’ll be less likely to notice feeling alone at night., Learn to get better with computers and other ways of connecting with people besides in-person. If you have friends who live far away, consider keeping in touch with them through email, Facebook, Twitter, or Skype. Schedule regular phone calls or text messages with friends for when you come home at night.


If you don’t know how to use a computer or internet-based services, libraries and community centers usually have classes to teach you the basic skills. This is also a good way to meet people in your community!, Consider getting more involved in your community by volunteering, taking a class, or joining a club. This could help keep you from feeling too lonely, give you more structure, shift your mood, give you increased self-confidence, and help you meet more diverse people in your community.By the time you get home at night, you’ll feel tired and less alone because you’ve spent the day meaningfully connecting with others.


Be patient. This may feel uncomfortable at first and you might have to try several different clubs or organizations before you find one where you feel more at home.

, You might find connection and help coping at night if you have a pet with you at home. Pets bring companionship and joy. They’re not only comforting and fun to interact with, but you can sleep with them if you’re feeling lonely or unsafe at night.


If you’re not allowed to have a pet where you live, if you’re allergic to cats or dogs, or you simply can’t afford a pet, you can even do something as simple as having a fishbowl or a bird feeder nearby your house."

Talk to other single moms online to share ideas and tips about social life as a single mom.",How to Have a Social Life As a Single Mom," This includes banishing any thoughts that your wish to have a little time to yourself is selfish, irresponsible or disloyal. It's both normal and healthy to want to socialize with other and to pursue interests that you enjoy and your desire to enjoy a little time now and then without the children in tow is a perfectly reasonable one. If you're still feeling unconvinced, think of the benefits, such as feeling more energized to resume your sole parenting with renewed vigor, having time to discover positive things about yourself you've long forgotten about and rediscovering your long lost social connections. All work and child raising isn't a balanced life; your life and your role as a mom will benefit from the inclusion of social time for you.


Be very careful if you use the excuse that you'd rather be with your children all the time than having any time to yourself. You may have convinced yourself that this is the way for you out of necessity but it's not healthy for your children to have only you as the main support and source of friendship in their lives. They will benefit too from being with other people occasionally in their non-school time. And you will learn how to socialize with adults again!
Do you know someone who has insinuated that by wanting time to yourself or – heaven forbid – wanting to meet new men that you're being totally selfish by not putting the children first? You do? Delete their name off your contact list! If they're family, don't pander to them – simply say that you're making a responsible choice and that it makes your immediate family happy. You can do without negative, oppressive, judgmental attitudes based on other people's imaginations.;
, A lot of single moms feel that it's too hard to organize social time because it involves relying on others. Given that single moms tend to take everything onto their own shoulders, asking for help beyond ""total necessities"" can feel as if you're pushing the limits. However, it's important to accept that needing other people's help to care for your children while you spend some time out enjoying yourself is a good thing. It does not reflect poorly on you; nor does it indicate that you're unable to cope alone. There are always people willing to help out provided you're willing to ask – don't be afraid to ask for help when you need a break. Practical approaches you can take include:


Work out who can care for your children while you're out. Do you have family or friends you can rely on? Are your neighbors a good choice? Are there other moms you know? If applicable to your situation, the children could also spend time with the father.
If not, consider professional babysitting services. They can be worth the cost for peace of mind and sidestepping worries that you're imposing on anyone or if you truly have nobody close you can rely on currently.
Consider making a babysitting trade arrangement with another single mom or with a group of single moms. You can share the care arrangements on different social nights, knowing full well that each of you is reciprocating in kind. This can relieve the pressure of feeling you're burdening someone else and it can also be a fun way for your own children to get to know other children quickly. This can also be a way of developing a strong relationship with another mom who can help out in those emergency situations like when you have to dash off to the medical center with one child but need another child looked after while you're gone. Building this strong relationship with another mom for your social reasons first can have enduring benefits.

, It may sound cliched but having a social life doesn't happen unless you choose to make it happen and that involves planning and allowing yourself the time to do something for yourself. Sit down and work out when you'd like time to have social events on your calendar; perhaps once a week, once a month, or tri-monthly – really it depends on you and what you personally feel is doable in your current situation. The one thing not to do is to think that it's too hard and to set it aside for next year; planning allows you to set the goal, deal with the logistics of booking in carers, tee up meeting other people and save up any money needed. Once you permit yourself to think this way, it will begin to fall into place.


Lower your household standards. Make things clean enough rather than super clean, tidy enough rather than immaculate. Cull the truly unnecessary tasks like perfect ironing, daily scrubbing and separating the whites in the wash. Think shortcuts about every household chore to gain yourself more time. Get the children to pick up after themselves, to be responsible for household chores and to be prepared to pitch in from as early an age as possible. With the chores being done to as ""good enough"" a standard as needed rather than being perfect and with each member of the household contributing in their own way, there will be more time for you.






Do you have a busy schedule focused intently on work and your children's activities just because you're frightened of those down times when you feel so alone? If this is the case (and be very honest with yourself), try to see the down times in a new light – these are now your potential social life moments!







, It's likely that you're concerned about spending money on your outing instead of on the bills, the children's needs and the running of the household. However, with careful planning and astute choices about what to do, you can have a great time out without spending a lot of money. Naturally, the things you do will need to fit with your interests but here are some ideas for starters:


Visit a museum or art gallery. Depending on where you live, some have free or low entry prices and many offer special discount days.






Visit the park. Take a picnic and have lunch with a friend you haven't caught up with in ages. The park can also offer entertainment if street theater is being performed or you can simply people watch. Consider exercising in the park, perhaps walking or running or using the athletics field. And last but not least, a lovely day in the park provides ample opportunities for lying on your back under a tree with a good novel and some daydreams, all minus interruptions from children.






Go dancing. Dancing can be a very affordable and fun way to spend time with friends or to meet new people. Avoid drinking too much and you'll save a lot of money and have a great time.






Eat on the cheap. Visit a local cafe, look for meal specials, or use restaurant vouchers to keep the prices down. Or indulge in your favorite pre-made gourmet foods and take them for a picnic in the park.






Attend a class. Going to night school one night a week to learn something new is both education and socializing. It's not everyone's idea of socializing but you do get to meet new people and share an interest and you pack a double punch with education and getting out all rolled into one! And not all classes are about book learning – how about learning to cook a new cuisine or how to taste wine?







Exercise. Your idea of socializing might be having the freedom to go to the gym regularly or to be part of a social sports team. This is a great way to relax and get fired up all at once, as well as spending time with people who also love the same exercise activity as you.






Attend plays, functions, the movies and the theater. Find reduced price tickets for more expensive events, or save up for one really special event you know you must see.






Visit a bookstore and simply browse in an uninterrupted, free way that reminds you of the days before children. Sip a coffee as you read the latest releases and appreciate just being able to do this.







Go window shopping in your favorite mall or high street. You might even find a bargain that you feel you can indulge yourself with.







, This may seem a little confronting at first but it's not about dating or purely adult-oriented occasions but about socializing with your children in ways that meet your socializing needs while still entertaining them. If there really is no other way to get you out of the house, bring them along. There are many places you can indulge in your interests where the children will be happy too, provided it's not too late at night. Think of such activities as showing them your love for music, art and natural history in the hope that they will be interested in it some day too. While they may seem less engaged at times, it's all settling in their mind somewhere.


Socialize with friends who have children so that you can all bring the children along. The children can play together and the adults can relax together.
Take the children for a hike, bike ride or picnic. Adjust the length of the walk or ride according to the youngest age in the group but don't use their age as an excuse to not go. Getting outdoors is energizing for all of you.
Go on a vacation together, even if it means simply throwing your gear in the car and traveling to the mom and pop motel in a local town. The change of environment will do you all good, the disrupted routine will feel refreshing and there will be a new side to mom that your children will see and realize that you're not just one-dimensional! Vacations are both social and learning experiences for the whole family and they don't need to break the bank (think camping for a weekend).

, If getting back into the dating scene is your thing, don't hesitate. Using the internet you can find your dream matches at home and meet up for a coffee after getting to know one another a little online. It isn't just people with kids who rely on internet dating – it's a convenient option for many people and while not all your choices will turn into a potential new love interest, someone just may well.


Be realistic and honest. If you do hit it off with someone, let them know early on that you're a single mom. If they don't accept the children in your life now, they probably never will and you don't have time to waste on them. And it can be helpful to find someone who has children too; they ""get"" what you're experiencing and will be much more understanding.






If you do intend dating someone, be aware that your availability for dates can make or break the relationship and if it soon becomes clear that you're not able to meet up that much, it's likely your date will lose interest, so you will need to be very up front about this aspect and not brush it off hoping your date won't notice!






Avoid connecting any transient dates with your children. Only introduce a date when it's absolutely clear that you both have serious intentions about one another.






Be careful. When meeting people for the first time in real life, always meet in a public place and don't go anywhere alone with them until you know them a lot better. Keep everything light and enjoyable to begin with; you really don't know where this headed when you first meet up.







, There are lots of single mom forums and sites you can join and they are fantastic resources for asking questions, getting information and simply sharing stories about your experiences. You'll learn how other single moms make time for themselves and some of their tips and tricks might work for you too. For some single moms, chatting online is a form of socializing and meeting new friends but just be careful not to substitute online life for all real life opportunities.


Websites such as Meetup.com will have events for single moms in your area and if you can't find one for where you live, opt to be an organizer of such events yourself. An ""event"" can be as simple as single moms getting together in the local cafe or something more elaborate as organizing pooled babysitting and going to a special restaurant, ball game, the movies or whatever you're all keen on doing together.
Other gathering opportunities for single moms can be found through your church, community centers and anywhere that arranges events for children where the moms can sit around and chat while the activities take place.

Use the 4 3/8in lag bolts with washers to attach the mount to the wall.,
Mount the TV onto the mounts.",How to Mount a Fireplace TV Bracket," To mount to your fireplace you will have to first make sure that your stone/brick is sturdy enough to hold the TV mount.;
, Research options for your space; you can find ones of different sizes and options, including those that move down to a more comfortable viewing level and can extend out over the fireplace.

, If mount does not include anchors, use one with that is 1/2″ diameter; thread: 3/8″-16; head width: 9/16″; washer OD: 1″ (drill size 1/2″). You will have to figure out the correct length for yourself, based on your mounts and surface.


It's best to use at least 3 of these in the top row; these anchors are the ones that do most of the work.
To drill into the stone/brick you will probably need a special drill called a hammer drill, which you can rent from the hardware store along with the correct size bit. Using the hammer drill is just as easy as using a regular drill.

, Measure out where the bottom of the mount will be. Use the mount as a template and mark the locations of the mounting holes. The mounting holes need to be in the center of the studs; use a stud finder as needed.


Put the level on the top edge of the hook plate where the attach arms hook onto. This edge should be level to help ensure a level TV.
2 mounting holes are needed in the top slots of the mount and 2 in the bottom slots.
2 mounting holes need to be on each side of the of the center of the mount and the center of gravity of the television.

, Once you know your location, pre-drill the 4 mounting holes 2.5in deep using the 1/4in drill bit.

, Tighten with a 9/16in box or socket wrench until the mount is firmly pressed against the wall. A friend makes this much easier. Do not over tighten.

, Make sure it's secure, and then wire it up as needed.

Talk to them.,
Offer your money openly if you can.,
Offer to loan them the money.,
Suggest paying it forward as a means of paying you back.,
Give them money anonymously.,
Offer to help out in other ways.,
Hire the person.",How to Help a Proud Person2," Seeing where someone is with their problems, and the steps they’re taking to rectify the situation is a good start for trying to help them out financially. You can share strategies you’ve used in similar situations before immediately jumping to give them money.For example, you might say something like, “I’ve struggled to pay my bills before and what helped me the most was getting help with things like buying food and paying my gas bill. Did you know that these kinds of resources were available?”

, If the person really needs money, they might just be too proud to ask. However, the person might accept money if you offer it in a sensitive way. When you offer them money, if you feel it is appropriate, you can let them know you don’t need to be repaid. For some this will be a relief. For others, it will feel like you’re pitying them.For example, you might say something like, “You have helped me in the past when I have been struggling, will you please allow me to help you now?”
If the person says that he or she wants to repay you and you do not want to be repaid, then you can just say something like, “Don’t worry about that right now.”

, If the person is too proud to take money from you straight out, then you may need to offer to loan them the money. This has some drawbacks though, as it can add financial pressure to their already strained wallet. Try your best to alleviate those fears by negotiating terms in a way that favors them but still allows them to pay you back. It can be difficult even so, so don’t push them.For example, you might try saying something like, “This is a loan, but you don’t have to worry about paying it back right away. Just focus on you for now.”

, This is an especially good tactic for those who are reluctant to take even a loan, as it obligates them to pay it forward in some way, but relieves them of the obligation to think about paying it back immediately. It will be something they can do once they’re back on their feet.For example, you can tell the person, “You don’t have to repay me, just promise that you will help someone else someday if you can.”

, Giving the money anonymously may save the person from feelings of embarrassment or shame, which are likely if the person is too proud to ask for help. It may also prevent any awkwardness between the two of you because of a loan or gift of money.You can leave a money order for the person in his or her mailbox. If you’re a part of a religious organization, then you can talk to your religious leaders to see if you can anonymously forward the money to them.

, You can also help the person by offering to help with tasks that they would usually need to pay for, such as by offering free childcare, lawn care, or personal services. This is an especially good option if they’ve helped you out in any of these ways before. The person will feel less like he or she is receiving charity, but they’ll have a bit of relief.Try saying something like, “Hey Karen! I wanted to pay you back for watching my kids last week. Can I watch your kids for you sometime when you need a babysitter?”

, If the person in financial need is unemployed or underemployed, then you could also offer them a job. Make sure that you pay them the same amount that you would pay anyone else. Do not pay more or less.For example, if the person is a contractor, then you might hire the person to do some repairs around your house. If the person is a teacher, then you might hire the person to tutor your kids.

Talk to them about your concerns.,
Share your experiences if you’ve experienced something similar.,
Show your support.,
Consider finding someone they respect to broach the topic with them.",How to Help a Proud Person3," If you notice a friend is withdrawing or just acting a lot differently than normal, ask them how they’re doing. Let them know they can talk to you. This will give them some space to express their feelings. They might feel alone on top of feeling too proud to ask anyone for help. They may have the sense that they should be able to figure it out on their own. So, let them know, they’re not alone.It’s important that you ask in a way that doesn’t sound like the typical pleasantries. Try saying “What’s going on with you right now?” or “I noticed you’ve been struggling lately. How can I help?”

, Sharing your experiences is a good way to let them know they aren’t alone. If they seem to be anxious or depressed, talk about a time when you felt that way. If you haven’t felt that way, try to find an experience that is at least somewhat similar. Don’t make it up. If needed, refer them to a friend who might be able to help them more than you can.Try saying something like, “I don’t know exactly what you’re going through, but I have experienced something similar.”

, Letting them know you’re on their side can be a big relief for some people. By being a support in other ways (cleaning, childcare, etc.), you can help take a load off and possibly encourage them to get the help they need. You can say something like “I’m here for you” or “I’ll check in tomorrow to see if I can help you with something.”For example, you might offer to cook dinner for the person one night by saying something like, “I am planning to try out a new recipe on Saturday. Would you like to come over to my house and join me for dinner?”

, Most people have at least one person who they look up to, such as a mentor, an educator, a boss, or a charismatic family member. Your friend might be more open to listening to someone who he or she looks up to. Find this person and get him/her to go up to the proud person and encourage him or her to accept help from others. This person might be able to convince your proud friend to seek help from you or someone else who can help."
"
Know your limitations and accept them.,
Maintain healthy boundaries.,
Respect their decisions.",How to Help a Proud Person4," Sometimes we can’t help someone, or at least not in the way they need. If they push back aggressively, or are taking too much from you in time, effort, etc., it may be time to step back. Even if they do accept your help, there’s only so much you as a friend can do. Sometimes therapy and medication is needed, and a friend can’t offer that.

Keep in mind that you can say no if you feel that someone is taking advantage of your kindness.
If you are worried about a friend or family member’s well-being, then you might talk to someone who can help, such as a teacher or a counselor.

, This means neither overstepping in helping them nor allowing them to overstep in asking for help, assuming they do. This is especially important with a proud person, as helping them too much may make them feel like you pity them or that you feel sorry for them. Instead, when possible, ask how you can help, and don’t attempt to do more than is requested.For example, if the person has reassured you that he or she is okay, then you should not keep pressing the person to accept your help. You might simply say something like, “I am always here for you if you need my help. Just let me know.”

, As much as you want to help them, it is important to give them the space to make their own decisions. Ultimately, it is their life, and they have the choice to get help when they need it or to reject that help. It might hurt, but being a friend sometimes means stepping back and letting your friend choose their own path."

Think about what you want to say.,
Get some feedback.,
Prepare yourself, mentally and emotionally.",How to Amicably End a Relationship2," Plan out in your mind exactly what you want to tell the person. This will help you be clear, and will also help you stay focused on what you need to say if you start to lose your courage.


Have answers ready for any questions you can anticipate the other person asking. He or she will almost certainly want to know why this is happening, and if there's any chance you will change your mind.Be specific about the grievances that have led you to this decision, and be clear about the fact that the relationship is over--this is not up for negotiation. Plan to say something like, ""Because of X, I need to break up with you,"" not ""I've been thinking maybe we need a break from each other.""

, If you can, talk over what you plan to say with a trusted friend beforehand.Ask your friend to tell you if anything seems unclear, and what questions they might anticipate the other person having.


You can also ask your friend if you are being too harsh, or if anything you are saying might give the other person false hope.

, Ending a relationship is hard. It will be difficult, both for you and the other person. Expect an emotional reaction, and do your best to steel yourself for it.


Think about what kind of support you may need after the conversation. Make plans in advance to do what you will need to do to take care of yourself.You may need some time alone afterwards. Or, you may want to meet with a friend. Think about what will be most helpful to you and make arrangements.

Set a time.,
Be gentle, but honest.,
Don't sugarcoat.,
Take responsibility.,
Provide a specific reason for the breakup.,
Listen to the other person.,
Don't argue.,
Keep control over your emotions.,
Be clear about the future.",How to Amicably End a Relationship3," Once you feel prepared, you need to let the other person know that you need to have a talk about something important. This way, you can be certain that he or she also has enough time and that you won't be interfering with an important public, business, or social engagement.


If you can help it, do not tell the other person you need to have this conversation until a few hours beforehand, at most. Especially if there are obvious issues in the relationship, the other person may spend a lot agonizing hours worrying about what's going to happen if you give him or her too much advance notice., Don't be unkind or accusatory, but tell the person in simple and straightforward terms that the relationship is over, and explain why.Be specific about why it didn't work out. This can be a learning opportunity for the other person.
For example, if you are breaking up with this person because he or she doesn't include you in other aspects of life (e.g. social outings with friends or meeting family), you might say: ""I haven't felt like I'm really part of your life. When you go out with your friends, I feel uninvited, and I feel that you haven't been inclusive when I've asked to go. I also feel concerned that you haven't introduced me to your family. It makes me feel like I'm not that important to you. I think you're a great person, but that's not the kind of relationship that's going to make me happy, so I need to move on.""
It is ok to be honest about your feelings about the breakup as well. If this is difficult for you, let the other person know. It can help both you and him or her feel better about the situation., While you want to be as kind as possible, you should not sugarcoat things or be too nice. This can send mixed signals that be confusing to the other person.It can lead him or her to hold onto hope that you may change your mind. This doesn't do the other person any favors in the long run.


It's possible for a breakup to be so nice that the other person doesn't realize what has happened. If this occurs, you'll have to go through the whole thing again.
You would not want to say, for example, ""I really love you, and I think this is something you need to work on."" This could be interpreted to mean that if he or she made some changes, you'd be willing to continue the relationship.

, In most cases, when a relationship ends, both parties bear some responsibility. It's very seldom only person's fault. Acknowledge your responsibility for the end of the relationship.For example, you might say, ""I probably should have spoken up more before now to let you know how I felt about these problems,"" or ""I know there's more I could have done to make you part of my life, too."" Statements like these will help the other person feel less as if she or he is being blamed for all the problems that have brought about the end of the relationship.

, Using the ""It's not you, it's me"" line can make the other person feel like you really are blaming him or her. Instead, provide a specific reason for the the breakup based on your needs, but don't feel like you have to tell the person every single reason why you want to break up.For example, you might say something like, ""I have noticed that I am becoming really critical of you and it is interfering with my ability to be a good boyfriend/girlfriend. That is not fair to you and it tells me that I am not ready for this kind of commitment.""

, You're not going to be the only person with something important to say in this conversation. Listen patiently and respectfully to the other person's response, and truthfully answer any questions she or he might have.


The other person's response may be emotional. He or she may wish to tell you about their feelings. There may be difficult questions. Be prepared for and accepting of all of this.For example, if the other person bursts into tears, you might say ""I understand that this probably hurts you a lot. I'm sorry this is so difficult for you.""

, While it is respectful to hear the other person out and answer any questions she or he may have, do not allow this to become an argument. This will benefit neither of you.If the other person starts making accusations or blaming you for the problems, you could say something like: ""I know I wasn't a perfect boyfriend/girlfriend either, but this is how I feel. I really don't want to have an argument about it.""
If the person tries to talk you into remaining in the relationship, you can say something like, ""I'm sorry, but my mind is made up, and I'm not going to change it.""

, However the other person responds, try to be the calm one in this situation. You've had time to prepare yourself, the other person has not.You may have very strong feelings about the relationship ending. The other person may react in a way that is hurtful to you. Regardless of how this plays out, take a deep breath and try to keep your emotions under control. Getting angry and having a fight now will definitely not promote an amicable split.

, Tell the other person, in straightforward terms, what type of relationship you would like to have with them in the future. If you hope to still be friends, say so. If you don't want to see her or him again for awhile (or ever) say that, too.For example, if you hope to stay friends, you could say something like: ""I hope after we both take a little time to heal, we can still be friends."" If you do not want to have the other person in your life at all, be honest. Say something like: ""I really think trying to be friends would be too difficult for me. It's probably best if we don't see each other anymore.""
Even if you want to stay friends, don't assume that will necessarily work out. The other person may not feel that way. Or, it may simply be too difficult for one or both of you."

Don't complain about your ex.,
Don't seek revenge.,
Divide any shared possessions fairly.,
Don't encourage lingering feelings.,
Avoid intimate contact.,
Give it time.",How to Amicably End a Relationship4," There are many mistakes that people make after a relationship is over that can prevent the split from being truly amicable. One of these is a tendency to complain about the other person.


If word gets back to the other person that you've been saying unkind things about him or her, this can be hurtful and ruin any chances of an amicable end to the relationship. You may have feelings you need to vent, but don't do it with anyone who is likely to share your comments with others.
Definitely do not complain about this person to mutual friends.Don't vent on social media, either. If you don't think you'll be able to resist the temptation, just stay off social media for a few days until you are calmer about the situation., If you feel you've been wronged by the other person in the relationship in some way, it can be very tempting after a breakup to seek revenge in some way. It should go without saying that if you want things to be amicable, this is unacceptable.Do not, for example, get romantically involved with a friend of other person as means of getting back at him or her. Do not post embarrassing pictures of him or her on the internet, or go around revealing information that was told to you in confidence.

, Where many breakups turn nasty is when it comes time to divide shared possessions and/or return things that belonged to the other person. This can be especially difficult if you live with the other person. Approach this as calmly as possible, and be fair.


Give back anything that legitimately belongs to the other person.
Try to find a mutually agreeable compromise with shared belongings, asking, for example: ""How would you feel if I took X and you take Y?""
If the other person really wants something and it isn't that important to you, it may be worth just letting him or her have it. If it's not worth a fight, consider just letting it go., If the other person still has feelings for you and wants to get back together, do not encourage these feelings in any way, unless you are seriously considering getting back together.


Sending mixed signals may be hard to avoid if you feel conflicted, but do your best. It isn't fair or respectful to the other person to string him or her along if you don't actually want to get back together.Even if you still have lingering feelings for the other person, or still find him or her attractive, you should keep that to yourself. It might make you feel good to say it in the moment, and it may even feel good for the other person to hear it in the short-term. However, this can make it harder for the other person to move on with life, which can lead to resentment and anger after a while.

, Ending a relationship can be scary, for both parties. As a result, it's not uncommon for people to seek out the familiarity of intimate contact with someone they've recently broken up with. This should be avoided.


Making out or having sex with someone you've just broken up with can feel good at the time. In the long run, though, it keeps you both from moving forward and can make the situation more painful and difficult for both of you., Even if you want to remain friends with the other person, expect and accept that you will probably need some time apart before this can happen. Recovering from a breakup is a painful process and it can take a long time.Even if you are happy about the break up, your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend might be heartbroken. He or she will recover, but it will take a while, so try to be patient.


Trying to be friends right away can make it harder for one or both of you to move on with your lives. Wait until you are sure that you and your ex are ready to be friends. This may take a few months or even years.

Try not to overreact if the perfectionist annoys you.,
Note specific instances where you had a problem with the perfectionist.,
Focus on the positives of living with a perfectionist.,
Suggest the perfectionist seek professional help if they get out of control.",How to Live With a Perfectionist2," Though it can be challenging to live with a perfectionist, you should try to not to snap or freak out if the perfectionist annoys you. Take a few deep breaths and then ask the perfectionist if you can discuss the issue together in an open and respectful way.You may propose that you both practice active listening and take turns listening to each other discuss the issue. Doing this will keep the conversation civil and help you both reach a compromise.
For example, you may start by saying to the perfectionist, ""I am struggling with your expectations for maintaining the kitchen. I work late and am not able to clean up until the morning. But I am aware that waking up to a dirty kitchen annoys you and you then nag me about it. Is there a way we can compromise on this issue?""
You should then listen intently while the perfectionist responds to your question. Do not interrupt the perfectionist or cut her off. Work together to come up with a compromise, rather than fight about the issue.

, Avoid generalized statements when you discuss any issues with the perfectionist, such as “You always want everything perfect” or “Nothing I do is ever up to your perfect standards.” Instead, focus on specific instances where you feel the perfectionist overstepped your boundaries and upset you with a need for perfection.


For example, you may notice that the perfectionist always complains about how you wash the dishes or clear the table. You may then say to the perfectionist, “I’ve noticed that you have been commenting on how I wash the dishes. I think I do a pretty good job, even if they are not perfect. Can we come to a compromise about this?”
You should bring up issues as soon as they occur and avoid keeping your discomfort to yourself. This way, you can both address the issue and resolve it right away. Doing this also prevents you from feeling resentful or angry at the perfectionist.

, There are actually many positives to living with a perfectionist and focusing on them may help you to appreciate the perfectionist, especially in moments of conflict. Perfectionists are often goal driven and pay attention to the small details, which means they tend be reliable and trustworthy individuals. Because they are driven to do things perfectly, this also means they focus on doing things the right way, with no short cuts. Often perfectionists will help others get things done and show others how to do things properly.You may want to think about an instance where the perfectionist took the time to help you do something properly or helped you focus on the small, important details of a situation. For example, maybe you forgot to send important mail but the perfectionist ended up doing it for you to ensure you did not miss an important deadline. Or, maybe the perfectionist helped you fix an issue with your car and spent time doing it the right way so you do not have issues with it anymore.

, Sometimes perfectionism can be taken to the extreme and result in medical conditions like obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder. If you notice the perfectionist is becoming more and more intense and demanding of you and of others, and this seems to correlate with outside stress or anxiety, you may want to suggest she get professional help.You should do this by sitting the perfectionist down in a quiet, private area. Start by noting that her perfectionism appears to be getting more intense and that it is becoming more challenging to live with her. You may then let her know that there is professional help available if she is struggling with other issues, like anxiety, stress, or depression, that may be triggering her perfectionism.
Many perfectionists have a hard time admitting they are having problems, as they do not want to be seen as imperfect. If you notice something seems off with the perfectionist or she seems to be crippled or trapped by her perfectionism, you may want to suggest she see a therapist or a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist may then diagnosis the perfectionist with OCD or a panic disorder and recommend treatment options so their issues do not spiral out of control.

, Do not allow the blade to nick the center conductor as you continue to cut around the center conductor.

,, Grasp the the cable between the end and the fresh cut. Firmly pull the end off of the cable while twisting the end back and forth.,,, If it is nicked, it will be required to repeat the above steps until you are able to perform the steps without damaging the center conductor. It may take 6, 10 or more attempts before it can be done successfully if never attempted before.
, Be sure the center conductor is clean all the way around over it's entire length.
, There are different types of ""F"" connectors and ways to attach them to the cable. Most common ""F"" connectors can be attached to cables prepared with the dimensions used here and should be used unless the connectors you are using specifies a different dimension., The purpose of this cut is to penetrate the jacket only, and leave the braid intact. The cut will be perpendicular to the cable like the first cut. Many ""F"" connectors specify that the braid not be removed, while others prefer it removed. Plan to leave it in place for now, as it can be removed later, if needed. The braids are woven around the length of the dielectric foam, and lie just beneath the outer jacket. The individual wires that make up the braid are thinner than a hair, and are easily cut. Gently press the blade into the jacket and run it around the cable, in the same manner as was done in the first cut to the center conductor. Once the blade has cut around the circumference of the jacket, press the tip of the blade against the jacket at this cut and gently cut towards the end of the cable. Again, try not to cut the braid., Peel the 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) jacket off of the cable, leaving only the braid covering the dielectric., This should expose the dielectric, which surrounds the center conductor. There is no concern if some of the braid wires were cut. Check the requirements (if any) of the ""F"" connector you will place on the end of the cable., It is very important that there are no wires, filings or other conductive bits between the center conductor and the braid. The white dielectric should show anything that bridges these two parts easily. Remove anything found., Make one final inspection by looking into the connector. Make sure that no conductive debris is between the center conductor and the ""F"" connector before securing to the cable., It should not extend beyond or be recessed more than 1⁄16 inch (0.2 cm) from the bottom of the connector. Under no circumstances should the center conductor be in contact with the ""F"" connector.,

On the back of your computer, you'll see multiple ports and connectors. Video connectors may be located near the USB, speaker, and Ethernet connections, or you may have a separate graphics card further down the back of the computer. There are three main connectors that you want to look for on your computer:HDMI - This is the current standard for connecting HD devices, and most modern computers will have an HDMI port on the back. HDMI carries both picture and audio. The HDMI port looks like a longer USB port.
DVI - This is a digital connection that uses pins. DVI connectors are rectangular and have three rows of eight pins each. DVI only transfers the image signal.
VGA - This is the old standard for connecting display devices. It is a trapezoidal connection with 15 pins arranged in three rows, and is typically blue. Avoid using this connection if you have access to DVI or HDMI, as VGA is the lowest-quality. VGA only transfers the image signal, and cannot display HD images.;
, Once you know the types of connections your computer supports, you'll need to find out what types of connections your TV supports. Most TVs have input ports on the back of the TV, though some have ports along one of the sides.


Most modern HDTVs have one or more HDMI ports. This is the quickest and most pain-free way to connect, and also provides the best quality. HDMI is the only connection method that transfers both audio and video through one cable.
DVI is not as common anymore, but can still be found on many HDTVs and standard definition TVs.
VGA is typically not available on HDTVs, but can be found on standard definition TVs.

, This will help you select the correct input when switching to your computer's display.

, Buying a cable can be a confusing experience, as companies often throw buzzwords around to make their cables seem better than the competition. When it comes down to it, most people won't notice a difference between a cheap and an expensive cable. If you're buying HDMI, the cable either works or it doesn't, so a $5 cable will result in the same quality as an $80 cable.


If you don't have a matching connector on both your computer and your TV, you'll need an adapter. For example, if you have a DVI connector on your computer but only have an HDMI port on your TV, you can get a DVI-to-HDMI adapter or cable. In this case, the HDMI wouldn't transfer any audio since DVI doesn't support audio.

, If you are connecting HDMI to HDMI, you won't need any other cables. If you are connecting using a different method, you'll need an audio cable as well.


To connect an audio cable from a laptop, use a 3.5mm audio cable and connect it to the Headphone jack on your laptop. On a desktop, use the green audio jack on the back of the computer. When connecting the audio cable to the TV, you may be able to use a single 3.5mm audio plug or the stereo (RCA) 2-plug cable.
If you're connecting via VGA, turn your computer and TV off first. For DVI and HDMI, you don't need to worry about turning your equipment off.

, Make sure to select the input that you connected the cable to on your TV. Most TV remotes have an ""Input"" or ""Source"" button that will allow you to choose.

, There are several ways that you can do this, depending on the type of computer that you are using.


Many laptops have a ""Display"" key that will switch between connected displays. You may need to press the Fn key to access it, and it may just have a symbol instead of the word ""Display"".
In Windows 7 and later, you can press the Windows key + P to open the Project menu. You can then select which display mode you want to use (computer, TV, extended desktop, or duplicate displays).
In any version of Windows, you can right-click on the desktop and select ""Screen Resolution"" or ""Properties"". The ""Multiple displays"" menu will allow you to select between the different display modes (computer, TV, extended desktop, or duplicate displays).

, Your computer's monitor and your TV may have different resolutions, and your TV's display may be blurry when you switch over. Use the ""Resolution"" slider in the ""Screen Resolution/Properties"" window to select a clear resolution.


Most HDTVs have a native resolution of 1920x1080. Select the ""Recommended"" resolution if possible.

, Some tuners come with an antenna built-in. Your cable box or external antenna can be connected using the coaxial connector on the tuner.


If you wish to keep your cable box connected to your TV, but also want to connect it to your computer, you will need a coaxial cable splitter


, Some tuners allow you to connect an external A/V source, such as a DVD player, to your TV tuner. This allows you to turn your computer into an all-in-one entertainment center.

, If necessary, you may need to install the software that came packaged with the tuner. Most tuners come with the software on the disc, though you can usually download the software as well from the manufacturer's support page.


Windows Media Center supports TV tuners as well.

, Start the TV tuner software and follow the instructions to scan for available channels. If you are using an antenna, the channels you receive will depend on the signal strength., Many tuners allow you to record what you are watching to your computer hard drive. This can take a lot of space, but allows you to watch your shows again whenever you want.

Knowing which connection type you have will help you figure out what equipment you need.HDMI - The HDMI port looks like a longer, slimmer USB port, with small indents on each side. The port will have ""HDMI"" printed above it. This is the current standard for connecting HD devices, and most Macs and MacBooks made after 2012 have this port. HDMI does not require any special adapters.
Thunderbolt - This is a port slightly smaller than a USB port. It will have a small lightning bolt icon printed above it. You will need a Thunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter to connect to most HDTVs.
Mini DisplayPort - This port looks identical to the Thunderbolt port. The logo is a small box with a line on each side.
Micro-DVI - This is one of the older ports that you may encounter. The icon is the same as the Mini DisplayPort, but the port looks like a smaller USB port.

, They may be located on the back or along the side. The most common TV input ports are HDMI, DVI, and VGA. If you can connect HDMI-to-HDMI, you'll only need one cable for both video and audio. For all other connections, you'll need a separate audio cable.


Make note of the input label so that you can easily switch the TV to it later.

, Once you know the port that your Mac has and the connection that your TV supports, you can get the adapter that you need.If your Mac has an HDMI port and your TV has an HDMI port, all you need is a standard HDMI cable.
If your TV supports HDMI but your Mac has a Thunderbolt or Mini DisplayPort, you'll need a Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter.

, Once you have your adapter, you can get the right cable. If your adapter goes to HDMI, get any HDMI cable. Cheap HDMI cables will work just as well as expensive ones. If you are connecting via DVI or VGA, you'll need an audio cable as well as the video cable.

, Connect the video adapter to the display port on your Mac.

, If both the computer and the TV have HDMI ports, just use a standard HDMI cable to connect the two.


If you aren't using HDMI to connect to the TV, you'll need an audio cable to get the sound from your Mac to your TV or home theater system. Use a 3.5mm audio cable to connect the Headphone jack on your Mac to the Audio In port on your TV or receiver.

Remember, your old TV doesn't have its own OS and web browser. It doesn't have the ability to connect to the Internet. Your old desktop or tablet PC will serve this function.
If you don't have a spare device sitting around, and you don't want to spend a lot of money buying a new computer, you can always buy a cheap tablet PC with HDMI output.

, If your computer or smart phone has HDMI output, connect the device to your TV using a standard HDMI cable. Note that for smaller devices, you may need to use a mini or micro HDMI adapter.


If your system does not have HDMI output, then you need a VGA monitor cable and an audio cable to connect to your TV. The VGA cable is to provide video output, and the audio cable is to provide sound output. The HDMI cable is capable of provide both sound and image output, so you need only one cable for this to work.

, Use the full-screen mode for best results. Your old TV has just become a smart TV!

, If it supports that, then you can buy devices such as Chrome Cast, Apple TV and many others.

, This will allow you to stream movies and surf the internet. This will take your old television experience to new level. All you have to do is connect device with TV by USB or HDMI cable and then you are all set to do the things which you can do with a smart TV.

Part with your TV for good.",How to Turn off the TV During Summer," Wrap the cable up and use twist ties to firmly hold the cord looped around. Make it an absolute hassle to unravel it and put it back.


Every time you give in and do unravel this cord, be sure to restore the cord to its tied-up position again. This will form aversion training, as you'll get sick and tired of the tying up and unraveling each time and will soon feel disinclined to sneak in any more TV watching.;
, If it's likely that you'll feel tempted to keep watching a range of missed episodes, interesting movies, sports events and other things if you have cable TV, consider unsubscribing for summer. Removing the temptation might be the push you need. You'll be left with free-to-air, and that's a fairly daunting prospect during the dead summer season, helping you to stay away.

, This is key to surviving a summer with the TV turned off. Draw up a schedule of things you'd love to be doing. Make sure to add these things into all the slots when you'd be tempted to watch TV. Examples of activities to escape into include:


Walk through your cityscape and local parks
Have evening and weekend picnics
Take up new sports or rediscovering old ones
Go to outdoor cinema events or foreign language film festivals
Spend time volunteering with the homeless, a hospice, an animal welfare shelter or in the local soup kitchen
Start a new website, app, online venture
Plan and start a new business
Write a book or a series of short stories or poems
Research something you want to know more about
Take up cooking, baking or mastering chef standard recipes
Invite friends over for parties, conversations, pole dancing, a swim, a beer tasting night or a gaming event
Help your family renovate their house or renovate your own
Look for a new job by doing work experience in the evenings
Go for long strolls, plan hiking weekends away
Start a political campaign
Exercise more, join a gym, get super fit
Make crafts or do artwork
Pursue a hobby
Spend more time with people you haven't seen for ages
Completely change your soft furnishings for new ones; spend summer planning and looking for new items
Read lots of books, magazines, poems, studies, etc.
Join a drama group and be part of a summer play presentation
Travel; go somewhere far away and keep away from TVs
Get another job and earn extra cash for something you've really wanted
And many other things!

, Make a bet to see who can stay off TV the longest over summer. Wager with money, a favorite item or something else that will be hard to part with!

, Throw something over it so that it is no longer prominent in your room, like a scarf, cape or blanket. Or, hide it behind cupboard doors or put it somewhere else completely, like up in the attic. Getting it out of sight might reduce the desire to watch it.

, If you still find yourself watching pointless local TV stations, sell or give away your TV. By parting ways, there is absolutely no way you will be able to watch TV over summer. Just be sure to have the cash to buy a new one when the season changes. Although, by then, you might be a whole new person who isn't keen on TV at all!

",How to Scan for DTV Channels Using a Digital TV Converter Box," If you are using rabbit ears that you have to adjust differently for each channel, you might wish to ask a neighbor who has a good rooftop TV antenna if you can temporarily connect your DTV converter box to his antenna to do the scan (most good DTV converter boxes will ""remember"" the channel scan information even if you unplug the power to take it back to your house).;
, Some remote control units have a button for ""CH SCAN"", while for others you must enter the ""MENU"" mode and navigate to the ""AUTO CHANNEL SCAN"" or ""AUTO TUNING"" function. The first scan after June 12, 2009 should be a ""full"" auto scan, not a ""channel add"" scan. A ""full"" scan completely re-scans, removing previously memorized channel frequencies (since many channels used for DTV broadcast changed on June 12, 2009).

, The DTV converter box will examine all the TV channel frequencies (2 through 69) and if it finds a DTV broadcast, it will memorize the that frequency and the call letters and DTV virtual channel number associated with it.

, The virtual channel number appears first, then a dash (-), then subchannel numbers starting with 1. If you expect to see a channel 11, for example, be sure that ""11-1"" is one of the channels that appears as you traverse the channels.

When working from an attic space, it will be significantly easier to access a wall space on the floor below by working either an interior wall or, the exterior wall that is on the gable end of the structure.,
When working from a basement, inspection of the area in contact with the foundation or sill will be required.,
Cut the bottom straight portion off from a metal coat hanger.,
Chuck the ""bit"" into an electric drill - with the 45 degree angle out - it will serve as the cutting edge.

,
From inside the living space, position the bit against the wall directly above (if accessing from attic) or below (if accessing from basement) the desired location of the service the cable will provide.

,
Protect the wall with a thin piece of cardboard, etc.,
If drilling downward through the floor, repeat the above procedure, but expect to pass through 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) sub-floor and up to an additional 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) of finish floor (hardwood, etc).,
Go to the space into which the drill was boring.,
Repeat as required until the bit is located.

,
While in the space drilled into, using the bit as a locator for the wall above or below (as the case may be), select a spot TWO inches ""back"".

,
It is very important to know which direction ""back"" is.,
Mark the spot with pencil, etc.

,
Remove the ""bit"" from hole and chuck in drill again.

,
Drill with the ""bit"" on the mark that was two inches ""back"".

,
Run the drill until 6 or more inches have been pushed into the hole.

,
Verify that the bit is NOT protruding through the ceiling, doorway, floor space, etc.

,
Mark the spot that ""bit"" is in and withdraw the bit completely.

,
If the ""bit"" appeared where not expected, try again until successful.

,
Chuck a drill bit sized to allow the cable to pass easily through the hole it creates.,
Carefully drill the spot made above.,
Once the resistance of boring through wood and possibly nails eases up, withdraw the drill and push a snake or fish tape into the hole.,
Once sure where in the wall the snake is, trace an old-work switch box on the wall at the same height as other boxes in the room.

,
Cut out the tracing on the wall.,
Once it is in your hand, have the helper slowly withdraw it until you have the end.

,
Pull the snake out of the wall.

,
Connect durable string, wire, etc to the snake and secure with tape for use as a ""pull"".,
Have the helper connect the the new cable or wire(s) to the ""pull"".

,
Withdraw the ""pull"" while your helper guides and feeds the new cable into the hole.

,
Pull enough cable or wire(s) to work with and press into the box's opening.

,
Secure the box into the wall.

,
Terminate the cable or wire(s) to the proper device and trim out with a wall plate.

,
Connect the other end of the cable or wire(s) to appropriate splitter, multi-switch, transformer, terminals etc.

",How to Run TV Cables in Wall Spaces from the Attic or Basement Space," It will be next to impossible to drill downward under the portion of the roof that slopes to the attic floor, without a ""right-angle drill"".;
, Some exterior walls are more accessible above one basement wall than another due to the way floor joists are installed. Either way, room to drill up from below will be required, unless opening the finished wall above to drill down is acceptable.

, Clip one end at about a 45 degree angle to form a long ""drill bit""

,,, and while loosely guiding the bit with one hand, apply even pressure with the other holding the drill while running it. If drilling up, through the ceiling, expect to pass through a thin coat of plaster and 5/8"" of sheet rock and 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of strapping to which the sheet rock is secured. After that, drilling should be noticeably easier. You may need to withdraw the drill and clip the end again to make a new sharp edge. Continue drilling until 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so have been pushed into the hole. Once through - do NOT pull the drill out - unchuck the ""bit"" and leave in place.

, Once 2 inches (5.1 cm) have been penetrated, it should be much easier to drill. Continue drilling until 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so have been pushed into the hole. If not it is possible that the drill bit aligned with a floor joist. Do not pull the bit out - but unchuck it from the drill instead and leave in place.

, Locate the the ""bit"". Remove any insulation in the general area to make the bit easier to locate. If unable to locate the bit, repeat the drilling process after moving to a spot a couple of inches away from the first hole.

,,, If the correct direction is chosen, it would be ""back"" into the wall space, as opposed to 2 inches (5.1 cm) in front of the wall space - in the ceiling.

,,,,,,,, This bit should be at least as long as the amount of the coat hanger ""bit"" that was needed to penetrate the space.

, Balance the speed of the bit and the pressure applied on the drill as needed. Avoid high speed drilling operation as if things go wrong, they'll happen much quicker at high speed (and do more damage as a result)!

, Push in as much as needed plus a couple of feet to reach the desired location. Go to the living space and determine where the snake is while a helper shakes the snake in the wall space.

,, Reach into the space and grab the snake. If unable to grab the snake, make sure it has been pushed far enough into the hole and have the helper shake the snake again until you are able to grab it.

,,, Have the helper pull the snake out of the hole.

Turn on your TV.","How to Properly Use ""S"" Video Cables"," S-video cables connect a component (something that generates video, like a DVD player) with a screen (like your television).


S-video input slots are circular with several small holes clustered around the middle of the port. Both your component and your TV must have S-video inputs for you to use S-video cables.;
, This will determine which specific S video cable to buy and whether or not you will need an adapter.


S video inputs can be either 4, 7, or 9 pin.
If your component S-video input has 7 holes (a 7-pin configuration) and your TV S-video input has 4 holes (a standard 4-pin configuration), for example, you'll need a 4-pin to 7-pin adapter.

, S-Video cables tend to be much cheaper than their high-definition counterparts.


A gold-plated connector won't oxidize over time (unlike a silver- or copper-plated connector), so while buying a more expensive cable won't affect your picture quality, it may make for longer cable life.High-quality cables are usually cheaper online than in a store. Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy are reputable online providers.

,


If you have multiple components that need connecting, such as a VCR and a receiver, purchase an ""S-video cable splitter"" in addition to more S-video cables. Splitters should cost around $5., If you try to swap out cables with your TV on, you can damage your set.

, Your TV quality can suffer from having too many video inputs plugged in at once so it's best to start with zero.

, The S-video slot is round with a series of small round holes clustered around the middle, to match the number of pins on your S-video cable. The small pins on the cable should go in the top of the input.


If your TV requires a different number of pins than your component (or vice versa), count the pins first to make sure you're plugging in the correct end of the cable.

, Use an adapter if your setup requires it.

, These could be red and white composite cables (in which case leave the yellow video cable unplugged) or a higher-end setup.

, Your DVD player (for instance) should be fully on before you turn on your TV.

, If your DVD video appears, you plugged in the S-video cable properly!


You may have to switch your TV's default input channel after changing to S-video. To do this, press the ""Input"" or ""Source"" button on your TV or TV remote.

In addition to cable or satellite, you may want the capability to display images from your computer and other video devices such as a DVD, Wii, and DV-R. Also, you will have to consider the audio and visual out signals that you may want— now or in the future. Your household might really be thrilled if you were to install and hook up a surround sound system.


You can go in-wall with your wiring or can conceal it in somewhat attractive wall-mounted conduits.
Sketch everything out and have contingency plans in case you are not able to make things work exactly as planned. You will need cubbyholes, shelving, or cabinetry for the associated electronic devices and, probably, storage for your media. Do detailed planning before you proceed and make sure to get the spouse, kids, and roommates on board with all elements of the plan.

, Although walls may look similar, they can actually be built from a variety of materials using differing construction methods. It is most likely that your home is of wood framed construction with wood studs in the walls on 16"" centers. You will need to verify the construction in order to form a reasonable approach to mounting the flat screen TV. If your wall has studs, follow the section below for ""Mounting with studs."" If not, skip down a bit to learn how to hang your TV on a wall without studs.

, You can do this by using a stud finder. Some stud finders find the edge of the stud, others find the middle of the stud. It is important for you to know which type you have.


Additionally, it is important to know if your wall is built using metal or wooden studs. You can find this out by locating a stud and drilling a tiny hole through wall finish in a location that wouldn't be noticeable.

, Using your stud finder, make sure that you have two available studs that are aligned properly in order to ensure a successful mount. Make sure that you have two that are close enough to each other to provide proper mounting points.


After you find the studs with your stud finder, double check them using a hammer and a small nail. This will also assure you that they are wood (not metal).
Mark the studs by drawing a line in light pencil on the wall, along the edges or center of each stud.

, Before making any holes in your wall, make sure that you can properly attach your brackets to your TV. Most TV mounting kits will come with a set of mounting hardware that you can use for this.


To begin, lay your TV glass-side down on a soft surface, such as a blanket or a pillow.
You should see three or four threaded holes on the back of your TV.
Once you find these holes, take your brackets and line them up on the holes, then bolt them so they are equally spaced.
Then you just secure the brackets using a Phillips-head screwdriver.

, Pick a visually appropriate location and, if you are centering the TV on a space, mark the calculated edge positions, then have someone hold the TV in place while you judge if the location needs to be adjusted. Take a measurement from where the bracket will touch the mount on the wall, to the bottom of the TV. This will help you determine the proper wall mount height (vertical location).


Make sure that the holes line up with the lines that mark the stud location.

, Next, based upon the measured location of your TV, drill a hole into your stud that will be used to attach the mount. Once you drill the first hole, use a level to make sure the next mount hole is horizontally aligned with the one you just made. Mark the next hole, then double check with the level, adjusting the mark if necessary.


Remember, unless you want your TV to hang crooked, use a level to ensure proper alignment.

, Moving vertically, down from the two holes that you just drilled, determine where to drill the two lower mounting holes. These should be directly underneath the two upper ones, along a plumb line. Mark where you will drill the two holes, and double check with your level that these two holes are horizontally aligned. Drill the holes.

, Using the holes that you drilled, attach the mounts to the wall. The TV will hang from these, so verify that each mount is plumb and that none is crooked.


It will be clear if your screws are going into the stud properly. You will feel them ""biting"" into the stud, rather than just spinning loosely as when you have missed the stud. Eventually, the screws should tighten and stop turning. If not, try a different location. It is important that the mounts are secure because they will be supporting substantial weight.

, There are usually hooks on top of the brackets attached to the back of your TV. Hang the TV on the wall mounts.


There are usually two screws that need to be tightened that will secure each bracket to a mount. Make sure these are installed and properly tightened.

, If you have installed the mounts properly, the TV should look completely level. If not, check the horizontal alignment with a level. If the level shows that the TV is indeed level, find out which horizontal line in the room is making the TV appear crooked. You may decide to rehang the TV, splitting the difference between what you see and what the level says. Remember that it does not really matter whether the TV is level or not.— It matters what your eye perceives.

, Before making any holes in your wall, make sure that you can properly attach your brackets to your TV. Most TV mounting kits will come with a set of mounting hardware that you can use for this stage.


To begin, lay your TV glass-side down on a soft surface, such as a blanket or a pillow.
You should see four threaded holes on the back of your TV.
Once you find the four holes, take your brackets and line them up on the bolt holes so they are equidistant from one another.
Then you just screw your brackets in using an appropriate screwdriver.

, Take a measurement from where the bracket will touch the mount on the wall, to the bottom of the TV. This will help you know where the TV will be located on the wall.

, Hold your mount against the wall. Use a pencil to trace the holes of the mount. Then, remove mount from wall, leaving behind several pencil marks on wall that denote where the holes or grooves in the mount are.

, Based upon the measured location of your TV, drill a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) hole into your wall that will be used to attach the mount. Once you drill your first hole, use a level to make sure the next mount hole will be horizontally even with the one you just made. Mark the next hole after double checking with the level.


Remember, unless you want your TV to hang crooked, use a level to ensure proper alignment.

, Moving vertically, down from the two holes that you just drilled, determine where to drill the two lower mounting holes. These should be directly underneath the two upper ones, in a straight line. Mark where you will drill the two holes, and double check with your level that these two holes are horizontally aligned. Drill the holes.

, Your 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) holes will accommodate your snap toggles. To use them, first bend the top part of the metal portion so that it is flush with the plastic tail. Then, insert your snap toggles into the holes. Finally, manipulate the tail by pushing, until the metal part becomes horizontal.


Make sure to put all four of your snap toggles in.

, In order to secure the snap toggle to the wall, slide the plastic sleeve down the plastic tail that is protruding from the wall. This will squeeze the surface of the wall in between the flat metal ""T"" head of the snap toggle, and the plastic tail, securing the toggle. Additionally, this pushed down piece of plastic will provide a hole for the bolt to go through.


Then, snap off the plastic ends of the toggle in order to create a flush surface with the wall.
In order to ensure that the toggles are installed properly, make sure the plastic mounts on the outside of the toggles are level. Keep them loose while you make sure that they are level, tightening them one at a time.

, Once the plastic portion is pushed down and tails have been snapped off, insert bolts into the snap toggles. The bolts will go through the center of the plastic portion of the snap toggle, and then will secure themselves in the metal ""T"" section of the toggle that is within the wall. Screw the bolt tight, forcing the metal ""T"" to tighten against the wall. This will secure the mounting bolts.

, There are hooks on top of the brackets that you attached to the back of your TV. Hang the TV brackets onto the mounts that you installed in the wall.

, Make sure all the hardware is tightened and visually check the TV's alignment from afar. If you have installed the mounts properly, the TV should look completely level. If not, check the horizontal alignment with a level. If the level shows that the TV is indeed level, find out which horizontal line in the room is making the TV appear crooked. You may decide to rehang the TV, splitting the difference between what you see and what the level says. Remember that it does not really matter whether the TV is level or not.— It matters what your eye perceives.

Measure a TV diagonally, from corner to corner, to get a measurement that manufacturers use.,
Measure from screen to screen, not from bezel to bezel.,
Get the measurements of the overall width, height and depth of the TV set as well.,
Allow for extra space when you fit a TV into a tight area.,
Understand aspect ratio and how it relates to TV size.,
Perform a simple calculation to match the screen size of a standard TV to that of a widescreen TV.,
Know how far away to place relevant seating depending on the size of your TV.",How to Measure a TV," You might think that a 32 inch (81 cm) TV is 32 inches wide, from bottom left to bottom right. Not so. A 32 inch TV is 32 inches (81 cm) from bottom left to top right, or bottom right to top left.;
, Some people make the mistake of running their tape measures from the outside corner of the TV bezel, or frame, to the opposite corner of the bezel. This will give you a wrong number. Instead, measure diagonally from the corner where the screen ends to the opposite corner where the screen ends. Because the bezel of the TV is almost ways bigger than the screen, measuring from bezel to bezel will end up giving you wrong number.

, Measure the full size of the whole TV (including bezel), and not just the screen. These measurements will come in handy when you try to fit your new TV into an existing space or entertainment center.

, Say you're thinking about buying a 46 inch (117 cm) TV. It is approximately 44.5 inches (113 cm) wide and 25 inches (63.5 cm) tall. It might technically fit into your entertainment center, which is 45 inches wide and 45 inches tall, but it would probably make too snug of a fit to look aesthetically pleasing. Opt for a 40 inch (102 cm) TV instead if you intend on fitting it inside your entertainment center.

, Aspect ratio is the ratio of the display image’s width to its height. There's a difference in aspect ratio between older, standard TV models and newer, widescreen models. Most standard TVs use an aspect ratio of 4:3 for their screens. That means for every 4 inches of width of screen, you will have 3 inches of height. The newer widescreen TVs normally use an aspect ratio of 16:9. This means for 16 inches of width, you have 9 inches of height.


Even though a standard (4:3) TV and a widescreen (16:9) TV could have the same diagonal measurement, such as a 32-inch screen for both, the total area of the screen would be different. The standard TV will have a bigger screen area and the image will be more square, while the widescreen TV will have a more horizontal image.
Widescreen TVs came about after TV producers started tinkering with the aspect ratio in an effort to attract more viewers to movies.Widescreen (16:9) aspect ratios show a bigger picture with the opportunity for bolder backdrops.

, If you currently have a 4:3 TV and you want to continue watching 4:3 on a widescreen TV, multiply the diagonal length of the older TV model by 1.22. The result would be the diagonal screen size that the widescreen TV would have to be to match the old model.


Say you have a 40 inch (102 cm) TV with a 4:3 aspect ratio, but you're thinking about upgrading and you don't want your screen size to get smaller. You'd need to get at least a 50 inch (127 cm) screen to view in 4:3 without your picture getting smaller. That's because 1.22 x 40 = 49. Since 49 inch TVs are generally not made, you'd need to go up to 50 inches (127 cm).

, Once you've got the size of the TV squared away, the final piece of the puzzle is choosing how far away to place seating. Follow this guidewhen placing seating:

Obtain a correctly-sized bracket either online or at an electronic retail store.,
Remove the base that comes with the TV if it is attached.,
Lay the TV on its face (glass down) on a soft, padded, flat item.,
Look for the four holes on the back of the TV.,
Put the mounting brackets on the back of the TV, aligning them as stated in your mounting directions.,
Use a screwdriver to tighten any remaining bolts.",How to Mount a Flat Screen TV1," Any major electronic retailer should be able to help you with this purchase if you have questions. Generally, brackets come in a size range. This means you can buy a bracket that fits a range of TVs.


For example, you might purchase a bracket that fits 32 to 56 inch (81.3 to 142.2 cm) televisions. Any flatscreen TV within this size range should fit the bracket, unless otherwise stated.





;
, If the base is not already attached when you open the box, do not put it on; you'll just have to take it off later.

, If you have any reservations about laying your plasma TV glass-down on the carpet or floor, check the owner's manual for guidance. Some plasma screen manufacturers recommend working with the flat screen facing upright while attaching the brackets.

, Those are where you will place the bracket you purchased. There might be three pieces to your mount. The two small brackets will attach to your TV.


Remove any screws plugging the holes if necessary. Many TVs manufacturers plug their mounting holes with screws during assembly.

, Make sure that the brackets are facing the correct way when screwed to the TV.

, The bracket should be firmly bolted to the TV, without any wiggle room. You may need to use some washers that come with the bracket to get a tight fit.

Find the studs in your wall.,
Using a level, mark your studs with pencil marks.,
Drill pilot holes into them according to the drill pattern on your bracket back.,
Place your mounting bracket on the wall, lined up with the studs and the pilot holes you just drilled.,
Hold the mounting bracket on the wall and screw the largest bolts into the pilot holes.,
Pick up your TV and hang it on the bracket.,
Make sure that the bracket is sturdy and can hold the weight of the TV before you fully let go.,
Finished!",How to Mount a Flat Screen TV2," Mark the center of the stud on the wall. Standard studs are actually 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide (after drying and dressing the rough-cut 2"" x 4"" board). If you don't locate studs when you hang the flatscreen, your TV is likely to weigh down too much on your weakly-supported drywall and fall right off, leaving you with a damaged TV and a damaged wall.


The best way to find the studs is with an electronic stud finder, which you can easily rent at your local hardware supply store.
Alternately, you can measure 16"" from the corner of the closest wall to find a stud, then keep measuring every 16"" if your house is build to code.
If you're totally lost about where to find the studs, use your knuckles to tap on the wall where you think a stud might be. A hollow sound means drywall, whereas a thinner sound means stud. Hammer a tiny nail through the spot where you think you've hit a stud. If the nail goes right through, it's drywall; if it takes a while to go in, you've hit a stud.

, You want to ensure an even, level mounting, so take a little time before you mount to ensure that the final product will be visually appealing.

, You pilot holes should be a bit smaller than the bolts you'll be drilling into them. All you want to do is make their job a little easier.

, You may need another person to help you in the following step.

, You can use a drill or wing it with just a socket and wrench. Double-check that the mounting bracket is in fact level.


Cut two holes in your wall if you want to hide your cords and keep them from trickling down from your TV.






In the middle of the mounting bracket, cut a square hole. Your mounting bracket should have a square hole designed specifically for this purpose.






One foot from the ground, cut another square hole into the drywall. This hole may be smaller than the first hole.






Feed your cords into the first hole and out the second. If you need to, use a feeder, such as Fish Tape, to help expedite the process.

, Tighten the nuts that are attached to the bracket so that the TV will be tightened to the bracket.

, Plug in your cables to their respective homes and turn on your power.

, Your TV has been successfully mounted.

Make a subtle noise.,
Ask him to stop.,
Embarrass him.,
Make it clear that you’re uncomfortable.",How to Get Guys to Look at Your Face Instead of Your Chest1," When you catch a guy staring at your chest, make a sound to indicate that you know what he’s doing and you don’t appreciate it. Clear your throat loud enough for him to hear you and don’t continue the conversation until he looks up at your eyes. When he does, give him a quick scowl to let him know his actions aren’t cool.You can also say something like “ahem.” Make sure whatever grunt or noise you make is loud and clear enough for him to react to.
You can also point to your face when you make your noise to make sure the message gets across.
If he keeps staring at your chest, you can repeat this a few times until he gets the message.
Completely refuse to keep talking to him if he can’t look at your face.;
, Look at him with an expressionless face and ask him to stop ogling you in a completely serious tone. Say something like “Would you please stop looking at my chest?” Don’t smile, laugh or ask nicely. Speak in a matter-of-fact voice that so he knows that you’re not joking.


You have every right to be respected as a person and you shouldn’t have to be polite to someone who’s disrespecting you.
If you try too hard to be nice, he might think that it’s not a big deal and keep looking at your chest.

, If you’re around other people, you can call him out in front of them. Make him look like a creep in front of everyone. Say a funny comment to draw attention to his actions and make sure it’s clear your addressing him. If you can make everyone laugh at him, he may be too embarrassed to stare at anyone inappropriately ever again. You might also send a message to the other men there that you’re not to be messed with. Try using comments like:


Don’t worry. They’re still here. You don’t need to keep checking.
My eyes are up here bud.
Hello? I’m up here.
Did you get a good look? Great! Now we can continue.

, The next time that you catch a guy in the act of staring at your chest, use your body language to communicate that you feel uncomfortable with the attention. Be sure to be obvious enough to get your point across. Some examples of body language you might use include:Fidgeting with your clothes. You may lift the front of your shirt up slightly to reduce the cleavage that he can see.
Put your arm over your chest to hide your cleavage.
Cross your arms in front of your chest and give him a “what a creep” look.

Send him an email.,
Tell his wife or girlfriend.,
Tell your supervisor.,
Avoid the offender.,
Talk to a principal or school counselor.",How to Get Guys to Look at Your Face Instead of Your Chest2," If someone continually ogles you but you don’t want to engage him directly, you might try sending him an email letting him know how you feel about it. Let him know that you don’t want to bring up his behavior around people but you will if he doesn't stop it. This can be particularly effective if the person is a co-worker.


You can give him a chance to stop their behavior without retaliating against him.
If he sends back a disrespectful email, you can always forward it to your boss as proof of the way he treats you., If the offender is in a committed relationship, you can always tell his significant other about his activities. If his behavior causes a rift to form in his relationship, he'll definitely think twice before ogling women in the future.


Sometimes the threat that you might tell a person’s wife how he's acting might be enough to get him to stop.
She might not believe you if you’re by yourself. If he treats other girls the same way, try to get them to tell his wife how he acts with you.

, If the offender is your co-worker, you can try telling your boss about the situation. Make sure to tell your boss that you can’t be productive in an environment where you feel uncomfortable and that you think your co-worker’s behavior is completely unacceptable.


If your boss refuses to take action you might have to go to his supervisor. Move up the ladder as far as you have to to get results.
You can even threaten to take legal action if the issue is not dealt with.

, If all else fails and you can’t get a person to stop staring at your chest, then try to stay as far away from him as you can. If the person is someone in your circle of friends, simply refuse to hang out at events where he’ll be present. If the offender is someone at your job, quit.If your company allows people to treat you like an object instead of a person, you won’t be happy working there anyway.

, If the offender is someone in your school, talk to the proper authorities there. Tell a principal, trusted teacher, or school counselor about what has been going on. They will likely talk to the boy about appropriate behavior and decide on a proper punishment.


If you don't feel comfortable speaking up on your own, ask a parent for help. You may feel more comfortable having your mom or dad call the school on your behalf.
If you know other girls who have a similar problem with this boy, you can ask them to speak up as well.

Have good posture.,
Demand eye contact from people.,
Be real.,
Control your body language.",How to Get Guys to Look at Your Face Instead of Your Chest3," Be sure to stand straight up with your shoulders back and don’t be afraid to take up space. Don’t try to make yourself smaller to accommodate men. If you shrink around people, they won’t view you as strong or confident and men are more likely to treat women they view as weak with disrespect.Show men that you mean business by carrying yourself with great posture.
You can practice by standing with your back flat up against a wall. Both your shoulders should be touching the wall.

, Whenever you talk to people, make eye contact with them. If they don’t initially meet your gaze, make it clear that you expect them to. Move and tilt your head so that you’re looking into their eyes. Keep eye contact a little longer than feels comfortable. You might come off a bit intimidating to men but you’ll gain their respect.


If you demand eye contact from people, it will be very hard for them to stare at your chest.
People view easy eye contact as sign of confidence., Don’t try to appease men by acting subordinate to them. You may think that putting others above yourself will make them like you but in reality all it does is make them see you as weak. Whether you’re trying to appear strong at work or around your friends, let others know you’re an equal and that you don’t need to impress anyone.


Only smile when you genuinely want to. Disingenuous smiles can be seen as a sign that someone is trying too hard to seek approval.
Don’t nod too much while you’re talking to people. Nodding too much can make you look like you’re not strong enough to have your own opinions.

, Sometimes when women feel uncomfortable they fidget with their hair or body. These signals are also very similar to what women do when they’re attracted to someone so you should try to avoid doing them if you don’t want attention. Some men may feel like it’s ok to ogle you if they misread your body cues.Touching your hair or chest can release sex hormones.
Some people might misread you touching your hair as a sign that you want to be touched by them.

Travel separately.",How to Get Someone to Ask for Directions," Try to accept that in his mind, he is still getting wherever it is you're supposed to go and that he has a strong faith in his ability to finally get there.;
, As you drive around and around in circles or you haven't arrived at the motel early enough to get the cheaper room, you're perfectly in your rights to point out the costs involved in this need to be so right. Point out that stopping for directions saves gas, money, hassles and even means less pollution. Indeed, it is estimated that driving lost costs $3,000.00 in a lifetime.That's money that could go toward a vacation of a lifetime instead.

, Time cannot be replaced and tempers that flare are hard to restore, so getting directions can save both time and tension. If he insists that time is not being wasted, inform him that over a quarter of men polled about asking for directions wait at least half an hour before finally admitting that they need to do sowhile around 75% of men stop and ask before that. So if he's in that 25% minority that's a half hour less beer drinking at the party. Men love a bit of melodrama and will love you just that little bit more for it!

, Hired to lead the first wagon train along the Oregon Trail in 1845, this frontiersman's unfamiliarity with the area and persistence in pretending he knew where he was going caused the loss of over 20 lives. While the man who isn't taking directions in your life probably won't be the cause of anything so drastic, you can remind him that his unwillingness to accommodate your desire for him to ask for directions is metaphorically ""killing you"" and this escalation of the melodrama may well have him feeling like doing just that!

, If you have no moral problem with this kind of manipulation why not give it a try? He probably won't fall for this white lie but hey, if he's stupid enough you never know what might work! Wax lyrical about how sexy you find a man who has enough courage to own up to when he just doesn't know where he's going. Tell how much it means to you to know he's the type who can reset his course by listening to others. Good luck with that, but if he does fall for it - sorry, respond to it - then you can add that to your arsenal of man manipulation, and you never know when that might come in handy!


Bear in mind that many a man sees asking for directions as akin to saying ""I am a moron"". Moron and sexy just don't get uttered in the same sentence.

, Start looking tired. Yawn and shuffle around saying you're just going to nap a bit. Make a big deal of trying to get comfortable. A few minutes later, say something like ""Well, that didn't work, too bumpy"" and get out a book or your iPod or something else to fiddle with. Then suggest you play travel games, ""like on those really long car trips we had as kids"" or sing songs to ""make the time pass"". Ask him if he's hungry because the last meal was ""such a long time ago"" and offer him a snack. Or simply start munching something yourself, stating ""OMG! I am sooo hungry!"" Men respond remarkably well to passive aggressive games like this and he'll love you more than ever for it!

, If he won't, you'll need to. Be prepared, put aside the passive aggressive sighs and just ask. Sure, you're salvaging his pride but you're also facilitating a faster arrival at where you'd rather be.


If you're in a vehicle and he won't stop to let you ask for directions, start complaining loudly about a need to pee, right now! There is a good reason for locating conveniences in gas stations where maps and locals ready with directions are easily found. And if you're really clever, stay in the bathroom for a while. Long enough for him to get out, ask for directions and get back in thinking you haven't noticed a thing. You could even - shock horror - ask for those directions yourself! Better still pee in the car - nothing like a wet stain on the car seat to get him to stop that car pronto!

, If you don't already have GPS or Sat Nav in the car or on your person, have good maps at hand. If he can't see well, get maps that are very easy to read in large print. And be prepared in advance - check the map out yourself and start looking for the roads, signs, landmarks and other markers signaling where you're supposed to be headed and alert him to these places very early on, whether you're driving, walking, hiking or boating. This is a radical notion known as pulling your weight, contributing in a positive way and working together as a team. Quite a foreign notion to many women, but it really works, perhaps better than any other suggestion on this page!


If you hate reading maps, hold it upside down very obviously. His need to show you how a map is read will cause him to find the way. How subtle you are, and let's face it - he's a man - he'll be far too thick to realize you're manipulating him!

, You drive or lead the way instead. That way, when you refuse to stop and ask for directions yourself, he can use all the tactics in this article on you. You will now have the burden of getting there on time on your shoulders while he sits back complaining about how hungry he is and suggesting that you could maybe stop and ask someone for the way there yourself!

, Provided you take the time to study the map and manage to get someone to give you good directions that you can follow if you do get lost then you should get there on time, and he can get there all the happier for having travelled without you nagging him the whole way there. An all round win win situation!

Shake it!",How to Get a Badonkadonk," Any good combination of cardio and weight-training will help tone and shape your body, but in order to achieve a badonkadonk, you need to focus on your gluteus maximus, the muscle that forms the underlying shape of your butt.


Any motion that pushes your body up engages the glutes. It is possible to actually make your butt bigger and rounder by encouraging your glutes to grow through specific muscle-building exercises.;
, An effective way to build your glutes (or any muscle for that matter) is to lift heavy weights 2 to 3 times each week. For weighted exercises, use as much weight as you can handle with good form for 5 sets of 5 reps each.


Make sure that the weights are heavy enough that the last rep of each set is very slow and difficult to complete.
Some fitness experts argue that the popular advice of doing 8 to 12 reps is outdated, and that it’s more effective to complete fewer reps (no more than 5) with heavier weights., Squats — particularly barbell squats — are the most popularly cited exercise for build a large, shapely backside. Before you add weights to your routine, however, you need to perfect a basic squat:


Starting position: stand with your back straight, your chest out, and your head up, with your chin parallel to the floor. Your feet should be hip-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outward.
Squatting down: ensure that you keep that posture (straight back, chest out, head up) as you bend your knees and slowly lower your butt toward the ground. It may help you avoid slouching if you push your knees outward and focus your weight into your heels.As you lower your butt toward the ground, ensure that your knees do not hang over your toes. Imagine a line running across your toes, and do not let your knees go past that. To do otherwise could cause injury.
People generally stop when their legs are bent at a 90-degree angle, with the upper legs parallel to the floor; however, you can — and if possible, should — go lower!Once you are down as far as you can go, return to your starting position: exhale as you push yourself back up from the floor with the heels of your feet.

, With both arms, balance a barbell on the back of your shoulders, just slightly below your neck. Still holding the barbell, squat down as low as you can without letting your knees extend past your toes. As you drive up, clench your butt cheeks together to target those glutes.You may find it helpful to use a squat rack for this exercise for safety purposes.If you are unsure of whether your gym has a squat rack, as an attendant. Most gym attendants are more than happy to show you how to use the equipment, too, so don’t be shy!

, If you have any back or shoulder problems, you can substitute the barbell squat with a dumbbell variation or wide-stance leg press.The dumbbell variation: squat while holding a heavy dumbbell in each hand. You’ll just hold the dumbbells in your hands along the sides of your legs — you needn’t do anything special with them. Be sure to keep a strong core and back here, as with any squat!Leg presses: lie back in a 45-degree leg press machine and with just your heels resting on the top outside corners of the platform, and your toes pointed out at 45-degree angles. Doing a wide-stance leg press will help focus the work on your glutes as opposed to your quads (upper thighs)., Experts claim that squats and lunges are the 2 fundamental exercises required for building a great butt.You can do lunges without weights, but adding weights will definitely rev up your results. To do a perfect lunge:Stand with your back straight, chest forward and chin parallel to the floor. Your feet should be hip distance apart, with your toes pointing forward.
Step your right foot forward roughly 2 feet (0.6 m) and lower your body until both legs bend at 90-degree angles. Your front shin should be straight and your back knee should hover just a few inches above the ground.
Use your left leg to push back upward and pull your right leg back to return to your starting position.
As with squats, be careful that your front knee does not extend past your toes as you bend your leg, as this could cause an injury.
To add weight to a lunge, as with dumbbell squats, hold the heaviest dumbbells you can in each hand, and keep your arms straight down at your sides as you go through your lunge. You should feel tired after 5 reps.

, Plyometric exercises such as jump squats, jump lunges, and box jumps will not only help you build muscle; they’ll also boost your metabolism and help you burn calories.The key is to make your movements explosive. As an example, here’s how to do a jump squat:Get into the starting position of a regular squat (feet hip-with apart, back straight, head and chest up) and cross your arms over your chest.
As you inhale, squat down as you would normally squat, until your thighs are parallel to the floor, or lower.
Pressing mainly into the balls of your feet to push off, jump straight up into the air as high as you can. Exhale as you do this.
As soon as your feet touch the floor, squat down and jump again. Reps will vary depending on your fitness. A good gauge is to do it until your final rep feels almost impossible.

, Think about how you can engage your glutes in any activity you’re doing — for example, if you’re running on a treadmill, do it at an incline to better engage your ankles, legs and — most importantly — your glutes.You can even build your glutes while sitting at a desk or standing in a lineup, although you might get some funny looks if anyone notices you. Wherever you are, alternate between your right and left butt cheeks -- flex, relax, flex, relax.

, By alternating what you do each day, you can continue to exercise without exhausting your muscles — for example, you might work your arms every 2 or 3 days, and alternate those days with your legs and core.


You might also consider doing low-impact exercises such as yoga, pilates, or swimming on rest days., Getting the popular “badonkadonk” look of a large, shapely backside and a small waist takes dedication. Be prepared to eat healthy and work out at least a little bit every day.


Celebrity badonkadonk gurus Kim Kardashian, J Lo and Beyoncé all claim to work out for at least 1 hour each day.All of their workouts are roughly half cardio and half weight-training.

, Whenever you’re exercising, it’s imperative to warm up beforehand and cool down afterward.Exactly what you do to warm up and cool down will depend on the exercise you’re doing:Before cardio, you should do some slow, gentle aerobic activity — for example, walking or lightly jogging. Cooling down would include some slower jogging or walking, and then some stretching.
Before strength-training, do a cardio activity that works out all of your muscles — particularly the ones that you’ll be focusing on that day. Cooling down would include some slower jogging or walking, and then some stretching.

, Your muscles need rest in order to repair themselves and grow. A rest day doesn’t mean skipping exercise: it means switching things up so that you’re not working the same muscles every day, which can lead to stress and injury.It’s important to listen to your body. If you’re sore, exhausted, or feel bored with your workout, your body might be telling you that it needs a break.How often you rest your muscles will depend on how fit you are. If you’re new to exercise, you may find that you need to rest your muscles quite often at first; as you grow stronger, you’ll require less rest., Studies have shown that exercise alone is not enough to lose weight. If you want a flat stomach to go along with your large, shapely butt, you need to eat healthy and drink lots of water.


Stick to lean proteins (chicken, fish, legumes), healthy fats (almonds, olive oil, avocados), fresh vegetables and fruits, and whole, unprocessed foods in general.

, Protein forms the building blocks of muscle — in order to build muscle, you must consume enough protein.


Some good sources of protein include lean meats (chicken, fish), nuts (almonds, walnuts), and protein shakes (hemp and rice protein powders can boost your protein intake without the bloat that can come from consuming dairy products).

, As you exercise and eat right you may find that you lose weight. This is great as long as you don’t get too skinny! A badonkadonk is the opposite of a skinny supermodel butt.


Leave your hangups about flab and cellulite behind; badonkadonk fans care more about size and shape, and how you carry yourself, than about how tight your butt is.
Kim Kardashian, for example, is open about loving her “bumpy bits” (cellulite)., Part of the allure of a large, shapely butt is in its presentation. Investing in a pair of perfect-fitting jeans is essential to accentuating your badonkadonk.Look for jeans with the Brazilian waistband: a very low-rise jean with a short zipper (no more than a few inches long).
If you have a small waist, very high-waisted jeans will highlight your waist-to-hip ratio and help accentuate your badonkadonk.
Jeans with smaller back pockets and/or detailing on or around the butt will help your butt look bigger., Whatever pants you wear, get ones that are made with spandex. The more stretch, the better.


This is particularly important when choosing a pair of jeans, as you want them to hug your curvy butt without squeezing it too tightly or making it look smaller.

, It can be difficult to find great-fitting clothes if you’ve got a badonkadonk — particularly if you have a small waist, too. Getting your clothes tailored will ensure a perfect fit.


Kim Kardashian has all of her dresses tailored so that they ""cup"" her butt., The appeal of a badonkadonk is not just how it looks, but also how it moves. You may already notice a bit more pep in your step just from all the exercise you’ve been doing!

Accept human nature.,
Try to find sympathy or empathy for them.,
Put yourself in their place.,
Respect that there are lots of valid choices.,
Think about how kids act and think.",How to Get Along With People1," Humans make mistakes. People aren't always nice. They say the wrong thing, they get distracted, they forget. You have to remember: all of the problems that you have in your life right now, all of your pain, they have that too. Everyone is dealing with their own set of problems. This is important to remember when you're trying to get along with people who are very difficult or seem to be ignoring you; everyone is just doing the best that they can.;
, Sympathy is when you understand or try to understand why someone feels the way they do. Empathy is when you've been there yourself and you know how they feel. Both are great feelings to have towards another person. When someone is being difficult or they're ignoring you, try to understand their feelings. Understand that just because you don't share them, the feelings and experiences that they have are still valid. Remember that they're doing the best that they can and that they're struggling with their own problems. Think about how your problems sometimes make you meaner than you'd like or make you do things that you regret. This will make you feel better and should make your interactions with them better too.

, Think about what people do and then think about what you'd do in their position. Remove as much of your personal bias as possible and remember that they might not be as emotionally developed or sensitive as you are. Would you make the same choices that they did? Be truthful with yourself. The answer will often be yes, so try to cut people a break.

, People are all very different: that's what makes life interesting. And just like people are all different and aren't just black and white cookie cutter characters, the world is also very complex. Every situation is different, always. Just because someone doesn't make the choice that you would make or just because they take a less efficient or smart path to get where they're going doesn't make them wrong. Life isn't a test with an answer sheet: it's just something that we have to do for ourselves and we can't hold other people to our standards.

, When you're really having a tough time with people, think about kids. Kids often say the wrong things and do the wrong things because they're still learning. The tough thing about life is that it's very complex. There's a lot to learn. Some people might not have learned all their lessons yet. Try to treat them with the same patience that you would treat a child, without being patronizing. We're all in the process of growing up, our entire lives.

Fix problems that can and should be solved.,
Remember that this is temporary.,
Sing a song in your head.,
Imagine that you're somewhere else.,
Reward yourself later.,
Practice forgiveness.",How to Get Along With People2," When you're having problems with people, you should start by identifying what those problems are exactly. If the problems are serious problems that need to be addressed, such as someone being a jerk or doing something dangerous, then this is something that you should call out and work to fix. You should not accept or ignore bad behavior. However, if someone is just annoying or different and that makes you uncomfortable, then it's a good idea to move on to other outlets.

, Develop your patience to help you deal with people who piss you off. A good starting point is to remember that, as the great Joseph Campbell so liked to quote, ""this too shall pass"". Everything is temporary in this world, including that annoying guy in your office. You have to learn to not let yourself get caught up in the negative feelings you have and instead push them aside so that you can focus on creating more positive feelings.


Try distracting yourself with work if you're struggling with this step.

, If someone's annoying you, try singing a song in your head in order to keep yourself calm and keep your behavior appropriate. You can sing any song you like! ""Let it Go"" from Disney's Frozen is a good start, assuming the song hasn't already driven you insane.

, Another tactic is to pretend that you're somewhere else while you're dealing with frustrating people. Pretend that everyone driving you crazy is a cat that's just meowing constantly. Sometimes cats get annoying but they're usually cute later, right? You can also imagine that you're somewhere else altogether, like floating down a river in summertime. Just imagine the sound of the cicadas and the bubbling of the water...

, A good way to keep your cool in tough situations if you're having to concentrate too much to distract yourself is to just promise yourself a reward for being a good sport. For example, tell yourself that if you remain polite you get an ice cream. If you help the person, even though they're driving you crazy, then you get a double scoop of the good stuff!

, Forgive people when they do make mistakes. Sometimes you just have to stop and give people the benefit of the doubt. They might really be sorry or they might really not know that what they did was bad. You have to forgive them so that you can move on yourself to happier feelings. No one wants to get stuck thinking about how mad they are at someone.

"
"
Keep an open mind.,
Thank people, even when they're making you mad.,
Say what you mean.,
Set limits.,
Recognize people.,
Think about what your words really say.",How to Get Along With People3," Sometimes you have to give people the benefit of the doubt: you might think that they hate you but they might be honestly trying to be nice to you. For example, when people invite you to parties, really consider going instead of just brushing the invitation aside because you don't think they're serious.

, Even when someone's making you mad, thank them for their effort to help or their suggestions. They usually mean well and being a jerk or ungrateful isn't going to make you feel any better. Just be nice and wait until they go on their way. Really, sometimes thanking someone is the fastest way to get them to shut up.

, When you're trying to connect with people, start by being honest. Say what you really mean instead of trying to dance around the subject or be passive aggressive.

, If you're uncomfortable with people, set limits on your interactions in order to keep yourself protected. For example, if they're always wanting to do things but you're not that social, tell people you're only available at certain times and on certain days (no exceptions). If someone that you have to spend time with is wanting to discuss topics that make you uncomfortable, let them know when you don't want to talk about a subject.


When trying to excuse yourself from a topic, use words like ""I feel"". People will usually be more respectful when you directly say how something makes you feel bad.

, Sometimes people just need to be seen and feel like you really understand them. If someone keeps bothering you, let them say what they really want to say. Let them talk about what's bothering them. This might give them the release they need in order to go back to business as usual.

, Sometimes we say things without really thinking about what those words really mean or how they might make someone else feel. Has someone ever said something to you that made you really upset? It can feel pretty bad and stick with you for a long time. It's even worse when they don't feel bad about it! Think about the things you say before you say them, and try to think of how those words affect others.


For example, a joke may be funny to you but to someone else they might be extremely hurtful for very good reasons. Saying these jokes may be what gives you problems with so many people to begin with, because you accidentally make so many people hurt and uncomfortable.

Be a force of positivity.,
Contribute to all your relationships.,
Help people.,
Do something together.,
Complain together!",How to Get Along With People4," People don't like to be around people that are really negative, like to complain, or talk about violent stuff. It makes them worry that you're not quite right in the head! Instead of being a little Eeyore, be the person who sees good everywhere in the world. See the bright side of negative situations. Be the person who sees the lesson that can be taken away. Be the person that has hope, no matter the circumstance. When you have an overwhelmingly positive spirit, especially in the wake of terrible circumstances in your own life, people will be drawn to you because you will inspire them when they're having a tough time applying this advice to their own life!

, Remember, you're not just entitled to someone's friendship or love. We all have to work together and give equally in all our relationships. Both friendships and romances are partnerships. If someone you care about seems to be pulling away or things between you are getting really hard, think about if you're really carrying your weight. Do you do the things that you're expecting of them? Do you provide them with as much benefit as they provide you? If not, it might be time to work on your approach.


Make sure you appreciate them and do nice things for them every now and again.
Don't see this as a direct transaction. For example, just because you give your girlfriend a gift doesn't mean she's obligated to have sex with you. Instead, do things because you believe people really deserve them, not because you want to get something in return.
Be an active listener. Sometimes, what someone really needs in their life is someone that will really listen to them. If you feel you don't have much to offer, at least be a good listener and a shoulder to cry on when their life is hard.

, Helping people is a great way to connect and make friends. You can help the people around you with the basic stuff in their lives, like tutoring or work, or you can help people who are really in need and give yourself a larger sense of fulfillment and purpose.


Consider serious volunteer work. You can try Habitat for Humanity, which build homes for people in need, or try Big Brothers Big Sisters, which lets you mentor an at-risk youth. Put your wisdom and love to good use!

, Doing things together is another great way to bond with people and make friends. You can work together on a project for school or work (or even work together on something nice for the neighborhood). You can also try a new activity together. Joining clubs is a great way to meet people and make friends who share your interests. These activities will give you more to talk about and lots of chances to interact and get to know each other.

, It's not the most positive thing or even the best choice, but complaining together can be a really quick way to bond with people. Don't start complaining out of nowhere though! Watch and listen to them and pay attention to their reactions to situations. This will help you find something that they don't like. You can then comment on and complain about what you already know bothers them, instead of risking offending them. Don't take complaining too far though: instead, use it to start a conversation and move on to other topics!

Refine the art of “name dropping” and “event dropping.” You would be surprised at how the mention of a particular name or public event could instantly elevate your status in the eyes of another but however coerced try to maintain your integrity in this area.,
Be energetic, positive and perfectionistic.,

Use your resources wisely and responsibly.",How to Finesse People and Situations," That voice inside your head is the real you and the best way to verify that you have taken notice of another person and that another person has taken notice of you is through gentle eye contact. A smile, a handshake or a pat on the shoulder are all ways of acknowledging and respecting the presence of another.;
, Take care to correctly pronounce and spell another person’s name in your interactions with another. Be it conditioning or the egotistical need to feel important, there is something special about hearing one’s name that makes a person more alert and more open to what is taking place between the two of you.

, People tend to have an unconscious knack for sensing a phony, so take the time to study a person and express admiration for a bona fide strength. This is a power that you have to encourage more of what is good about a person.

, If a person takes their time, effort, attention or money to say or do anything of benefit for you, the least you could do is acknowledge this and express appreciation for it. There are limits to any sense of entitlement and this is one of the best ways to indicate to another that you value him or her and his or her words and actions. If someone invites you to partake of anything perhaps a little novelty gift may be appropriate.

, Your ego is not so fragile that it cannot survive a bit of honest criticism here and there or even chiding that you don’t really deserve a compliment which someone is trying to pay you. Try to laugh with people and not at people; this is best accomplished by allowing yourself to be vulnerable too. Embarrassing moments happen to everyone and such should be handled with sensitivity but also with a sly wink.

, Really try to imaginatively place yourself in another person’s shoes to whatever extent possible and try to adhere to “the golden rule” in whatever situation you're seeking a resolution to. Remember the old adage that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar and try to contain any feelings of hostility.

, With so much to do in so little time, it requires discernment to assess which interactions truly deserve our 100 percent focus and involvement. This is especially true when dealing with one’s spouse, one’s children and one’s clients or customers.

, Let’s say you were at a particular national event or happened to rub shoulders with a particular cultural icon or more practically that you attend the same fitness center as a person’s boss who you're negotiating a deal with. Master the art of the tactful mention here and there.

, It has been expressed that some of the bravest orchestrations of people were made by males, females or gralise who were snailishly tired but were concomitantly relentless as jackals. Having said that, it is a turn off to engage with persons who seem lackluster. Be fly in appearance, words and actions. Pride runs deep to generate the courage to elevate. Each day is a new opportunity to purchase life, enjoyment, elevation, companionship and dignity - seize it with both hands, both feet and the oneness of your head! Keep fit, well rested, well oxygenated, well hydrated, well nourished and be prepared to offer the best of you to existence and to expect the best from existence; Master and maximize VALUE incessantly to evolve to your highest celestial destiny.

, We are naturally selfish and this is in the interests of self-preservation. Remember that to each person whom you encounter he or she is literally the most important person in existence.


Make things plainly obvious to people when lodging a complaint or expressing a want. For example, if you were on an airplane which leaked water onto your infant it may help to add in your complaint that you plan to write an article to the local newspaper in your seeking some form of placatory compensation for you and your child’s distress. You will get better at doing this with practice.

, Every benefit in life has a cost of some sort which it is only fair that the recipient of the benefit should suffer the expense of. It is an enormous personal asset to have the strength and courage to routinely tolerate constructive discomfort to make the most of the opportunities available to you. Whether your style is flamboyant and over-the-top or simple and elegant, to be wasteful or destructive with time, money and energy is highly irresponsible. As with most areas of life, fine and gracious living is an art and a science that eventuates best with a plan, priorities and persistence of focus and effort.

Wrap up the conversation well.",How to Cold Approach a Girl," While it can be quite tough to understand women (even for women themselves), gaining an understanding of women and how they think is vital to approaching them in any way. Everyone's heard the stories of trying - and failing - to impress a stranger that you want to get to know, and effectively ruin your chances. If you want to be able to effectively cold approach a girl and have the approach go smoothly, it's crucial to understand her beforehand. While there's no way of generalizing women and how they think, there are a few things you can recall to improve your chance of the cold approach going well.


Many women prefer long-term relationships over hookups, and can tell which one a guy wants. Chances are, if you approach a girl solely to have sex with her, she'll know what you're up to.
Arrogance and playing yourself up to be ""manlier"" than you really are will backfire, as many women are interested in people who care about the feelings of others. She'll also discover it eventually if you were faking masculinity.
Women are often emotion-based, so it's important to be sensitive and put yourself in her shoes. If you say something rude, she won't appreciate it.
While many women want to find a partner, they often prefer friendships first. It's best to approach a girl with the intent of making a friend, not getting a date.;
, While it's important to have some social skills before approaching anyone, women in particular have some finer social nuances than others may pick up on. There are exceptions, of course, but many women prefer to be treated respectfully and as though they're being approached for more than just how they look. While it takes a lot more than just knowing how to have a good conversation to tune up your social skills, here are a few things to keep in mind when approaching girls for a conversation.


Avoid calling women terms like ""b*tches"", ""sl*ts"", ""wh*res"", or any other terms considered derogatory towards women. Avoid swearing, as well. This will turn many girls away from you.
Don't comment on her body. Unless you're out at a club, you're not going to get a girl to want to go anywhere with you if the first thing you comment on is her breasts or butt - or any other part of her, for that matter, as you may creep her out. Try to avoid commenting on her body, especially with your opening lines.
There's a fine line between flirting and sexual harassment. However, nobody likes to be sexually harassed. A woman who looks uncomfortable towards your sexual advances or asks you to stop does not want you to keep making those comments, and you may be sexually harassing her.

Show respect, above all. Treating anyone - male or female - like they're lesser than you will not only make you seem callous and dismissive, but it will also drive most people away from you (girls included) when they see how you treat others.

, It's very important that you are confident. Confidence is not only attractive, but also gives you courage to approach and carry out a conversation with a girl you just met. Thinking negatively and bashing yourself for mistakes you've made in previous cold approaches doesn't help; just use those experiences to prepare yourself for now. Show that you're sure of what you're doing, and that you don't doubt yourself. Many people love others who are confident.

, Yes, it's a cliché, but there will always be people who'll dislike you and what you do. A big part of confidence is living the way you want to, despite whether or not it's the way others want you to live. If you stop focusing so much on what other people think of you (including the girls you're approaching!), it'll make you much happier and more confident.


Be aware that some people may have very valid concerns, so at least take the time to listen to them and consider them. In particular, if female friends or family members are giving you warnings, take note and heed them. Girls often know what other girls like and don't like.

, If you're nervous about cold approaching a girl, you may ruminate about ""what-ifs"", such as ""What if I catch her at a bad moment?"" or ""What if she's rude and calls me a name?"". Remember, though: you can't read her mind. You don't know how she might react when you approach her, so you have to be willing to take risks. Being afraid to approach girls just because of the ""what-ifs"" may prevent you from approaching girls and seeing if any of those ""what-ifs"" are actually true!

, This is a method which is out of the norm and could be scary. That’s one of the reasons the benefits are great. Think about it - it helps you overcome fear, which gives you a deep inner confidence, and therefore sets the stage for you to become a more confident person who can move forward easily. And if it goes well, you get to meet a new person who could potentially become your friend, or even girlfriend!

, Yes, you have negative traits - but so does everybody else, and it doesn't do you any good to pick yourself apart or mull over your flaws. So what if you have a stutter, your clothes don't match the trends of what most girls seem to like, or you don't have a fantastic job that makes it possible for you to go out to fancy five-star restaurants with others? A girl who's worth befriending or dating will accept you for who you are. Even if you can't necessarily know what kind of person she is when you cold approach her, know that if she's the right person for you, she'll accept you despite your flaws.


This doesn't necessarily mean that you shouldn't work on things that are in your control. Your grooming habits, for example, are within your control, and are important to control; a girl won't be very inclined to talk to you if you haven't showered or worn deodorant in three days and your shirt is covered in old pizza grease stains.

, While not everyone will reject you, and rejection doesn't define your worth, it's very possible that at some point, a girl will reject you. When this happens, take it in stride. Apologize if she seems offended or creeped out, and take some time away to let the awkwardness cease. Rejection happens; what's important is how you handle it, and that you don't let it discourage you from ever asking a girl out again.


There are many reasons a girl may reject you. She may not be comfortable with talking to someone she doesn't know, she might already have plans, she may already have a partner, she may not be attracted to you, she may be worried you're only interested in her for her body, and many more reasons. Just as you wouldn't want to date every single girl you'd come across, she doesn't want to date every single person she comes across, either.

You do not have the right to force anyone to do anything they do not want to do. Regardless of what the girl doesn't want to do, if she says no, she means no. You do not want to be ""one of those people"" who takes the phrase ""bad with rejection"" to serious extremes. Respect a ""no"", apologize, and drop the subject.

, You don't need to head out in a suit and tie in order to meet women, but it's important to at least look presentable before you head out. Shower if you haven't already, apply deodorant, wear clean clothes that fit you, and brush your teeth. Comb your hair if it's long, too, and make sure your facial hair is in check. Taking care of yourself is one of the most important things when trying to approach women, since your appearance contributes to the first impression they get.

, You can't cold approach a girl if you never leave your home. Head out in public, and go to places where you're likely to find girls that are happy to chat with you. Some good places to go are:


Shopping malls. Lots of people in malls are in a fun mood.
Gyms. Plenty of women go to gyms for their workouts.
Concerts. This is a great place to meet girls with common interests, if you really like the band or artist.
Meetup groups. You can find plenty of local meetup groups online. These groups organize social events on a regular basis, and you can find something that you're interested in. Even if you don't meet girls, you're more likely to make friends this way.
Libraries. Although these places are usually quiet, if you're careful, you can approach bookworm girls and have a decent conversation.

, When you see a girl you want to talk to, approach her confidently without wasting time. Now that you're out and can meet girls, don't waste time overthinking or ruminating. Don't make excuses. Delaying it will only make it worse, and there is a good possibility that you may end up getting mad at yourself, and most likely giving up. Getting mad at yourself is just more negativity on top of negativity, so it's important that you reduce lag-time between approaches. Just go!


Of course, if there's a genuine reason for you not to approach her (for example, she's clearly focused on something else, or she's working a job), listen to your gut instinct. Most people don't like being broken out of their focus, and you don't want to distract her from her work.

, It can be hard to begin a conversation when you have nothing to talk about, but it's not impossible. When coming up with a conversation starter, try to come up with something that will hook you both into the conversation and keep it going. A great conversation-starter can be key to making a new friend, or getting a girlfriend.


You can always go with a question that anyone would ask, such as, ""Hi, do you know if there's a coffee shop around here?"", but the downside to this is that you may not have much to talk about with that kind of opening.
Common ground is a good starting point. For example, if you're at a concert, a quiet moment would be a good time to ask, ""How'd you discover this band?""
Avoid starting off a conversation by commenting on her appearance - whether it's about certain parts of her, or just telling her that she looks pretty. This can cause awkwardness and make the whole thing fall flat. However, if she's wearing something that's a reference to something you know about, you can say something about that, such as, ""Nice shirt! You watch that TV show, too?"".
Steer clear of questions that can be answered with a ""yes"" or ""no"" response, since it's hard to continue a conversation with most of those.

, How you present yourself is very important when it comes to having a good conversation. Having open body language is crucial, as you don't want to seem nervous or cranky when you're approaching a girl, and good body language can make the conversation go as well as possible. Try to do the following to show the girl you're interested:


Maintain eye contact. Eye contact shows a girl that you're interested in what she has to say. Don't stare her down, though, or she'll become uncomfortable.

Smile. Smiling can portray a friendliness that makes her more willing to talk to you. Make sure it's a natural smile, though, or else she'll become creeped out.
Be a good listener. Truly listen when she is talking; don't think about the next thing you're going to say. If you zone out, you only prove to her that you don't think whatever she's talking about is something you're going to listen to.
Don't cross your arms or legs or put anything in front of you, as this is a sign of being disinterested and closed off; it's often seen as ""barricading"" yourself.

, You don't want to get so wrapped up in what you're saying that you completely ignore whether she actually wants to hear what you have to say. Her body language is a prime indicator of interest, but that's not all you can use to judge how interested she is. Things like openness about herself, whether she focuses all her attention on the conversation, and how much she's talking can be indicators of how interested she is. A conversation isn't a solo act - she has to be contributing, too!


Open body language, a genuine smile, laughter, and carrying on the conversation without having to be prompted are signs that she's fairly comfortable.
If she's smiling uncomfortably, not making eye contact, facing her body away from you, or giving monotone one-word answers, she's most likely not interested. Wrap up the conversation, thank her for her time, and move on.

, She may be someone you don't know, but she very likely hangs out with her friends, has hobbies, works, studies, has a life story, family, music, movies, has other interests, and so forth. These things should be enough to make you feel curious about her. Finding out more about her can be a great way of getting to know her and keeping the conversation going simultaneously. Getting her to talk about herself is key to finding out more about her - and thus, finding new avenues of conversation.


Learn about her interests. Asking her what she likes to do for fun is a good start. If you saw her doing something that could be seen as a hobby (e.g. you met her at the gym, or saw her painting something), it's also great to ask her if she likes to perform that activity (e.g. ""Do you like painting?"" or ""Do you come to the gym often?"").
She may ask you about yourself. Be prepared for this; have an interesting anecdote about yourself. Don't lie; she'll find out eventually, and no good relationship is built on a lie.
Obviously, use common sense; avoid using profanity before she does. And never make sexual comments about her or other girls!

, If the conversation is going well and you're both having fun, then ask her out for a coffee or beverage. It doesn't have to be a big proposal; a simple ""Have you got anything to do after this? I was wondering if you wanted to go for a coffee afterwards"" can work magic.


If she says that she's busy immediately afterwards, try to arrange a time when you can see each other again.
Noncommittal answers or not making concrete plans to meet you, as well as constantly sidestepping making plans (e.g. she always has ""something to do"" on every suggested date and time) is a sign that she's not interested in seeing you again, and that you shouldn't press the matter any further.

, If the conversation is going well, ask for her phone number and call her later. For example: ""You seem like someone I would like to get to know better. How about we exchange numbers and talk sometime later?"". Don't necessarily wait for the end of your conversation to ask her for the phone number. Do it when you feel you have reached a very powerful connection with her during the conversation and it just feels the right moment to do so. It's called window of opportunity. Use it wisely.


Call or text her within the next day or two of meeting her. This is very important, as the more you delay contacting her, the more likely she's going to forget who you are and lessen your chances of seeing her again. Calling her instead of texting may be more effective, since it not only reflects someone who is confident, but it's more personal than texting, and also provides an opportunity where you both can start a conversation from where you left off.

, Even if the approach has gone wonderfully and you both feel like you could spend the entire day talking to each other, the conversation does have to end at some point, and it's important to leave her wanting more. When it's time to go, tell her that you've enjoyed talking with her - and if the conversation went well, ask her for her phone number or make plans for meeting again. Cold approaching is all about making a good impression, and it's important to leave her with an impression that makes her want to see you again!

Avoid reacting immediately.,
Don’t retaliate.,
Ignore it.,
Tell the person to stop.",How to Deal With People Who Put You Down1," When someone puts you down, deal with it by not immediately reacting to him. Giving a quick comeback or getting angry will reinforce his behavior. It gives him what he wants — a response from you.. Also, it’s not good for you to act out of anger or other negative emotions. You could do or say something you will regret,or you could damage yourself with stress.


Take a deep breath or two. This will help you to remain calm.
Slowly count to five while you make sure you are calm.;
, You may want to respond with a put-down of your own, but doing this can make you seem as petty as her. It can also increase the tension, and really won’t solve the problem.Just like reacting immediately, retaliating gives her what she wants.
Even though you might want to, don’t reply to rude comments and posts online with mean posts of your own.
Avoid gossiping about her later. It may feel good in the moment, but does nothing to solve the problem., Sometimes silence can be the best weapon.Ignoring someone that is putting you down denies them the pleasure of a response from you. It keeps you from wasting time and energy on someone that isn’t worth it. Plus, her bad behavior will really stand out against your good behavior.


Just act as though she didn’t say anything.
Continue doing what you were doing without giving her a glance.
Unless the person is incredibly thick-headed, she will usually leave you alone after being ignored.

, This is a clear way to let the person know that you want him to quit putting you down. If ignoring the person didn’t work or if the situation is especially annoying or hurtful, telling him to stop can help resolve the problem.


Make sure you are calm. Look him in the eyes and use a controlled, confident, clear voice.
For example, if a peer insults you, take a few deep breaths and then calmly say, “Stop putting me down.”
With a co-worker, you might try saying, “I don’t like or appreciate how you are talking to me and about me. I want you to stop putting me down.”
If it’s a friend that may not actually be trying to be mean, you might say, “I know you didn’t mean to, but what you said hurt my feelings. Please don’t put me down like that.”

Stay hot yourself.",How to Find Hot People to Be Friends on Facebook," The beautiful people generally only want to hang out with other equally gorgeous people. If you aren’t putting your best face forward, you’ll lose a lot of potential hot friends. And photography can make you look your absolute best, so don't fret:


Re-take your profile picture or look for a really good recent picture. Have it taken professionally for the absolute best results as a photographer will ensure the best lighting and will get your best angle. Also consider using makeup and having your hair styled for the photo, so that you look your best. Avoid having the photo taken on a bad hair day or when that zit looms bigger than your nose.
Make sure the picture is relatively new––in the event you meet one of your new friends in real life, you won’t want him or her to feel as if you were deceptive by showing an old photo.
Only feature you in the profile picture. Even though you may think that including your other hot friend or someone from the opposite sex is a good idea, resist the temptation. You want the other person to connect with you and you alone. They may see your picture and be more interested in the other person in the picture and not you but you won't necessarily know. This rule goes for dogs or cute pets too––you don’t want your new friend to only be friends with you to get to your dog.;
, Hot people want to associate themselves with intelligent, exciting individuals who lead fascinating and debonair lives (or at least, seem to). If you write down that you're into laying around in your sweatpants and watching endless hours of Star Trek on TV, you may get bounced. Equally, if you keep exclaiming that you're too stuffed to exercise, attend that party or make a healthy meal, the beautiful people will not be interested. Always put yourself in the other person’s shoes and think about what information would turn you on or intrigue you about the other person and what would be a turn-off. Stick with what excites, interests and intrigues people, even if you're creating a bit of an illusion (you can always live up to some of the more far-fetched parts later, like a future promise to yourself).

, You may already have a nice group of hot friends but haven't really seen them in this light before. Look through your friend list to see who is hot and who is not. Also, consider friends you haven’t friended on Facebook yet. You may have attractive friends or acquaintances in real life that haven’t joined your network of online friends. Other areas to consider include:


You may have overlooked someone and didn’t realized you passed up friending a total hottie. Think about your current and past list of friends carefully. You may have skipped over or forgotten about a previous friend or acquaintance who is smokin’ (or even relatively) hot. Be sure to check all requests for friending with their hotness potential in mind!
Check old school chums for the hotness factor. The ugly duckling in high school may have finally blossomed and you would never know unless you checked. Troll through old yearbooks or school rosters and then do a search on Facebook––doing this may produce one or two new attractive friends.

, One of the easiest (and most common) ways to expand your list of hot friends is to look at friend’s lists. Although some friends will hide their friend lists, check out those who reveal a complete listing and then check for common bonds. For example, Facebook allows you to filter through friend lists by school, workplace and locale. You have a better chance of friending someone you may not know who went to the same school versus someone whose only connection is your mutual friend.

, While doing this may turn up a few cuties, be extremely careful when trying to mine new friends from work colleagues or clients. If you go about this the wrong way, you could damage or even ruin your career, especially if you friend them and then reveal too much of your wild or less professional side. If you do intend to lurk around work associate contacts, play it safe by following these tips:


Only send friend requests to hot people who work within the same industry or area. For example, if you're a graphic designer, friend other designers or people who work in the same industry (if you work in banking or retail, only reach out to those in the same industry).
Make the friend request all about business. Your potential friend doesn’t need to know that the real reason you want him or her on your friend list is because he or she is hot. Instead, when extending the request, mention that you both work in the same field and were broadening industry connections.
Refer to the mutual work contact in your friend request. The fact that you both know the same person may open the door to a friend request acceptance so mention that you’ve worked with “Sheryl” or “Dan” in your invitation.

, Familiarity and having a common bond is key to making a connection. Check out fan lists for your favorite show, book, film, athletic team or music group. Popular groups will often have extensive fan lists so you may want to create a short list of potential friends based on locale, demographics and age. As with any other friend request, send a message along with your request noting that you would love to be friends so you can discuss your mutual adoration for the book, movie, band etc.

, If you want hot people as Facebook friends, you need to sustain your own hotness. This means being considerate about what you post and how often you do it. Posting frequently and posting a stream of negative consciousness will soon convince everyone else that you're not only not hot but that you're full of hot air, whining and complaining all the time and having nothing better to do but air your grievances on Facebook. A total no-no. Instead, keep the postings irregular, fascinating, free of negativity and always reveal the exciting aspects of your life. It's not much different from editing our life stories at the watercooler, so don't bleat about inauthenticity; we edit out the dull bits all the time in daily conversations.


Be classy; if you wouldn't say it out loud, don't write it down.
Be mysterious––a little suspense and mystery is alluring for everyone and builds up interest.
Love what you're doing. If you don't, then it's pointless and you could be pursuing something else of interest.
No photos of drunken revelry, nude parts or cranky facial poses. Those are just not hot.

Understand why the person does it.,
Draw a line.,
Talk to co-workers and peers.,
Be assertive with friends and siblings.,
Be respectful with superiors.",How to Deal With People Who Put You Down2," People that put others down may do it for several reasons. It is not always on purpose and may not always be meant to hurt you.Understanding what the person's motive is can help you determine how to deal with her.


Some people do it because they are insecure or jealous. They are trying to feel better about themselves by putting you down.Some do it because they are trying to impress someone or get attention.For example, the coworker that criticizes your work in front of the supervisor.
Others don’t realize they are doing it or just don’t communicate well. For example, the grandmother that says, “That’s a nice shirt. It covers your stomach well.”
Sometimes people aren’t really trying to be mean or hurt your feelings. They may just consider it harmless teasing. For example, a friend that calls you ""short stuff""., Some comments are just annoying and you can ignore them. Other comments are truly mean and hurtful and should be addressed.Deciding where that line is for you will help you determine how to address the situation.


For example, when your brother puts you down it may be annoying. But you know he probably doesn’t mean it and isn't actually trying to hurt your feelings. You may not even want to address it with him unless it gets way out of hand.
But, a co-worker that always makes rude remarks to you that are upsetting will probably need to be addressed.
If the insults are discriminatory or happen a lot, the person is crossing the line and should be reported.

, People that don’t know you well, but put you down are probably doing it for a bad reason (or they could just be annoying). Don’t cause a scene, but do let them know that it’s not okay.


If possible, have the conversation in private. This cuts down her need to ""put on a show"" for other people and maintains the respect of both of you.
You might say, “During the discussion you made some harsh comments about my idea. I appreciate constructive feedback, but not insults. Please don’t do that again.”
If she starts putting you down while you are trying to talk to her about it, then end the conversation.
If the behavior continues or gets worse, you may need to report it.

, Although it may start as harmless teasing, sometimes it can go too far and you need to tell the person to cut it out. Don’t laugh as you tell her to stop or throw in an insult of your own. She won’t take you seriously and the put-downs will continue. Be assertive, using a calm, clear voice when you tell her to stop.


For example, “Hahaha. Cut it out, Dumbo ears” is not a good way to tell your sister to stop putting you down.
Look her in the eyes and in a calm, serious voice try saying, “Ok. That’s enough. I know you think it’s funny, but it really bothers me, so I’m asking you to stop.”
If she doesn't immediately stop, tell her, “I was serious when I asked you to stop,” and then leave. She will most likely come after you and apologize. Sometimes those closest to us don’t know when we are serious.

, Sometimes parents, teachers, or supervisors put us down, often without knowing it. Let these people know that their put-downs bother you and that you want them to stop. This makes the person aware of what he is doing and how you feel about it. It is also an important step in dealing with the situation long-term.Check with your Human Resources Department at work and see what they suggest on how to handle put-downs from superiors.
Talk to him one-on-one, if you are comfortable doing so. It will make the conversation less awkward for both of you.
Try saying, “When you call my work silly, it really bothers me.” Or, “I know I don’t always get everything done, but please don’t call me lazy. It hurts my feelings.”
Tell another adult you trust or the HR department if you aren’t comfortable talking to him one-on-one or if you feel he is putting you down on purpose.

To avoid this, make a specific workout plan before you get to the gym. Decide in advance which machine you’ll start with, which free weights you’ll use, and how many sets and reps you plan to complete with different weights.If you establish a regular gym routine, you’ll feel—and look—more confident in what you’re doing.;

You can begin by going to the gym twice a week, for only 30 minutes each time.As you start feeling more comfortable at the gym and your social anxiety decreases, you can start staying for longer workouts and visiting the gym more often during the week.

, If you’re concerned about working out next to strangers in a crowded gym, ease yourself into the experience by visiting the gym when it’s slow. Visit the gym early in the morning (aim for 6:00), during the mid-afternoon when most people are still at work, or late at night.Be sure to check a new gym’s operating hours online before you show up for an early morning or late-night workout.

Once you are comfortable, you may join a class that focuses on teamwork and group encouragement, like a boot camp or CrossFit class. This way you slowly build up your confidence so you can take on bigger challenges.Once you start feeling comfortable in your classes, strike up light conversations with your classmates. You can discuss your experiences at the gym, or your opinion of the class you’re both in. Having a conversation will help you feel more welcome and less socially awkward at the gym.

, Consider regularly going to the gym with a friend or family member to help alleviate your anxiety. Being around someone you’re comfortable with can help to keep you motivated. Plus, they can help ease you into a new workout, encourage you to try a new class, or help you meet other members of your gym.Having a buddy with you at the gym will also give you someone to talk with. Jokes and light conversation can help decrease your anxiety and ensure that you have a good time at the gym.

, Making an effort to engage in small talk can help you overcome your social anxiety.Next time you have questions about the gym equipment or would like to talk about your exercise routine, seek out a personal trainer or coach. Remind yourself that they are there to help, and that they will not judge you for asking questions.


If a trainer isn’t around, ask another gym-goer for help. Talking with a trainer or gym-goer about workout plans or gym equipment will help you feel included and welcome at the gym, and reduce the anxiety that you feel in a new and unfamiliar place.

, People who have social anxiety disorder are often held back by negative thoughts, like “People at the gym won’t like me,” or “I’m not as fit as that person.” Remind yourself that these are assumptions and not facts.Over time, you can reduce these negative thoughts and have a more realistic, positive outlook about going to the gym.For example, you may think to yourself, “Everyone will judge me if I try to use that new piece of gym equipment.” Evaluate these thoughts so you can lessen their impact. Ask yourself, “Will someone truly think I’m incompetent just because I’m nervous?”"

Befriend a person you don’t think you would ever like.",How to Be Open Minded," If you want to be more open-minded, then the first thing you have to do is embrace something that is completely foreign to you. Sure, this may sound a bit broad, but the unknown can really mean something as simple as taking a different route to work, finally accepting that coffee date with your neighbor, or seeing a movie by a director you’ve never heard of. If you want to be more open-minded, then you should try to embrace one new unknown thing every week—or even, every day.


Have you never checked out that new restaurant in town because you don’t know what it’s like there? Now’s the time to check it out.
Have you avoided signing up for that English class you’re interested in because you don’t know anything about Romantic poetry? Go for it.
Have you avoided the Barre classes at your yoga studio because you’re afraid you won’t know what you’re doing. Check them out and you’ll see that it wasn’t as scary as you thought.;
, Close-minded people are famous for forming negative opinions of things they’ve never even tried. They may hate the other pizza place in town without even setting foot in the door, or they think the vegan movement is completely silly without ever trying it themselves. So, the next time you catch yourself espousing a negative opinion about something, ask yourself what evidence you have to support your ideas.


If you find that there is absolutely no evidence to prove your case, then you should try that thing yourself before you say anything else.
If your only evidence comes from biased sources, such as your favorite blogger or your best friend, who agrees with everything you say, then that doesn’t really count.

, This could be your friend’s standing invitation to go to go on a hike, your co-worker’s invitation to join your company’s bowling league, or even your barista asking if you’d like to try the new latte special. Stop saying no to things and start saying that you’d like to try them. You’ll be surprised by how quickly this changes your perspective.


The next time you say no to something, ask yourself what lies behind this impulse: is this fear of the unknown? An unwillingness to step out of your comfort zone? The desire to be hanging out in bed in your pyjamas instead of meeting new people? Face the feeling and find a way to fight it.

, This is easier said than done, of course. Let’s say you’re politically liberal and support a serious handgun ban. Sure, you may think your way is the best way, and you don’t have to change that, but you should read some arguments from the other side to see what the other people are saying. You may find that they have some good ideas of their own; and if you don’t, then you’ll feel more justified in your own opinion because you’ll be more informed.


Read up on how other countries run their governments. America could learn a thing or two from Sweden and vice versa. Seeing how other people do things can give you a better sense of any situation, whether it’s fighting crime, dealing with adoptions, or offering easier and cheaper access to healthcare.
Let’s say you’re a very devout Christian. Can you try reading up on other religions, or understanding the reasons why someone might not believe in God at all? Make a list of these reasons and see if it makes it easier for you to understand your differing perspectives. This doesn’t mean you have to change your mind, but it will help you have a more open-minded outlook.

, Though being close-minded doesn’t necessarily equate with being negative, many close-minded people tend to look at most things at the world as being negative or threatening and tend to stick to the things they know. So, the next time you catch a negative thought crossing your brain—or even the next time one escapes your lips—counter it with a positive thought.


It’ll feel good. Let’s say you catch yourself saying, “It’s freezing today. This weather sucks.” Can you think of anything good about the cold day? Try: “But there’s nothing like drinking a pumpkin spice latte in your favorite café when it’s cold outside.” Or: “Maybe it’ll snow later. I love snow.” Being more positive will help you embrace the things you thought you hated.
The same goes for whining and complaining. If you catch yourself whining and complaining about something, immediately counter your complaints with praise or excitement surrounding that thing.
You can find the good in almost any situation. Maybe you hate your 2-hour commute from Sacramento to Berkeley, but you can love the alone time you get to listen to your favorite audiobook.

, This is another great way to adjust your perspective and to become more open-minded. Try karate, hiking, oil painting, power yoga, photography, or any other activity that you have never tried before, don’t know much about, and don’t even particularly think you’d be good at. Sign up for a class in your town or at a local college. You will meet new people also interested in that thing and will learn to look at the world in a new way.


Who knows, your new hobby may even turn in to a passion. And if you really find yourself having a passion for something new, your outlook will improve. A love for photography, for example, will change the way you look at the world.

, Close-minded people tend to do the same thing every day because they’re convinced that they wouldn’t be happy if they did something different, had a different breakfast, or took a different route to work. So, do just that. Don’t eat the same bagel and cream cheese and go for some oatmeal and a fruit salad. Don’t go to the gym after work; try running in the morning instead. And don’t go straight home after work or school, either; hang out with your co-workers or friends instead.


You’ll be surprised by how quickly you’ll start looking at the world in a new way when you get out of your old rut.
Routines are a good way to bring order and stability to your life and there’s nothing wrong with them. But if you want to be more open-minded, mixing it up once in a while will show you that there’s more than one way to live your life.
Let’s say you planned to stay in all weekend and watch that ‘’Law & Order’’ marathon you’ve been craving. Your friend invites you to her beach house at the last minute—if you want to start changing your life for the better and to be more open to new experiences, then you better say yes.

, If you want to be more open-minded, then you have to broaden your horizons any way you can. Educating yourself is a broad idea, and you can achieve this through going to school, taking some night or online classes, or just by reading more books and watching online tutorials about how to do more things. The more educated you are, the less like you are to fall victim to bias.


Spend three hours on wikiHow next Sunday and learn how to do ten new things. Then, try them out.
Being more educated will make you more informed and less likely to form close-minded opinions.
Being educated will also help you hold your ground in your position if you like to argue, and it will also help you become more open to the point of view of the person you’re arguing with.

, It’s hard to be open-minded without reading. You should read widely: non-fiction, literary fiction, magazines, newspapers, blogs, or almost any kind of reading materials will enrich your life and make you understand that there are an infinite amount of ways to live and enjoy your life. Read a book about a country you’ve never been to, or a book about a political movement you don’t know much about. The more you know, the more power you’ll have to make educated decisions and to be more open-minded.


Start a Goodreads account and try to tackle at least three books a month, at first. See what other people are reading and get inspired.
Spend hours at a bookshop perusing the shelves until you find a book that speaks out to you. Then, make a goal of finishing it by the weekend.
Join a book club. This will make you even more open to a wide variety of literature and will expose you to a number of new opinions.

, Though many people have a limited budget, you should make a habit of traveling when you find the money. If you only have a little bit of money to spare, just travel to a fun destination a few hours away from your hometown and try to learn something new. If you have more money to work with, go look at the Mayan ruins in Mexico, check out the plethora of museums in Paris, or spend a weekend in Montreal.


If you can’t afford to travel, watch the Travel Network. Though it won’t be as exciting as the real thing, it will give you more perspective into how people live in other countries.
Volunteer in a foreign country. This is a great way to give your time while exploring a new place.

, Learning a foreign language is a great way to broaden your horizons right from the comfort of your own home. Order Rosetta Stone, get another language learning guide, or even invest in a private tutor or take a class in the language. You’ll understand how anything linguistic system works and will end up having a better understanding of your own. You’ll also pick up some information about a foreign culture and will understand more about the world.


If you get really committed to the language, you can find other native speakers to talk to. This will help you learn even more about the world.
You can watch foreign films in this language to get a better sense of how people speak. You’ll also gain valuable insights into the culture you are learning about.

, Maybe you’re afraid of heights. Go stand on the roof of a building (if it’s allowed). Hate going to noisy restaurants? Make a dinner date and see if you survive. Afraid of meeting new people? Go to a singles’ mixer or a meet-and-greet in your town or let your friend drag you to a party. Make a habit of doing this as often as you can and you’ll slowly feel your mind opening up.


Write down five things that make you really uncomfortable. Find a way to do as many as you can. This will take time and courage but you’ll feel better for it.

, Whether you watch just two hours of TV a week or if you watch two hours a day, you can make a habit of watching something that opens up your mind instead of closing it off further. Put away those reruns of crime shows you’ve seen a million times and change the channel from Maury Povich. It’s time to watch the History Channel, see if a classic film is playing, or watch a documentary about the environment.


Don’t watch anything that you feel is only making you stupider. You’re better off staring at the wall.
Check out Turner Classic Movies. You’ll gain a new appreciation of classic films and may change your opinion of anything made before 2010.

, You may like eating your three favorite foods, but if you want to be more open-minded, then you should check out the new Burmese or Ethiopian place everyone has been talking about. Never had food from El Salvador? It’s never too late to try.


Sure, Mexican, Italian, and Chinese are old favorites, but if you want to be more open to new experiences, then you’ll have to try new things, even if you have no idea what they’ll taste like.
If you’re trying a completely new cuisine, try to go with a friend who is an expert and knows exactly what to order. This will increase your chances of having a good time.

, The next time your friend invites you over for dinner with his or her family, don’t make a lame excuse for staying in. Sure, meeting a friend’s parents or siblings can be a little intimidating, and understanding the dynamics of another family isn’t always easy. But hanging out with your friend and his or her family will make you see that there are multiple ways to live, and that the way you were raised isn’t the only way to live.


Your friend’s parents might be more funny, strict, entertaining, exciting, quiet, or friendlier than yours. No two families are alike, and you’ll see that every family has its good and bad sides.

, If your friend's parents come from another culture, then learn about it to broaden your horizons!

, When you’re heading out for that soul-crushing morning commute, turn off Katy Perry and put on KCRW. Sure, pop music may give you some pump-up points to help you feel even more caffeinated in the morning, but nothing will wake you up and make you feel better than some food for thought. Make a goal of listening to talk radio when you get in the car next time and see how much you learn.

, Genres like classical and jazz can ease you into the day, while upbeat Latin or reggae music can wake you up quickly to prepare for the day ahead.


Listening to other experts talk about a variety of political and social topics will give you a better sense of what’s going on in the world. It’s like reading the news without picking up the paper.

,, Many people who struggle with being open-minded are also known to judge people before they really know them. If you tend to judge people when you first meet them, or even when you just first hear about them or see them across the room, then you need to work on approaching every new person on a case-by-case basis without judging him based on his background, appearance, or accent.


This can be tricky if you’re used to quickly forming opinions on someone based on his appearance or the first five minutes of a conversation. Take a look at yourself in the mirror. Do you think people will be able to know everything about you after looking at you for five minutes? Probably not.
The next time you meet a new person, try to really understand where he or she is coming from before you form any kind of an opinion.
You may be the kind of person who is prone to jealousy and who instantly hates any friends that your friend brings around because you’re possessive. Instead, think of it like this: if your friend likes this person, then there must be something good about him. Try to seek it out.

, If you’re close-minded, then you may tend to think that you don’t have anything to learn from or about other people. So, the next time you meet a new person or talk to an old friend, ask him or her more questions than you normally would without sounding like you’re in the interrogation room. Ask the person what he’s been up to that week or if he read anything good lately. You’ll be amazed by how much you’ll learn.


If a person just came back from a trip to an exotic place, ask for all the details.
If you know the person well, ask him about what his childhood was like. You may hear some really interesting details and will learn something new.

, If you want to be more open-minded, then you can’t just be friends with your five best friends from high school or college, all of whom basically share the same interests, and expect to have a broad perspective on life. Make friends from work, your ceramics class, your favorite neighborhood bar, or from different classes in school.


Though you shouldn’t hand pick your friends based on their diversity, try to hang out with people that have a variety of jobs, interests, and backgrounds.
Being friends with people from diverse backgrounds will give you insight into different perspectives on the world.
If you have really eclectic friends, some of them may not even end up liking each other, and that’s okay.

, If your friend is really passionate about printmaking or yoga, let her take you to a class or show you how it’s done. You’ll be able to gain expert knowledge from your friend and will have a new appreciation of something you never considered before. Try to challenge yourself and pick something that you previously scoffed at; you’ll be surprised by how much it can change your life.


Seeing your friend get really passionate about something you know nothing about can also help you have a more open-minded approach to how other people choose to spend their time.

, This is an easy way to be more open-minded. Though you don’t have to say yes to every invitation, you can make a habit of saying yes 50% more and going to parties or places where you never thought you’d end up. It could be a potluck at your neighbor’s house, your aunt’s yearly barbecue that you always skip, or even a poetry reading your friend has been trying to get you to go to for months. Exposing yourself to a wide variety of events will make you more open-minded.


Try to accept invitations to different types of events. Just saying yes to party invitations may not necessarily broaden your horizons if you say no to everything else.

, If you’re close-minded, then you may love to argue about a topic because you’re convinced that you’re completely right. Well, the next time you find yourself in the middle of a little debate, take a friendlier, inquisitive approach. Don’t tell the person all of the reasons why he is wrong, but ask him to tell exactly why you should believe his perspective. You won’t change your own mind, but you will definitely like something new.


You don’t want to develop the reputation of being the guy who argues with everyone until he clears out the room. Instead, be easygoing, not aggressive, even if you’re really passionate about a topic.

, You might have never thought you would be friends with a staunch Republican, a girl who is obsessed with her modeling career, or a guy who chain smokes and covers his body with tattoos. Though it may be hard to seek these people out, if you do find people that you feel you would not be compatible with in your social circle or around you, be friendly and invite them out for a cup of coffee. You’ll become more open-minded and may even end up making a new friend in the process.


If you don’t get along, then that’s fine, but at least you can’t blame yourself for trying.
Remember that people may also be stereotyping or thinking negatively about ‘’you.’’ You can help others be more open-minded by sharing your perspective, too.

Understand the exact goal and timeline.,
Help delegate tasks.,
Let everyone participate in discussion.,
Assume good faith.,
Suggest ways to communicate.,
Hold members accountable and exchange feedback.,
Seek consensus whenever possible.,
Don't burn bridges.",How to Collaborate1," The purpose of the collaboration should be obvious to all participants. Even if you are simply working on a school assignment or other short term goal, make sure you know the exact scope of the project. Are you committed to work weekends? Does everyone understand the specific work required?;
, Rather than trying to do everything, it is best to divide and conquer. Let everyone find his or her strength and work therein to contribute to the common goal. If you feel overwhelmed or think someone else could use your help, speak up.


Assigning each member more general roles such as ""researcher"" or ""meeting facilitator"" makes specific task delegation quicker and less arbitrary.

, Stop and listen if you find you talk more than most other participants. Consider other ideas before responding automatically. Collaboration thrives when each member recognizes the value of each other member's participation.If some members are talking too much, adjust the discussion system. A small group can give each person speaking time in clockwise order. A large group can limit people to a certain number of minutes spoken per statement, or a certain number of statements made per meeting.
To encourage shy members to speak up, ask them for input on a subject he or she is knowledgeable about or interested in.

, Collaborative work proceeds most effectively in an atmosphere of trust. If you think someone is not acting in the group's best interest, you should try to discuss the reasons behind their actions non-judgementally. If you point a finger mistakenly, the spirit of collaboration can easily turn sour.


Discuss problems openly, not behind a team mate's back.

, Collaborators should have opportunities to exchange ideas and information between meetings. Use online wikis, email discussions, or document sharing services to keep members up to date.Meet as a group for the occasional relaxed gathering as well. You'll work better together if you know each other better.

, Request that everyone meet as a group to discuss ways you can improve. Have regular short-term milestones and discuss how to meet them if you fall behind. For longer term collaborations, check in regularly to see if everyone is happy with progress toward the eventual goal.


Try to use fact-based metrics to monitor progress. Don't just ask whether a member did any research, check to see how many pages of notes they took or which sources they found.
If a group member isn't completing their work, try to discuss the underlying causes together. See Dealing with Issues for specific situations.

, Disagreements are common in any group effort. When conflicts arise, seek consensus from all members on a decision.


If you can't reach consensus and need to move forward, at least make sure disagreeing members accept that the group has made a reasonable effort to compromise. If you leave a member upset, it will make further collaboration much harder.

, Even if there are serious disagreements between collaborators, try to keep your emotions reigned in and forgive people who argue with you.


Well timed use of humor can be great for defusing a situation. Use self-deprecating humor or inoffensive jokes only, and don't offend someone by joking around when they're seriously upset.

, Bring the left side over to the right. You should now have a rectangle half the size of your handkerchief.

Discuss conflicts openly.,
Don't try to resolve every difference.,
Address underlying causes of low participation.,
Resolve arguments over customs, language, and style choices.,
Improve boring or ineffective meetings.,
Deal with manipulative and argumentative members.,
Reduce arguments over goals or strategies.,
Manage pressure from member organizations.,
Bring in a mediator for serious issues.",How to Collaborate2," The nature of collaboration involves people with different priorities working together. Issues will arise, and you should discuss them honestly instead of keeping them in the dark.


Make it clear that conflict resolution isn't about determining who's right or wrong. Keep the discussion focused on how best to adjust the process or action in question to remove the conflict and move the collaboration forward.
If you see a member develop signs of apathy or hostility, ask them in private what caused the change. Discuss the cause at the next meeting if it is related to the collaboration.

, The goal of the collaboration is to achieve a goal, not to instill every member with the same viewpoint. You should discuss these differences, but sometimes you'll need to agree that the conflicts aren't going away and choose a compromise or an alternative path forward.

, If a member is barely attending meetings or not fulfilling the assigned role, find out why and fix it:


Ask the member if there are any issues with other members or the collaboration process so you can discuss them openly.
If the member is a representative from another organization, make sure that organization isn't overworking them. Remind his boss that a certain level of commitment was expected, and ask for the member's work duties in writing.
If the member simply refuses to participate or doesn't have the qualifications necessary, find a replacement. This risks offense, but is crucial for the collaboration to be a success.

, If members are used to certain matters being handled in a different way, or have different definitions of a term, set aside time to discuss and resolve these.


Put the definition of controversial terms in writing.
Adjust the language of your charter or mission statement to a wording everyone can agree on.

, Research how to run an effective meeting, and share your results with the facilitator or meeting convener. Make an effort to enhance trust and engagement among members.


Even small gestures such as bringing refreshments to a meeting can make members more engaged.
If meetings are running slowly due to an unskilled facilitator, select a new one everyone trusts, and who has the skill to manage the discussion without offending anyone.

, There are many ways to address this issue before resorting to an attempt to remove them from the team, which can cause bad blood.


Controlling or manipulative behavior could be caused by fear. If the members are representing another organization, they may be worried about it losing its autonomy. Try to discover the underlying issue and discuss it with the collaboration — or, if it's a personal issue, ask them to deal with it on their own time.
If a member withholds a conflict of interest or doesn't speak up when they oppose a decision, use meeting time to discuss each person's perspective in turn.
Use a more structured discussion system to ensure argumentative members don't dominate the meeting.

, Decide on clear goals and methods you can put into writing to reduce confusion. If members are still arguing over written goals, spend additional time tweaking them.


This may signal a desire for concrete accomplishments, rather than an actual disagreement over end goals. Try agreeing on specific results and attainable, short term strategies in line with your charter.

, If the leadership of member organizations is pressuring your collaboration for quick action, remind them that the collaboration has its own authority. Planning is a necessary step in collaborative efforts.

, Sometimes, you should collectively select a third party mediator. The mediator will facilitate one or two meetings to resolve the conflict, and should be replaced if he or she becomes personally involved. Use a mediator in the following situations:


When a group leader is directly involved in the conflict.
When there is disagreement over whether or not a conflict exists.
When cultural differences are involved and a mediator who understands both perspectives is required.
When impartiality is essential, such as when conflicts of interest arise.
If the group is poor at conflict resolution. Consider a mediator who can train the group in conflict resolution rather than requesting one each time a problem arises.

Choose the right groups.,
Establish a clear purpose.,
Involve the right individuals.,
Make each member's role clear.,
Write a collaboration charter.,
Maintain the collaborative environment.",How to Collaborate3," You can collaborate with people from non profit organizations, businesses, the public sector, or individuals, but research them first. Discuss openly whether the group can commit to the type of collaboration you envision.


If you are looking for a financial partner as well, don't invite a financially struggling organization, or a government organization during a period of spending cuts.
If a group or individual is notorious for poor work relations, trust issues, or backstabbing, steer clear.

, Make sure all groups involved understand why the collaboration should be formed and the exact goals it will have. Have each group commit to a level of involvement before you begin.


Determine a timeline for the collaboration. You'll quickly run into problems if one group expected a few meetings and the other assumed a year long project.
Make expectations clear. Similarly, the organizations involved should know how many people and how much time is expected of them, and to what extent leadership will be involved.
Choose a purpose members can commit to. The collaboration should focus on the overlapping goals between all members, not one organization's mission statement.

, Find people who have relevant experience and enough credibility and trust to carry weight in their home organization. Don't bring on unqualified people just because they volunteer or are your personal friend.


Don't bloat the collaboration with too many members. The more there are, the slower it will go, so only pick enough to achieve your purpose and deal with any specialized issues that may come up.
If the goal involves broad organizational changes for the member groups, you need leadership from each group involved.
Include a legal advisor if you plan on fundraising as a collaboration.
Consider bringing on additional people from outside the core organizations if necessary. A member of the school board, city government, or business sector may be able to provide insight that you wouldn't otherwise have access to.

, Does everyone have equal decision making power? Does one person provide expert advice in a specialized area, and is that person a full member as well? Let each person know how much time is expected of them in terms of meetings attended and outside work done.


Also discuss the process by which new members are accepted and existing members are removed from the collaboration.

, Don't dive into action right away; you'll save time and increase effectiveness by first establishing the nature of the collaboration in writing. Do this in discussion at your first meeting. Include the following elements:Mission and purpose. These should have already been established, but you may need to spend time discussing the details or wording. Include a timeline and milestone goals.

Leadership and decision making process. These are extremely important elements. Everyone must agree on who has the leadership role(s) and what exact powers those include. Are decisions made by consensus (discussion until total agreement) or some other system?

Values and assumptions. If a member organization has a ""do not cross"" line or assumes a particular path of action will be followed, now is the time to formalize these. Try to identify risky scenarios for each group and discuss what to do if one arises.

Ethics policy. If a conflict of interest arises, how should the collaboration resolve that issue? Whom can the collaboration enter into financial relationships with? Does each member organization's policies apply to the collaboration's actions, and if not, how will you resolve the discrepancies?

, Congratulations, you've got your collaboration up and running. It's still each member's job, and the facilitator's job in particular, to make sure the collaboration stays healthy.Use your charter as a guide in discussions and conflicts. Discuss possible changes to the charter if your goals or timeline changes.
Construct an atmosphere of trust. If personal issues arise, or some people aren't being heard, modify the discussion process so every person has an opportunity to contribute and to discuss conflicts openly.
Establish systems for providing feedback and holding members accountable for their role.
Communicate frequently. Record all decisions made and notify absent members. Provide opportunities for members to talk in more relaxed, informal environments as well as at meetings.

Make an excuse.",How to Decline an Invitation to Dinner or Other Social Event," Is your friend inviting you? Do you work in a small company, and your boss is inviting you to dinner? Are you expected to attend this invitation? What would the consequences be if you didn't attend?;
, There are many social obligations we face throughout life, some more important than others. A social event that typically occurs once in a lifetime, such as a 'coming of age' party or someone's wedding, should have more importance over a night at the movies. How does this invitation rate compared with your existing obligations and priorities?

, Someone is taking their time to invite you to some event they feel is worthwhile. Thank the person for their consideration.

, If you're confronted in person with a verbal invitation, respond with a request to check your schedule. This may be communicated within a question, as in ""do you mind if I check my schedule and get back to you?"", or a statement, ""I really need to check my schedule before I commit to anything"".

, To an extent, truthfully give the person a yes or no response. Sometimes a direct answer is desired, especially if the invitation is a social event with an RSVP. Many invitations will have a form on the card to select either yes or no. In this situation, it is not necessary to give an elaborated response. If you're unable or unwilling to attend, simply mark 'no' and thank the sender for his or her invitation.

, If applicable, let the person know you are interested in accepting the social event at a different time or under different circumstances. Showing interest softens the rejection of an offer.

,, If things are going really badly, just say, 'I'm really sorry but,' and say something realistic and important and if they say ok, then just don't answer any calls at the time and stay away.

, Place your arms at your side or on your lap. If you are holding something or making gestures, keep your hands slightly to the side or near your lower torso.Avoid unwelcoming positions, such as crossed arms or hands raised in front of your chest. Enthusiastic postures with hands raised above your head may make you harder to approach, although psychology studies are divided on this point., Simply smiling can make you seem much more approachable and inviting. A fake or forced smile isn't nearly as effective, though. Think of a happy memory, or a funny joke, to trigger a genuine smile.

, People are much more likely to approach someone who is looking directly at them, than someone who turns away or avoids their gaze. Prolonged eye contact and a smile can make all the difference. If you want to try something more flirtatious, here are a couple alternatives geared towards women:


For a bold flirt, make eye contact for a few seconds, smile slightly, then slowly turn head away to look at something else.To act cute and coy, briefly make eye contact with someone looking in your direction, then immediately look down or in another direction and smile."

Explore the variations of nerdy girls.",How to Capture the Interest of a Nerdy Girl," There are many different types of nerds and knowing her type is one of the most important things you can do. (A fuller explanation is found at the base of this article.) She can be a one or more of the following:


If she's wearing a black shirt with neon accessories, and listening to techno or playing the Tetris theme on her instrument, maybe she's a techie.
If she has on a shirt that says ""Roll for initiative"" on it and refers to herself as ""Adora"" the Eladrin Paladin devoted to the Raven Queen, then she's a roleplayer.
If she dresses in pleated skirts and is fluent in Japanese and likes to rave about Soul Eater, Death Note, or Naruto, then she is an anime fangirl, otherwise known as an 'otaku' or 'weeaboo'.
If she spends all day and night working on or planning out her science project then she is a science nerd.
If she is overexcited about resurrecting her old video game platform and spends her free periods playing video games, then she is a gamer.
If she is a math whiz and is the top ""Mathlete"" then she's a math nerd.
If she is always seen reading or carrying a book or two, she's obviously a bookworm.

, Now that you know what she's interested in, look up some of the things she likes:


If she's a techie, look up Benny Benassi's ""Satisfaction"", and ""Able to Love"".
If she's a role-player, get a free trial! in WoW or some other MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game) such as Star Wars The Old Republic or Runescape, and see how you like it.
If she's a fan girl, figure out which anime she raves about most and watch an episode or two online.
If she's a science nerd, learn a little bit about the Schroedinger's Cat Paradox.
If she's a gamer, try playing a few video games.
If she's a math nerd, brush up on your math skills.
If she's a bookworm, make reading a hobby. If she sees a book in your hands, she would look your way to see what you're reading and even ask how the book is. Also, you may want to try to figure out what her taste in books are.

, Wave at her in the hallway or nod to her when she sits down in your physics class (or your after school biology tutorial). Just make her know your face so if she sees you, it might click in her head ""Ooh it's that guy!""

, You can do it. All it takes is one two-letter word: ""Hi"". Maybe you want to say something else, for instance, ""I couldn't help noticing your..."" (but please don't say anything perverted!).

, If you aren't familiar with the game Dungeons and Dragons, rolling for initiative is when everybody rolls their d20 (20 sided dice) and the person with the highest roll goes first. Wait for her to say something. If she just smiles shyly at you, take the initiative and say ""What's up?""

, Maybe she's an optimist (in which case, try not to be a Debbie Downer), perhaps she's cynical towards the human race (try not to anger her too much, and instead get on her good side), or it's possible she's a thoughtful person with an open mind, but it's also possible she's arrogant and snobbish. If you learn what kind of person she is, getting on her ""good side"" is a lot easier.

, Recently, Facebook has become popular even amongst the nerd community. On Facebook you can use the chat application on your web browser for casual conversation and you can look at her info (just don’t be a Facebook stalker) to find out a little bit more on what she likes. You could also follow her on Twitter.

, If she doesn’t have a cell phone, ask for her email address or her Play Station or Xbox Live names. Find some way to contact her, even if it’s through the post.

, It’s always nice to see one more follower on a personal blog. It shows her that you're interested in what she has to say. Comment on her posts, and rate them (if she has the option). If you have a Facebook or Twitter account, post her posts on your wall, and give her some ""link love"". She will especially love these kind actions if she's a computer geek, or is your friend on Facebook.

, Whether you act flirty with a few geeky pickup lines (""I'm a fermata, hold me!"") or you tell an elaborate joke about the last episode of Doctor Who, being funny is definitely one of the best ways to find your way into a girl's heart.

, Do anything to get involved in her life.

, As mentioned above, there are many types of nerd girls. Some of them might be a mixture of these types or they might be their own type all together, but the following types represent the most common:

The techie, otherwise known as the computer geek: is in love with everything technology. Often, they listen to techno music, but not every techie does. They nearly always know how to code, and have their own website and/or blog. They usually have a knack for little gadgets and enjoy getting the latest model of their favorite phone platform. Techies are usually gamers as well. The best way to relate to a techie is to learn a little bit of html (it's not too hard), listen to techno, and to join a forum or chat-room that you particularly enjoy.
The sci-fi nerd: loves Star trek, Star Wars, Doctor Who, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate, and everything science fiction. They might nerd-rage over which science fiction series is better, what the best season is, and whether the first 3 Star Wars films made (IV-VI) are better than the last 3 (I-III).
The comic book junkie: spends all of her time in the local comic book store, reading the latest issues of their favorite series. They either have gone, or are planning to go to Comic-Con dressed as their favorite characters, and have a knack for keeping the pages of their comics flat and straight, as if freshly printed for years. Take these girls out to the comic book store (yes, the good one) and allow her to rant about the inaccuracies of the latest Marvel film.
The film geek: loves movies, especially from the 30's to the 60's. They love to make movies, write scripts, star in home-movies, and have probably even entered theirs into a film contest. These girls would gladly go to the movie theatre with you, but don't be surprised if she pays more attention to the movie than to you.
The theatre geek: is usually obsessed with being on Broadway and being an individual. They are often theatrical and loud, even off the stage, and love making a grand entrance. Usually, they can sing, and will often break into song while doing the dishes. Take these girls to see a theatre production such as The Rocky Horror Show.
The science nerd: seems to spend all of her time working on her science projects and learning quantum mechanics or marine biology. They love to learn new things. Take these girls to an aquarium or a museum.
The mathlete: is quick-witted and skilled with numbers. She loves to stimulate her mind with long equations and impossible-to-do problems. It's hard to find an ideal date for a girl like this, but dinner and a movie would definitely be a good idea, perhaps finishing off the date with a stimulating game of chess. Or you could take her to a math conference and hear some thought-provoking lectures on algebraic K-theory or partial differential equations.
The bookworm: is smart and clever. She has a passion for knowledge, and her mind is filled with a lot of trivia information from all that reading. If you want to ""accidentally"" run into her, your best bet is going to the library or the bookstore. And of course, if you manage to get her to go on a date with you, always include going to a bookstore somewhere in the arrangement. So, you could go have dinner and then go to the bookstore to browse books together. Or before a movie starts, give ample time to go to the bookstore together.
The role-player: spends all day playing World of Warcraft and might play Dungeons & Dragons or another RPG with a group of people once a month or so. They live in a fantasy world, and sometimes take it to the extreme, doing things such as live action roleplays, otherwise known as LARPing. Take this girl to the renaissance fair.
The fan girl or otaku: loves all things anime, and often cosplay (roleplay with costumes) as their favorite characters. Usually obsessed and ready to glomp every Mello or Naruto they find at a convention, these girls are super happy and friendly (for the most part). Take these girls to an anime convention and buy them lots of Japanese sweets.;

Ask them to leave.,
Remind them about any pre-existing arrangements.,
Tell them you have other obligations to attend to.,
Request monetary contributions.,
Ask them to do chores.",How to Discourage Uninvited House Guests1," The simplest and most straightforward way of discouraging their continued stay is to just ask them to leave. By asking them to leave, you’ll explicitly communicate the fact that they are indeed uninvited.


Be firm. Let them know that you are serious. Say, for example, “John, I’d like you to leave by the end of the week.”
Try to be polite. For example, say “We’ve really enjoyed having you stay with us, but its best for everyone if you move on to your next destination.”
If the person refuses, you may need to resort to legal means.;
, If you made an arrangement with the person before they came into your home, then bring this up to them. This may help them to see that they are infringing on your space and decide to move on.

For example, you could say something like, “Remember when you first arrived and I said that I had a busy week ahead of me, but you assured me that you would only be here for the weekend?”

, A great way to get your guest to leave is to tell them that your life is getting in the way of being a good host to them. In the end, they may take the hint and pack their bags.


Let them know that your work and family life are so busy that you can’t be the type of host you want to be at the moment. They should consider visiting again in the future.
Tell them that other house guests will be arriving soon. For example, let them know that your in-laws are coming to visit and need to stay in the room they are staying in. Say “John, I’m so sorry, but my in-laws are coming to stay for a week starting Friday, we’ve got to have our guest room available to them.”
Share your plans to begin a home improvement project on the room they are staying in. For example, tell them you’re about to convert it into a home office or a gym. If you’re serious about it, you may even want to hire a contractor to go and take measurements of the space., One of the realities of hosting is that your guests will undoubtedly cost you money. Because of this, it seems obvious that you should request contributions of your guest if they overstay their welcome. However, if you just want them to leave then this might not be the best option. If you are okay with them staying longer if they help to cover the costs of their stay, then there are a couple of things you can try.


Explain to them the cost of them staying. Detail the cost of extra water, power, and any other resources they are using.
Set your nightly or weekly rate above low-cost alternatives. For example, if an extended stay charges $200 a week, you should ask $250.
Understand that this might not work for some people, like parents or older relatives. Requesting money is best reserved for younger relatives, siblings, and children., In addition to monetary contributions, your guest should also pitch in and take care of some household chores. This should make a lot of sense, as someone who lives in a home should take part in taking care of the home. Some chores might include:


Lawncare
Taking the trash out
Washing dishes
General household cleaning."

, You should have a triangle now that's half the size of the handkerchief.

, Grab the tip of the bottom half you just folded up. Now fold it back down so that 2/3 of it has passed the halfway fold. You are only doing this two one layer. So at the top you should still see one whole triangle with another one folded down and sticking past the midline by 2/3s.

, Grabbing the tip bring it back towards the top of the pocket square. Just as you did before, let about 2/3s of the new triangle extend past the fold line beneath it.

, Each time we do this the triangle gets smaller, and we create another step (like stairs) on top of the last fold. Keep your folds neat and well-defined.

, This is the last time you do this kind of fold for the Three Stairs Fold. Once again you only want to let about 2/3s of the remaining triangle to stick out past the last fold.

, The folds should be intact and facing the table. Be sure to support the folds while you turn so you don't have to redo them.

, You should now have a triangle about one fourth the size of the whole handkerchief. Also, the multiple folds you did earlier should now be visible.

, The new halfway fold from the previous step should be facing up and to the left.

, This is similar to all of our earlier folds and serves the same purpose or creating a stable base.

, You should now have a flat bottom line to fit into your suit.

, Adjust the look to your liking and smooth out any creases or wrinkles.

Avoid items that block your face.,
Put down distracting items.,
Cultivate your appearance.,
Pay attention to personal hygiene.",How to Be More Approachable2," Sunglasses, hats, and scarves can all make your face harder to see. Even if they are not directly obscuring you, the psychological effect may make you seem more isolated and difficult to approach., If you're checking your phone or reading a book, other people may not want to interrupt you. You could even be missing out on glances, smiles, and other cues that could otherwise lead to a conversation.

, It may seem shallow, but people who put effort into their appearance may end up looking more inviting. Consider ironing your clothes, dressing well, or even embarking on a makeover.

, Wash your body and hair regularly, brush your teeth, and keep your nails trimmed. Wear clean clothing, and remove mold from your house that may contribute to a persistent, unpleasant smell in clothing or accessories.

"
"
Take an interest in others.,
Practice ""drive-by compliments"".,
Come up with conversation topics.,
Prepare answers to common questions.,
Know how to respond to cultural biases.,
Avoid rude comments and gossip.,
Make an effort to include people in conversations.,
When you learn a secret, treat it seriously.",How to Be More Approachable3," When talking to another person, ask the occasional question about his life, and try to spend more time listening than talking. If he wants to open up, he may start a more in-depth conversation, and feel thankful for your interest. Make a habit of this to earn a reputation as an empathetic, approachable person.


If you have trouble picking up on social cues, learn how to observe people. Improve your social skills to interact with people more effectively, and practice empathizing with their concerns and perspectives.

, These are pleasant, endearing surprises for other people in your life. Compliment someone's appearance, recent actions, or personality as you walk past. You can boost her mood, bolster your reputation as a pleasant person, and maybe even start a complimenting trend.

, If you are trying to meet new people, being approachable is only half the battle. You'll have to convince them to stick around as well. Before you go to an event, come up with conversation topics to talk about. Stick with subjects you're interested in, but try to include at least one that is more ""popular,"" such as a recent movie or piece of sports news, since you'll be more likely to meet someone who shares that interest.


Tailor your conversations to the type of event or location you're in. If most of the crowd is made up of students, you can talk about recent news on campus or an academic topic. At concerts and many other events, you can talk about the band, person, or art you've all gathered to watch.

, Someone asks you, ""How's it going?"" You answer: ""Fine."" Well, that conversation didn't go anywhere. Be ready for common questions like this and tell the other person something interesting that's happened in your life.This can lead to an actual conversation, instead of awkward silence.

, Stereotypes, workplace politics, and even fashion opinions can make someone less likely to approach you. Make an effort to ask about the etiquette of a new town, workplace or other community. Many biases, such as those based on gender, age, and ethnicity, are impossible to avoid. However, recognize that many knee-jerk reactions are based on ""implicit bias,"" meaning an unconscious and automatic response that may not reflect the other person's views.If you make the effort to start a conversation or build a friendship, you may notice a very different reaction.

, Even if said as a joke, mean comments can upset others and make you seem rude and ungenerous. Try not to get involved in gossip, either, as it can earn you a reputation for spreading secrets or working behind people's backs.

, Make room for a newcomer joining a conversation, introduce him, or ask his name. Let someone in on an inside joke if he looks confused. Don't assume that someone wants to be left alone because he doesn't join in conversations or get invited to social events, Make an effort to approach people, and you may earn more and deeper friendships.

, Show other people that they can trust you. If you keep your promises and avoid betraying someone's trust, even someone you actively dislike, people around you may take note of your trustworthy behavior. Even if you find out the secret secondhand, don't help spread it around.

Don't attempt to judge a person's pronoun preference by their gender expression.,
Ask their name.,
Politely ask their pronoun preference.,
Know that you may mess up.,
Learn the pronouns:


He/his/him is typically for men, She/her/hers is typically for women.",How to Determine What Pronouns to Use When Meeting Someone New," They may have a feminine expression, but prefer gender neutral pronouns, or a masculine presentation but prefer female pronouns.;
, Names sometimes can give away gender, but there's no guarantee. With some names like Alex or Sammy the person could be any gender.


Really, it's best not to judge pronouns by name either. People, especially nonbinary or foreign people, may have a name you associate with one gender but be a different one.
Ideally, if you didn't know someone's pronouns, you would just use their name to refer to them. For example, instead of something like ""Alex brought her bag to school."", you would say ""Alex brought Alex's bag to school."". It can be clunky, but it's better than misgendering someone.

,


It is best to ask someone their pronoun preference in private, rather than public. By asking their preference, you are putting yourself out as an accepting person. They may tell you something different than what everyone else thinks because they trust you.

, It happens. Correct yourself, apologize, and move on. Do not dwell on the mistake.

, Either one can be used by some nonbinary people. Do not assume that someone is a certain gender based on the pronouns they use.
Ze/hir/hirs (or xe/hir/hirs) are gender neutral pronouns that replace he/him/his and she/her/hers.
The singular ""they"" can also be used as a gender neutral pronoun, and makes a good filler if you're unsure of what pronouns someone prefers.
Other pronoun sets include ey/em/eirs (Spivak pronouns), ne/nem/nirs, or ae/aer/aers, among others.

Avoid feeding them.,
Disengage from them.,
Take small steps to make your home less inviting.",How to Discourage Uninvited House Guests2," While it may seem polite to invite your house guest to dine with you, you may be inadvertently inviting them to stay. Instead, avoid dining with them or feeding them at all.


If possible, dine out in the company of friends and family.
Don’t inform them if you are cooking a meal.
Stop stocking your pantry and refrigerator with snack food that they like to eat. In fact, if you notice they’re munching on something, make it disappear., It may seem tempting to spend time with your house guest or to invite them to fun activities. But while you may be having fun, you are also sending the signal that they should stick around. Instead, avoid engaging or spending time with the person.


Don’t announce recreational activities that you are involved in. They may invite themselves to join you.
Watch TV in your own room or away from them. If you watch TV in the living room, your guest may take the time to hang out with you., There are small things you can do to make your home a whole lot less attractive to stay at. And while these things might seem small to you, they might be enough to get your house guest to reconsider their living plans.


Feel free to turn on the TV early in the morning or entertain guests late into the night. If the house guest does not respect you enough to leave, you shouldn’t go out of your way to make your home inviting."
"
Never volunteer the fact that you have a spare room.,
Let them know that your place is not comfortable or relaxing.,
Don’t make yourself or your home available when they’re in town.,
Lie if you must.,
Be clear about your terms.",How to Discourage Uninvited House Guests3," One of the worst things you can do is to let potentially unwanted house guests know that you have a guest room open. Thus, you should not advertise the fact that you can host people.


Only tell close friends or family about your guest room.
Don’t invite someone to stay, or even suggest it, unless you really mean it.
Avoid bragging about or talking about your house around people you don’t want staying with you., A good way to head off an uninvited house guest is to share with them the fact that your home is not really welcoming. By letting them know that your home is often chaotic, they’ll see it as an undesirable place to stay.


Share the fact that your small children are noisy.
Talk about how your place is cluttered and needs to be cleaned.
Tell them about your aggressive dogs., If someone is coming into town who you know will try to invite themselves to your home, make yourself scarce. By not being around, you’ll make it very hard for them to settle in as a houseguest.


Tell them you are going out of town.
Let your family know you will be out of town or on vacation during the holidays.
Make plans so you will be busy when they are around.
If you must meet a person who is visiting from out of town, make sure to do so at a neutral location, like a restaurant or coffee house. Don’t invite them to your home. They may invite themselves to stay., Depending on the situation, you might have to resort to lying to a potential house guest. While lying seems like a drastic step to take, you might need to do it to avoid an awful and uninvited house guest.


Try to bend the truth instead of creating a big lie. You don't want to get caught in the middle of your own lie. For example, instead of saying one of your kids is deathly ill, say they have a very contagious cold.
Use future plans to deter them from staying. For instance, if you plan on remodeling the house in six months, tell them you're about to start now. In the end, you can always tell them you pushed it back.
Remember that the person will likely communicate with others that you know, so make sure you don't create a lie that you'll be caught in.
Before you lie, consider that telling the truth and outright refusing to host the person might be a better option., If you are willing to let someone stay in your home for a short period of time, then make sure to clearly communicate your terms for their stay with them.

Understand that holding up people when boarding is actually holding up the entire airline from Economy to First Class. Because you will be the first group boarding and settling in, it's important to show respect by being where you need to be at the right time so thing's run smoothly and you can get to your destination on-time.

, Before you depart on the next leg of your journey, it's important to say farewell and thank your host from the first class lounge, you may never see them again. If you feel so inclined, you could tip them for their service as a sign of your appreciation before they hand you over to your next porter.

, The flight hosts that will be serving you during the flight are hospitality veterans and seasoned professionals, not just flight attendants. Be very kind to these people and use your manners extensively. They will be doing everything they can for you, and it's simple protocol to treat them with reverence.

, It's most likely that you will be seated next to someone in most aircraft's. Although, you will have your own room and space to enjoy the flight, it's very respectful and kind of you to introduce yourself to people within reach. This could lead to some very interesting conversation that will will make time fly!


You can learn a lot from others, even more so the people that fly in first class due to their presumed success.

, Show that you are having a good time by smiling at service attendants and other passengers while you reside in the first class area. It's evident that most people in First Class will be very friendly and excited due to the relaxed environment.

, In most flights there is a private first class bar with a broad range of beverages. You will most likely have your own small range of alcohol in your little luxury pod; however it's important to stay modest and avoid getting sloshed. You want to be able to remember the experience and not ruin it by getting ridiculously intoxicated.

, Some people are rather reclusive and don't wish to mingle more than they have to. It's esteemed that you honor other peoples desires by not forcing them or pushing them to interact with you. If however you are a reclusive person and don't wish to mingle, respect others that want to. Be polite if you're introduced to someone, however it's fine if you tell someone that you would rather be left to your own devices.

Keep questions light as you get to know other people; you might ask why they are flying, and where they are visiting.

, It's very evident that you may be acquainted with a familiar face while you fly in complete luxury. When you meet the icon or are given the opportunity to speak with them, treat them like they were just another person. This is usually the way they wish to be treated.


By being down-to-earth and relaxed, you're on the same level as the other person and the atmosphere is far from elated.
Be you and be normal. Don't request the person to sing if they are a singer, or request any other strange activities for you to be able to remember. Understand that even though you might be on vacation, they are more than likely at work.

, The individual you meet and speak with have spoken to numerous people in their success. Just let them ask the questions and lead the conversation. If you have questions to ask them, be sure to keep them to a modest number and avoid plucking at topics and questions that are personal or not of your concern.

, Understand that the personage is probably tired, nervous or wanting a nice and laid back flight to their next destination. If you're the irritating fan or follower wanting them to sign every last item that you are carrying, you will come across as a goose and probably be removed from seeing the celebrity by in-flight security.


Fend to only request one autograph signing and if given the opportunity, one qualitative photo.
Refrain from asking the person to add or follow you on social networking if you do not know them personally or aren't at the same 'status' as them. If you are an executive or figure yourself, ask your publicist (if you have one) to go and ask theirs if you can sojourn with them for a while.

, First class flying has plenty of perks and one of them would be the opportunity to enjoy gourmet food over 35,000 feet (10,668.0 m) in the air. Aim to order what you know when it comes to dining though. There would be nothing worse than realizing that you are allergic to a certain ingredient while you want to experience first class flying in the best state you can.


Because the flight only has a trained nurse on-board, if something does unfortunately go wrong in relation to food, you may not have all the medical assistance you will require.
It's fine to save the opportunity to enjoy a delectable seafood dish at your hotel or restaurant on land. You could aim to eat things like salads, sandwiches, soups or a banquet of finger food to share with the Lady or Gentleman next to you if you feel so inclined.

, If there is something an airline knows what to do extensively, that would be food variety. Even economy has a few options in their section, but because you are in first class, take the opportunity to suit the food to your pallet or requirement(s). Remember to ask your concierge or flight host to check with recipes that they meet your dietary needs.


If you have allergies like an allergy to nut products, be sure to ask a host to see the in-flight chef if they can cook a dish that usually requires a nut ingredient, to be substituted. The chefs on-board are professionally picked, and it's their job to meet the demands of first class passengers.

, After you have treated your taste buds to some of the globes most gourmet dishes, it's a great idea to go and compliment the Chef face-to-face. This meek gesture will be well-revered by others around you, and you may even get a complimentary dessert or get to taste one of their new decadent creations.


Chefs in First Class are usually very friendly and laid back individuals who like a good gastronomic chat. If you know a thing or two about the culinary arena, or perhaps want to learn more, it's encouraged after the dining service, to meet and converse with the chef(s).

, At the end of your voyage you should strive to thank everyone who made your experience worth-while. Thank your flight host or concierge by name and wish them an enjoyable rest of their day. It's even more encouraged to let the flight hosts know what you really admired during the flight.


A gratified individual is highly revered and you will be remembered if in the unlikely case you get the same host or concierge on your journey home.
In some flights you are able to meet the pilot. It's encouraged to warmly shake his or her hand and thank them sincerely for such an enjoyable flight. You will make their day to know that what they love doing is ultimately bringing the world closer together.

, Remember to not leave anything behind except your smile and polite demeanor. Prior to landing and then again before exiting the aircraft, double-check under seats, arm rests etc. for any personal items that may be mislaid.

, It's most likely that the flight will have donation slips for a charity that they sponsor. If you don't have one in your arm-rest or seat pocket, you can ask for a spare one from your flight host. It's a sweet gesture and it will certainly not go unobserved.

, You can express your appreciation by visiting the airlines website or airline review websites and write about your experience to inspire others to fly First Class and provide insight for the carriers probable candidates.

Find a quiet, private place to talk.,
Ask the person if they received your gift.,
Express your displeasure at not being thanked for the gift.,
End the conversation on a positive note.",How to Deal with Not Being Thanked for a Gift1," If you decide to confront the person you gave the gift to about their lack of thanks, do so face to face and in a private spot. You may choose a neutral spot, like a coffee shop or a park bench. Or you may invite the person over for coffee or dinner at your home and have the talk then. Try to choose a setting where you can talk honestly and freely with the person.


If you can, have the conversation with the person face to face. Confronting the person over text message or email can make it difficult for you to strike the right tone and manner. Even a phone call would be a better option than a text or an email.;
, Before you confront the person, ask them directly if they received your gift. You may do this if you did not give them the gift in person, such as a gift sent by mail, or if the gift was left in a pile of presents and opened later. Confirming the person has received your gift will ensure you are not confronting them for something they did not get or open yet.For example, you may say to the person, “I was just wondering if you got my gift?” or “Did you get a chance to open my gift?”
Doing this may also prompt the person to remember to thank you for the gift. Give them some time to respond and see if they offer their thanks when prompted this way.

, If the person confirms they received the gift, you may tell them simply and honestly that you were surprised and disappointed you didn’t get a “thank you” for the gift. Explain how it made you feel to not get a thank you and be honest about your feelings.


For example, you may say to the person, “I was disappointed to not receive a thank you from you for the gift” or “I was hurt when I didn’t get a thank you. Did you not like the gift?”
Often, saying this will prompt a person to respond with “Sorry” and “Thank you” or explain why they did not say thank you to you right away. Be patient when listening to the person’s response.

, If the person brushes off your question or does not respond with a “thank you,” try not to let it bother you. Work on ending the conversation on a positive note, even if you did not get the thanks you wanted.


For example, you may say to the person, “It bothers me that you do not show thanks for the gift. But I can accept it and move on.”

Wrap something around your waist.,
Dry yourself off as best you can.,
Change clothes if you can.",How to Cope if You Pee Yourself Laughing in Public1," One way to cope with peeing while laughing in public is simply to cover up the evidence. There's a good chance no one will notice, and you'll end up avoiding some humiliation. This might be easier than you think. If you have a sweater, or another longer clothing item, try wrapping it around your waist to hide the urine stain.If you have a jacket or a sweater with you, either one would work. Simply tie it around your waist. This will work better with a sweater, because many people tie sweaters around their waists anyways.
If you don’t have a sweater or jacket handy, you could always buy one if you’re near or in a store. Going to this extent would make the most sense if you’re about to meet someone where you need to make an impression or seem professional.
You could always ask a friend whether you could borrow a sweater or jacket if you don’t have one along. In fairness, you should be clear about why you need it if you’re borrowing someone else’s garments.;
, You should make sure that the pee dries, at least somewhat to avoid drawing attention to yourself. You want to get rid of stains and smells. Dampness can also cause skin irritation, so it's vital you clean yourself up after an accident in public.Get to a bathroom as soon as you can. You may have to slip into a coffee shop or a grocery store to make use of the public restroom.
Ideally, you would wipe off your skin with a cotton cloth. From there, you would use moisturizing wipes to wipe off your skin. It's a good idea to put a moisturizing cream on the parts of your skin that got wet, as this can provide a barrier that prevents irritation.
If you're in a grocery store, or near one, you may be able to quickly purchase these products before slipping into the restroom. However, for the most part, it is unlikely you would be able to wipe up properly. Improvise as best you can. Use toilet paper or paper towels to dry your skin. If you have lotion in your bag, use that for now to provide a barrier. Scented lotion may help cover some of the smell.

, The most obvious solution is to change your pants, if that’s possible given the situation. If you have a change of clothing nearby, change into it as quickly as possible. One downside to this approach is that you will have to explain your change of dress to colleagues.Many people keep workout clothes in their cars, or in a locker at work, if they head to the gym after work. If that attire is appropriate for the occasion, you could retrieve it, and change into shorts or yoga pants.
If you’re in an area with a lot of clothing stores, you could buy a new pair of pants, and put them on. For example, if you’re in a tourist area, there are likely to be many clothing stores in the near vicinity where you can buy clothing relatively cheaply.
You could ask to borrow clothes if you are with close friends or a colleague, and that person has workout clothes in the car. If you have a persistent problem with bladder control, you could keep a change of clothing in your car. You can also call someone, like a roommate or spouse, and ask them to bring you a change of clothes.

Suggest a social setting where you feel comfortable eating.,
Avoid discussing your food choices with others.,
Go for the healthy option on the menu.,
Have balanced portions.",How to Cope with Social Eating Pressure1," If you struggle with feeling pressured to eat in a certain way when you are out with others, you may want to take control and suggest a setting that you find comfortable. You may suggest to friends that you all eat at a restaurant where you know there are healthy food options or food options that you are comfortable eating. Or you may recommend a bar that is close to where you live and familiar to you so you are not intimidated by the setting.You can also try rotating where you eat out with others so you get at least one meal at your preferred spot. For example, you and your friends may agree to rotate three to four places when you go out to eat, with your preferred spot being on the list.;
, Though you may feel a lot of pressure to discuss your eating habits with others when you are eating out, try not to give in to this kind of talk. You may have friends who ask you, “Why didn’t you order food?” or “Why did you order fries instead of a salad?” Avoid answering them and try to ignore their questions. You do not have to justify your food choices to others, especially with friends or those you are close to.If the people you are with keep pressing you with questions about your eating habits, you may respond by saying, “I can eat whatever I want” or “I’m good with what I ordered, don’t worry about it.” Keep your tone casual but firm so everyone at the table is aware that you do not need to feel pressured about your food choices.
You can also confidently state why you are making certain food choices. For example, if someone gives you a hard time about ordering the grilled chicken salad, then you might say something like, “I chose that option because I am trying to drop a few pounds, and because I love salad!”

, You may find it easier to cope with social eating pressure by opting for a healthy option on the menu. Going for the healthier option will allow you to feel good about what you are eating and feel less judgement from others around you. You may also find that you enjoy your meals when you eat out with others more if you are having food that is healthy and will give you energy.For example, you may try to choose a salad on the menu and add protein like chicken or fish to it so it remains healthy. Or you may have vegetables on the side of your meal so you have a healthy addition to your meal.
If you are going to a party where there will be food shared with others, you may bring your own healthy food with you. Make a large salad to share with everyone or another healthy option so you have something to eat that you like at the party.

, It may help you cope by having portions that are balanced on your plate when you eat out. Rather than go for huge servings or large portions, you may opt for portions that are more standard and balanced. Having balanced portions can make eating in front of others less of a spectacle. It can also ensure you digest your food properly once you have finished eating.You can determine the ideal portion sizes on your plate by using your hand. For example, you should have a pointer finger length amount of cheese on your plate as well as one fist size glass of milk or dairy. You should also have one fist size portion of vegetables on your plate and a palm size portion of meat such as chicken, beef, or chicken."

Acknowledge their accomplishments.,
Ignore them.,
Equalize the playing field.,
Try to calm down.,
Defend yourself.",How to Deal With Competitive People1," Often competitiveness stems from a place of insecurity. If a person is bragging about their work, family, or some other part of their life, give them the praise they are seeking. If you give in, you may find that some of the competitiveness stops.In addition, you may find that the praising the person helps them see you as a friend rather than as a competitor.;
, One strategy you can employ, especially at work, is to ignore the person. Pay attention to what you need to do, and continue working hard. If you enter the person's game of one-upping each other, you're only egging the person on., If someone is always taking over meetings to show how much better he or she is, suggest a way to even the playing field. For instance, maybe you could set a time limit for how long each person talks. In turn, maybe you could encourage a way for every person to share ideas, such as going down the table at meetings to see who has ideas, rather than just letting it be a free-for-all., Getting angry at the situation will not help. When you find yourself getting mad, take a few deep breaths to calm yourself. Once you're calm, try to figure out how you can make the situation better. Giving in to anger may only egg the competitive person on., If a competitive person is trying to attack you, you are well within the realm of decorum to defend yourself. If possible, have a way to back up what you are saying.For instance, if a coworker tries to steal an idea, bring up emails that show you had the idea first."

Keep in mind the lack of thanks may have nothing to do with you.,
Remember that giving without expectation can be beneficial.,
Try to move on from the issue.",How to Deal with Not Being Thanked for a Gift2," If you do not want to confront the person about their lack of thanks, you may need to work on accepting the situation as it is. Keep in mind the person’s lack of thanks may have nothing to do with you or with your gift. Sometimes people do not say “thank you” for their own personal reasons and you are not responsible for their actions.For example, perhaps the person has poor interactional skills and does not know how to say “thank you” properly. Or maybe the person feels embarrassed by receiving a gift and does not feel comfortable saying “thank you.”
Think about the person’s character and personality. Consider if they are just not comfortable saying “thank you” and try to accept that you cannot control their actions or their preferences.

, You can also try to take a more generous stance on not receiving a thank you by seeing it as a selfless act. Giving to others without expectation of reciprocation can help you build empathy for others. It can also make giving gifts more enjoyable, as you are doing it only for the other person’s enjoyment and not just so you can receive thanks or praise.Giving without expectation can also be useful for building a reputation for being generous and thoughtful with no strings attached. Your friends and colleagues may come to see you as someone who gives freely without expectation, a quality to be admired.

, Try not to get too hung up on squeezing a thank you out of the person or forcing them to show appreciation. Work on moving on from the issue so you do not let it cloud your day or get you down. Though the person may not have said “thank you,” you will likely receiving thanks and praise from other people you give gifts to. Do not let one person spoil your entire outlook on gift giving.


For example, you may tell yourself to let go of the issue and take a few deep breaths to release it and move on. You may then focus instead on the people who did say thank you to you for your gift.

Opt to only give gifts to those who say “thank you.” If you are bothered about not receiving thanks for the gift, you may adjust your gift giving practices in the future to only include more appreciative people in your life.,
Try to practice gift giving without expectation.,
Skip giving out gifts to others.",How to Deal with Not Being Thanked for a Gift3," Perhaps during the next holiday season, you only give gifts to people who said “thank you” to you the previous season. Or maybe you skip giving someone a gift for their birthday the following year because they did not seem to appreciate the gift you gave them this year.You may set your own limits around giving gifts to only those who appreciate them based on your comfort level. For example, you may not be able to get out of giving a close relative a gift, even when they do not say “thank you.” Rather than get them a lavish gift, you may go for a less expensive gift so you spend less money on them and potentially feel less upset about not receiving a thank you from them.

, Moving forward, you may also try to give gifts to others without the expectation of a thank you. This may be hard to do, but setting yourself up for no thanks or praise at the onset can make it easier for you to give gifts freely and generously. Practicing giving without acknowledgement from others can be a good way to be more selfless and generous towards others.For example, for the holiday season, you may focus on giving gifts to those you love and let go of expectations around receiving a thank you from them. That way, when and if you do receive thank you’s from them, you will feel surprised and pleased.

, If you do not feel comfortable giving without expectation, you may decide to skip gift giving all together. Rather than spend a lot of money on gifts every year for friends and relatives, you may opt for spending that money on yourself instead. You may feel better about focusing on your own needs rather than give to others, especially if you do not get the thanks and praise you feel you deserve.


Another option is to donate money to charities or local organizations rather than to family or friends, as you will definitely receive thanks and praise from a charity or organization for your gift. This may be a good way to still give to others and get the thanks you are seeking.

Stay calm.,
Laugh it off.,
Stay in the present.,
Spend some time thinking over past embarrassing situations.",How to Cope if You Pee Yourself Laughing in Public2," Remember that this is really not the biggest problem in the world to have. Everything is relative. If a little embarrassment is the worst problem you will ever experience, you’re lucky. If you become flustered and react intensely, this can spur a reaction in others, creating an uncomfortable situation for everyone. Instead, try to keep your cool.It’s possible that no one will notice or be able to see anyway. It might feel wet to you, but the pee stain may be barely visible to other people around you because of where it’s located. Try to stay relaxed and slip away.
If someone does see, remain calm. People often react to embarrassment by becoming flustered, tearful, stuttering, and acting upset overall. This makes the people around you feel awkward as well, causing a tense situation. While it can be incredibly embarrassing to have an accident in public, staying calm can help smooth things over.
If anyone notices, try to react with a smile and take it with a grain of salt. You can proceed to do things to help quell your embarrassment.

, How you respond to something can affect how other people around you respond to it, so your attitude can make the situation more or less embarrassing. Adopt a confident attitude, and try to laugh off the mistake.In hindsight, embarrassing events are easy to laugh off. People often share embarrassing stories at cocktail parties. In the moment, however, laughing can be hard. Try to remind yourself you will live down this moment. This may make you feel more comfortable laughing.
Even if it feels uncomfortable, try your best to laugh it off. Say something like, “Can you believe I just did that? I guess your joke was really funny.” Speak with confidence, and downplay the significance of what just happened.
Enlist a friend's help. If you're feeling sensitive, it may be difficult to laugh at yourself. Try to turn to a trusted friend and encourage him or her to laugh with you. Make a joke at your own expense and say, ""Am I right?"" If your friend joins in, the conversation can go from uncomfortable to fun and lighthearted.

, If you want to overcome embarrassment, work on moving forward. Instead of dwelling on what has just occurred, keep your mind in the present. You peed your pants, and now you must deal. Ruminating on the embarrassment will block your ability to smoothly cope with the situation.Try to silence the voice in your head. You may be inclined to think something like, ""I can't believe you just did that. How humiliating."" Try to ignore the words of self judgment. Instead, focus on what you can do now, in the present, to deal with the situation.
Keep pulling your attention to the present as need be. Remind yourself you need to get to a bathroom, cover the stain, or laugh it off with those around you.

, You may feel you'll never live down peeing yourself in public. However, try to remind yourself of embarrassing things you've done in the past. This is probably not your first cringe-worthy moment. Remembering past embarrassments can help put things in perspective. You never thought you would get over certain fumbles, but eventually you did.Go over a list of your most embarrassing moments. Replay that uncomfortable first date, that awkward comment you made in English class, and so on. Try to recall your top five embarrassing moments. Think to yourself, ""I got over all of that and I will get over this as well.""
Try to enlist your friends to help. Have friends share embarrassing stories as well. You may feel better about yourself if you realize everyone has experienced embarrassing moments.

Tighten the pelvic muscles.,
Avoid drinking alcohol or caffeine.,
Wear adult diapers for bladder control.,
Go to the bathroom frequently.,
See a doctor to rule out an underlying medical problem.",How to Cope if You Pee Yourself Laughing in Public3," Many bladder control problems are caused by weak pelvic muscles that have become stretched during childbirth. As a result, the bladder sags and stretches the urethra’s opening. If you believe your bladder control issues are due to childbirth, do Kegel exercises regularly to tighten pelvic muscles.To do a Kegel exercise, first identify your pelvic floor muscles by stopping urination in midstream. The muscles you use to do this are your pelvic muscles. Get a sense of what it feels like to move these muscles.
Tighten these muscles for five seconds, and then relax them for five seconds. Repeat four or five times in a row. Work up to to the point where you are contracting the muscles for 10 seconds at a time.
Make sure you are not simply contracting your abdomen, thigh, or butt muscles. Try not to hold your breath. Perform the Kegel exercises three times a day, making 10 repetitions at a time.

, These drinks are diuretics, which means that they take fluid from swollen areas of the body and direct it to the bladder. The bladder fills fast, causing it to leak.Choose decaffeinated drinks. Drinks with caffeine in them, such as sodas or coffee, will fill the bladder up fast. It’s normal to pass urine every three to four hours, but the urge can be more frequent if you’re drinking large volumes of these beverages.
Try not to drink a lot of fluids at once if you have this issue. By losing weight, you can also also reduce pressure on your bladder. Quitting smoking can also help you control urine leakage, according to some studies., If this is a persistent problem – if you pee frequently when laughing or performing minimal duties – you should see a medical professional to diagnose what’s causing it. Your doctor may suggest adult diapers, and may be able to provide advice on the types to wear. As with anything medical-related, you should see a doctor to make sure that there is no underlying cause that is particularly serious. It’s better to get it checked out than to guess what’s going on.If your leaks are usually light, you may be able to get by with a pad or guard over a full on diaper. You can place these items inside regular underwear, and they may make less noise.
However, if you need a diaper, you can pick a brand that's easier to conceal. Try a variety of brands before deciding on a product that works for you. Experiment with different types of pants and clothing to see what best conceals the diaper.
Be prepared when wearing a diaper in public. Carry around scented disposable bags you can use to discard wet diapers. If there isn't a garbage can around, a disposable bag can be used to temporarily hold a soiled diaper until you find a place to discard it.

, If your bladder is not full, you’re obviously not going to have as much of a problem with peeing in public. Thus, you should make sure you empty your bladder on a regular basis.


It's more risky to try to hold a full bladder for a long period of time, and if you do so, you will increase the chances of urine leakage.
Try not to delay trips to the bathroom. Just go, especially if you’ve been drinking a lot of water-based beverages, such as beer, soda, or coffee.
Before you launch into that funny story, recognize the signs of a full bladder and head to the restroom to empty it out. Try to go to the bathroom at set times and before you actually feel a strong urge to do so, as well.

, If you pee simply by laughing, it could indicate an underlying issue. If it happens more than one time, see a doctor. Incontinence can be a sign of a variety of underlying health conditions.


There is a specific term for this kind of bladder control leakage because it's relatively common. It’s called “stress incontinence. It doesn’t mean that you have emotional stress. It means there is stress placed on the bladder.
Menopause can also increase urine leakage in women. Damaged nerves can also cause urine leakage as a result of ailments such as a stroke or diabetes. Urine leakage can be caused by trauma, such as pelvic surgery. Being overweight can also effect the bladder.Once your doctor has figured out the cause of your incontinence, the two of you can go over a treatment plan. There are a variety of ways, such as medications and lifestyle changes, to treat incontinence and help you better control your bladder.

Prepare your own meals at home.,
Discuss your eating habits with your parents or guardians.,
Tune out discussions about your eating habits, unless instigated by you.",How to Cope with Social Eating Pressure2," If you feel like you are dealing with social eating pressure at home, you can take control by preparing your own meals. You may find that your parents or siblings comment on what you eat during a shared meal, such as dinner. You can address this by preparing your own meals so you can eat what you want and not feel judged.You may make a meal plan for the week and go shopping for your own food so you have enough ingredients to prepare your meals. You may opt for healthy meal options and ensure you are getting a balanced amount of each food group in your meals.

, If you do not want to make your own meals but are still bothered by the pressure you feel eating at home, you may want to talk about it with those around you. Start a conversation with your parents, your guardians, or your siblings about how they talk about food with you and how it affects your eating habits. Be honest and open during the discussion.For example, you may ask them, “Are you aware that your words are making me feel pressure to eat in a certain way or to eat certain foods?” Or you may say, “I feel like your comments about my eating habits are not positive or helpful. Can we talk about why they make me uncomfortable?”

, Though you may find it difficult to be around others while you eat, you may need to do this when you are living at home or with your parents. Also, keep in mind that not wanting to eat around other people may be a sign of an eating disorder. Signs of an eating disorder may include having a preoccupation with food, excessive exercise, obsessing over your weight, and perceiving yourself as overweight when you are not.If you notice that they bring up your eating habits, try to tune them out or ignore them. Listening to their critiques will only make you feel more pressured and anxious about your eating habits. Instead, try not to respond to them.
If you do want to respond to their comments, you may say, “You are making me feel uncomfortable with my eating habits right now. Can we talk about something else?” or “Would you mind if we changed the subject?”

Find common goals.,
Build networks.,
Introduce new people.,
Value diverse opinions.,
Work on trust.",How to Deal With Competitive People2," Another way to convert competitive people to allies and build a cooperative environment is to look for ways to work together. If you happen to find another parent at your kid's school too competitive, you could try finding a project you can work on together, such as building a better library.For instance, you could say, ""I see we both care deeply about our kids' education. What would you think about working on a library book drive together to improve their educational environment?""

, When you're dealing with a competitive person at work, it can make you feel isolated and frustrated. Be sure to work towards building friendships with other people in your office, the ones who aren't trying to compete with you. By being yourself and working hard, you will find that people will realize your value, despite the fact that someone is always trying to look better than you. Additionally, building networks helps the whole environment, making it more cooperative and team-focused.Besides helping people value you, building friendships can help give you the support you need when you have a competitive person in your life., When new people arrive on the job, make sure you go over and introduce yourself. You can take it even further by introducing that person around to other people in your department. That way, the person already starts to get to know people and doing so promotes good working relationships.If you can, try to go beyond just ""Hello!"" and ""Welcome to the company!"", In a workplace environment, it can be easy to shut out opinions that don't conform to the majority. However, often dissenting opinions can help make a project better. Try to encourage others to speak up, and if someone gets shut down, take it upon yourself to defend the person., Like most relationships, work relationships are built on trust. Just like those other relationships, building trust takes work and time. However, doing so can help make your workplace more cooperative.Tell the truth. Being honest about your work helps to build trust with others.Do what you say you're going to do. Another way to build trust is to first say what you will do, and then follow through with it.Work towards the benefit of the group. Not only will this step help thwart the competitive people, it will also help create an environment of cooperation. That is, instead of always looking for personal acclaim through the work you do, make sure you are trying to make your team or the company as a whole shine."
"
Work against negativity.,
Tell yourself you can do it.,
Show yourself your good qualities.,
Put on a brave face.,
Push yourself.,
Dress the part.,
Be prepared.",How to Deal With Competitive People3," Your brain is wired to think negative thoughts at times, even when the situation doesn't warrant it. Meaning, your brain may be thinking that everyone in the office is against you because someone made a small comment. However, it's more likely that most people find you a likable person, even if one person made a negative comment about you. Think about all the things people have said in the past that have been positive to help balance it out.Confidence can drive a competitive person crazy. If the person is insecure, your confidence will throw the person off his or her game. If the person is simply narcissistic, the person will likely respect you more for your confidence., Self-affirmation is a technique that many people use to build confidence. One way you can employ this technique is to pick an affirmation statement and repeat it as you look yourself in the mirror every morning, such as ""I'm a good person who is capable and strong."" You can also use similar mantras to psych yourself up before big events, such as meetings., Set aside some time to make lists about yourself. Focus on your achievements and strengths. You can also make a list of what you like about yourself. Use these list to boost your confidence when you're feeling down.For instance, under achievements, you could write things like, ""Got a degree,"" ""Have an awesome job,"" and ""Have an amazing family."" Under strengths, you could write ""pays attention to detail,"" ""is good at communicating with others,"" and ""does well on a team."" Under things you like about yourself, you could write things such as ""I am always willing to help out"" or ""I make time for my family.""

, Half of being confident is acting confident. As you smile and hold your head up, you'll start to actually feel the confidence you're trying to fake. In other words, even if it feels weird, faking confidence builds confidence.That also means projecting your voice. Speaking soft or mumbling doesn't exude confidence., When you always do the same things every day, you may find that you start feeling just a bit too comfortable. Pushing yourself to do new things, even small ones, can boost your confidence. Talk to someone you've been meaning to introduce yourself to. Go to that new Ethiopian restaurant across town. Sing at a karaoke night. All these little instances add up to make you more confident., Dressing the part doesn't mean you need to dress like everyone else. Rather, it means that you need to find clothes that make you feel good about yourself. While you need to think about the clothing being appropriate for the situation, finding clothes that make you happy can boost your confidence., Whatever the situation, try to prepare ahead of time. Giving a presentation in a meeting? Do the research you need to do, and practice your speech. Going to a new building for work? Find it ahead of time so you know where you're going. Being prepared gives you confidence, since you know you've done what you can to face any bumps in the road."

Be confident.,
Dress nice.,
Be friendly to every single brother.,
Be moderate.,
Make your presence known.,
Don’t be the drunkest guy at the party.,
Be nice to women.,
Set yourself up for success.,
Don’t be a suck up.,
Defend your letters.Defending your letters may be the most important tip to earning respect.",How to Become the Most Respected Brother in Your Fraternity," It is rare that someone who is self conscious and unsure of himself is respected. Being confident means having the ability to stand up in front of your whole chapter and saying what you have to say even if a negative response is inevitable. Confidence is not caring what others think of you and just going for it. Most college men use alcohol and drugs to portray confidence (for example, having a few drinks before talking to a girl). A respected fraternity man oozes confidence. You can see it in his mannerisms, his relationships with woman, on the intramural football field, and in his interviews where he knows he is going to get the job.


Essentials to being confident, or at least portraying confidence:

Having a firm handshake
Always making eye contact
Having good posture
Speaking loud enough for a room full of people to hear you clearly, but low enough where you don’t come off as abrasive or obnoxious

;
, What you wear goes hand in hand with confidence. Take pride in your appearance. A confident, respected fraternity man does not follow a trend just because everyone else is doing it. It is disappointing to see a dozen fraternity guys walking around campus wearing the same outfit of sperrys and a Ralph Lauren shirt. Try to exceed people’s expectations without coming off like you are trying hard. If only a dress shirt and khakis are required, show up wearing a blazer and pocket square on top of it. It is okay to follow a trend as long as you have you incorporate your own unique style into it.


Essentials to dressing nice:

Wear slim fitted clothing; consider wearing one size smaller than you usually wear
Always match your belts with your shoes
Invest in more professional/upscale shoe styles such as penny loafers or oxfords
Invest in a nice timepiece; a classic yet sharp style is the leather/gator band watch
Add accents such as cuff links, tie bars, or pocket squares to your formal wear
Stay away from anything with rips or tears in it
Avoid wearing graphic tees, especially ones with inappropriate messaging on it; try sticking with solid color tee shirts
Never wear socks with loafers, boat shoes, or sandals



, Make an effort to personally acknowledge every brother at an event. This means saying hi, giving a handshake, and making light conversation. Even if they are not one of your closest friends within the fraternity, do it anyway. It will give them a lasting impression that you’re a good guy. Being friendly also entails knowing basic information of each brother. This may sound obvious but there are cases where brothers don’t even know simple info about their peers. You should know first and last name, hometown, academic year, and who their girlfriend is if applicable. Nothing can tarnish a relationship between brothers like hitting on someone’s girlfriend can. Last but not least, never, ever, lay a hand on another brother in a hostile situation. Rough-housing is natural among men but you should never be in a real physical fight with another brother.

, Not in life, but on your stance of issues, whether they are political, religious, or fraternal. An easy way to distance yourself from a group of your brothers is to be on the extreme opposite of the spectrum as they are on issues. That is why it is smarter to be moderate. This is how political candidates get elected. A great way to earn respect from the brotherhood is coming up with an idea/solution/policy that makes both sides happy. A brother who only cares about partying is bound to be respected less than the brother who cares about partying and philanthropy or partying and community service.

, To be respected means to show that you care about your organization. If the fraternity needs a volunteer for something, step up. If a big idea or solution is needed, propose something. Apply for committees and chair positions. Making your presence known doesn’t mean bragging about your home run in intramural softball, it means being passionate and enthusiastic about your fraternity to the point where the brotherhood notices what an essential part of the organization you are.

, This means not being that brother that is walking around like a zombie after popping pills and taking too many shots. Sure you may be respected by some in terms of how wasted you could get, but you will never gain true respect this way. By all means, have fun at parties, and make other people thrilled to be at your parties, but do it in a manner that isn’t going to put your fraternity at risk of getting into legal trouble, losing their charter, getting kicked off campus, or losing their good reputation. An easy way to mess up your fraternity’s reputation is throwing up on a girl because you are too drunk.

, Chivalry, gallantry, whatever you want to call it, is a requirement of a respected fraternity gentleman. If you are a jerk to women at your parties, other women will find out and won't come to your parties anymore. You may feel cool being an asshole to women but it won't gain you respect. If you respect women, especially sorority women, they will come to your events and your brothers will be happy. If not, don’t be surprised when you ruin your fraternity’s relations with sororities on campus, then see how much your brothers respect you.

, Who do you think will be respected more, the brother with good grades who has a high-paying job lined up for him, or the brother with straight D’s who is dropping out of school to become a DJ. If you picked that latter, you are far from being the most respected brother of your fraternity. Sure, trying hard in classes may take a toll on other things with a higher priority such as getting girls and partying, but it will pay off in the end. When you have that corner office and are hooking your brothers up with jobs and internships, you will be respected.

, Sucking up and tattling are two qualities that should not be associated with fraternity men. These are qualities of weasels who will go nowhere in life. Blowing smoke up the judicial chair’s behind in order to get out of a punishment is sucking up. Strategically being friendlier to certain people in order to win an election is not sucking up, it is being politically savvy and is natural in the fraternity world.

, If someone is tarnishing or slandering the name of your fraternity, set them straight. If a group of meat heads are messing with one of your brothers, have his back no matter what. However, defending your letters does not mean going out and looking for fights. Nothing shows your commitment like sacrificing yourself for the welfare of your house. If you happen to get punched in the face defending a fellow brother, walk into your next chapter meeting with your black eye and be proud that every single brother now has an enormous amount of respect for you.

Show kindness and courtesy.,
Be polite.,
Don't discriminate.,
Respect differences.,
Respect spaces.,
Respect the earth and all who live here.,
Respect other people's possessions.,
Respect personal space.",How to Be Respectful1," Being respectful starts with a basic consideration of other people's feelings. Ask yourself how you'd want to be treated in a given situation, and make an effort to treat other people that way. Treat everyone you encounter - strangers on the street, coworkers, classmates and family members - with respect and courtesy.


Offer people food, water, or something else when you see a need that could be met.;
, The concept of etiquette and good manners seems pointless when you're a kid, but when you grow up you realize that these customs function as a way to keep society running smoothly. Practicing good manners is a way to be respectful of other people's space and time. If no one bothered being polite, everyday situations like eating in a restaurant, waiting in line at the post office or dealing with bad traffic would be completely intolerable. Here are a few ways to be polite:


Don't talk on your cell phone in a coffee shop, store, restaurant, or any other public place where it could bother other people.
Don't cut in line.
Don't cut people off in traffic.
Say please and thank you!
Follow rules intended to make life more pleasant for everyone, like limiting your time using a public computer so someone else can have a turn.
Don't eat or drink in places where there's a rule against eating or drinking.
Stop talking when the lights go down in a movie theater.
Throw away or recycle your trash instead of leaving it for someone else to clean up.

, Be respectful to everyone - not just people you know or those you perceive as having a higher status than you. Many people save their respect for people upon whom they want to make a good impression, and they're rude to everyone else. But there is truth in the saying, ""You can judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them or to them.""This means you should be as kind to those who aren't as ""cool"" as you as you are to the most popular people you know.
Be kind to people you encounter throughout the day who aren't always treated with respect. For example, homeless people are often overlooked or treated rudely, but they deserve the same respect and courtesy as anyone else.

, Be respectful to people who are different from you, even if you don't understand them very well. The differences among us are what make life interesting, and besides, you probably have more in common with people than you know. Even when you really don't see where someone else is coming from, be courteous and civil. You don't have to love everyone you meet, and you certainly don't have to agree with them, but you can still show them respect.


Be respectful of people's cultural differences.
Be respectful of people with different religious beliefs.
Be respectful of people with different politics from you.
Be respectful of people on the team that rivals yours (and fans of the other team).

, Any space that you share with other people should be treated with respect. Your home (if you live with other people), your school, your street, your bus line - these familiar spaces are familiar to other people, too. You wouldn't appreciate it if other people trashed the places where you spend time every day, so be sure to clean up after yourself and do your part to keep them nice for others.


Don't leave wrappers and other trash lying around - pick it up and throw it out. If you make a mess, clean it up.
Don't graffiti public spaces (unless you're an artist, and you have permission).

, Being respectful extends beyond just being nice to other people. Remember to show respect to animals, plants and the earth itself. We're all living here together, and each one of us is deserving of respect. Treat every living creature as an individual worthy of courtesy.


Do your part to avoid polluting the environment.
Understand how your actions affect the rest of the world. For example, using pesticides on your lawn could contaminate the groundwater and have a negative impact on your environment. Try to make conscientious lifestyle choices.

, It is considered rude and inconsiderate to help yourself freely to anything that does not belong to you. Ask permission before using someone's property. If you don't, you might be accused of stealing.

, Personal space varies in different situations. Strangers (e.g. people on the subway) should be given a space bubble, and it's best not to strike up conversations unless they're showing signs that they're open to talking. Friends and family members usually are more open to touching, but it's still important to make sure they're okay with it.


When offering hugs and kisses, let the person see it coming so they can decline it if they don't want it for any reason.
Ask before prolonged contact, such as playing with someone's hair or rubbing their back.
Treat disability equipment (canes, wheelchairs) and service animals like extensions of a person's body. Don't touch without permission.

Listen when someone is talking.,
Think before you speak.,
Be clear when you want something.,
Respectfully disagree.,
Practice patience and assume good faith.,
Don't stereotype other people.,
Don't gossip.,
Apologize if you hurt someone.,
Be respectful to others even if they're not respectful to you.",How to Be Respectful2," When you're having a conversation, being a good listener is a basic sign of respect. If you look bored or interrupt the person, you're showing that you don't really care what he or she has to say. Practice listening more intently and waiting until the person is finished talking before you respond.


Making eye contact is a good way to show that you respect what someone is saying. Other body language cues can help as well. Face the person to whom you're talking and try not to fidget while they speak.
Process what the person is saying instead of just absently nodding your head.

, When it's your turn to talk, try to formulate a respectful response. Take into account what the person was saying and voice your opinion without undermining theirs. Avoid insulting the other person by saying something rude or callous.


Try not to be condescending. Don't over explain a concept the other person clearly already understands. For example, don't tell a varsity athlete how to hit a baseball.
Don't be patronizing. Along similar lines, talking down to someone can make them feel disrespected. Avoid phrases like ""Don't worry your little head about it,"" or ""It's a guy thing, you wouldn't understand.""
Be mindful of circumstances you should avoid talking about. If you don't know someone very well, there are certain questions you probably shouldn't ask. For example, if you just met someone, don't ask how he got the 3-inch scar on his forehead.

, People are often happy to help you, but they can't help you if they aren't sure what you need. Talk about your needs (physical or emotional) so that people aren't left wondering what is going on with you.

, You can respect someone's view even if you wholeheartedly disagree. The key is to disagree with what the person is saying without undermining the actual person's worthiness. For example, you might strongly disagree with someone's political beliefs, but you can still value the person as a human being, and that should come through in the way you argue.


Never resort to insulting someone during an argument. Don't let ""I don't agree with your view on that"" escalate to ""You're an idiot.""
If necessary, halt the conversation before things get too out of control and you say something you'll regret. You're not going to get anywhere by disrespecting the other person; you'll just make a new enemy.

, Communication can be difficult sometimes, and people may misspeak or struggle to find words that fit. Give them time, and when you aren't quite sure what they mean, assume that they are doing their best to be kind and understanding.

, Don't come to a conversation with assumptions about someone else's opinions or background based on their race, gender, religion, nationality, or any other factor. Everyone is an individual with special life experiences and wisdom. Don't make the disrespectful mistake of thinking you know someone before you've taken the time to learn about him or her as a unique person.

, It's a common form of disrespect that people usually get away with, but gossiping is a bad habit. It puts you in the practice of seeing people as characters who are up for discussion instead of individuals with feelings that can be deeply hurt. Even the strangest, most annoying or obnoxious people should not be regularly discussed as though they exist to provide entertainment for others.


If you have nothing good to say, it's better not to say it at all.
Politely object to continuing or starting such discussions, even if the person being gossiped about has done a bad deed towards you before. Remember, you reap what you sow, so do not indulge in bad habits for your own good and other people's good. Keep in mind that the good or bad deeds you commit will affect you and others in the long run.

, No matter how hard you may try, you'll probably tread on someone's toes at some time or another. Your hurtful mistake is less important than how you react to it. If you realize you did something unkind or upsetting, talk to the person about it to apologize.


Avoid saying ""but"" to justify your actions. If you wish to explain why you behaved the way you did, try ""and"" instead. For example, ""I'm sorry I winced when you said you were autistic, and I was acting on a misconception of what autism is. I'm sorry I upset you, and I accept you for who you are."" This explains the action without excusing it.

, As difficult as it might be, try to show patience and humility. The other person may learn something from you. If the person is downright rude or mean, try to defend yourself without sinking to his or her level.

Show deference to those with rightful authority.,
Don't abuse your own power.,
Respect yourself.,
Practice empathy and compassion.",How to Be Respectful3," Some people deserve extra signs of respect because of the position they hold. The school principal, the boss, the church leader, the mayor, the queen of England - these are people you have risen to leadership positions because they have exhibited qualities society deems worthy of respect. Show authority figures respect according to the proper custom, whether it means calling the principal ""Sir"" or bowing to the queen.


Elders are also deserving of extra respect. Respect your parents, grandparents, and other elders in the community for the valuable wisdom they have to share.
In some cases it is important to recognize when an authority figure is not deserving of extra respect and deference. If someone has broken your trust and you feel you can no longer respect them, that's a personal choice you have the right to make. In some cases, by standing up to authority you are respecting yourself and other people affected by the authority figure's power.

, If you are in a position of power, respect those who trust you by being courteous and kind to them. Never expect them to defer to you ""just because."" Be the kind of leader who people want to follow instead of the kind they're afraid not to follow.

, You are an important person, and you deserve to be treated well. Work on treating yourself the way you'd treat a friend. Every time you think a negative thought about yourself or do something self-destructive, ask if you'd talk to a friend that way. You are your own best friend.


An ""others first"" approach is kind, but is only realistic to a certain extent. Put your basic needs (food, sleep, mental health) first. Once your needs are met, you will then be able to help other people effectively.

, To really understand how to respect other people, put yourself in their shoes and attempt to truly understand where they're coming from. You can be courteous to people without really caring much about them, but true respect stems from a sense of empathy, a deep sense of shared understanding. Try to recognize the bonds that tie us all together and the fact that we're all sharing the same earth. Respecting each other is a way of getting along and making the world livable and more delightful for everyone.

RSVP.,
Arrange the arrival.,
Join in.,
Drink responsibly.,
Don't outstay your welcome.,
Say thank you.,
If you are in your late teens to early twenties and at a party with the same age group, you should still act courteously but may be less formal.",How to Be the Perfect Guest," When you receive an invitation to a party, whether it's a dinner party or an informal get-together, it's simple courtesy to let your host know whether you will be attending. This is particularly important for a dinner party, where they will need to know how many to cook for. A good host will have issued the invitations well in advance and may have given you a date by which to respond. You should always respond before this date, whether you can attend or not. If the invitation doesn't include an RSVP date you should still give a response.;
, Your host will have told you what time to arrive. It is polite to arrive between 10 and 15 minutes before this time. This will allow your host an extra few minutes to make sure they are ready before guests arrive. You should always arrive early, particularly for a dinner party, so you can assist the host/hostess if they need it.

, A party is only as much fun as the people who attend. You should do your best to join in wherever possible. Make conversation, get to know the other guests, and have fun. If the host has planned some games or other events, take part.

, Casual drinking may help the guests relax and become sociable, but keep track of your consumption. DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE.

, If the invitation stated a time for the party to finish, you should offer to help with cleanup at that time and if the host declines you should thank them and bid them good night. You don't know what else your host has planned - they may have a busy day the next day, or may simply be exhausted from the party and want to sleep. Of course they may be enjoying the party and want it to continue, in which case they should make it clear to you that they want you to stay.

, After your host has gone to all the trouble of putting a party together, the least you can do is express your gratitude. This will let your host know that someone appreciated their efforts. For a drinks party or informal gathering, a simple phone call will do the job perfectly. For a more formal dinner party, it's polite to send a postcard or short letter. If you've stayed for the weekend, you should send a letter.

, Use judgment.

Consider your ideal iPad.,
Compare the different iPad models.,
Decide if you need cellular service.,
Think about storage.,
Consider processing power.,
Decide on a color.,
Test your preferred iPads out in person.,
Consider buying a used iPad.,
Check for deals online.,
Buy your iPad.",How to Buy an iPad," Most iPads' storage ranges from 16 gigabytes to 128 gigabytes (though some models, such as the iPad Pro, support up to 256 gigabytes). Similarly, most iPads on the market will support cellular data, meaning you can add the iPad to your cellphone plan and use the data from the pertinent account to access the internet in areas without wi-fi. Other aspects you'll want to consider include the following:



Size - iPad screens vary from 7.9 inches across to a whopping 12.9 inches across.

Performance - Smaller iPads, such as the iPad Mini, won't be able to process large amounts of data the same way a heftier iPad Air or iPad Pro can.

Price - iPads aren't cheap. If you're on a budget, you'll probably want to opt for an older model (e.g., one of the original iPads). Alternatively, you can buy a newer iPad Mini and sacrifice some of the performance of a larger iPad.;
, With your ideal criteria in mind, consider the aspects of the following tablets:iPads 1, 2, 3, and 4 - The original iPads (commonly referred to as the ""iPad 1/2/3/4"") are no longer in factory production as of January 2017, but you can usually find them for a discounted price on Amazon, eBay, and Craigslist.iPad Minis 1, 2, 3, and 4 - The iPad Mini line of tablets have a smaller, 7.9 inch display (as opposed to the traditional 9.7 inch display). The iPad Minis 2, 3, and 4 come equipped with high-definition Retina displays.

iPad Air 1 and 2 - The Air series of iPads is a continuation of the original iPad line. They have 9.7 inch Retina displays as well as upgraded processors from the iPad Mini series.

iPad Pro (9.7 inch and 12.9 inch) - The iPad Pro line is geared towards optimal performance, making them both the fastest-operating and the most expensive iPads on the market. Both the 9.7 inch and the 12.9 inch models have Retina displays, though the 9.7 inch model is the only iPad that can record video in 4K definition.

, The iPad 3 and all subsequent models of iPad have cellular counterparts, though they tend to be slightly more expensive. Cellular service means that you will be able to connect to the internet as long as you have a cellular signal. If you want cellular service, you will need to sign up for a data plan with a carrier that supports the iPad.All iPads have wi-fi capabilities, which allow you to connect to any wireless network that you have the password for. Purchasing an iPad with cellular capabilities does not mean you'll lose wi-fi capabilities.

, Most models have several different storage options available, which is the main feature that dictates the prices of the iPad. Most iPads released up until late 2012 (iPad 3 and iPad Mini) come in 16, 32, and 64 gigabyte varieties. iPads released since then come in 16, 32, 64, and 128 gigabyte varieties.


The iPad Pro comes in 32, 64, 128, and 256 gigabyte varieties.

, If you intend to run a lot of high-end apps (e.g., photo-editing software), you'll want to stay away from the original generation of iPads and the iPad Mini series--while the processors in these models aren't subpar by any means, the iPad Air and iPad Pro lines are built specifically for performance.

, Most iPads are available in Silver/White or Gray/Black.


If you don't like your iPad's color, you can always purchase a case for it.

, To do this, visit your local Apple Store or electronics retailer to give a few different iPads a quick spin. This will give you an idea about things like the screen size difference between the iPad and the iPad Mini, the speed and size difference between the iPad Mini and iPad Air, and the graphical rendering differences between iPad Pro models.

, Brand-new iPads are prohibitively expensive, but you can check places like Craigslist or eBay for used tablets.


Make sure you check out the iPad in person if at all possible before committing to the sale.

, Online retailers may be able to offer a better deal than physical retailers, though you may have to do some digging. Ensure that the retailer is legitimate and that you are actually purchasing a new iPad. Some online retailers don't make it obvious that you are buying a used product.


Amazon is a good place to search for a new iPad, but make sure you verify the dealer before purchasing. If they have negative reviews or little history on the site, you may end up not getting what you paid for.

, Once you've settled on a model, all that's left to do is make the payment!

It may not always be easy to be nice to people, especially when you're in a bad mood or are stuck with someone who annoys you.,
Introduce yourself to new people.,
Give a sincere compliment.,
Be polite.,
Don't curse.,
Offer help.,
Be a good listener.,
Ask how the person is doing.",How to Be Friendly and Kind," But if you make the effort to do the most basic things, like smiling, holding doors open for people, or asking people how they're doing, you'll be able to create a more pleasant environment for yourself and everyone around you. Not only will being nice to people make them respect you more, but it will also make your day sunnier! If you want to know how to be nice to people, see Step 1 to be on your way.;
, If you're in a room with someone you don't know and everyone else seems to know each other, take the time to introduce yourself.

, Everyone loves compliments, so don't be afraid to say something positive about the other person. But be careful, though, not to flatter them too much. Too much flattery can give the impression that you are sucking up to them.

, You should be just as polite to strangers as you would be to your family members. Even if you're having a bad day, take the time to say ""excuse me,"" to hold doors for people, and to treat people with a basic level of respect.

, This will make you look vulgar, and definitely not nice. If people see you cursing and getting angry, they'll feed off of your negative vibe and won't want to be around you.

, It's important to offer to help the people you see around you, whether it's a person with his arms full who can't open a door, a child who dropped a toy, or an elderly person who has difficulty walking. One day, you may need to rely on the kindness and help of a stranger, so you should get the good karma going while you can.

, One of the best ways to be nice to the people you know is to take the time to truly listen to them. Stop texting your other friend or looking around, and give the person you care about all of your attention.

, Just simply taking the time to say, ""How are you?"" and really meaning it is a great way to be nice to a person. Don't just ask this question in passing, but ask it in a way that really shows you mean it and care about the person and what he or she is feeling.

Distance yourself.",How to Break Up," It’s important to consider your decision when you are not emotionally upset and able to think clearly. This can help you avoid making an impulsive decision that you may regret or hurt the other person.It’s more difficult to problem solve when you are emotionally upset, and this may contribute to irrational decisions.;
, It’s important to gain clarity as to why you want to break up. This can help you distinguish between the simple road bumps in a relationship and more serious and irreconcilable issues between you and your partner.Only you can define what are irreconcilable issues and those that you can overcome. For example, if your partner doesn’t treat others well or doesn’t want children, these are often factors that cannot be changed. On the other hand, a person’s unwillingness to help around the house may be something they can amend.
Every couple has arguments, but if those spats are constant and ugly, it may suggest deeper issues and incompatibility.If you're in an emotionally or physically harmful relationship, this is usually a clear sign to end the partnership. , Consider writing a list of reasons you want to end your relationship. You may also want to include positives and negatives about your partner and the interactions and relationship you share.Seeing the positive parts of your relationship on paper may help you to focus on these instead of the negativity that may come along with the feelings you currently have.A list may also help you avoid ending the relationship based on the feeling “it feels like the right thing to do.”Remember that any type of abuse is a clear reason to end a relationship.Looking at the list and thinking it through, ask yourself if the relationship is more destructive to your life than enhancing it., If you're simply upset with your partner, consider if there is a way to change the dynamic in your relationship. Before making a final decision, you may want to focus on resolving issues, rather than simply ending the relationship as the first solution. If change is an option, see whether or not your partner is willing and able to change.If the issue in question has already been discussed without experiencing any changes for the better, and you keep feeling unsatisfied, hurt, or betrayed, then breaking up might be the only way to end the pattern., Before you decide to make a final break, discuss your frustrations and considerations with your partner. Give him the chance to make changes for the better. If you eventually decide to end the relationship, this may make it seem less abrupt and soften the blow because you'll have already voiced your frustration.Bottling up your frustration and feelings often leads to blowing up or expressing your emotions in inappropriate ways.Try to respectfully and calmly tell your partner what is bothering you. Avoid shouting, abuse, or blaming.
If your partner has cheated on or harmed you in some way, you may consider these irreconcilable differences that don’t deserve communicating your frustration or giving the person a chance to change.

, You want to avoid getting into an endless chain of hoping for your partner to change and then experiencing disappointment. Setting a limit on timing for your partner to change can help make your decision easier in the long run.


You may or may not tell your partner about your timetable. Issuing ""ultimatums"" by saying ""If you quit smoking by next month we can stay together"" can lead partners to agree in the short term before going back to the old ways in the near future.
Make sure that the ultimatum is helpful. In most cases, ultimatums don’t work. However, it may be necessary for your relationship to remain tenable. For example, you can say “I need to see you make an effort to quit or significantly reduce your smoking habit for this to work.” Issuing ultimatums such as “You need to want to have children” will likely never work and only cause harm and feelings of guilt.For some people, it can take a long time to change long-established behaviors. For example, it can take smokers months or years to quit their habit. Give your partner time to make a concerted effort to change their behavior.

, If you are having a difficult time getting any clarity, talk about your feelings with a person you can trust. This can help you talk through your feelings and more effectively clarify where you stand. The trusted individual may also be able to add some perspective to your or your partner’s behavior as well.Your trusted person can be a friend, family member, a counselor, or health professional.
Make sure that the person won’t betray your confidence and discuss the issue with any outside parties. You may also want to ensure that he or she doesn’t treat your partner any differently, either., After you’ve considered the various dynamics of your relationship, discussed them with your partner, and given your relationship a second chance if applicable, make a final decision on the fate of your relationship.This can help you begin to move on and plan for a respectful and honest break up with your partner, or focus on healing your relationship further.Remember that your decision is based on what is best for you—and no else., It’s best and most respectful to end your relationship in person and discuss your reasoning. Scheduling some time in a quiet place that will allow you and your partner to be alone can help make the process easier and minimize intrusive interruptions..


Consider scheduling time that is not during the work or school week so the person can begin to mourn the relationship in private and without having to face others immediately.You may want to signal your partner or significant other about the nature of the conversation so that they can prepare themselves and don’t feel blindsided.For example, you can say something like “I’d like to talk about the status of our relationship in a calm and peaceful manner.”

, You may want to have the conversation in private to prevent the risk of embarrassing yourself or the other person. In addition, pick a place that you can leave easily so that you don’t get into a protracted or circuitous conversation.If you feel unsafe with your partner, break up in public or bring a person who can back you up without being confrontational.
If you and your significant other live together, breaking up can be particularly problematic and stressful. It is up to you whether or not you want to move out immediately or take your time.
If you don't feel safe or would feel uncomfortable staying in the home you share with your partner, make sure to have a place where you can stay. You can move all of your stuff while she is not home and then break up when she comes home, or break up and leave with some of your things, with the intention to come back when things have calmed down.

, Consider what you want to say to the person. Having a basic plan of your conversation can minimize becoming over-emotional and help keep you on track. It may also make it easier for you to not hurt the person any more than necessary.The actual conversation during which you break up with this person can last a lot longer than it should, especially if your partner is devastated or completely surprised by your decision. Many conversations may go around in circles, so consider giving it a time limit.Be honest with the person, but not mean or brutal. You may want to consider telling the person what first attracted you to him or highlight some of his good qualities as you discuss why you no longer want to stay in the relationship.For example, you can say “I was really attracted to your outgoing personality and kindness when we were first together, but I am afraid we have different goals in life that make it difficult to continue as a couple.”

, Although it may be easier to break up with someone if you don't have to look the person in the eye, ending a relationship by phone, text or email is impersonal and disrespectful. Unless you're a long distance away and choose not to wait until you see the person again, or you're afraid of the other person, give the person the respect she—and your former relationship—deserves.Breaking up in person can also help the person realize you are serious about ending the relationship., Sit down with your partner and let him know that you've decided to end the relationship. Approach the break up as calmly and respectfully as you can, with a sense of resolution, which may help make a bad situation seem slightly less negative and devastating.Don’t badmouth the person or say things you may regret. Remember that this can come back and hurt you in the long run.For example, you wouldn’t want to say “I think your personal hygiene is terrible and it disgusts me to be with you.” Instead, you can say “I think we just have different styles of living that are not compatible with one another.”
Avoid being overly emotional if you can. This can help minimize any feelings of guilt you may have and can also help you stay resolute to your decision.You can say “I think you’re a fine person with many really great qualities that will make someone happy, but they’re just not compatible with what I envision in a relationship.”

, Talk about what isn't working for you in the relationship, rather than telling the other person what is wrong with him. Talking about him personally can make what is likely a devastating situation even worse.For instance, instead of saying ""You're clingy and insecure,"" try saying ""I need a lot of independence and freedom in my relationships.""Don’t put the reasons for breaking up on the person, either. For example, saying “You deserve more” gives your partner an opportunity to say that you are perfect for him and that there is no reason to split up.Instead, you can say “I feel like we’re on different paths in life. I want a career in academia that requires a lot of travel and time alone.”

, Certain open-ended phrases and words can leave false hope with the person about getting back together. Leaving the door open for her can only hurt her and you more.Making statements such as “we’ll talk later” or “I want to be friends/ I want you in my life,” leave the door open for the person to hope that things will work out in the end, even if they won’t in your mind.You’ll need to nicely tell her that you cannot have any contact going forward. You may want to tell her this is the best thing for both of you to heal.In the event that you do want to stay friends, set the parameters for this in your conversation. You may both realize that breaking up is the best thing for your relationship. However, be very clear in your expectations and needs for the friendship.

, This can help you stick to your decisions and may minimize potential manipulation by the person. Prepare for:


Questions. Your partner will likely want to know why you don't want to be with him anymore and whether there was anything he could have done to prevent the breakup. Answer the questions as honestly as possible.Crying. Your partner may be very upset and show it. You can offer comfort, but don't allow yourself to be manipulated into changing your decision.Arguing. Your partner may dispute anything you've said during the break up, including dissecting examples you used in your reasons for breaking up. Don't get dragged into a fight about petty details that don't matter to the bigger picture. Let your partner know that arguing isn't going to change your decision. If the person tries to argue with you, you can simply say “I’m not going to get involved in an argument and will walk away if you continue.”
Bargaining or begging. Your partner may offer to change, or to do things differently in order to preserve the relationship. If the person didn't change when you've discussed your problems in the past, it's too late to expect him to truly change now.
Lashing out. Your partner may say hurtful things and ""push your buttons"" as a way of feeling better. For example, if your partner calls you a nasty name, simply acknowledge it and move on. You can say “I can tell you are very angry with me, but I will not tolerate being called nasty names, so maybe we need to end this conversation.” Threats of physical harm or escalations are serious. If this happens, leave immediately.

, This is one of the most difficult, but important, parts of a breakup. Try and minimize contact with your ex and his friends to help minimize feelings of guilt or giving them false hope.


If you have children with the person, you may not be able to distance yourself altogether. Keep your relationship as civil as possible and put the well-being of your children first.
It may help to delete the person’s number from your phone and email from your computer.
If you live together, move as quickly as possible. If you can't move permanently, find somewhere to keep your stuff and somewhere to stay. Prolonging the entanglements of ""stuff"" can make the process too complicated.
After a while, you may find you are able to be friends with the person. If this is the case, make sure to set parameters for the friendship and any future relationship.

Be sincere.,
Be grateful.,
Use the right body language.",How to Say Thank You1," The most important part of saying thank you in person is being sincere. The person you are thanking should understand that you mean what you say 100% and that you aren't just saying ""thank you"" out of obligation when you don't really mean it. Here's how to do it:


Have a sincere tone of voice. Don't say ""thank you"" as if it's an afterthought or as if someone else just told you to do it. Speak clearly with an even tone, and show that you really mean every word you say. Don't mumble.
Use sincere words. Be specific and show that your thank you means something. Don't just say, ""Thanks,"" but really mean it say, ""Thank you so much for helping me with my homework. I never could have figured this out without your help.""
Be honest. Being honest is a part of being sincere, so open up and say what you really mean. Tell the person, ""I don't know what I would do without you,"" if you really mean it.;
, To say thank you in person, you have to show that you are truly grateful for what the person has done. You should say that the person has impacted you in some way, whether it's big or small. Your thank you should not be perfunctory, but it should show that the person's action really made a difference. Here's how to explain how grateful you are:


Be specific. Don't just say, ""Thank you,"" but say, ""Thank you for taking the time to help me pick out a prom dress. I wouldn't have been able to do it alone. If it wasn't for you, I never would have even tried on that blue dress, and now I can't imagine my prom without it.""
Show that you understood the person made a sacrifice. Whether the person made a big or small sacrifice to do something nice for you, you should demonstrate that you appreciate that he or she had time to make the effort. Say, ""Thank you so much for letting me crash at your place last week. I know it was a really busy time for you and it wasn't easy to have a house guest, and I really appreciate that you took me in anyway.""
Show that you're grateful for the results of the person's help. If the person gave you an amazing book for your birthday, you can tell the person that you read the book, loved it, and that it had a big impact on your life.

, Maintaining the right body language will help you fully demonstrate how thankful you are. If your body doesn't communicate how much you mean it when you say thank you, then your words may be lost on the person you're thanking. Here's how to have the right body language:


Maintain eye contact while you're thanking the person. Look into the person's eyes and give the person all of your attention to show that you really care about what the person did.
Face your body toward the person you're thanking. Keep your arms open and gesture if you need to. Don't fold your arms at your sides, or you may look like you're reluctant about thanking the person and like you don't really want to be there.
Touch the person if it's appropriate. While you don't want to scare off a person whom you don't know very well with your unwarranted touches, if you're thanking a friend or a family member, a light touch on his or her arm or shoulder, or even a hug if it feels right, can help communicate your true feelings.
Show your emotions. If the person impacted your life in a big way, you don't have to cry, but let your face show how touched you are by that person's help.

"
"
Say thank you in a phone call.,
Say thank you in a text message.",How to Say Thank You2," Whether you're thanking a friend, colleague, or a near-stranger over the phone, it can be a bit trickier to thank someone over the phone because it's harder to communicate your true feelings without face-to-face contact. But thanking someone over the phone is easy if you pay attention to a few key points:


Speak clearly. Communicating over the phone can be tricky, so make sure you enunciate your words, speak slowly enough for the person to hear you, and that you aren't calling from a place that is loud or has bad reception.
Give the person your undivided attention. Though it's tempting to multitask when you're on the phone, don't call the person while you're driving home, cleaning your apartment, or watering your plants. Tell yourself that the phone call should only take a few minutes and that if you're really grateful, then that person deserves your undivided attention.
Call at a good time. Make sure you're making a call at a time when the recipient isn't likely to be busy and that you're not calling too early in the morning or too late in the evening. If you're calling a person who lives far away, make sure to account for the time difference.
Have the right body language. Though it may sound silly to use body language over the phone, maintaining an open posture or gesturing with your hands can help you emphasize your true feelings. If you're calling when you're laying down or using your hands to make a sandwich, you won't be able to show the person how grateful you really are.
Know your audience. If you're talking to a family member or a close friend, you can be open, honest, laugh, and be more free about how grateful you are. If you're calling to thank a potential employer for interviewing you, you should still give them your attention, speak clearly, and use proper body language, but you should also keep things short and sweet. Just because you're on the phone doesn't mean you are free to ramble and be chatty; if you're thanking someone for professional reasons, then keep things professional.

, Sometimes, saying thank you in a text message can be more effective than saying thank you in a phone call. If you just saw the person and wanted to thank him or her for a great time, or if you just wanted to send someone a quick thank you without making a big deal about it or taking up the person's time, then a text message may work best.


Maintain your sincerity through texting. You can just say something like, ""Hey! Thank you so much for helping me clean up after my party. You're a great friend and saved me a lot of time.""
Use the person's name. Even if you're texting, saying, ""Thanks, Amy!"" makes your message sound more personal.
Don't sound overly enthusiastic. There's no need for a million exclamation marks to show the person how grateful you are. That will just make it look like you're trying too hard and don't really mean it.
Pay attention to your words. Though texting is more casual, aiming for correct grammar and punctuation will show that you took time to craft the message.

Say thank you in a thank you card.,
Say thank you in an email.",How to Say Thank You3," Thank you cards are a more formal and old-fashioned way to say thank you, and it can be tricky to know exactly what to write in them. Thank you cards are perfect for thanking your professors or teachers for helping you with your work, or thanking your wedding guests for their generous gifts. Here's how you do it:


Whether you're writing or speaking, you should always remember to be sincere and to show how grateful you are.
If you're thanking your professors or teachers for a great year of school, leave a specific note about how their hard work has influenced you and made you a better person.
If you're writing thank you cards to your guests at your wedding, party, or other social event, you may not have enough time to personalize each note, but you can try to call the person by a nickname, or write a quick line about the specific gift he or she gave and how it's a big help to you.
Pick a meaningful card. If you really mean it when you say thank you, you should pick a serious and subtle card to help you communicate this message.
Send your thank-you card as promptly as you can. If you want to say thank you, don't delay it. If you thank someone months after they did something wonderful for you, it may look like you were putting it off or don't really care that much.

, An email is less formal than a thank you card, but it should still communicate your feelings with sincerity, clarity, and honesty, and should be sent in a prompt fashion. Here's how to say thank you in an email:


Be direct. Write ""Thank you"" as the subject.
Address the person as ""Dear (name)"" and sign off by saying ""Sincerely, (your name)."" Even if you're only sending an email, you should follow the conventions of a letter to show that you're taking the process seriously.
Choose your words carefully. The person should know that you spent a lot of time crafting complete sentences that clearly state your feelings.
Show the results of the person's gesture. For example, if the person gave you an amazing sweater, send a picture of yourself wearing it. If the person gave you a lot of money for your birthday, send a photo showing the amazing new kitchen table you were able to buy with it.

Learn how to set appropriate boundaries in relationships and friendship.Boundaries are significant to you living a healthy, stable life.",How to Break Your Addiction to a Person," Write a column for positive things you get out of the relationship, and another column to list the negative things about the relationship. Dig deep into your life to establish whether connections are socially, mentally, emotionally, or professionally healthy.Here are some aspects of healthy relationships for you to consider:Open, honest communication. Both people feel able to express their feelings and opinions without fear of being harmed or belittled for them. Both people use kind, caring language to express their feelings and do not use shaming or blaming language. Both people do not make excuses for their actions. Both people acknowledge the validity of the other's emotions.
Fairness and negotiation. Both people are willing to negotiate and compromise in order to find healthy solutions. Neither person always gives in or gives up. Both people attempt to see the situation from the other person's perspective. Neither person is ""in it to win it"" at the expense of the other.
Shared responsibility and power. Neither person makes all the decisions. If one person usually makes decisions, it is because both people are comfortable with this.
Respect. Both people feel valued for their unique selves. Both people express appreciation for the other. Even when angry or hurt, both people maintain respect and do not use hurtful or violent language or actions.
Trust and support. Both people are supportive of each other. They want the best for the other person. Both people feel like they can rely on the other. Both feel safe to share their emotions, desires, and needs without fear of being judged.
Intimacy. This may be physical affection. It can also be respecting the other person's boundaries or privacy. Truly intimate relationships do not attempt to control or monitor one person's behavior.
Personal integrity. Both people have a sense of self distinct from their relationship. Both have a sense of independence and maintain their own values, tastes, and beliefs. Both partners take responsibility for their words and actions.;
, Many people who become addicted to people have suffered from inadequate family relationships. Many times these family members were not trustworthy or did not provide basic needs, such as food, shelter or emotional support.If the person to whom you are addicted reminds you of a past family member or another relationship, you may be looking to compensate for a previous failed relationship through this current relationship. You will need to separate the feelings from the two different relationships to move on.
A hallmark sign of a codependent person is attracting individuals who are unstable.Maybe you always make friends or start relationships with individuals who are emotionally unavailable. Examine previous relationships to see if this is true for you.

, Write regularly about how the relationship makes you feel and what behaviors, hopes and fantasies you harbor. Writing about a relationship daily can help you avoid glossing over the bad moments and pretending the relationship is always good.

, In addictive relationships, the pair is usually unable to discuss risky issues and often glaze over certain topics with half-truths. If you notice that you and your partner rarely have truly intimate conversations relating to your personal fears or dreams, you may be in an addictive relationship.Healthy relationships involve intimacy in which conversations go below the surface into areas you would normally not share with the public. These attachments also include give and take from both partners as well as mutual benefit from the attachment.Unhealthy and codependent relationships generally stay above the surface and have few fulfilling conversations. Maybe you are always pretending to be cheerful around the other person, but, inside, you feel sad or confused. You may only ever feel relaxed and happy when the other person is feeling this way. You fear what would happen if you told your lover or friend how you really feel., You need to get out of this relationship before the situation gets worse.


Signs of an obsessive relationship may include delusional tendencies in which your partner or friend exaggerates any interaction you have with others. This person may think a smile with a stranger means something more. They may want to check your phone or email to be sure their relationship with you is priority.A controlling partner may cause you to feel as if you have lost your individuality. This person may guilt-trip you about time spent away to the point that you find yourself spending almost no time with family or other friends.
Most people think an abusive relationship equates to physical violence. In fact, obsessiveness and controlling behavior can lend to emotional abuse. If your partner or friend isolates you from others, acts possessive, tries to tell you what to do, or puts you down to maintain a position of authority over you, you may be in an emotionally abusive relationship., It is common in such relationships to see your partner through rose-colored glasses. We have a tendency to maintain fantasies about what a person is like in the hopes of them someday coming true. We also may create fantasy narratives about the relationship that we tell other people.Accept reality about your partner. Instead of saying, ""He's not that bad; he bought me a necklace for my birthday"", tell yourself the truth about your partner: ""She pretends to be jealous about other people I hang out with so I end up only hanging out with her"" or ""She often keeps me from seeing my family."" If the relationship - platonic or romantic - causes you to feel powerless or controlled, you need to admit this to yourself. Don't pretend everything is going well just to maintain the attachment.
Magnification (blowing things out of proportion) and minimization (seeing things as less important than they are) are common cognitive distortions, unhelpful ways of thinking that we can slip into unawares. If you find yourself constantly looking for excuses or dismissing things as ""not that bad,"" you may be using these distortions to justify staying in the relationship., Connections may include things such as finances, housing or work projects. Understand that you will need to give yourself extra time to break these connections. Also, ask yourself if your relationship addiction is based on the conveniences available to you by being with that person.Change your bank account and start receiving paychecks to the new account if you are sharing funds with this person.
Look for a new place to rent or live on a temporary basis if the unhealthy attachment is a roommate.
Remove alcohol, drugs, food, sex or other triggers that may be tempting you to stay in an addictive situation.

, In order to counteract the negative energy and feedback you have been getting in an addictive relationship, you must replace it with positive feedback from other sources. Renew connections now and surround yourself with thriving individuals who value what you have to offer., If you have been ignoring yourself because of a personal addiction, try picking up a hobby, starting to train for a fitness event or going for a promotion at work. If you start working on yourself, you will be able to clearly see how disconnected you have become in an addictive relationship.

, Start each bullet point with “I want...” or “I would like...” so that you can start separating personal desires from relationship desires. These desires can range from wanting to visit Italy to getting a new haircut or color. Focus only on you while you break away from a love addiction. , Think of a plan or develop a script of how you will respond if you encounter this person. Remember: you should limit contact if the person reduces your self-esteem and makes you feel small or unloved.For example, if the person wants to talk on the phone, suggest a date and time, and then go to a supportive friend's house to take the call.

, In the place of euphoria, excitement and infatuation, you may experience fear, self-doubt, loneliness and panic after an addictive, codependent relationship dissolves. Physical symptoms can mimic those of substance abuse like being unable to sleep or eat, cramping, shaking, and experiencing nausea. These are normal parts of breaking a bond that gave you positive feelings. The symptoms will eventually fade., If you feel chronically depressed, seek out the services of a professional counselor. Ending an addictive relationship can make you feel empty inside and make you believe you will never find another person to love. A counselor will help you to understand the importance of working on yourself and making sure you are healthy and whole.


Keep in mind, feelings of worthlessness cannot be stamped out by relationships; you must resolve these feelings in order to ever fully love yourself or another person. Deal with your own self-esteem issues now, before you start dating again.

, You may find strength to cope by listening to the triumphant stories of others who have severed ties from an addictive relationship. In conjunction with seeing a counselor for individual therapy, attending meetings with others like you can help you to educate yourself on addictive relationships and learn how to spot such unhealthy relationships in the future.

, It can be easy to neglect yourself when you are feeling down about ending a relationship with someone you cared about. Take extra time to eat and exercise regularly, get quality sleep, and treat yourself gently. Doing a few self-care activities each week can also help you to feel more like yourself and bring some structure to your new-found independence. Relax in a soothing bubble bath, get your hair cut and styled, or visit the spa for a massage. Don't neglect yourself because you're feeling bad., Many people wrongly assume if they are extremely close to another person when they first meet, it's a sign of a perfect match. Keep in mind, you should have a life beyond your boyfriend/girlfriend or best friend.


The next time you meet a new person be direct about your needs and any limitations you would like to set. In healthy relationships, both partners should have a say in how things work. Don't give up your power in another codependent relationship.
Moving forward, always be mindful and aware of your past relationships/friendships that have been treacherous. Take things slow with any new person that enters your life. Always keep your needs in mind and practice self-care.Finally, continue to seek outside support from your counselor or a local support group to receive education and encouragement as you form new healthy bonds.

Offer the person a unique gum or a mint.,
If the person is your significant other, use kissing as positive reinforcement: ""I love to kiss right after you chew that mint gum.,
Offer the person a snack or drink.,
Pretend you have bad breath.,
Find a way to talk about dental hygiene.,
Lead by example.,
Practice Radical Honesty.,
Water is the solution.",How to Deal With Someone's Bad Breath," Get one for yourself, then offer them one, as if you're just being polite by sharing. If they turn you down, say ""You sure? I love this flavor. You should try it!"" This is especially effective if you carry candy with you that has an unusual flavor, because you can use that as a reason to pressure the person if they don't get it: ""You have to try these popcorn-flavored jelly beans.""


Do this simultaneously: place a mint in their hand while saying ""here,"" incline your head toward them slightly and give them a polite but firm smile. Then immediately go on with your conversation (about something else).;
, It feels so minty and cool."" You can even make it into a playful little ritual--kiss them every time they chew gum, eat candy, or just finish brushing their teeth. They might catch on and learn to use that as a way to hint for a kiss!

, Sometimes people get bad breath because their mouth is dry. Any drink or snack will help, even a glass of water. Just don't offer them any food or drink that might make their breath worse, like milk or anything with garlic or onion in it.

, Say something like ""Ugh, I have some weird breath right now. I haven't eaten for several hours, maybe that's why. Do you have any gum?"" Sometimes this will make the other person wonder about their own breath, and perhaps use whatever remedy they give to you.

, The objective is to raise their consciousness about dental health. You should judge your conversation on how well you know the person.


I always forget to floss. My dentist says I should though, and I've noticed that when I floss regularly, I don't get bad breath as often. Do you floss?
Have you ever used one of those tongue scraper things? Apparently the bacteria that causes bad breath sits mostly on your tongue. Do you know how to use one? I've never tried.

, Practice good dental hygiene in front of this person as much as possible, and act like you're assuming they do the same. After eating, for example, excuse yourself to brush your teeth. Carry some travel sized mouthwash and floss with you. Ask them if they want some.

, Think about it first. How would you like to be told? Simply saying ""Your breath is bad/weird/funky. Here, have some gum."" is embarrassing and offensive. Let them see you checking your breath, and then offer the gum. If they take the hint, fine. If not, just go on.

, As someone said above, a dry/dehydrated mouth will cause bad breath. Water is usually a better solution than gum or a mint, even. Not any snack or drink will do, as something with sugar will make things worse. Constantly have a water bottle with you and offer your companion a drink. If you don't have a water bottle, tell your companion, ""I'm really thirsty. Come with me to get a drink from that water fountain."" They'll probably take one too.

Think about the benefits of being upfront.,
Consider just tapering off contact.,
Try waiting for them to contact you.,
Choose a time to break the news.,
Identify why you're breaking things off.,
Stay realistic about what the relationship was.,
Be direct.,
Try to end things on a positive note.,
Do not say more than necessary.,
Avoid attempting to comfort the other person.,
Stop contacting the person after the breakup.,
Evaluate your approach to online dating.,
Deal with aggressive reactions.",How to Break up With Someone You Met Online," It may be better for you and the other party to be upfront about ending things. You can do this face-to-face, or via text. If you've never met this person in real life, or only met them a couple of times, there's no need to meet them face-to-face if you're not comfortable. However, a longer relationship would benefit from a face-to-face meeting.The main benefits of this approach is that it's a mature way of handling a potentially awkward situation. You won't have to awkwardly avoid the person in the future. You will also avoid any feelings of guilt. If you simply cut someone out, you may regret it later.
The major con is rejecting someone is hard. The other person may react negatively if you reject them upfront. You also may not feel you owe someone an outright rejection if you only knew them via the internet. However, if the person seems very invested in you, you should probably be upfront about your feelings so they have some closure.
If you met someone in real life, and dated for a few weeks, try meeting up in real life. If you only talked to someone online, or only met them a few times, you can break up via text or email.;
, Sometimes, it's best just to slowly taper off contact. If you never met this person in real life, or if you only had one date, consider just slowing contact until they take the hint.One pro to this approach is that you avoid a potentially awkward situation. If the other person seems to be slowing contact as well, they may feel the same way. If the other party doesn't seem invested either, it may be appropriate to slowly stop returning texts and emails.
This is probably not the best approach if the other person seems more invested. If you're getting a lot of texts, emails, and other forms of contact, the other person may want to move towards a serious romance. If this is the case, simply ceasing contact can leave them feeling confused and hurt. A conversation may be better.

, Another approach is allowing the other party to contact you. If you're not sure if the other party is invested in the relationship, give it a few days. If you don't receive any contact, it's safe to assume the other person is not interested in continuing things. At this point, it's fair to simply move on without a formal breakup., In the event you decide to be direct, choose a time to have the conversation. If you're comfortable, you can meet in person. If you don't feel comfortable meeting up again, you can send them a text or email.If you met up for a date and didn't feel a spark, it's best to let the other person know sooner rather than later. This is especially important if the other party seems more enthusiastic than you. Give it a day or so, and then get in touch with them.
You can probably send a text or email if you only met the person once, or never met in person. However, a longer relationship warrants a face-to-face conversation.
Pick a time when you can fairly assume the person is free. If there's a particular time you were regularly exchanging texts and emails, this is probably a good time to talk.

, Before the conversation, figure out why you don't want to continue the relationship. This will help you better express your feelings. Spend some time consider what went wrong, if anything, and why you're not interested in the other person.When did you notice the relationship did not feel right? The person may have said something that indicated you wouldn't be compatible. For example, the two of you may want different things from a romance.
You don't have to be brutally honest with the other person. If there was something particular you disliked about them, there's no need to tell them about this. However, knowing on your own end can make you more confident about breaking things off.

, When breaking things off, try not to make it a bigger deal than it was. Many online relationships are not serious, even if you meet up for a date or two. The other party may be taken aback if you approach the situation with the seriousness of breaking off a longterm, face-to-face romance.Remember, you can exchange many messages online and not have chemistry in real life. While you may feel a connection to this person because of an onslaught of social media interactions, you may not have a real life connection.
The other person may already understand this somewhat. Therefore, you may be able to approach the situation somewhat casually.

, You do not want to beat around the bush when breaking things off. Online relationships can sometimes be confusing, as you interact intellectually before you do so physically. As the boundaries can be confusing, make sure to be as direct as possible when breaking things off. You can send them a text, or meet them in person to let them know.It can be helpful to begin the conversation with something nice. Oftentimes, ending an online relationship is not personal. The online chemistry may simply not be present in real life. You can say something like, ""I had a great time hanging out with you, and you seem like a really nice person.""
Explain your feelings about the relationship. You can be brief and to the point. For example, ""While I had a good time, I just don't feel a romantic spark.""

, There's no need to leave harboring negative feelings. You can still be friendly with someone, even if you're not interested in them romantically. When finishing up the conversation, try to look for some positives. You don't want to leave the other person feeling they wasted their time with a relationship.Wish them luck in the future. You can say something like, ""I had a lot of fun with you. I hope you have good luck finding someone more compatible with you.""
Remember, relationships are a learning process. Most of them do not work out. Even though your online romance fizzled, the two of you probably learned something about yourselves during the process.

, When breaking off an online relationship, especially one that was casual, there's no need to give a laundry list of reasons. If you're sending a text or email, keep things brief. You don't owe this person a detailed explanation.If there was a specific reason, you can mention it if you feel comfortable. However, don't mention anything that could be hurtful.
For example, if you just weren't attracted to the person, there's no need to mention this. If you felt the two of you wanted different things, you can say so. Try something like, ""I got the impression you wanted something more casual. That's fine, but I'm looking for a real relationship right now.""

, If the other person is disappointed, do not try to offer comfort. Rejection hurts. If the other person was more invested, being rejected may be a major blow to their pride. If you offer comfort, this may come off as condescending. Once you tell them you're not interested, slowly taper off contact., When you meet someone online, it's often easier to keep up contact after the relationship ends. You may be inclined to continue to interact with them via Twitter, Facebook, or other social media platforms. However, this could easily be interpreted as mixed messages. Once you've broken things off, cease social media contact, at least for awhile. Give the other person time to understand the romantic part of the relationship is over., Online dating can work for many people, but you may not be approaching it effectively for yourself. If you frequently break things off with online matches, spend some time viewing your approach to the online dating world.You may be spending too much time talking online before meeting in person. Stick to a few conversations to establish whether you have something in common. Then, meet in person. This way, you'll be able to tell right away if this person is right for you.
You can also try meeting people other ways if you don't like online dating. Try going to clubs or volunteering to meet potential romantic matches.

, In the event the other person gets aggressive, react appropriately. If the other partner threatens to harm you or themselves, cease contact. If you believe your safety is being threatened, contact the police. Online harassment can be very dangerous.

"
Do a reality check before dialing the number.,
Don't wait for the person to call you.,
Make sure the person you're breaking up with is in a comfortable place.,
Break up definitively.,
Expect this to be a totally difficult conversation from the moment you tell them onwards.,
Bring the conversation to a close.,
Say all that needs to be said, but nothing more.",How to Break Up Over the Phone," Be one hundred percent certain that this is what you want because once the words are said, that's it, the other person will be absolutely aware of your thoughts. If you are breaking up because you haven't been able to see this person for a while (such as in a long distance relationship), be sure that you're happy about not meeting with them in person to discuss things before seeking to break up completely.


Also consider if the phone really is the best method for doing this. For a relationship that is fairly young, abusive, or distant, this may be the best choice – you're not heavily invested in a young relationship going nowhere, you're probably scared if the relationship is abusive, and if there is distance involved, the practicalities require a phone break up. But where you've been dating for a long time, it might be rough not only on the recipient but on you too. Then again, if you really cannot bear the thought of seeing their face and reactions, or you're really concerned that this will make you undo your commitment to break up by not remaining resolute, the phone might be a valid option. It's your conscience!;
, Once you've made up your mind that this is the only path to take, do it. Unless it's incredibly difficult for you to get in touch with the other person, draw the courage to make the call and get it over with. No matter how much you've been thinking this through, it's highly likely that the other person won't be expecting the break up. If you've waited for them to call you first, only to break the news you want out of the relationship, it will be extra shocking to your significant other who called in looking forward to talking to you, only to realize you've been waiting to break up with them.

, In the age of mobile technology, you can't be sure whether the person you're calling is at home, or on the train, or shopping for groceries, or even stuck in a public phone booth (more likely if they're traveling). If possible, try to call the person when you know they'll have the privacy to process the break up appropriately. If they are busy when you call, or you feel that they're in an inappropriate place to hear this news, you have two choices:


Pretend everything is normal, and try again another time.






Let them know you need to talk about something important. Understand that this will likely make the person nervous and worried, possibly distracting them from the task at hand, so be careful of your tone and the sense of urgency with which you convey this ""need to talk"".







, Say ""I'm breaking up with you"" or ""I've decided to end the relationship."" This tells your partner that it's over, not that it might be over (in which case they could try to persuade you to change your mind). Don't say anything to encourage negotiation, like ""I think I want to break up"" or ""I don't want to be with you anymore"" or ""I'm not happy with this relationship.""

, Be ready for their surprise and awkward silences. Depending on their personality and ability to take bad news, expect anything from silence, to crying, to outrage, to threats such as ""this isn't over until I've had a chance to come and talk this through with you"". Being prepared for the reactions is important, because you will need exit strategies in mind.

, Whether the reaction is questions, crying, arguing, begging, or lashing out, stay calm and committed to your decision. Don't let the conversation drag out. No matter what your reasons, and how unjust or untrue the other person might think those reasons are, you're still entitled to end a relationship you don't want to be a part of anymore. Briefly work out any logistics (e.g. ""I'll come by tomorrow while you're at work and pick up my stuff, please leave it on the front porch"") and end the conversation: ""I understand if you don't agree with my reasons, but that doesn't change my decision. I wish you the best. Goodbye.""

, Before you hang up, make sure you've said everything that he/she needs to hear, but don't let it drag on any further than that. You don't want to pull a ""Joe Jonas"", or end a relationship through a 27-second phone message, but you still have to realise that carrying on a long breakup conversation will not provide the kind of closure that you both need; instead, it will only make things harder.

Be quiet and respectful.",How to Practice Thai Buddhist Monastery Etiquette," Showy clothing is not appropriate. In Thai culture, black is a funeral colour, so dressing in all black is not advised. Long shirts and long skirts or long trousers in plain colours are recommended, especially in higher-ranking or stricter temples. Other places may be slightly more relaxed, and you may even see Thais wearing shorts, but modesty is still appreciated.;
, Showy jewelry or other overt displays of wealth are unacceptable.

,, Don't be surprised if your shoes are 'borrowed' at a larger monastery with many entrances...just wait patiently and they will be returned.

,, If a woman must offer something to a monk, do not hand it directly to him. Put it down somewhere he can pick it up. An offering cloth may be used for this purpose in Thailand, however, in Thai monasteries outside of Thailand, the use of an offering cloth is not as common.

,


The person in the highest position is the most respected. If a monk is seated, try not to stand/walk past with your head above him. This can be done by shuffling while kneeling if you need to move.
Do not walk in front of people who are bowing.
Do not step on the threshold.

, This gesture of respect is called a ""wai"". The monk will not return this gesture. He is not being impolite, just accepting your respect.

,,,,, Don't make a lot of noise or run about.

Bring up the accomplishment.,
Say ""congratulations"" with a smile.,
Mention your feelings on the subject.,
Try to make it heartfelt.",How to Congratulate Someone1," Don't skirt around the issue when there's something to celebrate! Mention the reason that congratulations are in order right off the bat. If you want, you can tell the person how you heard the news. This will set the right tone and make it easier to say the right words and share in the person's excitement. Here are a few ways to bring it up:


Craig, I heard the big news that you're engaged! How wonderful!
Celine, your father told me that you scored more points than anyone else on the team this season.
Lola, I just saw your Facebook post. I am so excited to hear that you're having a baby!
Marcus, we just heard the great news that you were promoted to senior manager.;
, After stating the achievement, express your congratulations with a winning smile. The expression on your face is pretty important, because if you say congratulations with a serious look on your face, the person will probably think you aren't actually all that happy for him or her.


If you're congratulating a close friend or relative, you can give the person a hug, too.
If you're worried your facial expression won't come off the way you want it to, you might try practicing in the mirror at home before you see the person.
Your tone of voice matters, too. When you say ""congratulations,"" sound excited - not flat.

, If it's appropriate, you can follow up the word ""congratulations"" with an expression of how you feel. For example, you could say that you've enjoyed watching the person work toward his or her goal, or simply say ""I'm really happy for you."" Be as expressive as you want, keeping in mind that your tone of voice will really make a difference.


Another way you could follow your initial expression of congratulations is by asking some questions about the accomplishment. If your friend is having a baby, for instance, you could ask about the due date, or ask if there's any way you can help out in the coming months.
If you're expressing congratulations in a professional setting, especially to your boss or manager, it's fine to be a bit more private after you've expressed congratulations. Stick with the usual customs of your workplace; if people are generally friendly and effusive, say as much as you want. If you work in a traditional corporate environment, you may not want to go overboard.

, No matter why you're congratulating someone, try to make your words and actions as genuine as possible. Of course, there are moments when it's necessary to congratulate someone when you're not feeling particularly happy for them, and in those cases you just have to fake it as well as you can. But try to remember that you'll have your turn in the spotlight at some point, and there's nothing wrong with celebrating someone else and trying your best to emanate positive vibes instead of nursing jealous thoughts.


If you feel forced to congratulate someone when you really aren't happy for them, it might be best to send a note instead of congratulating him or her in person. You might not be able to control your facial expressions face to face. The person could be left feeling deflated, or wondering whether you're jealous.

Beware of your initial facial expression.,
Maintain open body language.,
Listen to the entire message before speaking.,
Ask clarifying questions about the problem.,
Thank the person for the feedback.,
Consider your relationship with the person.,
Think about the context of the feedback.,
Get a second opinion.,
Determine whether to use or discard the information.,
Seek input from others.,
Brainstorm possible solutions to correct your behavior.,
Take action on making these changes.,
Follow up with the person to reassess your progress at a later date.",How to Accept Constructive Criticism," When you hear negative information about yourself, it’s normal to instantly react. Override your urge to frown, roll your eyes, or ignore the person. Exhibiting any of these behaviors can be off-putting and limit the amount of helpful feedback you receive in the future.


Maintain either a welcoming facial expression or try to keep your face blank. This is especially important to partner relationships where emotions play a large role in dynamics.Sending a negative facial signal can put an end to any further conversation. This also sends the message that you don’t find it helpful to learn from others. An attentive and encouraging look can signal to the person giving the criticism that you are open and ready to listen.;
, Your body language can also steer others from giving you constructive feedback. Be mindful of how you are carrying your body when someone is discussing your behavior or performance.


Something as simple as slouching or crossing your arms can signal to others that you are closed off or somehow reacting negatively to what is being said. Nervous movements or gestures can also send negative signals to others.The best stance to use when actively listening to constructive criticism is one that shows you are open to listen with arms at your side, but standing tall and confident.

, Really listen to what is being said without running your reply in your head while it is being delivered. Practice non-reactive listening by not arguing or fighting about what is being said. The point is to turn that suggestion inward to learn from it, not to start an argument. By taking your defensive reaction out of the equation you are giving yourself more time and energy to connect with the person speaking and apply what you hear.The basics of active listening are also helpful to show in a non-verbal way that you are listening and also hearing what is being said. This includes making eye contact, staying open by not folding your arms and leaning into the conversation.

, See if the person has any suggestions for how you can correct the problem. Be very mindful of your tone of voice to avoid sounding anything but sincere when asking for suggestions and further information. Keep the conversation going by remaining open and engaged.An example of a clarifying question would be: “When you say I did not take the assignment seriously, what did you mean?”

, Make sure your body language matches the words you say when you thank them. Approach the opportunity to change as a positive challenge and frame it as such.Example of genuine expressions of gratitude may include: “Thank you for coming to me to talk about ways I can work better on our team, I appreciate hearing there is room for improvement.” or “I value your opinion, thank you for the suggestions.”

, Even if you don’t like what you are hearing, the relationship with the person can help you determine whether they are saying it to hurt you or help you. Is this your close friend or an enemy? Is the feedback coming from your boss or a competing coworker?


The source can tell you a great deal about how much weight the criticism holds. If this person is someone you are close to the input may hold more weight than just a co-worker.
Is the feedback coming from someone who always seems to have something to say about everything? In that case the input may be ignored., Was the feedback delivered in the heat of the moment in front of other people or was it one-on-one after the fact? Did the situation seem emotional or sincere?


Sometimes people say things in front of other people just because they have an audience and they may not even mean what was said. If there were heightened emotions involved the feedback may be less than constructive.
A sincere delivery adds credibility to what was said and also works to create a supportive relationship.

, Do others agree that you need to work on this area? Ask someone you trust before you go making changes based on unhelpful feedback.


In the event that the criticism is actually constructive, chances are there will be others who have noticed the same issue. Opening up and asking for suggestions may start a conversation with the people you ask for a second opinion that leads to further growth.

, Just because you are receptive to constructive criticism does not mean you have to apply the suggestion to your life. Carefully assess the feedback you receive and choose suggestions that are beneficial to your personal growth.

, Get advice from others about how you can improve in the specified area. A good way to grow personally and professionally is through mentorship.If you can, find a person who is good in the area in which you have a shortcoming. Ask the person if he or she is willing to give you some guidance in the area or allow you to shadow them.


For instance, you might get some feedback on your speaking style in a public speech course. You can ask a friend or an instructor something like “I have heard when I get nervous I talk so fast that I am hard to understand. Any hints to help me calm down and focus on my delivery?”

, Remember brainstorming means being open to every suggestion without judgment. Write everything down and sort through them after the brainstorming process.In a journal, take 15 minutes to write down every possible solution. Keep writing the entire time without worrying about how realistic any one item is.
After the initial list, go back and see if there are trends or ways to group the suggestions together. Once you identify trends you can start to flesh out details that are reasonable.

, Keep the written list of the changes for accountability. Commit the necessary time to see the changes all the way through. This will build trust and show you are open to the process of using constructive criticism for positive change., Approach the person in a positive manner and again show your appreciation for their help. Share your brainstorming process and the changes you have made. Ask for feedback about what he or she has seen as far as the changes being made.


Returning to those who have given you feedback in a humble, help-seeking way truly inspires cooperation and teamwork. The person will more than likely be impressed that you are really taking their recommendations to heart. If appropriate, you may even be able to offer this individual positive constructive criticism to help him or her improve in some area.

Recognize this personality trait and resist prying for justification of this person's behavior, as this will only be counterproductive. If the person has already proven to be unresponsive to constructive dialogue, sometimes it's best to accept his or her refusal for the time being.;
, A little sugar never hurt anyone! The next time you see this person, you might want to bring something that lightens the mood and pleases — perhaps a cup of coffee, a lemon and candied ginger muffin, or a fun story that might be appreciated.

Show people that you really care.",How to Be Gracious," One of the most important qualities of a gracious person is the ability to thank people for their efforts, however big or small they were. Even if a co-worker is just calling you to tell you something, thank him or her for making the effort. If someone is asking you to donate money on the street, thank them for trying, even if you say no. If a friend picks up coffee or reminds you that your favorite show is coming on later, say thank you.


A big part of being gracious is being able to appreciate what people do for you. And how do you show your appreciation? You say thank you.
You can say “thank you” with a small gift, a note, or even a hug. There are a number of ways to thank somebody, and you have to pick the best way for the situation.;
, Gracious people are other-driven, not self-driven, and they care more about other people than they care about themselves. Make an effort to really hear what people are saying to you, to make eye contact, and to put away any distractions, like your phone, which may keep you from fully giving people the attention that they need. Don’t interrupt people and hold your questions or comments to the end so they can finish saying what they have to say and feel like you really care about them.


Note all of the details of what a person is saying to you, so you can bring them up later. If someone mentions that his sister just had a baby girl, the next time you see him, you can ask how his little niece is doing; the person will be impressed that you care enough to remember this.
Show sympathy. If a person is upset, you can say, “I can’t imagine what you’re going through. That must be so hard because…” Let the person see that you’ve really heard what you were told.
Don’t multi-task. If you’re sending an email or texting a friend and a co-worker or roommate wants to talk to you, just ask to hold off for a minute so you can give that person your full attention.

, Being gracious means paying attention to people in social situations. Instead of worrying about how you come off or what you should say next, you should watch other people to have a sense of their moods, to see if they are worried or anxious, and to understand how they interact with each other. Though it’s good to be self-aware enough to be tactful, respectful, and kind, it’s equally important to notice what other people are thinking and feeling.


A gracious person understands that other people are just as important as he or she is. That’s why it’s so important to pay attention to them.

, Gracious people don’t look for ways to cut people down, criticize them, or make them feel small. They do quite the opposite. Even if they’re not sure about a person’s intentions, they keep things positive and imagine that people want the best for everyone, too. Instead of gossiping or saying something negative about a person you don’t know that well, imagine that he or she is a nice person, just like you.


If you make a habit of doing this, then you’ll have a reputation of being a kind, respectful person, instead of a mean gossip, and people will want to spend even more time with you.

, Gracious people are always looking for the good in people and are therefore invested in making other people feel good about themselves – not in a “because it’ll make people like me more” kind of way, but in a very real, genuine way that makes them want to give credit where credit is due. Look around. Compliment not just the most obvious things (“I love your new haircut”) but the things people work hard for (“I love how the sunlight hits the furniture in your room. You must have spend hours decorating!”) to show that you’re really paying attention.


If you don’t feel like giving a compliment, don’t do it just to be nice. But if you make a habit of complimenting people, you’ll be better at spotting opportunities where people deserve a compliment.

, If you want to be gracious, then remember that it’s more important for everyone to be happy than for you to be right. Instead of trying to prove your point, argue with the person next to you (even if you’re positive that you’re right), you should be kind to the person, change the subject, or say something like, “I guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree.” Swallowing your pride may not be fun, but neither is arguing with someone just so you can look good – there’s nothing gracious about that, is there?If you really have the urge to argue with someone or correct him or her, just count backwards from ten and tell yourself that it won’t really be worth it. What will you gain from it?
If two people are arguing in front of you, be gracious by changing the subject.

, Do you really have to share everything that’s on your mind all the time? Chances are, other people have something to contribute, and you should let them say what they want to say. If you and someone else start speaking at the same time, insist that the person go first. Ask lots of questions instead of talking about yourself and show that you’re really interested in people. People love to talk about their ideas and themselves, and it’s gracious to accept that instead of stealing the spotlight.


This doesn’t mean you have to turn into a shy, quiet person if that’s not who you are. It just means you should let other people talk instead of being in the center of the conversation.

, Being gracious means saying “after you” in the literal and metaphorical sense. If you want to be gracious, then you have to put others first, whether you’re letting someone order ice cream before you thought you’re having a killer chocolate craving, or whether you’re letting a car cut in in front of you even if you’re late to work. It’s a mindset. Other people should go before you, and it’s really not so important – you’ll get your turn anyway, and you’ll be more gracious for it.


This doesn’t mean you should let people walk all over you, though. It does mean that you should put others first when it is reasonable to do so.

, Gracious people are always humble. They don’t brag about how great they are or show off; instead, they act modest and wait for other people to note their achievements. They don’t make a spectacle of themselves, they are in awe of how big and complicated the world is, and they don’t march into a room like they own the place. If you want to be humble, then be happy to be who you are without showing off about it.


Always give other people credit. If someone says you’ve done great work on a project, mention that you couldn’t have done it without the help of your other co-workers.

, Treat other people with kindness and respect – even if they don’t always deserve it. Be punctual if you said you were going to be somewhere. Hold doors for people. Don’t text your friends or look distracted when you’re supposed to be giving another person your full attention. Make eye contact, don’t curse, and treat people kindly regardless of their social status or their position within your social network or company.


Treating people with respect means treating everyone the same, regardless of what you think they can do for you.

, Having tact means not saying anything that is offensive, off-color, or just plain weird. Tactful people think before they speak and they are discreet if they have to say something slightly uncomfortable – like if they have to tell a person that he has something in his teeth. Be aware of what you say and also of how you say it – you may mean well, but your comment may be taken the wrong way because of your tone or the words you used.


Being tactful means not bringing up anything that can cause a stir. If you know you’re hanging out with two people who have very opposite views on Obamacare, for example, then don’t bring it up in their company.

, Generous people are able to give – whether it’s their time, their money, or their love and kindness. Be a person who is always looking for a way to help others, whether we’re talking about your closest friends or perfect strangers who are in need. Cultivate a generous spirit that is always looking for ways to help other people and to improve and expand their lives.


Being generous with your time is important. Sure, helping your friend clean her apartment will be a time suck, but she’ll really appreciate all of the help since she’s been so down in the dumps lately because of her break-up.
Being generous also means recognizing opportunities when you can help out. Your sick friend may not say that he’d love it if you picked up chicken soup for lunch, but that doesn’t mean he won’t appreciate it.

, It’s important to take a compliment the right way if you really want to be gracious. Thank people for their compliments, and show how much their words mean to you. You don’t have to downplay it or make it sound like you don’t deserve it; sounding overly-modest can get a little bit annoying. Instead, say something like, “Thank you so much for saying that. It means so much to me.”


If you can give a return compliment at the time, that would be great. For example, if someone says, “Thank you so much for helping me with my math homework,” you can say, “It was my pleasure. And thank you for helping me with the English homework last week. That was so helpful.”

, Gracious people know how to handle criticism – whether it’s constructive or not. If the criticism is constructive, then you have to be able to see the value from it, learn from it, and make a plan for growing or improving the qualities you were criticized for. And if the criticism was just meant to hurt you, then you can let it roll off your back and take the higher ground by not saying something negative about the person in return.


A great deal about your character can be revealed depending on how you take criticism. If you immediately get angry and defensive then this shows that you are uncomfortable acknowledging your flaws. Furthermore, it just won’t be very gracious.

, Gracious people act the way they do because they know how to count their blessings instead of focusing on the challenges they have to face. They know exactly what they have to be thankful for, whether it’s their health, their friends, their family, and/or their opportunities, and they never forget any of those things for a second. If you want to be grateful, then you have to always know how much you have to be thankful for, no matter how upset or frustrated you may be feeling at any given moment.If you’re really feeling out of your element or down in the dumps, it helps to write a gratitude list. This can include all of the things you’re thankful for, and you can add to it whenever another thing occurs to you. Taking the time to read over the list and smile can make you feel more grateful no matter how bad your day was.

, Give your time to people who really need it and help out in your community by working at a soup kitchen, library, homeless shelter, or another place where you can help people in need. Do this at least once a week and see how much of an impact you can have on the people around you – and how much they can change your life for the better. You should volunteer because you really feel like making a difference, and you will see how much more gracious you become when you see all of the challenges that other people had to face to be where they are.


You’ll see that the people you are helping will be helping you out as much as you’re helping them. Volunteering can make you feel more grateful for all of the advantages you have and will give you a fresh perspective.

, If you really want to be gracious, then you shouldn’t just help out your friends when they really need you; you should do them favors just to say thank you, just because they’ve been good friends, or because you know they need a little bit of cheering up. Pick up lunch for your friends, help them do laundry, or give them a ride to their work when their car breaks down. Help your mom clean the floor. You’ll be all the more gracious for it.


If you have a good relationship, then you’ll receive some favors in return, and you’ll feel happy about the reciprocation.

, Truly gracious people know that they aren’t perfect and are ready to admit their shortcomings. Whether you’ve hurt a friend, said something you didn’t mean, or messed up at work, it’s important to acknowledge the fact that you aren’t perfect and make a goal to improve the next time around. It’s far more important to admit to your flaws than to be in denial in order to save face and look tough. Sure, it won’t be pleasant, but you’ll be all the more gracious for giving the people around you the respect they deserve by admitting your mistakes and apologizing for them.


When you do apologize, make sure that you are sincere and really mean it, so the people around you don’t think you’re apologizing just to get it over with.

, Sending “thank you” cards to people is another great way to show your gratitude. Thank your professors, colleagues, or other important people who have improved your life, and make it a habit. You don’t even have to be so formal: thank your best friends, your significant other, or even your neighbors for helping you out during a difficult time. Try to send at least one “thank you” card each month and you’ll be even more aware of all that you have to be thankful for.

, Doing this makes people feel important. Get good grades to show your teachers that you respect them and follow their good teaching rules. Follow your parent's advice on what to do, and hear their opinions on things. Doing things like this will leave you, and other people feeling great. They will really feel important that you are taking the time to learn from them.

Send an email or card.,
Send a gift.,
Spread the word.,
Celebrate with a party.",How to Congratulate Someone2," In addition to saying ""congrats"" in person, you might want to send a congratulatory note. You could send a simple email or Facebook note, or write a message on a card you pick out from the stationary store. The note you write should include the basics - a mention of the accomplishment, the word ""congratulations,"" and a few happy sentiments.


This note is perfect for a relative: Dear Suzette, we learned that you and George are expecting a new baby this year. Congratulations! We are thrilled that a new member will soon be joining the Comer clan! We can't wait to see you at the Halloween party to hear how things are going. Much love, Betty and Pete

If you're writing a note to a colleague, make it a bit more formal: Joan, I heard the great news that you were promoted to Chief of Staff. Allow me to express my heartfelt congratulations on this accomplishment. I know the company will change in very positive ways under your leadership. All best, Ryan

To congratulate someone on getting married, it's okay to gush a little: Tim and Mary, from the moment I saw the two of you together it was clear you were meant for each other. You're an amazing couple, and everyone who knows you can feel the love you two exude. Congratulations on starting your journey together! I wish you many years of happiness! Love, Brenda


, If the occasion is special enough to merit a gift, something thoughtful and not too expensive is usually the right way to go. Choose a gift that lets the person know you want to celebrate with them and send it with a note of congratulations.


You can't go wrong with flowers, whether you want to mark a professional achievement or a personal landmark.
Food items are also usually welcome. Pick a universal favorite, like chocolates or fresh fruit.
A bottle of wine or good bourbon might be a good choice.
For a high school or college graduate, a small amount of cash will probably be appreciated.

, You can help spread the person's joy by telling other people the good news, so they can congratulate the person as well. Write a congratulatory post on Facebook, or get everyone in the office to sign a card. Before you decide to spread the word, just make sure the news is yours to share! Some people might prefer to keep good news private until they're ready to reveal it to more people.

, If your best friend got into the college of her dreams, or your colleague is moving on to greener pastures, having a party to congratulate the person is a great way to show how much you care. It doesn't have to be a giant bash - you could hold an after-work gathering at a restaurant, or invite people over for pizza to celebrate. The person you're congratulating will never forget your kind gesture!

Congratulate someone on a professional achievement.,
Share your excitement that someone is getting married.,
Offer congrats to someone having a baby.,
Congratulate someone for getting through a tough time.",How to Congratulate Someone3," In the workplace, there will be many occasions for congratulating your colleagues on their new promotion or job. Remember to keep your company culture in mind when you choose how to congratulate someone at work. Don't be overly effusive in a formal office atmosphere - keep it professional. Here are some great ways to congratulate someone at work:


Say ""congratulations"" in person, with a genuine smile.
Write a brief and professional congratulatory note.
If you're close to the person, you could take him or her out for drinks or bring a treat to the office for everyone to share.

, When you're congratulating someone who just got engaged or married, show some excitement for them! Give them a call or write a note on Facebook to tell them you wish them many years of happiness. If you're close, an additional gesture is probably in order:


Send a card with a personal note congratulating the couple.
Consider sending a small gift, like flowers or a bottle of wine.
If the person is a colleague, have everyone in the office sign a card for the happy coworker.
Consider throwing a shower if you're close to the person.

, A baby on the way is another sentimental occasion that should be marked with a genuine smile and hug. If your friend, relative or colleague announced a pregnancy, say congratulations in person and consider doing the following:


Send a card. It's customary to do so, and you'll find many options in the stationary store.
Send a gift. If you feel like it, you could send a little baby gift in anticipation of the birth.
Throw a shower. If you're close to the person, you might be the right one to organize a baby shower.

, If you notice that someone has overcome some personal hurdles, you might want to show your encouragement and love by congratulating them. For example, maybe your friend just finished a round of chemo and found out that her cancer is in remission, or your aunt just finished getting her degree after many years of hard work. Figure out the gesture that best matches the situation.


Sending a thoughtfully-written note is always a nice idea - especially when the person isn't expecting to get it.
Taking the person out to dinner or out for drinks is a good way to celebrate a personal achievement.

These statements hurt people in different ways, but can all be cruel and cause mistrust and anger. By identifying the kinds of phrases you use when talking to others, you can think more carefully about not using them in the future.Character assassination. This a broad statement that defines a person rather than highlighting a specific complaint. These statements suggest that the other person is innately bad or valueless, and won’t solve your problems.
Invalidation. This is another way of responding to a person’s position without actually responding to it. You are diminishing the person’s perspective or views as not worth a response. Rather than address what the person is saying, you respond by saying “That’s just stupid” or “You’re just not making any sense.”
Challenging. Similar to invalidation, you are responding to a person’s points by dismissing them, or using it as a chance to show how dumb you think they are. Mean challenges include saying things like “How could you say something so stupid?” or “Do you even know what you are talking about?”
Preaching. This is responding to another person by scolding them and what they are saying. This can be mean or hurtful if you are talking to someone who isn’t necessarily your subordinate, and therefore shouldn’t be receiving that kind of response. Statements like “You ought to know better than doing that,” or “You are so immature” attack the person’s behavior and treat them like a scolded child.
Threat of abandonment. This suggests the person you are talking to is worthless, or at least not worth talking to. Statements like “I don’t care what you do,” or “I don’t need this anymore” suggest you are prepared to walk away, and that the other person has no meaning to you.
Threat of exile. This is similar to abandonment, but more direct. Cruel statements like his are things like “Just get out,” or “I don’t want to deal with this, just get lost.” Rather than suggesting that you don’t care, you are actively pushing the person away.;
, When you are in a good mood, find good things to say about other people, whether to their faces, others, or just yourself. Thinking positive thoughts will help incline you more towards compassion and understanding, and less likely to use cruel words when you are angry or upset. Plus, saying nice things to others will help them think better of you, and respond in kind., Find ways to get profanity out of your language. Cursing might feel good, but it’s a lazy way to communicate. Plus, the more you use it, the more likely it is to slip out into conversations where you don’t want it, which is a good way to offend someone., Sometimes cruelty comes from not understanding another person’s perspective. You can insult them without even meaning to because you haven’t thought about their point of view. Remember that other people see the world differently from you, and accept that they may find things cruel that you don’t imagine are.


One way to do this is to talk to someone who you know disagrees with you. Ask them about their beliefs, and make sure to listen, rather than argue, with their response., If you feel yourself getting angry, and are concerned that is might express itself by saying something cruel, find ways to relax yourself quickly. Try some deep breathing from the gut to slow your heartrate, or find a way to think briefly about something else. Repeating a simple mantra like “relax” or “take it easy” is one good way, or visualizing a relaxing experience., Avoid broad generalizations about a person’s work or activities. By keeping it specific, you can give the other person something tangible to fix. Broader statements about a person’s character are more likely to be taken personally, and are harder to overcome.Specific complaints include referring to moments, saying things like “You drive me crazy when you do that,” or “That was really selfish of you.” These are better than more general statements about a person’s self-worth, such as “Why do I even try? You’ll never get it” or “You only care about yourself.”

, Sometimes, people can be cruel because they respond to something quickly. A short response can easily be misinterpreted, so try to expand your answers with an explanation. This lets the other person know what you are trying to say, rather than letting them guess., Allowing someone else to be cruel to you can build anger and resentment, which makes it more likely you will respond in kind. If someone is being cruel to you, address it directly. This is someone you will see often, so not addressing it will more likely lead to greater problems later.Use “I” statements. One cruel way to respond to someone hurting you is to accuse them of doing things wrong. You will probably get an accusatory response right back. A nicer way to get your message across is to talk about how it makes you feel. Saying “I feel diminished when you talk to me that way” is much better than telling someone “That was rude” or “How could you be so dismissive to me.”

, If you are angry with someone, and feel that you aren’t going to be able to control yourself from saying something mean or cruel, do something else. Find an activity to take your mind off of your angry feelings, and let them dissipate before you talk to that person.This can be reading a book, listening to music, or talking to a friend. Anything that will help calm you down and take your mind off of how angry you are.

Ground yourself first.,
Drop hints.,
Change the topic.,
Be a bit more assertive.,
Be honest.,
Be respectful and genuine when raising the matter of chatter with your friend.,
Feign weariness.,
Avoid using distractions to cope that will simply egg on your friend.,
Consider toning down the amount of time you spend with this friend if nothing you've tried has worked.",How to Be Friends With Someone Who Talks Too Much," Before assuming that this is all about your friend, consider your own behavior first. We all have flaws if yours is impatience or a dislike of listening, then your friend may not be talking too much objectively, but is doing so by your standards. On the other hand, if you are patient and respect your friend enough to listen carefully, and yet you can't seem to get many of your own words into the conversation, then it's probable that she or he is talking a lot more than usual.


If your friend insists that you are ""such a good listener"", this can be a warning sign!
Ask mutual friends tactfully if they have any experiences of this friend talking too much. They may be able to confirm your experience, making it more certain that you're being objective. You may not even need to ask––if everyone refers to this mutual friend as a ""talker"", then your own impressions are right.;
, If your friend has particular axes to grind or topics to chew on, you might be able to use a parallel experience to highlight what your friend is doing. For example, if your friend insists on constantly talking about the latest gadget releases in fine detail, pick a character off a TV show who does the same and make a pointed comment, such as ""I find how X always talks about early releases of software like they're more important than anything else happening that day to be a bit overwhelming. Doesn't he have anything else to talk about?"" The trouble with dropping hints is that they're not always noticed and even if they are, they're easily forgotten because they're a tad passive aggressive.

, It is possible that your friend only gushes on and on when it comes to certain topics, like the person she or he is dating, fashion, politics, beliefs, whatever. And you might find that if you get your friend off that topic, that she or he is actually very reasonable and listens well, converses well and knows when to keep quiet. If this is the case, you might need to come to a mutually agreed arrangement whereby the two of you have a signal when either of you has strayed into talking too much about ""that topic"". If you make this a case of both of you having to curtail talking too much on a particular topic, your friend won't feel so singled out.


Have a list of alternative topics ready to spring on your friend whenever she or he ratchets up on the pet discussion.
Don't worry about making a change of topic obvious. It's a small price to pay for alerting your friend to ""too much talk"".
Sometimes, no matter what you do, changing the topic will have a link that gets your friend back to the original topic and the incessant chatter starts up again! If this happens and you haven't mutually agreed to can the topic when it gets out of hand, it's time to tackle the problem head on.

, When your friend gets into full swing, don't be afraid to interrupt at opportune moments. While this goes against the usual etiquette advice of being a good listener, sometimes it's the only tool you have left after politely listening for ages to someone who doesn't show the same respect back.Perhaps try to change the topic or give an example of what they're discussing but from your perspective and experience.

, Sometimes it's best to be forthright and to simply tell your friend that you feel she or he has said so much that you haven't had a chance yet to explain your impressions or to reveal your news. Ask your friend to slow down for a bit to give you a chance to add something too.


Try telling your friend that she or he has talked about so many things that you've started to forget what she or he said in the first place!

, At some stage, you may feel that it's necessary to raise the issue of her or his talkativeness. In doing so, here are some important points to take note of:


Avoid telling your friend that she or he is selfish, narcissistic or thoughtless. Perhaps your friend is these things but if you want to stay friends, this isn't a good way to improve your relationship. Instead, couch the problem in terms of what you don't feel you're getting when the two of you converse, such as a good connection and a feeling that you're both sharing information; and feel free to explain that you feel a bit left out.
Remember to use ""I feel"" statements and not make any pointed comments about her or his personal traits.
Explain that you know how excited your friend gets about certain topics and how much you love learning about their perspectives; then make it clear that you'd love the chance to share your perspectives with your friend too, as you value their input and ideas about your thoughts.
Be aware that some people talk too much when they're experiencing challenges in their life, such as stress and anxiety, while someone suffering from bipolar disorder who is experiencing a manic phase might lean toward incessant chatter. While this doesn't excuse being selfish or even offensive, it does call for some understanding on your behalf.

, Tell your friend that you need a rest from chatting so much. Say something like: ""Hey, let's just sit here quietly for a little while, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night."" Or perhaps open your smartphone to Facebook and say, ""I need to check my updates because I didn't get a chance yesterday––do you mind if I just do this for a few minutes"". Or perhaps, ""I can't digest too much today, I can't think clearly because I have a headache––do you mind if we just stay quiet for a moment and watch the world go by?"". Use whatever fits your personality style and doesn't seem rude in the context––just enough of a break to give over your message that the conversation has been all one-sided.

, There are schools of thought that suggest that you can cope by focusing somewhere else or going into your own mind, using such techniques as nodding absent-mindedly or routinely agreeing even though you haven't listened. The problem with this is that you will look glazed over, you will miss an important point in the discussion and your friend will likely consider this far ruder than interrupting.


One constructive gesture that may help to speed up your friend, is checking your watch, diary or calendar and perhaps even making moves to leave, such as stacking your items up or putting them in your bag.
Try not to look around you, or stare off into the distance. Your friend might think that you're ignoring her or him and might be insulted. Stay engaged briefly but then try one of the suggested methods rather than letting your friend think you're interested in the non-stop chatter.

, If you're certain you want to remain friends but you're equally certain that you can't bear too many of the talkative meet-ups with her or him, minimize the amount of time you can spend together. Some options include:


Only meeting up once in a while, when the news actually is interesting to you.
Making sure that you have an appointment to get away in exactly half an hour after meeting up––keep it short and sweet.
Keep a healthy friendship by offering other things to do. If he/she is a gossiper, maybe offer to read some magazines or watch MTV. If they're an outgoing person, try visiting another friend or going to a place with lots of people. If they like or talk about a lot of sports, go to a school football game one night or challenge your friend to a game of soccer or better yet, round ho the neighborhood fir a game or two. The possibilities are endless. Just tailor a distracting your friend according to their likes.
Text, email or instant message more often than you meet in person.

Take a moment to compose yourself.,
Anticipate their arguments.,
Prepare facts and statistics.,
Choose when to confront someone.,
Appeal to their better side to bypass any defensive behaviours.,

Keep your cool.,

Reconnect with others.",How to Argue Effectively with a Person in a Position of Privilege," If you are moved to argue with a person of privilege, take a moment to gather your thoughts before you speak. Process the statement or the situation and reflect quickly on what you’d like to say and how best to say it.For example, if you are at work and hear a man say something negative about a woman based on her gender rather than her behaviours, take a moment to articulate your issue with a statement and think of the best way to communicate the problem.;
, Not only should you know your side, you should know the likely counterarguments that will arise from the other person. That way, you will be prepared to rebut them.While researching your topic, try to read articles that have an opposing view to yours so you have a general idea of what counterarguments may arise.
For instance, many people in positions of privilege think reports of other people's suffering are exaggerated or distorted. Find data that shows evidence of the suffering and the disadvantages that follow.

, When you know the subject you want to discuss with someone beforehand, do ample research so you are prepared with all the facts you will need. Try to find as many sources of news and fact as possible.If the topic contains an academic subject (such as law) research scholarly articles using Google Scholar or other sites for academic journals and books.
Always be careful to read and research using reliable news sources. The world is full of inaccurate and unverifiable information, so make sure that the information you are using for your argument is reliable.

, If the person holds a position of power over you, or could pose a safety threat, it may be dangerous to call them out. If you could lose your job, get kicked out of your house, be physically attacked, or otherwise be harmed by disagreeing with this person, don't proceed. Your physical and emotional safety comes first.


For example, it may not be wise to confront your boss about his privilege if you’ve been recently hired. Any hostility you show could be interpreted as an attitude problem, and affect your long term career.

, While engaging in the argument, try to uphold their character while being critical of the unwanted ideas. People can easily take criticism of their behaviour as criticism of their character, so make it clear that you respect them as a human being. If they have been oppressive, phrase the issue as a deviation from their usually good behaviour, rather than an attack on them.For example, if your friend has been making unfounded statements about a specific community, you could say, ""You're such a fair-minded person. I'm surprised to hear these remarks coming from you.""
If your neighbor puts down someone with a disadvantage, say, ""I'm surprised a thoughtful person like you would disparage anyone with different challenges in life.""

, Even someone with every apparent advantage in life has probably struggled in some way. If you know someone well, you can refer to this. If you don't know them well, just assume that they know what it's like to be deprived of something that they need and base your argument on such, expressing surprise if they claim not to know.You might say, ""Chris, I know you've had moments of hopelessness: I certainly have. Can't you see that people sometimes act out when they feel desperate?""
You can also acknowledge the ways you do have privilege, as well as the ways you do not.
This doesn't mean equating every kind of privilege. It's more a way of introducing nuance into the discussion, and letting the other person know that you see them as a whole and aren't erasing some of the complexity of their experiences.

, Ask them to consider the issue from another angle. They may come to new realizations and change their position. Even if they don't, the questions you ask will likely stick in their minds and they may gradually change their minds in the future.If the person disparages something such as an organisation defending a select disadvantaged group and you think they are missing the point behind it, ask ""Why do you think the organization felt it needed to be formed?"", Try not to directly accuse the other person of not understanding, or being too privileged to understand. It's harder to get someone to see past their own bias if they are on the defensive. Try to use ""I"" statements rather than starting sentences with ""you.""For instance, people in positions of privilege may become defensive if you say, ""You only achieved your success due to your privileges.""
You can get around this by using ""I"" statements and rephrasing things. For instance, talk about opportunities and access, rather than connections and privileges.
You might say, ""I am saying that everyone deserves access to these opportunities that you have made so much of, but many groups of people don't have it.""

, Once you have had the opportunity to speak your mind and they have given their side of the argument, think about what it is they said before you respond. If you immediately begin to respond after they have finished talking, it could come across as though you weren’t listening. Take a moment to reflect on what they said so you can respond effectively.Do this even if they are saying everything you thought they'd say. It is better to appear to consider the opposing argument so to prevent unhelpful defensiveness during the next exchange.

, Effective arguing is not about who can yell the loudest, it’s about expressing your facts and opinions in a meaningful and convincing manner. If you raise your voice, they will naturally want to yell back, which turns your argument into a shouting match. Additionally, if you yell at someone they'll likely respond with defensiveness or aggressiveness, and productive dialogue will be lost. If you start getting frustrated, angry, or overwhelmed, find ways to calm yourself.Take a moment to calm down. Try closing your eyes and taking a long, deep breath. Try not to do this in an obnoxious way. The person could see this as a sign of aggravation and not want to continue the conversation with you.
If the other person is speaking too quickly, ask them to slow down. ""I want to understand what you're saying, and it's difficult when you speak so fast. Would you please slow down and restate what you said?""

, Say ""I need some air"" or ""Okay, I need a break from this conversation"" if it gets out of hand. Some people aren't ready for you to talk to them. Excuse yourself if:They try to gaslight you (Try to make you believe your past didn't happen how you remember it).
They try to tell you or make you feel like your experiences aren't valid.
They become aggressive or threatening.
They prove that they're not willing to understand your side. (""Nothing can change my mind..."")
You feel like one or more of their points may be valid and you need to time to reflect and research further.
You don't feel that you can comfortably continue the discussion.

, Arguing with a person in a position of privilege, especially if they are in a position of power over you, can be a tiring experience. You don't need to do it every day, and it isn't always your job to point out someone's privilege. This is especially important if you are surrounded by a lot of people who share an advantage you don't have.

, It's normal to be upset after a difficult conversation, especially if it didn't go well. Give yourself some time to vent, and then do something relaxing. You might take a hot bath, meditate, or spend some quiet time with a loved one.

, Reach out to others with your same experiences or those who are in the same position as you are. This could remind you of why you wanted to have the argument in the first place.


Reach out to members of your community online. You might write a post about the encounter in a group with other people who share your values. Just don't get caught up in another argument!
Look into the next meetup or protest for a cause you're involved in. It can help to have group catharsis to look forward to.

Most new computers will come with HDMI (high-definition multimedia interface) ports built right into them. There is a photo of an HDMI port to the right, it is thinner then a USB port.
VGA port: A VGA port is rectangular with 15 pins. There is a sample photo of one to the right
DVI port: A DVI port is rectangular with 24 pins. There is a sample photo of it to the right

VGA and DVI ports look very similar, be sure to count the pins and make sure. Both of these ports require an adapter to to a television.


S port: An S Video port is circular with 4 or 7 pins. There is a sample photo of one to the right.;
, There is an image of a TV to the right, it has coloured arrows to label the input ports. Check to see which of the following your TV has.
Purple Arrow: HDMI port.
Red Arrow: S Video port.
Orange Arrow: HDMI Component.
Green Arrow: RCA Component.

,


If you have an HDMI port on both your computer and your laptop, then all you need is an HDMI cable.
If you have a VGA or a DVI port on your computer and and HDMI or HDMI Component on your TV, you can get a cable for that (there is a picture to the right side)
If you have either a VGA or DVI port on your computer and you do not have an HDMI or HDMI Component port on your TV, you will need an adapter cable. There are three kinds of cables you can get an adapter for, the first is RCA Component (Red, yellow, White), the second is HDMI Component (Green, Blue, Red), the third is an HDMI cable adapter. Make sure you choose the right one for your port (VGA or DVI). Then choose the right cable to use according to the inputs on your TV ( RCA or HDMI Component).
If you have an S Video port on both your computer and your TV, then you only need an S Video cable. If you have an S Video on your computer but not on your TV, you will have to get an adapter for your computer.

Plug in the DVD player and make sure it turns on.,
Determine what type of connection you need.,
Find the appropriate cable for your connection.,
Place the DVD player close to the television.,
Turn off the DVD player and TV before you connected them.,
Know that the same procedures work for a projector.",How to Hook Up a DVD Player1," Before trying to hook up your player, make sure it is plugged in and turns on when you press the ""power"" button. Usually a small light or welcome message appears when the DVD player is working correctly.;
, There are at three common ways to connect a DVD player, and each needs a different cable to work. Your DVD player should come with all of the appropriate cords, but you need to check which connections your TV accepts as well. Look into your owner's manuals or check the TV and DVD Player yourself to see what connections you can use. The three most common are.



HDMI: The most modern connection, HDMI resembles a longer, thinner USB cord. HDMI connections are the highest quality connections and you only need one cord for both the audio and video.

A/V Cables (Three-Prong): Standing for Audio/Visual cables, this the most common connection for DVDs. There are three prongs at either end-- red, yellow, and white -- and they match up to corresponding colored inputs on both the TV and DVD player.

Component Cables: Sporting better quality than A/V cables but less than HDMI, component cables are a set of five colored prongs attaching to five matching inputs on both the TV and the DVD player.

, Once you know what connection you will use, locate the cable and make sure it is not torn or frayed. If you need a new cable, or are missing one, take a picture of the input you want and bring it to your local electronics store to find a replacement.


If possible, use and HDMI cable, as they are the easiest to install and have the best quality video.

, Once you know what connection you will need, make sure you put the DVD player close enough to the TV so that you can reach the appropriate cables to the back.


Do not stack different electronic equipment on top of one another -- they can quickly heat up when in use and damage the electronics. , This prevents the likelihood of electric shocks and protects the equipment. , Most projectors have the same set of inputs as TVs, so don't be intimidated if you want to hook up a projector instead.


Some projectors use a ""DVI Input"" instead of the three connections listed above. If so, follow the same procedure as ""Connecting with an HDMI Cable,"" substituting a DVi cable for an HDMI. "
"
There are a few antenna options available.,
Use a rotor.,
Identify the antenna connection on your television.,
Connect the antenna to your television using coaxial RF cables (also known as ""F"" cables).,
Set up your television.,
Adjust your antenna.,
Locate your local broadcast locations.",How to Hook Up a TV Antenna," Rabbit ears, multi-element beams, and large array antennae used in remote locations. Pick the one that best suits your requirements.


Rabbit ears have two telescoping rods you can move around. These are optimised for receiving VHF signals. While they are better than nothing, they are not the best solution for good television reception.
Multi-element beam antenna are the most common antenna, and will serve you well. Those are the ones you commonly see on roof tops or masts. They have several elements, each one longer than the other. This design eliminates multi-pathing and focuses the signal, acting sort of like an electronic version of a magnifying glass. They come in a variety of sizes.
Larger antenna are great if you live in a remote area, in a valley, behind a hill, or other significant obstruction where you may need a larger antenna to get the maximum amount of signal—but don't buy anything bigger than you need to do the job. Really big TV antennas are meant for remote areas. If you are closer in you may pick up too much signal which will lead to distortion, or get channel interference and crosstalk from catching weak overlapping signals from further away.;
, If your location is such that one channel is broadcast from north of you, for example, and another channel is broadcasting to the west you, you may need an antenna rotor so you can turn the beam toward the station's tower.


If the angles only vary a little bit, or the stations are all fairly close, you shouldn't have much of a problem. If the angle is more than about 30 degrees apart, you may need the rotor—depending on how far the towers are. If you don't have a rotor, but find yourself running up the roof to adjust the antenna every time you change the channel, you'll soon be looking for the best rotor for the job!

, It will probably be what is called an F connector, or a round, threaded nub with a small hole in the end. There are older styles of connectors, such as the Belling Lee connector, or the spade-and-lug style connector, but digital signals are best served by an F connector.


Note: if you have an older style connector, visit Radio Shack or your local TV store and get the correct adapter. Digital televisions have a special input for digital reception, usually marked ""DTV"" or ""DTT"". They will not be able to mate to the old connectors directly.

, There are two basic types: screw in and push on. Either of these will work but the screw-on variety holds a little tighter.

, Using your television's setup menu (consult your owner's manual for exact procedures), set your Input to either ""Antenna"" or ""Air.""


Some televisions have multiple inputs: make sure you're setting the correct input during this procedure. If you also have cable, and multiple inputs, you can set one input to be cable, and the other to be the antenna input.

, Scan through the channels with your television tuner to see what channels are within range. If you see a fuzzy picture, reorient the antenna until the signal is clear.


Note: some antennae are motorized, saving you the trouble of running up to the roof to adjust the antenna.
For digital television, you may have special menu options for a full scan and a ""manual scan."" To optimize your antenna placement, you must do a full scan every time you change the position of the antenna. Write down all the settings, do a full scan, and count the number of channels found each time.

, Find each channel's broadcast location (distance and angle) by looking at a customized map appropriate for your area. If all the channels are in one direction (within 20 degrees), then it is easier to aim a directional antenna.


In the case that you need different settings to get different channels, then write down not only how many channels are picked up by the scan, but which ones.
Determine the main settings that you need and write them down close to the television.
Do the manual scan with each setting to add all the channels to your TV menus, and set the antenna appropriately for each channel that you watch.
Some televisions will memorize the channels that come in strongly enough to make a clear picture. You can set this as you search for and find broadcasters.

If there is an input number, like ""HDMI 1,"" remember it for later. This is the setting your TV must be set at to see your movies.

Breathe deeply.,
Let go of how people should act and what people should do.,
Ask yourself — what's in it for me?,
Don't be afraid not to react.A lot of the time, when someone annoys us, we feel such a strong emotion that it's hard not to react.,
Pay attention to your body language .,
Assume the best.,
Shrug off the little things.,
Stop trying to please everyone.,
Identify what is bothering you.,
Remind yourself that annoyed people are annoying.Take a step back and imagine how you come off when you're annoyed.,
Turn any would-be advice that you'd like to give back on yourself.,
Be aware your annoyance can be a problem with you instead of a problem with them.,
Consider shaking your life up a bit.",How to Be Less Annoyed With People," Breathing deeply, from your diaphragm, can actually reduce the amount of stress that your body feels.Calmly count to ten, slowly. Imagine yourself on the beach. Let the internal sound of waves and seagulls wash over you. Feel the mist of the seawater on your face and let it calm you. Channel your most calming memory of experience; the feeling of a loved one, the memory of success, the bliss of no responsibility.;
, This step is all about managing expectations. Too often, we have very specific ideas of how people should act and what people should do, and then we get annoyed when they fail to live up to our expectations. ""Common standards of decency,"" we say. While expecting others to be fundamentally decent is a worthy idea, it can cause real annoyance and, sometimes, unhappiness. There's another way to do it:


Set low expectations. Don't lose faith in humanity, but don't expect people to wow you with their manners, their thoughtfulness, their speech. When you don't expect a lot from others to begin with, you appreciate it more when they do. Setting reasonable expectations is a major key to being less annoyed., ""What do I get out of being annoyed?"" If you think about it, it's probably not all that much. Maybe you feel superior to the other person. But do you really want your judgment of who you are to derive from what other people do, or what you do? Your identity will be a lot stronger if you base it off of what you do, not what others do.

, That's when we say something we shouldn't, or do something regrettable. Most of the time, our outburst makes the situation worse instead of making it better. After breathing deeply, center yourself and take a moment to see if it's worth your time to react. It may not be.


Of course, if a coworker has just finished a sexist diatribe, it's probably a good thing to say something like ""Steve, I don't think it's appropriate to compare women and cows like that."" But if a coworker has just finished playing the same practical joke on you for the twentieth time, not giving him the satisfaction of a reaction will probably serve you best in the long run.

, Frowns, glaring, and other unpleasant body language convey anger and contempt. And they're contagious, too, so if they target the person who's annoying you, that person is likely to feel angry back. Before you know it, things can escalate. As much as possible, maintain a calm, collected demeanor, betraying nothing that suggests you're annoyed.

, Instead of assuming that the annoying person is trying to annoy you, assume that they don't know how they are coming off. The fact is that most people are not trying to annoy you. They probably don't realize that what they are doing is annoying. In other words, they probably are in their own world and may not even be aware of you. Remember, you think about you more than anyone else does — the same fact is true for everyone.

, A little kid is bothering you on the airplane; a man is talking loudly into his cell phone; a lady asks you the same question twice at the DMV. These are all small fry. In the big scheme of things, they don't matter. You can greatly improve your quality of life by learning to let go, stop sweating the small stuff, and focusing your limited efforts and resources on the things that truly matter for most people: friends, family, health and safety, novelty, adventure, and lasting memories.


Accept the things you cannot change. You can change yourself, the toilet paper, and the decor of your house. You cannot change someone else. Focus your energies on the things that you can change and the people around you will take note.

, No matter who you are or what you do, there will always be someone who doesn't get you or who thinks about you in an unflattering way. Don't try to win over those apathetic or hostile to you, because it's a fool's errand. It makes you annoyed that you can't get everyone to like you as much as you feel you deserve. This desire comes from a selfish place, and it's toxic.


No matter who you are, someone dislikes you. Whether it's because of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual preference or social class, they find it very hard to see you as a human being in your own right. It's possible for someone to overcome that prejudice, but it rarely happens, and it never happens fast.
Prove the haters wrong by doing your own thing. The best thing you can do to combat ignorance or prejudice is forget about it, continue to live your life, and prove them wrong by example. Show them what an amazing person you are. Don't shove it in their face — just live your life. The people who won't notice are probably the people who are beyond saving.

, What is it that's setting you off? Is it something truly annoying, like a brother repeating the same noise you've asked him twice to knock off, or is it harmless, like someone breathing loudly?If it's something harmless that annoys you, there's probably some underlying issue that you haven't resolved, either about the person, or about yourself.

, Do you imagine you're the second coming of grace, someone who everyone wants to be around? Or are you petulant, cranky, sour, the Debbie downer who people steer clear of because they burst their bubble? There's a good chance that when you let other people annoy you, you become the person you dislike. The best motivation for changing that fact is recognizing that you probably don't want to be the person you'd become.

, If you're annoyed with someone and you don't know why, or you're frustrated by the fact that you're annoyed, try this trick. Formulate some advice you'd like to give to that person. Say the person has played a joke on a friend of yours at their expense, and you want to tell the prankster ""be considerate of other people."" Now, instead of giving that advice to the other person, turn it around and see if the advice is applicable to you. Yes, you! Is there a way you can be considerate of other people? Can you let the good-humored attempt slide? Can you consider how your friend may have thought the joke was funny? Sometimes, the advice that we're most eager to give to other people is just the advice that we ourselves should swallow.

, It's certainly possible that the reason we find something or someone annoying is that it reminds us of ourselves; we don't want to believe that that's who we truly are, so we distance ourselves from the person or thing by summoning annoyance and getting angry. Ask yourself: Is the reason you're annoyed because the other person is reflecting something that hits too close to home?

, Being annoyed can be a sign that you're too entrenched in your comfort zone. Try shaking things. Rearrange your bedroom furniture, read books by authors who challenge your fundamental beliefs, take a trip overseas. Changing something in your life that shifts you out of your comfort zone and into new territory can lower your annoyance and crank up your compassion.


Anything that helps you to grow and mature will tend to dampen annoyance with other people. The more that you learn about the world, and the more understanding you are of people's motivations, the less you'll expect of other people. The key to happiness is low expectations.

They’re either too old or incompatible with your HDTV. To get the best picture you’ll need HDMI cables that may also connect to your sound system. Old DVD players, VCRs, and other sources also play a big part in picture quality. You may need to replace really old tech but newer devices may simply require settings adjustments in order to improve picture quality., To get a better picture while watching DVD's, you'll need a DVD player that can do your plasma TV justice. Look for one with progressive scanning or a high quality up-convert processor. (The up-conversion in *low*-cost DVD players is likely not as effective as the up-conversion built in to more-expensive plasma or LCD TV). Alternatively, you could invest in a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player. Set up your DVD player, cable or satellite box for 16x9 image output to improve picture quality. Use HMDI or component cable to hook up DVD player to your TV., To fully appreciate the high definition picture that your plasma television is capable of, you need to be using quality video cables that can handle HD (high-definition) signals (Digital Visual Interface or DVIs are comparable but don't carry audio signals ). High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) and Component (Red-Green-Blue colored) cables are the best for getting HD signal from satellite box or cable to your TV. Don’t spend more than $10 on them as pricier cables offer no added benefit., Fingerprints, smudges, dust, and hair on the screen can all lessen your picture quality. Clean your TV by wiping it with soft microfiber cloth regularly once a week. If you need to get rid of more stubborn spots a TV cleaning kit will run you around $10 and will contain a special solution for your screen aside from cleaning cloth or glove. , Bright lights will wash out the picture on your plasma TV. This is especially true with fluorescent overhead lights or sunlight. Dim your room lights and, if possible, block any sunlight entering the room by closing the blinds or placing your TV into a windowless room.

This is convenient if you don't know how to adjust certain settings in order to make the picture look good. All you have to do is to play the disc in your DVD player, follow the instructions and complete all the steps in the setting process. Disney WOW: World of Wonder DVD ($18) provide tutorials and guides on picture optimization., Making use of built-in presets designed by professionals is a great way to get the picture you like through fewer manipulations. These are designed to enhance your experience depending on lighting you are watching your TV in or media and genre of content you’re watching:


Standard (normal brightness, contrast, and sharpness levels)
Vivid/Dynamic (increased contrast, brightness, and sharpness)
Cinema/Movie (best for movies, image intended by creators)
Sports (sharpens image of quick movements)Game (for playing games with reduced input lag (delay in signal), reduced picture quality), The balance between two basic settings like Contrast and Brightness can immediately improve picture quality. When setting contrast choose a bright image with white elements in it, like clouds in the sky. Contrast should be started at just 50% of the available Contrast. Keep in mind that the higher you set your Contrast, the shorter the life of the TV, particularly if you set your contrast above 75%. At this point your clouds may appear as white blotches, which means your contrast is set too high.

, In order to set your brightness just right choose a dark image with dark elements in it, for example, a black jacket on a dark background. If you see just the silhouettes in a dark picture try increasing Brightness. The low brightness settings can deprive dark images of detail and nuance making the picture look flat. "

when you are around happy people others will feel alright to approach you when with your friend or acquaintances
being involved with violent and/or rude people makes others wary about approaching or talking to you as they may fear being confronted by that person or those people or they may simply assume that you are the same as them because you just hang out with them

",How to Be Friendly," You don't have to give every person you see a huge grin to be more friendly. However, making a goal to smile at least 30% more on a daily basis, whether you're smiling at people you know, complete strangers, or acquaintances who cross your path,smiling will make you look like a much more approachable, friendly person. Remember when you passed that guy you met that one time and he looked in the other direction and pretended you didn't exist? How did that make you feel? If you want people to feel good about talking to you, then you should smile more at them.


You can also make a goal of smiling more during the course of a conversation.;
, If you want people to feel like you're approachable and open to talking to them, then you have to master open body language. Here are the things that you can do to make people want to talk to you more:


Keep your legs together instead of crossed
Have good posture instead of slouching
Keep your arms at your sides instead of crossing them
Lean forward toward other people

, Another way to be friendlier is to notice everything that's going on around you instead of trying to beat the new level of Candy Crush on your iPhone. If you're tapping away at your phone, burying your nose in a book, staring at your computer, or even just picking at the paint on your fingernails, then people will think you have better things to do than to talk to them. Instead, look ahead, smile, and be ready for what the world has to offer you. You'll be surprised by how many more people think you're friendly and how quickly they come your way.


Tapping away at your cell phone is rude especially when you're actively engaging in conversation with people.

, This is something you should work on whether you're just saying hi to a person who is walking by or talking to someone face-to-face. You don't have to stare into a person's eyes 100% of the time to be friendly, but you should work on making as much eye contact as possible when you're listening to people, so that they feel like you care about them and that they're actually worth your time. When it's your turn to talk, you can look around a bit more.


If you're walking down a hallway and it's just you and another person, why not look that person in the eyes and say hello instead of staring at the floor or pretending to be fascinated by your own fingernails?

, The ability to laugh easily is another trait of the friendly person. You don't have to laugh at everything a person says or you may sound fake, but you should make an effort to laugh about 20% more, especially when people are trying to be funny, say something kind of funny, or just when you feel people need a boost of support and confidence. Laughing more will not only give your conversations more of a positive vibe, but the people around you -- even the people who are just walking by -- will see you as a more friendly person.


Laughing and smiling more? Now that's a potent combo.

, Knowing how to make small talk will go a long way in making you more friendly. Maybe you have a hard time making small talk because you're too busy, distracted, or just shy. But it's not as hard as it sounds. All you have to do is make the person feel comfortable, find some common ground, and reveal a little bit about yourself. If you get more comfortable, then you can start digging deeper and discuss more personal issues.


Some people think that small talk is completely superficial, but it's not. All good friendships and relationships start out with a bit of small talk. You can't just jump in and talk to a new person about the meaning of life, can you?
You can even make small talk with your check out person just to be nice. Make a comment about the weather, say something about the addicting tasty guacamole you're buying, or compliment that person's jewelry. It'll make you feel more positive and it'll make your day go by faster.

, If you want to be friendly, then you have to show a real interest in people. They have to see that you really care about who they are, what they think, and what they do. If you want to be friendly, then you have to ask people a variety of simple questions that show them you care. You shouldn't ask anything too personal or they might get offended, though; stick to some of the same topics first and move on from there once you know them better. Here are some great topics to try:Pets
Favorite sports teams
Favorite hobbies
Favorite bands, books, or movies
Favorite food, drink
Siblings
Weekend trips
School or work
What they’re trying to achieve in life
Favorite vacations or where they would like to travel to

, Complimenting people -- when you mean it -- will make you seem and feel like a much more friendly person. Just a small compliment given at the right time will make people think, ""He/she's really nice!"" and will make them feel more comfortable and happy to be in your presence. You don't have to compliment anything too serious, especially at first, and you can just say something nice about the person's jewelry, outfit, haircut, or even say that the person has a great sense of humor.


When you're talking to someone, ask yourself, what's one awesome quality this person has that I would like to compliment? You should come up with one pretty quickly.

, This is a simple yet effective trick to making people like you more and to seem more friendly. If you use people's names, you show them that you care about them and that you can really distinguish them as individuals. You don't have to overdo it to get the point across. Just saying, ""Hi, Ellen!"" when you greet the person, or saying, ""You're completely right about that, Ashley,"" in the course of a conversation will make you seem like a friendlier person.


If a person you've just met tells you their name, using it once or twice throughout your conversation will make you remember it for next time.

, Some people are unfriendly without even realizing it. If someone has given you a big ""Hi!"" and is approaching you while slowing down, this is because that person wants to talk to you; if you just say ""hey,"" and keep walking, then you'll look rude. You may think that you're just giving off a neutral or a busy vibe, but that may often come off as unfriendly.


If you don't hold doors for people, smile at them when they smile at you, and avoid looking in the direction of people you don't know even if they're standing right next to you, then you'll be looking rude without even knowing it.

, When you are talking to people, try to stick to the uplifting stuff. Instead of complaining about work or school, talking about something bad that happened to you, or just generally being negative, you should mention something awesome that happened to you that week, something you're looking forward to, or even something funny you saw on TV. Talking about more positive topics will make you seem more friendly in everyday conversation because you'll look like a fun, upbeat person that other people want to talk to.


You don't have to pretend to be someone else to avoid discussing unpleasant topics throughout the course of a conversation.
Sure, if something terrible happened to you or if you really feel like griping, go for it. But try to say at least three positive things for every one negative thing so you still seem like a positive person.

, Part of being friendly is making yourself a little bit vulnerable and sharing something about yourself with others. You don't have to reveal your deepest, darkest secrets, either. Mentioning something slightly embarrassing, goofy, or just offbeat will have a winning effect on people and will make them think that you don't take yourself too seriously and that you're comfortable talking to other people. Here are some things you can open up about:


Childhood pets
Wacky vacations
a prank you played on your sibling
A funny mistake you made
Something you've always wanted to do
Your experience doing something offbeat for the first time
A story about your family

, This is another cornerstone of being more friendly. You may be really shy or you might just think that new people aren't worth your time or that they all have something wrong with them. Well that changes today! Start making conversation with strangers sitting next to you on the plane, people at parties, or friends of friends that you run into. Make sure you read the situation and that the person actually wants to talk to someone new, and then proceed with a big smile on your face.


You don't have to talk to every new person who comes your way, but the more you do it, the more comfortable you'll feel.
Introduce yourself to people you don't know. If you're in a group of friends and a new person who other people know comes on the scene, take the initiative.

, Part of being more friendly means showing that you want to spend more time with other people. How do you do that? You invite them to do stuff. Start small by inviting a group of people to a movie, a free concert, or to grab coffee or ice cream some time, and see how much friendlier you feel after they eagerly accept your invitation. Make a goal of inviting people to do more things with you at least once a week and you'll be living a more friendly life.Get brave. Invite acquaintances to hang out one on one and turn your acquaintance into a real friendship.
Throw a party. Invite an eclectic crowd of people and have fun introducing them to each other.

, Another way to be more friendly is to say yes when people ask you to do stuff. You may be afraid of hanging out with people you don't know that well, you may be too busy, or you may just prefer to hang out with yourself, a bowl of Cherry Garcia ice cream, and Snookums, your pet ferret. But you have to get over all that if you want to be friendly and start accepting people's invitations to go to the movies, dinner, or to a party.You don't have to say yes to something that sounds completely horrible. But the next time you really want to say no, ask yourself what is behind your impulse. Are you afraid of something new? Socially anxious? Or just feeling lazy? These aren't the greatest reasons to miss out on a good time.

, If you want to be more friendly, then you have to spend more time with your friends. Spending more time around other people will make you be a more socially aware and sensitive person who is used to talking to other people. You should try to fill your calendar with parties, social engagements, group hiking, biking, or swimming trips, and other fun friend-filled outings if you want to be more friendly more regularly.To have a bustling social life, you have to make your social life a priority. Don't let work, school, or other commitments get in your way -- not too much, at least.
It's important to have a busy social life, but you should also remember to save some time for yourself. You'll need to decompress, especially if you're not used to spending so much time around other people.

, This may be a tough pill to swallow. You don't have to become BFF with your greatest enemy to work on being more friendly to people in your orbit -- whether it's your uptight math teacher, your crotchety uncle, or that kind-of quiet girl who is on the fringes of your social circle. You'll feel surprised by how good you'll feel about being nicer to someone instead of giving the cold shoulder, and that person may surprise with friendliness in return.


Make a list of five people that you have always treated sort of coldly. Find ways to be nice to each of these people -- even if they don't deserve it. Forgiveness is a key quality to being more friendly. Holding grudges can make you angry on the inside, and that may affect your attitude on the outside.

, Part of the reason that you may not be the most friendly person in the world might be because you're lacking confidence and think that people will judge you any time you open your mouth. Ask yourself what lies behind your distrust or coldness to other people and see if it has to do more with what you think of yourself. If that's the case, then work on loving the person who you are, loving what you do, and addressing the flaws that need some work.


Of course, overcoming your insecurities can take years of hard work, but recognizing this as one of the sources of your problem with being friendly can make you be more willing to be nice to others. Remember that they may be just as insecure as you are, maybe more.

, ""Age and stage"" refers not only to the age of a person, but to the stage of life that person is in. A stage of life could be being a college student, being a young professional, being a middle-aged mother, or being an older person who spends more time alone. Finding people who are around your age and your stage will make you more likely to find time to hang out and will give you more things to talk about.


So, for example, if you're a young mother, join a young mothers group and you'll be on the way to making some amazing new friends.

, This is the key to not just looking friendly, but to actually being a friendly person. A real friendly person actually cares about others and wants to make them feel comfortable. A real friendly person is concerned when others are upset and uplifted when others are happy; a real friendly person doesn't talk to people just to look cooler or to have more Facebook friends. If you really want to be friendly, then you have to remember this whenever you talk to people. If you actually care about them -- they will be able to tell.Of course, you can't possibly take an interest in everyone in your orbit. But the more you try to be nice to people, the more natural it will feel.
Remember that being friendly has nothing to do with being fake. And that it has everything to do with being more approachable, treating people with respect, and giving off a positive energy.

Be the person you say you are.,
Do what you say you’re going to do.,

Care about other people.,

Defend what you believe in.,

Never manipulate people.",How to Be Honourable," It’s easy to be a pleasant person, walking around with a ready smile and a “hello” for everyone you see. But being honourable isn’t the same thing as being friendly. When it comes to honor, it’s more important to be authentic. Show the world who you really are, even if it come at the expense of your reputation for being “nice.” To be honourable, you’ve got to be trustworthy.


If you hide your real thoughts and feelings behind a masked expression, try taking off the mask and see what happens. Maybe people will be put off at first, but after awhile they’ll come to trust you more, since you’re revealing more of yourself to them.
This isn’t to say you should go around being surly, but try to be more expressive of how you really feel instead of sugarcoating everything to make social interactions easier or to try to get people to like you.;
, If you’re constantly backing out of social plans, or not showing up when you said you’d help out, work on your follow through. Maybe you really mean it when you say you’ll hang out with that old friend who keeps calling, but your actions speak louder than your intentions. Central to being an honourable person is ditching your flaky tendencies.


Every seemingly harmless white lie makes you less trustworthy in others’ eyes, and before long people won’t consider you reliable at all. Doing what you say you’re going to do, no matter how small, builds character and develops your sense of honor.
Give it some practice. Eventually you’ll hate the feeling of not following through, and you’ll stop making commitments you can’t stick with.

, What do you believe in? In any given situation, how do you decide what’s right and what’s wrong? Having strong values is key to being honourable, since acting with honor means doing the right thing, even if others disagree with you. It can be really hard to figure out how to act with honor in any given situation. Your values are what you turn to for answers when there’s no one else you can ask. When you align yourself with them, you can be proud of yourself for having done your best, no matter what the outcome is.


Your values might be aligned with a certain religion or another belief system. Maybe your parents imparted strong values when they raised you. Try to examine your values to make sure you really believe them, since it’s hard to stand up for something when your gut tells you it isn’t really true.
If this concept is difficult and you’re searching for answers, try talking it through with people you see as wise, reading philosophical and religious texts, or attending spiritual services. Explore different value systems and compare their tenets with your life experiences to figure out what feels right.

, The honourable among us really care about the people in their life. They’re the parents who work second and third jobs to make sure their kids have enough, the friends who refuse to let their pals get behind the wheel after a night of drinking. Honourable people show their deep love for others through their actions. If the people in your life don’t know you’ve got their backs, it’s time to start showing them that you do.


Care about people outside of your inner circle, too. Acting honorably isn’t limited to only helping the people you know and love. What would you do if you were walking down the street and saw someone in need of help?
Question your boundaries. Sure, it’s hard to hand over change to every single person who asks. It’s not possible to help everyone you come across. But being honourable means seeing people as people, respecting their humanity, and giving the what little you have to offer.

, If you’re honourable, you help people because you care, and you don’t expect to get paid back. When you do something kind, there’s no self-serving motive behind it; you’re driven by love. Think about the decisions you make every day, and decide what powers them. Only you know whether your interactions are tainted by motives you don’t want others do see.


For example, have you ever given advice that serves you instead of really trying to help the person? If your sister asks you if you think she should move to New York, and you really wish she would stay in town, don’t let your feelings taint your advice. Advise her to do what you think is best for her, not for you.
Don’t build up resentment about helping out, or wonder what you’re getting out of a given situation. If you don’t want to be doing something, you should stop doing it. It’s more honourable to be up front about how you feel than it is to secretly despise something you’re doing.

, Do you want a new car? A boyfriend? Some new clothes? You deserve all of these things, but don’t use shortcuts to get them. It’s so much easier to take the easy way out, but this usually requires hurting someone else, and if you do it often enough it’ll backfire. If you want something, work for it. It’s the honourable thing to do.


Don’t steal or try to rip people off instead of paying what you owe.
Don’t shamelessly flirt with someone else’s tipsy girlfriend instead of forming an actual relationship with someone who’s available.
Don’t keep borrowing money from your friends and family instead of getting a job.
Don’t take credit for someone else’s idea instead of coming up with your own.

, Honesty and honor go hand in hand. Work on always telling the truth, whether it’s about your own intentions or an outside situation. It will certainly make you uncomfortable at times, and you might be subject to other people’s anger or hurt feelings. But ultimately, people will appreciate that you’re someone who tells it like it is instead of sugarcoating.


If there’s a situation in which you don’t feel comfortable telling the truth, just don’t say anything. It’s better than lying. Even so, it's important to tell the truth as often as possible.
When it comes to the tiny lies we tell to spare feelings, you make the call. Just know that if you lie often enough, even in this small way (“No, that dress looks great!” or “Yes, I really liked your speech!”) people will stop trusting your opinion and begin to assume you’re just being nice.

, Developing your values is one thing, but standing up for them is quite another. It’s easy to argue with something in your head, but truly honourable people speak up and step in. Defending your values can mean any number of things, and it doesn’t always need to involve a big show. In little ways, you can behave honorably and set an example for other people.


For example, if everyone at work makes fun of a certain person when he’s not around, you could make it clear you don’t think it’s right. Sometimes just saying “I disagree” or even changing the subject every time it comes up is a way to make your opinion known.
Sometimes you’ll be faced with a bigger problem, and you’ll have to choose between standing up for what you think is right and keeping your job, or staying friends with someone, or upholding your reputation as a sweet and genial person. That’s when true honor kicks in, and hopefully all those times you were honourable in little ways will prepare you for the big decisions.

, If you were to draw a cartoon of an honourable person, it might look like a guy giving up his seat on the bus for an elderly person while helping a child carry his luggage and offering to front fare for someone who forgot change. These cliches all demonstrate ways to be honourable, and they’re all situations that could happen in real life and provide easy opportunities to be a little honourable. However, true honor is demonstrated when you’re called upon to do something you really don’t want to do, and you do it anyway.


For example, maybe your brother and his two dogs need a place to crash for three weeks after losing their house. Things will be pretty cramped, but he’s your brother, so you do it.
Or maybe you’re in the car on the way to airport to catch a flight to Venice for your honeymoon, and you witness a car run off the road and hit the guardrail. Even though it means you’re going to miss your flight, you stop and offer your assistance.

, Part of being honourable is acknowledging the effect your words and actions have on other people. You have the ability to help, and you have the ability to hurt. Don’t mess with people’s emotions as a way to get what you want. It’s easy to do this without even realizing it, so try to be more mindful of the impact you’re having.Don’t take advantage of weakness, like using someone’s illness to gain an edge on them.
Don’t be controlling of those around you. Let them make their own decisions.
Don’t guilt trip people into doing what you want.
Don’t lead people on by making them think you’re more emotionally involved than you really feel.

Reward employees for good behavior.,
Be liked.",How to Be a Good Leader1," To earn respect, it's important to show that you know your stuff. People will respect and listen to you, if they know you are knowledgeable in your field.


Discuss your experience. Without showing off, let your employees understand how long you've been in the business and what you have achieved while you were there. Not only will they have a better understanding of why you're sitting in the boss' chair, but they'll be more excited to be a part of your team and will admire you.
Act professionally. Though you may be the boss, you should still be cordial to all of your employees. You should also still meet the basic standards of professionalism such as; dressing appropriately, coming to work and meetings on time, and communicating in a professional manner.;
, Whether you're the CEO of a company or the manager of a team of four people, it's important to make your expectations ""crystal"" clear from the beginning.


Have a Code of Conduct or an Expectation Notice that you can point to which shows employees how to act. Give feedback based on their work, and relate it with your Code of Conduct.
If you're working on a project, your goals and expectations should be clear from the beginning. Then your employees will be more motivated and not confused. It is preferable to have your goals down in written form.
Don't change your instructions in the middle of a project. Though some adjustments in the workplace are necessary, it's important to not only be clear about your expectations, but to also be consistent. If you change your mind about what you want halfway through a meeting, your employees may not take you seriously, or they might be frustrated.

, Though it's important to be firm, you should still leave some room for the considerations of others. This way you won't look like a dictator. Also, there's a lot you can learn from your employees, which might help your business thrive.


Ask for feedback. It's important to ask for feedback after you've wrapped up a project, set up guidelines during a meeting, or you have thrown a charity event. You can do this without scaring your employees. Simply ask through email, or send an anonymous survey to them.
Ask for opinions in a face-to-face situations. At the end of a meeting, you can casually ask if people have any questions or opinions. This will give your employees time to consider what they're working on. You may also pull individual employees aside, or invite them to your office, to discuss the project further. Tell them that their perspective is crucial to your success.

, To be a good leader, you need to maintain high team morale, and to motivate employees to achieve their goals in a timely manner. Also, make your rewards desirable and fun!


Give praise regularly highly engaged employees get praise every week from their leader
Have a monthly team dinner to celebrate a completed goal. This will be, not only delicious, but a fun way to bond with your colleagues and to motivate them to achieve goals in a timely manner.
Give individual ""shout outs"" when necessary. If one of your employees accomplished something incredible, there's no harm in announcing his or her achievements through an email or at a meeting. Though this may make him or her blush, he or she will see that you're paying attention to his or her hard work.
Reward your hard workers with prizes. A prize, whether it's the latest technological gadget or just a pair of free movie tickets, can give your employees the incentive they need to work hard, and will make them think you're a cool boss.

, Though it's important for your workers to respect you most of all, it couldn't hurt for them to think you're a person who is worth spending time with. This will make them more excited to work for you and to have you as their leader! Here are some ways to make sure you are liked:


Admit your mistakes. You aren't perfect, and occasionally showing that you could have planned something differently will show that you are only human and will make people respect you more. Of course, you can avoid always admitting that you've made a mistake, because you want to look like you know what the heck you're doing.
Share the occasional personal story. You don't have to be best friends with your employees, but talking about your family, or your background, can make them open up to you and see you as a person.
Be consistent in your interactions. If you're very friendly during group meetings, but chilly when you pass an employee in the hall, your workers may get mixed signals and may not like you very much. It's important to be cordial at all times--not just during the important ones.
At the same time, don't be too chatty or social with your employees. It's healthy to make friends in the workplace, but if all you're doing is chatting everyone up at the watercooler, people may think you're more focused on gaining approval than being a good leader.
Avoid romantic relationships in the workplace. This almost always ends badly and can lead you to lose everyone's respect, not to mention your job.

If you want to take it a step further, look around questioningly at everyone in the elevator when no one gets off at the floors you pushed.When someone comes in, say, ""I've got this,"" before you push all of the buttons.
You can also push all the buttons as you reach the floor you are getting off at.
If someone asks you why you pushed all the buttons, you can honestly say, ""It was just a joke!"";
, Every time the elevator reaches a new floor, say “ding!” very loudly. You can even sing the word “ding” on each floor like notes in a scale, getting higher as you reach each new floor.You can make other noises if you prefer, such as a bird cawing or an explosion sound every time a button is pushed.

, Many elevators have mirrors on the walls. A great way to be mischievous in an elevator is to carry on a running commentary while you look at yourself in the mirror.


You could look at yourself, turning to catch different angles and say “All right, all right, now we’re talking,” very loudly.
You could also keep adjusting your shirt or your hair, keeping a running dialogue about what look is best for you.
Stand in the corner of the elevator facing the wall. Don't say anything the whole ride.

If you're practicing with members of your own team, offer them encouragement. Instead of showing off and being mean when they make a misstep, show them how to improve their game and compliment them when appropriate.
On game day, it's important to look your opponents in the eye, shake their hands, and to show that your focused on the game, not whether or not the other team's point guard is a jerk. Even if you feel someone on the other team acted unfairly, take it up with your coach or a ref as the situation dictates, but avoid name calling and foul language.
Lose with dignity. Leaders should be seen as mature - not as crybabies. If the other team kicked your butt, congratulate them without wincing. With your good attitude, you'll get another chance at them.

When you're huddling with your team or giving instructions, make sure to give everyone a chance to participate in the game. If you're dictating plays, don't revolve the entire game around your skills.
Be helpful off the court. Help load equipment into your team bus, take attendance, and offer rides to any straggling team members. This will show that you care about working together on all aspects of the game, even it's just driving the freshman player to school so everyone can be a part of the game.

, Though you should be respected first of all, being a team captain is more casual than being a boss, and you should make an effort to make friends so you can have fun while working hard.


Be fun at team social events. Make sure to show up to team dinners and other social events first and to leave last. Show that you love being a leader of your team from start to finish. This will help you get to know your fellow players and to deepen your bond.

When you introduce yourself, tell them how many years you've been working in your field and what you have achieved there. Then they'll know you know your stuff.
Tell them how long you've been teaching your course. If you've been teaching the same course twenty times, let them know, so they have a sense that you've created the best course possible. If you're new to the classroom, however, don't let your students know so they don't see you as a pushover.

, Once the introductions are out of the way, it's important to let your students understand your expectations so they can meet them.


Have a well-organized syllabus that shows them exactly what to expect from every day of the course. Answer any questions they have after you go over it, so you can clear up any confusion.
Whether you're teaching children or adults, it's important to have a clear code of conduct, which shows not only your expectations, but the punishments if your students fail to meet them. Common code of conduct rules include showing mutual respect and avoiding disruptive behavior, such as using texting, talking on the phone, or whispering in the back of the classroom.

, Whether you're giving a quiz or a final exam, it's important to make sure the assignment is fair and useful for your students. They will be better students after all of your hard work, and will thank you for being an understanding teacher and classroom leader.


Have a study guide. Before an exam, tell your students what they can expect to be on it so they don't have any surprises on the day of the test.
Provide sample problems. Give your students practice problems so their skills are sharp on the day of the test.

This will make your students feel that your discussion is relevant to the real world.
Have unique activities that get your students moving and thinking. Allow your students to create their own paragraphs, board work, skits, or any other activity that may help them understand an old concept in a new way.

Have a useful system of rewards and punishments.,
Be a united front with your co-pilot.,
Have fun with your family!",How to Be a Good Leader4," Make it clear that you are the boss of your household, and that your rules should be followed.


Demonstrate to your children that your elders should be respected at all times. If your parents play an active role in your life, you can show your children that you respect your parents, just as they should respect you.
Tell your children to treat you with respect. You are a figure of authority and should be addressed and answered appropriately, even during tense situations.

, Your children should have a strong sense of your expectations. You should avoid being temperamental or unclear so that they know what you actually want.


Establish expectations for chores. Your children should know what work is expected of them, whether it is to wash their own dishes, help set the table, or do yard work. Rotating chores can also help mix things up and to ensure that no one member of your household is stuck with the unpleasant tasks, such as cleaning your kitty's litter, every time.
Establish expectations for appropriate behavior. Make it clear that you expect your children to avoid foul language, have dinner at the dinner table, and to maintain a positive attitude when possible. Repeating these rules and others early and often will show your children that you have clear rules for what is and is not acceptable in your home.
Be consistent. Though certain rules may change as your children reach a specific age, be clear about general household expectations. Make sure your expectations are the same for every sibling, so you don't look like you're playing favorites.

, In order to be the head of your household, your children should be aware that they will be rewarded for good behavior and punished for not meeting your expectations.


Have a reward for every occasion. If your child did well in school, passed a driver's test, kicked the winning goal in his soccer match, or reached an important milestone, such as a birthday, it's important to celebrate the occasion. Dinner at the restaurant of your child's choice, a trip to an amusement park or movie, or any other journey to your child's favorite destination, will help show that you care, and that you want him or her to keep succeeding.
Have clear punishments to discourage bad behavior. The punishment of grounding, or not allowing your child to spend time with a friend or at a favorite event, can go a long way in motivating your child not to stay out past curfew, or to skip class. If your child is younger, then having a simple ""time out"" or keeping him or her from watching a favorite show will demonstrate that you mean business when it comes to breaking rules.

, If you and your spouse or significant other share the head of your household, make sure that your expectations are very similar.


Avoid making important decisions, such as letting your daughter go to a slumber party at a new friend's house, without your significant other. If he or she doesn't agree with your choice, then he or she will look like the bad guy.
Be both good cop and bad cop. Avoid having your children view one of their parents as the lenient one. Both of you should have similar expectations about what is and is not allowed.

, Don't get so caught up in making rules that you forget to enjoy your precious time with your loved ones. Here are some tips for making sure there is more fun than rules in your household:


Make time for family every week. Whether it's for cooking an Italian meal, watching a scary movie, or just having family board game night, it's important to carve out quality time for all the members of your family.
Show your love and affection for your spouse and children. Though you may be an authority figure, you are also a mother or father, and it's important to tell your children how much you love them, to hug them, and to tell them they're special every single day.

Say please and thank you.,
Learn how to excuse yourself.,
Practice good manners at the table.,
Volunteer to help out when there is a need.,
Dress appropriately.,
Maintain good posture.",How to Be an Elegant and Mature Young Lady1," These are the basics of good manners! You might be speaking to a teacher at school or a waiter at a restaurant, but you should always express your appreciation.Say “please” if you want something.
Say “thank you” if you are given something.
Say “no, thank you” if you want to refuse something.
If someone gives you a gift, write them a thank you note to express your gratitude.;
, There are certain situations in which you will need to excuse yourself. You may need to leave the dinner table early, or you may need to take a call in another room. Do not just disappear without saying anything. This is extremely rude. Try saying one of the following.


If you need to leave the dinner table, you may ask, “May I be excused?”
If you need to use the restroom, simply say, “Excuse me. I’ll be right back.” You do not need to tell them where you are going.
If your phone rings, say, “Excuse me. I need to take this call.” When you return, apologize to the other person, and explain that it was important. Only take the call if it is important. It is rude to be on your phone in social settings., The dinner table is not the place to be reading your phone or texts. You should put away all distractions during a meal so that you can speak to the people you’re eating with.


Eat most of what your host gives you, and at least try everything. If you have an allergy or special diet, try to tell your host as far in advance as possible.
Wait for everyone to get their food before you start eating. If you’re visiting someone, you do not start eating until your host begins. At a restaurant, wait until everyone has been served their food.
Chew slowly and quietly. Do not slurp noodles or soup.
Ask for food to be passed for you. Do not reach over the table.
Do not talk with your mouth full. Close your mouth while you eat., Always offer your assistance when you notice that someone might need help. Ask if there is anything you can do, even if you are certain that the other person will say no. Some ways you can help include:


Offer to help clean up after dinner.
Bring a dish to parties and events.
Drop off medicine to a sick friend.
Drive an elderly family member around on their errands.

, Maintain good hygiene by showering daily. Make sure that your clothes are clean and ironed. You should understand that different situations require different types of clothing. While jeans and a t-shirt may be fine for hanging out with friends, you should wear something nicer when at a wedding. There are certain guidelines you can follow while dressing:


Formal events — such as weddings, award ceremonies, and some religious ceremonies —require a nice cocktail dress or gown. Your dress should be at least knee-length, if not longer. Heels or nice flats are required.
Business formal (also known as business professional) includes tailored trousers, knee-length skirts, blazers, button-up shirts, and nice blouses. Heels are recommended. These would be worn in a corporate setting.
Business casual includes nice khakis, black slacks, button-up shirts, knee-length skirts, and cardigans. You can wear heels or nice ballet flats. This is for a more informal office setting.
Casual dress includes jeans, t-shirts, shorts, tank tops, short skirts, and sneakers. This should be worn when doing errands, hanging out with close friends, and during informal outdoor events., It is proper to sit up straight when you are at dinner or in a meeting. Brace your shoulders back so that they form a straight line. Stretch your neck so that your head is looking straight forward. Do not slump your shoulders or hunch over while you sit or walk. When sitting, do not lean back on your chair.Make sure to cross your legs or keep them together when wearing a skirt.
If you are having trouble correcting your posture, you can do core exercises, such as Pilates or yoga."

Sing a repetitive song.,
Play loud music.,
Play a musical instrument badly.,
Read to yourself loudly.,
Clear your throat every few seconds.,
Don't be a jerk.",How to Annoy People in Elevators2," Being loud is one of the easiest ways to annoy people. Singing a song is a great way to get under peoples’ skin since songs can easily get stuck in your head. Sing a short song like “It’s a Small World” over and over again to vex your fellow passengers.What’s even more annoying than hearing someone sing a song over and over again is when they get the words wrong. Pick a popular song but get the words slightly wrong to really be annoying.

, Use your phone or a portable radio to play loud, repetitive music. You can even sing along with it to be especially annoying, or dance like you’re in a club., Bring an instrument like a guitar or an accordion into the elevator. Start playing it and making random notes and chords without playing a song. It’s even more annoying when the instrument is especially loud or off-key., Bring a book into the elevator and start reading loudly. Pretend to not notice people looking at you, and act as though it’s completely normal., Even though it’s not a loud sound, the sound of someone clearing their throat repeatedly can be extremely annoying. Clear your throat as you get on the elevator. Wait a couple seconds and do it again. Keep clearing your throat until you get off.

, It's a fine line between being lighthearted and mischievous and being a jerk. Aim to brighten the day of your fellow passengers instead of making an annoying racket. Start out quietly, then if the passengers seem amused, continue your prank. If the passengers look annoyed or irritated, don't keep going."
"
Stare at people.,
Pretend you have an imaginary friend.,
Pretend you’re an alien.,
Keep moving around.,
Tap people on the shoulder.,
Reveal the joke at the end of the ride.",How to Annoy People in Elevators3," Staring at people is especially creepy in an elevator since you are in such close proximity with your fellow passengers. When someone notices you staring, don’t look away. Instead, widen your eyes and tilt your head so you look especially bizarre.When there is only one other person in the elevator, tap them on the shoulder and pretend it wasn't you.

, Carry on an animated one-sided conversation with an imaginary friend. Pause every couple seconds like you are listening to his replies and act as though you are responding to his questions and comments.Hold the door open, pretending to wait for a friend. After a few seconds, pretend to greet your imaginary friend saying, “Come in Jonathan, what took you so long?”
Have your arm around an imaginary person, and whenever someone comes near, say, ""You popped Bubble Buddy!""

, Pretend that you’re observing everyone on the elevator as part of an alien study. Mutter to yourself periodically, “interesting, these humans” while you make notes on a notepad.


Pretend to talk into a tape recorder and say something like, “Day 34. Inside a small rectangular box called an elevator. It seems to be an extremely slow method that humans use to transport themselves.”
Roll up into a ball and cringe in the corner mumbling disturbing things to yourself, like ""They are coming!"" or ""You're next, you're next!""

, Instead of standing still and waiting for the elevator to arrive at your floor, move around constantly. Stand in one spot for a few seconds, then shake your head and move to the opposite side of the elevator. Keep moving like you’re trying to find the optimal place to stand.

, Stand behind someone and tap them on their shoulder. When they look around, give them a questioning look. After they turn back, wait a couple seconds and do it again., If you don't let your fellow passengers in on the joke, they may interpret your eccentricity as creepiness. This is especially true for staring at people and tapping their shoulder. At the end of the ride, say something like, ""I wanted you all to know that I was just messing with you! Enjoy the rest of your day!""

,How to Be a Good Leader5,
"
Keep your promises.,
Avoid gossip.,
Practice forgiveness.,
Maintain composure in tough situations.,
Learn how to say no.,
Apologize sincerely.,
Express sympathy.",How to Be an Elegant and Mature Young Lady2," You should always do things that you said you would do. Keeping promises shows that you are trustworthy and dependable. If something has come up that prevents you from fulfilling your promise, call and explain the situation.


Remember to show up for events that you signed up for.
Be punctual. Arrive at places at the time you said you would.
Show up to help out if you said that you could.

, No matter what you feel about other people, learn to keep these thoughts to yourself. It is never polite to gossip or insult others, even if they are not around to hear it. If someone has insulted you, try not to do the same to them. Take the high road by ignoring the behavior.


Avoid correcting or criticizing others, especially people you do not know or are not close to. They may find this insulting.It is fine to vent about people now and then. Choose a trusted friend who will not gossip, or tell a family member about what is bothering you. Limit yourself to one or two people whom you trust with your secrets.

, If someone has wronged you, it is good to forgive them. By holding a grudge, you will only lengthen your pain. If they apologize, tell them that you forgive them. If they don’t apologize, learn to let go of the grief by forgiving them in your heart.


Wait until someone apologizes before you tell them that you forgive them. Try to understand their position. You can say something like ""I understand where you are coming from. I want you to know that I forgive you, and I don't hold anything against you.""

, This doesn't mean you can't express emotion or be upset. Don't immediately react to things — if someone has made you angry, don't explode and tear into him. Take a deep breath and try to choose your words carefully. Be mindful of your tone and the volume of your voice. Try not to take insults or slights personally — if someone is being rude, that's his problem, not yours, and don't allow yourself to be manipulated to stooping to his level.


If you feel that you are too angry or upset to continue the conversation, it's okay to say something like, ""I can't have this conversation with you right now. I'm going to take a walk and we can resume this when we've both cooled down.""

, Maturity and elegance do not mean that you let others walk all over you. You are not expected to do everything asked of you, and you can learn to say no in a polite but firm manner. You can start with an apology before explaining why you cannot do something.


If you cannot help someone, you can say, “I’m so sorry, but I’m unable to help you with that. Let me know if there is anything I can do in the future.”
If you can’t accept an invitation, you can say, “I’m sorry that I am missing the event. I would have loved to come, but I am busy that day.”
If you are uncomfortable with the request, politely decline and say, “I don’t think it’s a right fit for me” or “I’m not sure that I’m the best person for that task.”

, Everyone makes mistakes. Maybe you forgot to show up for a friend's birthday party, or maybe you insulted someone. Learn how to apologize. While it may be difficult to acknowledge that you were wrong, it is best to get over your pride. If possible, try to meet with them face to face to express how sorry you are. A phone call or written card are also nice ways to say sorry.Be sincere in your apology. A simple “I’m sorry” will work if you have nothing else to say.
You can say something like, ""I understand why you're angry. I want you to know how sorry I am. Please let me know how I can make it up to you.""
Do not make excuses, although you can offer an explanation if you think there was a misunderstanding.

, If something bad has happened to another person, tell them how sorry you are. Offer to help in any way that you can.


You can say, “I’m so sorry to hear that. My thoughts are with you and your family. Please let me know if there is anything I can do. I am here for you, even if you just need someone to talk to.”You may want to bring flowers to a funeral or donate money to a cause in the deceased's name.
If someone is in the hospital, take time to visit them.
Send a card to them afterwards to let them know that you are thinking of them.

Pronounce your words clearly and slowly.,
Think before you speak.,
Work on becoming articulate and well-spoken.,
Listen actively.,
Avoid cursing.",How to Be an Elegant and Mature Young Lady3," Enunciation is very important for communication. When speaking, pace yourself. Pronounce every syllable. Do not slur or mumble your speech. Speaking too quickly will muddle your words, and it may cause the other person to misunderstand you.Use an appropriate volume. You do not want to yell while you speak, nor should you be so soft-spoken that the other person cannot hear you. As you speak, try to match the volume of the other person.

, Carefully consider the impact of your words before you say them. Understand whether or not someone might misunderstand you, or if they might take offense. Word your statements carefully so that your meaning is not mistaken.


Avoid talking about politics and religion. These touchy subjects can cause disagreements between family and friends., Try to stop saying ""Um,"" and ""Like,"" or other filler words and avoid using slang. Expand your vocabulary (try flashcards or a word of the day email) so that you can better express yourself.

, If someone else is speaking, wait until they are finished with their idea before you respond. Do not interrupt or speak over others. There are certain things you can do to let the other person know that you are engaged in the conversation:


Nod your head as they speak.
Make eye contact.
Occasionally repeat back what they said., Cursing can be offensive and rude. While you may feel the need to replace curse words with more polite phrases, it is better to keep your anger to yourself if you are upset or startled.


If you are having trouble with swearing, try keeping a swear jar where you put a dollar every time you curse. You should either donate this money or save it for an essential purchase.

"
"
Recognize why you want to stop.,
Notice when you curse.,
Enlist help (optional).,
Brainstorm other ways to express yourself.",How to Avoid Saying Bad Words1," Using bad words can reflect poorly upon you. In many circles, people who swear are seen as uncultured, uneducated, unrefined, immature, or worse. On the internet, swearing can get you banned from all sorts of social sites. Additionally, if you are using swear words directed at other people, you may be seen as a bully, unreasonable, or abusive. So there are many reasons to get your language under control. Take a few moments to consider why you want to quit, and how getting your language under control may improve your relationships and public image.;
, Figure out your triggers and bad habits. Get a notebook and a pen, and spend a week noting your cussing. When do you curse most? Is it around certain people, at certain places? Notice what are your environmental triggers. Is it when you are in traffic? When you have an irate customer on the line? Is it when you are stressed, frustrated or angry? Write down the words and the situations for a week. This will help you become aware of your behavior, which is the first step in changing it.

, Tell some trusted, kind friends and family that you want to stop cursing and enlist their help. Ask these people to tell you when you cuss.


If you do this step, realize that you will be getting critiqued. Decide ahead of time, if you can handle this kind of feedback. If not, skip this step. But if you do enlist help, make sure you do not get mad at your helpers for critiquing your cussing - after all, they are only doing this to help you.

, At the end of your observation week, spend an hour going over your notebook. Brainstorm alternatives to your cussing. Figure out other, healthier ways to express your feelings.


Instead of saying ""#@$% the management!"", say ""I am really frustrated with the management right now"" or some equivalent. Note how much more powerful and better received your thoughts and feelings are when you do not cuss.
You can also substitute more neutral words like darn, rats, flipping, crud, oh man, dang it, shiz, sugar, shoot, fiddlesticks, etc. in place of your normal cuss words.

Call ahead to check availability of popular items.,
When chasing after an item on sale, bring the printed ad with you (or at least write down the item number) to speed things up and avoid confusion about the price.

,
Put things back where you found them.,
Be patient when in line.,
If you find that an item is priced 15 cents lower at the other end of the store, let it go.,
Don't be hasty to return items (especially electronics) you can't figure out how to use.,
Leave the store with a smile and wish the clerk a nice day.

,
Don't shoplift.

,
Always be kind to store clerks, no matter how incompetent or rude you think they are.,
Don't take 20 items into a 10-item express checkout lane.,
Don't try to check out at closed lanes.",How to Be a Good Customer," It's far better than driving to the store, parking half a mile away, walking deep into the aisles, and wasting the time of a clerk who can't find it.;
,, When you knock something down from a rack or shelf, pick it up and put it back!


On the other hand, don't put things back yourself if you don't know where they go. ""Helpfully"" putting back a shirt you just tried on in the wrong section or with the wrong sizes can make the item harder for others to find, and harder for the salespeople to find again and put back properly. If in doubt, leave it to the professionals.

, Sighing, groaning, and inappropriate language won't make it move any faster.

, Having someone run a price check over insignificant amounts isn't worth your time, the clerk's, or that of the people behind you.

, When in doubt, either ask and/or study the owner's manual, and allow a few days' learning curve.

,,, Odds are, they are neither - they are either having a bad day, or don't know the answer to your question.

, If you do, don't be mad when you are redirected, or sneered at by other customers.

, If the light is on, it's open - even if there is no cashier there. If it's off, it's closed, even if there are three cashiers there. Period. Entering a closed checkout is like telling the cashier you don't respect him/her to his/her face. Don't do it, no matter what. Even if there is only one light on with 20 people waiting to check out, don't do it.

Don't bother trying to act tough; they know you're scared.,
Be sure you really want to go through the house.,
Make sure you won't react poorly to the environment.,
Avoid coming if you are drunk or under the influence of drugs.,
If there are rules, listen to them.

,
Do not touch the actors, even if this isn't explicitly mentioned.,
Refrain from trying to get the actors to break character.,
Do not hang out in an actor's scene and refuse to move until the actor is forced to break character to get you out.,
Avoid saying that you're ""not scared"".,

Resist the urge to scare others in the haunted house.,
Do not try to scare the actors.,

Don't ask the actors not to scare you.,
Do not force your companions to stay if they are frightened.

Walk, don't run.,
Do not walk slowly or dawdle.,
Come in smaller groups, preferably of two to four.,
Keep moving; don't hesitate.,
Don't spoil it for people.,
Don't take photos or video when you walk through.,
Don't chit-chat with actors you know.,
Stay with the group.,
Don't alert others to an impending scare.",How to Avoid Ticking Off the Actors in a Haunted House," And pretending you aren't scared or trying to act smart just wastes your money, not someone else's.;
, There's nothing worse than a customer who keeps their eyes and ears covered, or runs.

, Fog machines and strobe lights are often used. Keep this and any medical conditions that could be aggravated by this in mind.

, You won't have fun, your friends won't have fun, the actors won't have fun, and you could be a danger to yourself and others.

,, This is liable to get you thrown out, and possibly arrested.

, Unless they are unprofessional, actors are unlikely to break character, regardless of how many devastatingly witty one-liners you come up with. You might think it's hilarious to ask for an actor's phone number, or to comment on how hot they are. It's not.

, This is not funny. This ruins the experience for the people behind you and forces the actor to break rules.

, Stating that you aren't frightened indicates to the actors that you are. If you see an actor peeking out from behind a curtain, it is probably because they wanted to be seen. Saying ""ha, I can see you!"" doesn't prove that you're clever.

, Pushing aside curtains in search of actors waiting to scare you ruins the scare.

, It's not your job to scare people, it's the actors'. Let them do their jobs.

, This will almost certainly not work, and you'll look silly or foolish.

, Do not play with props. Do not move props. Do not attempt to steal props.

, If you find yourself too afraid to continue, request to be taken out. Do not ask to be taken out unless you genuinely want to leave the house. A false chicken out will only irritate actors who have to break character to escort you out.

, Asking an actor to not scare you will often not work. In fact, it will only encourage them to scare you more. If you are truly frightened, chicken out.

,, Having no fun ruins the experience for everyone.

, Running in a haunted house can be dangerous and destructive. Try to avoid it.

, Try to keep an average walking pace. This will ensure that you won't clump up into big groups with the people behind you, which leads to less scares for everyone.

, This makes you more manageable and easier to keep track of in the house.

, The longer you wait at the end of a hallway or in a doorway being frightened or debating about who goes first, the more time the actors have to prepare to scare you.

, When you leave the house don't warn waiting customers about what it might hold. That's kind of like telling people the end of a movie that they're waiting in line to see.

, This really destroys it for others. Posting on Facebook, Instagram, or anywhere else really destroys it for those that want to enjoy, and hurts those that took the time to create this art form. It also causes the actors to have no vision for a few minutes, making their job rather difficult.

, If you do happen to know one of the actors personally, don't yell out their name or ask/mention any personal information or upcoming plans to meet. Again, this ruins the experience for anyone else in front or behind you. It also ruins the scare actor's experience. Many hours of rehearsal have been put into your one walk-through, and it could be of concern to give out actors' names.

, Leaving the group you are with to hide and try to scare them is not only rude to the performers, it can hold its own dangers. There are electrical cords and other items that are intentionally set out of the way to not be a hazard to guests. By straying off the path, you may be putting yourself in harm's way or get lost.

, If you see an actor setting up a scare for someone in your group, don't try to 'help.' You're probably not as clever as you believe and your friend probably isn't as stupid as you think. Telling them, 'look over there' and pointing at the stalking actor is tantamount to saying, 'hey, there's a monster over there getting ready to scare you.'

Be clear.,
Be honest.,
Use “I feel” statements, if you are addressing things that make you emotional.,
Listen to the response.,
Pick a time to ask.,
Choose the correct person to ask.,
Don’t ask someone for something important when you are angry or emotional.,
Make sure you are being fair to the person you are asking.,
Don’t be a sore loser.,
Ask again.",How to Ask for What You Want," If you don’t know what you want, you can’t ask for it. Think about your desires until you are no longer ambivalent or confused about what you want. , If the thing you want is subjective, such as “a fulfilling life,” you cannot ask someone else to provide it for you. Take responsibility for things that others, such as children or spouses, don’t have the ability to directly provide.

, For example, decide what would make a life more fulfilling. If you decide a vacation would help you feel fulfilled, you can decide to ask for vacation time at work and ask your partner to use some of your combined savings for a vacation together.

, Verbally expressing yourself to others is much harder than writing down goals on paper. Pretend like you are writing a letter to the person you intend to ask.

, If you’ve gone through this process and still don’t know how to make what you want into something quantifiable, talk to someone who helps you tap into your creativity. Take an art class or a hike in a natural setting, which can help you think more creatively about a problem.

, If you are requesting a salary raise, make sure it is something you know the company can give. If you are hoping to spend more time with your family, make a request for weekly family activity time, instead of daily. , If you are trying to solve something, then lead with a clear introduction and a single reason it is important.


Try “I’ve been thinking about how to move toward my 5-year plan at the company,” if you are asking for a raise.
Tell a partner “It’s often frustrating when we don’t have enough time to spend together. I’d like to fix that,” if you want to ask for a vacation or date night.

, Don’t give the other person a chance to get distracted. You have segued with the previous step, so jump into it.


Say “That’s why I would like to look at applying for a promotion today” or “I want to look at spending more time together on a weekly basis.”

, Assume that no one is up to date with what you want and why you want it. Avoid the temptation to assume people are “mind-readers.”

, Don’t make up reasons why you should get what you want. If you must use reasons, pick 1 to 3 important reasons why this affects you and state them succinctly.


Avoid using too much evidence, if you are having a relationship conversation. You can make the person feel as if you have a long list of complaints. They may get defensive.
Try to cite examples, if you are asking for something at work. Say “I’ve been increasing my production numbers quarterly since I started with the company.”

, Say “Sometimes I feel burnt out after work, and it is exhausting to do the dishes. Can you please do them on days I work late.”
Say “I feel” when addressing some work situations. For example, “I feel like I have put my full commitment and creativity into this project, and I’d like to have the opportunity to have prove I can do larger projects.”

, You may be asked to address issues before the person says, “Yes.” You may feel nervous, but try to be attentive and ready for a discussion.


Nod your head slightly to confirm you are paying attention.

, Put it on your schedule and reward yourself if you follow through.

, If you need to ask more than 1 person, you may want to call an impromptu meeting of family or managers, so that you can leave with an answer. , You will not express yourself accurately, and people are less likely to give you what you want. Remember the adage, “you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar,” and be sweet.

, Having someone ask you something big can be uncomfortable, but choose a time when they are not obviously stressed or overburdened. You will help yourself and the other person. , You will not always get a “Yes.” Hold your head high and understand it took courage to ask.


Be grateful. Say “I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me.”

, Researchers at Stanford found out people are more likely to say “Yes” the second time around. People get uncomfortable being asked favors twice, and change their answer.


Lead with “I really think it’s important to discuss a promotion/a charity cause/our goals, since we talked I researched some more things that might interest you.” Then reaffirm that you think your desire is a good idea for both of you. "

Create a place for shoes.,
Leave your own shoes in the shoe area.,
Put a sign up.,
Create a mudroom.,
Link the request with the invite into your house.,
Ask directly.,
Inform your guests on the invite.,
Be firm and polite if they want to refuse.,
Provide socks or slippers for guests.,
Provide scented foot spray.,
Be aware of alternative customs.",How to Ask Someone to Take Off Their Shoes at Your Home," This should be an area clearly visible from the entrance where you can place your shoes that you have taken off. You might want to include a rack to place shoes on, or even just a small mat or rug where you place the shoes.


When people enter, they'll see the ""shoe area"" with you and your family's shoes, they'll see you (and other household members) without shoes on, and hopefully they'll put two and two together.;
, To make sure that the function of the space is understood, leave some of your own shoes in the shoe space so that your guests will see this and know what to do. Put several pairs of shoes in the shoe area.


If you create a shoe space without any shoes to occupy it, your guests may not realize that you want them to put their shoes there.

, To be absolutely certain that your guests understand the function of the shoe space, make a cute sign to hang above it. This will help eliminate any possible confusion.You can include a cute phrase on the sign like, “Leave your worries (and your shoes) at the door.”

, A mudroom is a space in a house (usually near the most used entrance/exit) that holds all the gear people wear outside — like coats, scarves, boots, shoes, etc. If you have a clearly designated room/area for these items, it is easy for guests to utilize the space.If your guests have to go through or pass by the mudroom on their way into your home, it will be quite easy to encourage them to use it.

, Try saying, ""Do come in — you can put your shoes on the rack."" That way the request is linked neatly with the invitation to enter. In fact, it would be very awkward at this point for your guest to do anything other than remove her outer footwear., If your guests remain oblivious to any visual clues you may have provided, you should ask them directly. Be firm, but polite with your request. Most people will respond positively because they won’t want to offend.If you feel it is necessary, give a good reason for asking them such as having had new carpets or having just had them cleaned, the weather being particularly foul, or you can say that your driveway is gritty and you're trying to minimize how much of it gets brought in on shoes.
Try saying something like:

“I’d appreciate it if you took your shoes off when you come in. We’ve just had the carpets cleaned.”
“Please take your shoes off when you come in the house. We like to avoid tracking in toxins and bacteria whenever possible.”Remember that it is your house, so you have every right to ask your guests to remove their shoes.

, If possible, it is best to let people know in advance that you would like them to remove their shoes. This will keep your guests from being caught off guard in a situation that may make them uncomfortable. It will also give them time to consider bringing their own slippers or wearing socks if they might have otherwise not worn socks.You could say, ""Oh, by the way we don't wear shoes in our house. You may want to bring some slippers or socks.""

, Some people may not want to take their shoes off no matter what you say. At this point, you should consider how important your “no shoes” house rules are and decide if you want to cause a fuss about it.


If there is a cultural or religious reason for not wearing shoes in the house, be open and let your guests know how important it is. For example, “I’m very sorry this caught you off-guard, but where I’m from taking your shoes off before entering is a sign of respect. It would mean a great deal to me and my family if you could do us the honor of entering our home without your shoes.”
Remember that you are well within your rights to ask your guests to remove their shoes, but if this makes your guests uncomfortable, they may choose to leave. That is a risk you must be willing to take.

, If you want your guests to take off their shoes, it might be a nice gesture to provide them with an alternative that is acceptable to both parties. Having some nice slippers or comfy socks available for your guests can help eliminate your guests’ feelings of discomfort or desire to push back against your request.However, you will probably find that most guests will prefer to be in socks or bare feet than wear borrowed slippers.
You can also try buying some disposable shoe covers (like the kind doctors wear over their shoes) for your guest to wear over his bare feet. This way, she won't feel strange borrowing someone else's socks or slippers and you can throw away the used covers after she leaves.

, It may be helpful for you to provide some scented foot spray near the area where you want your guests to remove their shoes. This will give your guests an alternative option if they are embarrassed about the possibility of having foot odor.

, In Japan, it is unheard of to walk into someone's house in your shoes, which are always left outside, and pretty slippers are always available. These can be bought quite cheaply in many local stores.This cultural difference is why it’s a good idea to provide socks or slippers for your guests.

Start small.,
Punish yourself.,
Reward yourself.",How to Avoid Saying Bad Words2," Start to change your ways, but start small. Picking a small manageable task is the best way to form a new habit. Pick one place, one situation to improve in. For example, you may choose to start by no longer cussing while driving, or in front of your nephew. Just pick one situation, and spend the first week avoiding cussing in that one.


When you (or your helpers) do catch a cussing in this situation. Apologize and rephrase the sentence without any bad words. This may seem awkward, but practicing talking without cuss words is the only way you will get better.

, Consider creating a swear jar. With a swear jar, every time you swear you put a dollar in. Now, to make the swear jar really work, you need to really hate losing that money. And losing a dollar here or there just isn't painful enough emotionally to be a real deterrent. Especially if you give that money to a friend or a favorite charity. Instead slate the swear jar money for something you really hate, like a rival political party. If you are Republican, make a commitment to donate all swear jar proceeds to the Democratic party. If you are Pro-Choice, make a commitment to donate all swear jar proceeds to a Pro-Life group. Now that will really make you clean up your language.

, When you meet your goal for that week - for example, no swearing in front of nephew - reward yourself with something: a night out, a movie, a good book, a massage.

"
"
Expand your challenges.,
Practice patience.",How to Avoid Saying Bad Words3," Once you have succeeded in cleaning up your language in one situation (say in front of your nephew), add new situations week by week.


For example, if you successfully did not cuss in front of your nephew all week. Next week do that, and do not swear when near playgrounds.
If you are not successful at your first goal, then that means your challenge was too big. Make it more manageable. Instead of never cussing in front of your nephew, make your goal smaller. Such as, ""I will not cuss before 8 am"", or ""I will not cuss at the drive through window"". Pick a time frame and situation that you know you can do, then expand the challenge from there, week by week.

, The key to success is to pick manageable situations and time frames to improve in. It will take time but slowly you will ease out of the cussing habit. It may take years before not cussing becomes your new habit. Self-improvement is always difficult but undeniably worth the effort.

Decide whether to use traditional forms.,
Begin the letter with ""Madam."",
Conclude the letter with a respectful term.,
Mail the letter.",How to Address a Queen1," According to the Royal Family's official policy, you should be free to write in whatever style you like.Politeness and respect will make any letter more kindly received, but that does not necessarily equate to using formal terms.

Ask the host what kind of party they’re planning.,
Check out good values and promotional discounts at the wine store.,
Cook a favorite dish or dessert.,
Bring a party game or other activity.,
Offer your services as DJ or bartender.,
Stay to clean up as the party winds down.,
Write a thoughtful card.",How to Be a Good Guest when You Are Broke1," In order to determine how you can best contribute, you need to find out what kind of a party your host is planning. If this information is not already included in the invitation, contact your host and ask for details, such as where the party will be held, if it’s a dinner party or just cocktails, and what kind of attire is appropriate.


For example, send your host a quick text saying something like, ""Hey, super excited for your party on Friday! Just wanted to check and see what kind of a vibe you're going for—should I dress up for a cocktail party, or will it be pretty casual?"";
, A nice bottle of wine is welcome at just about any party, and it doesn’t have to be expensive in order to be good quality. Just do a bit of research beforehand to make sure the modestly priced bottle you’re considering is up to snuff, or ask a liquor store employee for advice on selection.


In general, you can find a decent bottle of wine for 10-15 dollars (about 8-12 pounds or 9-14 euros).If the party is casual, you could bring a six-pack of affordable beer instead of wine. Beers like Corona, Tsingtao, and Heineken are widely available, cheap, and extremely popular., If you can’t afford a bottle of wine, or if the party in question is a potluck, you can still contribute meaningfully by bringing a scrumptious snack. Check out your kitchen cupboards and see what kind of a dish you could whip up without incurring significant expense. Just be sure to keep the party specifics in mind when deciding what food is appropriate to bring.


For example, if it’s a barbecue or informal potluck, you could whip up a simple potato salad or slaw or pick up a couple bags of chips at the store.If it’s a fancier cocktail or dinner party, put together a crudités plate by chopping up some veggies and dip.
If you’re bringing a dish from home, be sure to pack it in an airtight container.

, Your contribution to the party doesn’t have to be edible or potable. Instead, bring along a party-friendly game that will get guests laughing and talking. Cards Against Humanity, Twister, what?, and 5 Second Rule are just a few easy and fun games that require minimal set-up and coordination.If the party will be outdoors, you could bring a portable croquet set, a kickball, or a corn-hole board.

, Helping out your host by providing a party-friendly service is a great way to compensate for the lack of a concrete contribution such as wine, food, or a wrapped gift. It will free up your host to attend to other aspects of the party and their partygoers, as well as show that you’re trying to be considerate and helpful.


If you’re musically inclined, ask your host ahead of time if they’d like you to bring some playlists and attend to the music. Or, if you know your cocktails, see if you can help out mixing and serving other guests’ drinks.
If there’s no need for you to take on a definite role like bartender or DJ, you can help out in little ways throughout the evening. Pick up discarded cups or plates, mop up spills, and point people to the bathroom or coat room when needed.

, Even the politest partygoers and the mildest party will require some cleanup. Rather than leaving the host with the aftermath, you can stay behind and help to tidy up. Just be sure to confirm with your host that they’d like the help, as some people prefer to be alone after the highly social stress and responsibilities of hosting.This probably won’t be appropriate if the party is hosted at a restaurant or bar, but you can still help by asking the host if they need any help carrying gifts to the car, checking the area for any dropped or misplaced personal items, or driving ride-less guests home.

, Sometimes, the best way to be a gracious guest is expressing your gratitude in written form. If you’re artsy and have some free time, draw your own card and include a thoughtful note. If you’re hopeless with a pen and paper, buy a card from your local drug store—you should be able to find a nice one for under five dollars—and personalize it with your own written message.


This is especially important if you’re attending a birthday party for which you couldn’t bring a gift. The card and written message show that you spent some time, thought, and care on the birthday celebrant, even if you couldn’t spend any money.

Make a small curtsy, bow, or nod.,
Politely shake the Queen's hand if offered.,
Wait for Her Majesty to address you.,
Address her as ""Your Majesty"" the first time in the conversation.,
Address her as ""Ma'am"" for the rest of the conversation.,
Don't ask personal questions.,
Don't turn your back on the Queen until the conversation is over.",How to Address a Queen2," Traditionally, women do a discreet curtsy and men bow from the neck when they meet the Queen of the United Kingdom.This is no longer required, but citizens of the Commonwealth usually choose to use this greeting. People who are not subjects of the Queen often prefer to use a slight nod instead.Do not bow from the waist.

, The Queen may or may not offer her hand, although there is no special significance to one decision or the other. If she does offer her hand, take it in a brief, gentle handshake.


Do not offer your hand first.

, A good general rule, in fact, is not to initiate an action or conversation until the Queen has addressed you directly. Needless to say, wait until the Queen finishes speaking before you reply.

, If you are stuck for words, say ""Hello, Your Majesty. I am delighted to meet you."" Any polite greeting is acceptable, however.

, For the rest of the conversation, say, ""Ma'am,"" pronounced to rhyme with ""jam."" You may use the term ""Your Majesty"" again if you are asking her a question or introducing someone, but ""Ma'am"" will do most of the time., Most likely, the Queen will be guiding the conversation. But if you contribute your own small talk, avoid asking her about her family or personal life., Remain facing her or standing to the side throughout the conversation. Turn away or leave only when the conversation is over.And of course, don't forget to give her a proper good-bye and thank Her Majesty for the unexpected opportunity.

"
"
Try to find the specific form of address.,
When in doubt, use ""Your Majesty."",
Address Empresses as ""Her Imperial Majesty.""",How to Address a Queen3," Monarchies often have specific terms of address borne of their countries' traditions. Search online or in etiquette books for the terms of address for the specific monarchy.

, The term ""Your Majesty"" is common and unlikely to cause offense. This term is the proper way to address most queens, from Queen Pengiran Anak Saleha of Brunei, to Queen Mathilde of Belgium.


Use ""Her Majesty"" instead of ""her"" when writing or speaking about these queens in the third person.

, If a monarch's title includes ""Empress,"" or if the nation she heads traditionally considers itself an empire, she should be addressed as ""Her Imperial Majesty.""

Notify your hosts of the details of your upcoming stay.,
Take public transportation from the airport or bus station.,
Return home at a reasonable time in the evening.,
Send a thank-you note once you return home.",How to Be a Good Guest when You Are Broke2," Providing your hosts with a detailed itinerary of your stay is an easy—and totally free!—way to be considerate of your hosts before you even arrive. Knowing when you’ll be out of the house, where you’ll be going, and when you’ll probably be around will help your hosts figure out any changes they need to make to their own schedules, if they need to make a spare key, and what kind of sleeping and food arrangements they should make ahead of time.


For example, email or text an outline describing your arrival and departure times, as well as any appointments or sightseeing you’re planning during the timeframe.
If you’re in town for an interview or a wedding, make a note of when and where the engagement will take place, as well as how long you think it will take.

, Your hosts might offer to pick you up from the airport or bus station when you arrive, but you should assure them that you’re willing and prepared to make other arrangements. You probably can’t take a cab due to your limited finances, but you can figure out how to get to your host’s home by public transportation. By doing this, you ensure that your arrival creates minimal inconvenience for your friends’ daily schedule and pre-existing plans.


If they insist on picking you up, send a detailed itinerary and confirm your mobile number ahead of time so that your friend knows exactly where and when to find you, as well as how to contact you in case of confusion.

, If you're spending every evening with your hosts, you won't have to worry about the schedule you keep when staying in your hosts' home. If, though, you're spending some time separately, you should be conscientious about how late you return in the evening so that you don't disturb your hosts' usual routine.


If you must return late in the evening, be sure that your hosts know when to expect you. Also prepare your bed and pajamas so that you make minimal noise and bother when you enter.

, You probably already said thank you when bidding farewell to your host, but sending a written thank-you note after you’ve left will augment this verbal expression of gratitude. Make your own card or buy a modestly priced one from a local shop, then add a personal note expressing how much you enjoyed your stay and what a great host your friend was.If you have the space in your own home, add a sentence saying that you’d love to return the favor and host your friend if they’re ever in town in the future.

"

Keep your bed and personal belongings tidy.,
Offer to cook dinner for your hosts.,
Clean up after yourself in the bathroom.,
Do the dishes and other small household chores.",How to Be a Good Guest when You Are Broke3," Once you’ve settled into your temporary accommodations, do your best to keep your personal area well-kempt and orderly. Make sure that your belongings take up as little space in your host’s home as possible, and clean up after yourself in common areas like the bathroom or living room.For example, fold and put away any unused or dirty clothing, take any cups or dirty dishes back to the kitchen, and make your bed in the morning.

, Since you’re broke, you probably won’t be able to go out to eat while staying over at your friend’s house. Instead, ask your hosts if you can help out and ‘earn your keep’ by taking on cooking duty during your stay. If you’re not a great cook but your hosts are, ask if you can provide a helping hand during grocery shopping and dinner preparation.Since your friends probably have daytime jobs, you probably won’t be sharing breakfast or lunch with them. Stay on budget while remaining a good houseguest by picking up some cheap cold cereal or bagels for your breakfasts, and some instant ramen noodles or basic sandwich ingredients for lunches.

, In the comfort of your own home, you might go several days or a week before wiping down your sink or cleaning the mirror. When you're a houseguest, though, you should be extra vigilant about tidying up any trace you might leave in the bathroom.


For example, wipe off any toothpaste or soap residue you’ve left in the sink, check the mirror for splash marks from washing your face or brushing your teeth, and check the shower drain for any hairs you might have shed while bathing.

, Just because you can’t show your appreciation for your guests with traditional gifts like wine, flowers, or a gift certificate, doesn’t mean you can’t express your gratitude and courtesy in other ways. Pitching in around the house may not be the most conspicuous or glamorous display of gratitude, but it’s something that will actually make your host’s life easier and more pleasant during your stay.Be tactful when assisting around the house! Don’t go in your host’s private areas without permission, avoid any cleaning tasks that would require you to open drawers or touch paperwork, and don’t make any substantive changes to the home’s organization, even if you think you’re making improvements.

Do not use a national flag as a textile.,
Do not allow the flag to touch anything beneath it.,
Do not dip the flag.,
Do not use the flag for advertising.",How to Practice National Flag Etiquette," Buildings and outdoor flag staffs should be flown from sunrise to sunset. If a national flag is flown at night, it should be brightly illuminated with proper lighting, such as that of a spotlight.


National flags should not be flown in bad weather, such as heavy rain or thunderstorms, unless the flag is an all-weather flag.
Some nations require that during a brief period of precipitation, the flag be lowered until the weather clears.;
, The national flag should fly higher than other flags present. This includes state and provincial flags. The exception to this is when flags of other countries are also displayed, such as at the United Nations or during the Olympic Games.


If multiple flags are flown on the same staff, the national flag is to be flown above the others, at the top of the staff.

, When flags of multiple countries are flown in the same place, they must all be displayed as equals. They should each be flown on individual flagpoles, each of the same size.


All of the flags must be the same size and no flag can be bigger or smaller than another flag.
National flags of multiple countries should be arranged in alphabetical order., When displaying flags in a line, the position of the national flag in relation to other (non-national) flags changes based on the number of flags present. These range from two flags, to five or more.


When two flags are displayed in a line, the national flag should appear on the left side when viewed by an observer.
When three flags are displayed in a line the national flag should be in the middle (or the second flag).
When four flags are displayed in a line, the national flag should be the first flag on the left when viewed by an observer.
When five or more flags are displayed in a line, two national flags should appear at both ends of the line. In other words, in a line of five flags, the national flag should appear as the first flag and the fifth flag., When displayed horizontally or vertically, the flag should be hung correctly, in accordance to the nation’s wishes. In the case of the US flag, this means the union (the blue field of stars) should be displayed uppermost and to the flag’s own right. This will be to the observer’s left.Note that some nations restrict their flag from being hung in this fashion, or have specific instructions for doing so., When carried in a parade, the national flag should be carried on the marching right. If there is a center of flags in a line, the flag should be carried in the center of that line. The flag must hang freely.


If the flag is displayed on a float, it must be hanging from a staff. The flag is not to be draped over any portion of a vehicle.
Flags featured on a float must otherwise follow standard flag procedure when displayed with other flags., Events with public speakers, such as those that occur at a podium, should hang freely from a pole, superior to other flags present. The flag should be located to the speaker's right side, as a sign of honor and respect. For those observing the speaker, this will be on the speaker's left.

, National flags should be raised in a brisk fashion. When lowered, they should be done so slowly and ceremoniously. The flag should be raised at sunrise, and lowered at sunset.


Make sure to follow handling etiquette when attaching the flag to the staff. Do not let it drag or touch the floor.

, Raise the flag as though normal, but once you have reached the peak of the staff, slowly lower the flag to half-mast. When lowering the flag for the evening, first raise the flag to the top of the staff before slowly lowering the flag.


Each nation has specific days for flying the flag at half-mast. In the United States, those days are Peace Officers Memorial Day, Memorial Day, Patriot Day, Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, National Firefighters Memorial Day, and Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.
Some holidays only require a flag be flown half-mast for part of the day. On Memorial Day for example, the US flag is flown half-mast from sunrise to noon., People in attendance for the raising and lowering of flags should salute the flag. The salute should be held until the flag has reached the top of the staff, or has been lowered and removed. If music is accompanying the raising or lowering of the flag, the salute should be held until the music has finished.


Individuals present in military uniform should perform the military salute.
Individuals present who are members of the armed forces or veterans may also perform the military salute.
Those in attendance who are not in uniform should remove their headwear and place their right hand over their heart.The headwear may be held in the right hand, allowing the headwear to rest on the shoulder, while the hand is over the heart.Individuals from other countries should stand at attention, though are not required to salute., The flag should be folded in accordance to national tradition. It should not be crumpled or folded in such a way that results in creases or wrinkles. Store the flag in a spot where it will not come into contact with anything that can soil it.


Some flags have different folding techniques for certain occasions. The US flag for example requires a triangle fold when used at a burial., When a flag is no longer in good condition, such as if it is torn, ripped, or badly soiled, it should no longer be raised or displayed. It should be disposed of in a dignified way as required by the nation in particular. If the flag is currently being flown, it should be removed and folded in standard respectful fashion.


The standard disposal technique for flag disposal in the US is a respectful burning.

Some organizations, such as the American Legion, will take old, worn flags and dispose of them appropriately., A flag should not be used to create apparel, bedding or drapery. Flags must be allowed to fall free, and not be drawn or sewn in ways that restrict this. The flag should not be used as a covering for the ceiling.


This includes using the flag as a makeshift bag or purse!

, Most are familiar with not allowing flags to touch the ground. However, a flag should not teach anything that is beneath it. This includes the floor, water, parts of a balcony, or even merchandise.


Desecration of a flag is punishable in some nations. In the US, desecrating the flag can lead to a fine or no more than one year imprisonment., Some nations requires individuals who carry a flag to not “dip” it, or turn it from an upright position to a horizontal position. This indicates deference to those present. Some nations practice this for national events, such as the Olympics, and others do not.

, The flag cannot be made a part of any sort of advertising, such as being embroidered on pillows or napkins. Staffs that are flying the flag may not also fly advertisements for a product or company.


It should go without saying that a flag may not be altered to feature text or other imagery.

Be prepared.,
Never be embarrassed to answer this question.,
If you have lost a child or even more than one then this puts you in a different situation.,
If they don't understand, forgive them and tell them that you hope they are never able to really understand.,
Seek those others out, build a support group that does understand.","How to Answer the Question, ""How Many Children Do You Have"" if You Have Lost a Child or Never Had One"," Get your answer ready because it will happen. If you have never had a child, decide what you want to disclose to others. ""We decided to follow our careers"" or ""Our dogs are our children"" or ""We were unable to have children"" or ""We decided before we got together that the world is just too populated."" It all depends on how much information you want to disclose.;
, The question was asked, give the answer you are most comfortable with.

, Do you say ""Well, we had three but lost one"" or just include all of your children and let the conversation move on?


Most people that have lost a child will inevitably want the world to know their loss. Our children were here. We are all only here for a certain amount of time and parents of dead children have a deep need to keep that child's memory alive. Again, the question was asked.
You will get many different reactions from your answer. If you try to avoid the heartache this question stirs in you and give a generic answer without bringing up your loss the conversation may continue without opening that door. It may also leave you empty or even wishing you had opened up.
If you do answer truthfully be ready for some strange reactions. You will get some that offer solace and sympathy but very rarely will you get true empathy. Misery loves company but most people do not want to have to deal with other people's misery. It is not their fault. Unless it has happened to them they truly don't know how to deal with it. We are all trying to find happiness in this life. If a sadness jumps in, they are taken aback and some will even find reasons to avoid you after dealing with your answer.
Sometimes you will find that the person you are talking to truly cares and wants to hear more, but be ready, at some point you will be hurt because most people find it sad and regret asking the question.
You are now a member of a group that not everyone is in or even understands. If your child was killed tragically in an event like suicide or murder, then you are in an even smaller group. These issues will bring even different responses. They may be intrigued and ask questions but be ready for the ones that now see you as damaged goods and want to avoid you, maybe even judge you. Some may even think you are ""bad luck"" something to be avoided. Again, this is not their fault. It is self preservation for us to avoid the reality of our own mortality. When you allow them the truth it reminds them of their own mortality.
You will run into at least one person that actually hurts you by telling you to ""Get over it"" ""Move on"" or even in the case of suicide, that your child has gone to hell. Do not let this keep you from remembering or wanting to talk about your child. That is your job now. We NEVER get over it, it stays with us forever. You now have the ability to understand that they are fortunate enough not to understand what they are saying.

, When you run across those few that are in this unique group. You will see it in their eyes when the same question is asked of them. Now you have the ability to help them. It is what your child would want.

, It will help so much when you inevitably run across that question, ""So, how many children do you have?""

Decide which gifts you cannot use or do not like.,
Consider the potential for re-gifting.,
Store the gifts that you intend to re-gift.,
Get the gift out when you need it.,
Personalize the gift in some way if possible.,
Find a suitable card.,
Give the recipient their present.",How to Regift a Present," While your dislike of a gift might be an immediate reaction on receiving a gift, sometimes it's a good idea to give yourself a little time to see if can grow on you or not. If not, then it's possibly a candidate for re-gifting. Common reasons for not wanting a gift include not liking it, not fitting into clothing items, not being able to use an item (for example, earrings when your ears are not pierced), receiving a nice enough item but in a color that doesn't suit you or your decor, something that you consider doesn't meet with your values (for example, a leather belt when you're a vegan), and so forth.;
, Re-gifting should not be used in all cases and some of the times when re-gifting is not appropriate include when the giver will call often and notice the lack of the gift, when the gift is not something you'd give to someone else in your circle of friends and acquaintances, or when the gift has clearly had a lot of time invested in it and it really is the ""thought that counts"". Keep in mind the feelings of the original gift-giver;this doesn't mean you have to wear or use the item, just have it on hand to show occasionally until enough time passes safely for you to send it to charity or the back of the closet. And be super careful when re-gifting tech or similar items that date or go out of stock after a season; the gift recipient might try to return it to the store or need to get it fixed, only to discover it has long been superseded. Items may be suitable for re-gifting when:


The giver won't be aware that you've passed on the gift. For example:

They live far away
They simply don't keep a tally of what they've given you or anyone
Your house is a big cavernous place that swallows up ""stuff""
It's something that gets used up: for example, chocolates, candles, or soaps.


The gift is in good condition, doesn't have a use-by date (give those unwanted chocolates to someone else in the family!), and in many cases, still has its original packaging.
Is something you're proud to give to someone else. Re-gifting is still giving with care.

, Management of gifts used for re-gifting is important, in order to avoid giving it back to the recipient or people close to the recipient, and to avoid duplication. The following suggestions are intended to help your re-gift storage management:


Write down the name of the person who gave you the gift on a slip of paper. This is so you don't forget who gave it to you.
Keep the wrapping - you can reuse that too but use it on different gifts just to be on the safe side.
Also include names of anyone who may have seen the present and how you know them if you're especially forgetful.
Go over the gift with great care to remove any gift card evidence. If you accidentally leave a gift card attached to the gift, it'll be fairly embarrassing for both giver and recipient.
Make a list of the gifts you are storing on your computer. That way, you can quickly bring it up and check it when you're looking for a gift for someone.
Store all unwanted presents in a box or cupboard out of sight and where they will be safe from moisture, prying hands, and any other possible harm.

, Reasons for using a re-gifted gift might include when you're out of ideas for a present, low on cash or don't have time to buy a present. However, the main (and very good) reason is when you know that the recipient will really appreciate the specific gift and that it is something that you would normally purchase for this person. If it's something so left-field and not inclined to this person's tastes, they may well get suspicious that you're just passing along the stuff you didn't want.

, For example, wrap a piece of ribbon around it to make it look different, or add decorative elements that you'd normally attach to a gift. And be sure to wrap the gift beautifully, as well-wrapped gifts make a huge difference to how well it is received.

, Hand make a card if possible, or get an expensive looking one, to make up for the uninteresting present.


Write a highly personal and sentimental card, so the person remembers the card and not the present.

, Act perfectly normal; the item still has value and has been cared for in the interim, so provided you're not handing on dodgy things to people you're not terribly fond of, you've got nothing to worry about. If you're re-gifting an item because you don't like the recipient, it can be kinder on both of you (and more honest) to just not give one another gifts at all.


Be ready to step in and offer to return the gift if you get the impression that they don't like it. This will avoid a lot of difficult questions about receipts, the store in question, etc. To avoid probing, try to know in advance whether the recipient is the type to want to return it to the store themselves.

Contractions: “she's” (use “she is”), “I'm” (use “I am”), and “don’t” (use “do not”)
Abbreviations, including “TV” (use “television”), “phone” (use “telephone”), and “info” (say “information”)
Idioms, such as “piece of cake” (say “simple”) and “miss the boat” (say “missed an opportunity”);
, Along with not using informal words and slang, you also want to make sure that you enunciate when you're acting formal. Formal speech and behavior are often expected in meetings, in corporate settings, and at non-casual social events, and during these times you want to speak clearly so that people understand you.


Enunciating means articulating all the parts of a word properly, without dropping syllables. For instance, you would say “singing” and not “singin’”
To practice your enunciation, practice tongue twisters, such as: “Peter Piper picked a pack of pickled peppers.”, Many people find curse and swear words offensive, and you shouldn’t use these in formal or even semi-formal speech. When you are behaving in a formal manner, avoid all bad language, including:


Swear and curse words
Religious oaths
Vulgarities
Rude jokes

, This can be applied in any situation where formal behavior is expected, but these words are always polite to use in any situation.


Say “please” if you ask somebody for a favor or request. For instance, “Would you please pass the pepper.”
Say “thank you” if somebody grants a favor, grants a request, or compliments you. For example, “Thank you for providing that reference.”
You should also say “excuse me” if you're trying to get somebody’s attention, and “pardon me” if you accidentally get in someone’s way., This means avoiding casual greetings and expressions of farewell, such as “hey,” “hi,” “how’s it going,” and “see ya.” Instead, say things like:


Formal greetings: “hello,” “good day/morning/evening” “nice to meet you,” and “it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance”Formal farewells: “goodbye,” “farewell,” “take care,” and “until we meet again”

, Titles of respect should be used when addressing people in a formal setting. Use these instead of referring to somebody by their first name. Only used first names for friends and more casual settings, or if the person you're addressing says to.


To refer to somebody directly, use their last name and a title of respect, such as Mr., Ms., Mrs., or Miss Smith, which are traditional titles of respect for men and women.Mr. (“mister”) can refer to any man. Ms. (“miz”) can be used to refer to any adult woman. Mrs. (“missus”) is used to refer to a married woman who wants to be identified as a married woman. Miss is used to refer to younger women who aren't married or adults.You can also refer to people as “sir” or “ma’am” when addressing them, especially if you don’t know their last name.
It’s important to use titles of respect only if you know the person. If you haven't been introduced before, you shouldn’t assume anything about a person’s gender or marital status. While terms like Mr., Ms., sir, and ma’am don’t assume marriage status, they do assume gender.
For people you don’t know, there are a few ways you can refer to them. For people with certain careers, there are titles of respect you can use, such as “doctor,” “professor,” “officer,” and “reverend.” You can also try the gender-neutral title of respect M. (“em”) used with a last name, such as M. Smith., When you're having breakfast, dinner, or another meal where you're eating with other people, put away the cell phones, tablets, and other distractions. This includes when you're at home, at a friend’s house, or out to dinner at a restaurant.Removing distractions also means not watching TV or playing video games while eating. When you're at home, make sure everyone who’s eating sits at the table, and turn off all the electronic devices.
Most people find it acceptable to listen to quiet music while eating. If you want to listen to music during your meals, make sure the volume is low so that people can still talk.

, Being invited into somebody’s home is always an honor, whether it’s for a party, casual get-together, or other event. When you go to another person’s house, especially for a party or meal, it’s polite to take a gift for the host. Common host gifts include:Wine
Cheese or fruit plates
Desserts
Plants or flowers

, Acting formal means practicing proper table manners, even if you're just eating alone or having lunch with your family. However, dining etiquette is especially important in formal situations, in public, and at restaurants. Good table manners include:Keeping your elbows off the table
Asking for people to pass you things you can't reach
Chewing with your mouth closed
Waiting for everyone to sit down before eating
Sitting up straight
Asking to be excused before leaving the table

, During a formal conversation, it’s polite to allow one person to speak at a time. This means don’t interrupt or talk over others, and wait for people to finish speaking before responding or adding something to the conversation.


The only time it’s acceptable to interrupt somebody is during an emergency or when you need help., Negativity doesn’t have a place in formal speech or behavior, so stick with the old adage that if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.


To avoid saying things that aren't nice, never comment on another person’s appearance, unless it’s to pay that person a compliment.Don’t listen to or spread gossip.If you're involved in a conversation and somebody introduces gossip, change the subject when you have a moment to interject.
If somebody asks you your opinion about something you don’t like, try to say something nice about an element you appreciated. For example, if you didn’t like a particular meal but did like the appetizer, remark about how good the appetizer was.

, Along with only saying nice and positive things, you must also think about how your words and actions can impact others. Being formal means being polite and considerate, so you should always strive to be courteous and kind.To be considerate of others and their feelings, you must put yourself in their shoes and try to think about how things might affect them. For instance, if you have a friend with a sick father, ask how he’s doing next time you get together with that friend.
You can also be courteous by doing things like sending “thank you” cards when people give you gifts, keeping promises to people, being on time for meetings and appointments, and apologizing when it’s necessary.

, Part of being formal means dressing in clean, well-fitting clothes that aren't casual. Clean clothes are important for many reasons, including proper hygiene. However, clean clothes also say that you care enough about yourself and others to present your best self in public.


Always wash your clothes as soon as they become stained or visibly soiled, and never wear dirty clothes.
Clothes that aren't visibly dirty or smelly still need regular washing.
T-shirts and undershirts should always be washed after one to two wears, but shirts and blouses can go three or four wears before needing a wash. Office and dress clothes can typically be worn four to five times before washing., Opt for clothes that are tailored for your body, but not form-fitting. Avoid clothes that are too tight, loose, long, and short.Know your clothing size for shirts, pants, and blazers, and don’t try to squeeze into something a size smaller or hide under something a size larger.

, Clothing comes in many levels of formality, including casual, business casual, semiformal, formal, black tie, and white tie. To dress properly instead of casually but without being overly formal, wear things like:For men: button-down shirts with cuffs and collars, suits, vests, ties, and dress shoes or loafers.
For women: dress shirts or blouses, suits with either pants or skirts, dresses, and high or low heels.

, Wearing clothes that are in good repair is just as important as wearing clean clothes. Dressing formally doesn’t always mean wearing a suit or dress suitable for a ball, but it does mean looking professional and presentable.


Despite the current fashions, don’t wear jeans with rips or tears.

Call people sir or ma'am.,
Offer your help.,
Be patient.,
Don’t assume they have disabilities.",How to Respect Older People1," Even if you’ve grown up in a more casual environment where you usually call your friends’ parents by their first names, you shouldn’t assume that all older people are comfortable with that kind of informal title. Some elderly people may be more traditional, and prefer that you call them Mr./Mrs. So-and-So. That’s why it’s always best to ask what name they prefer and use sir or ma'am when you don't feel comfortable asking., People can often lose strength, balance, and agility as they age, which can make some everyday activities that we take for granted more difficult. Providing even the smallest assistance may help make their day a little easier, and demonstrate your respect in a courteous, thoughtful manner.It’s always polite to hold the door open for the people behind you, but it can be especially helpful for older people with canes or walkers.
When you’re on public transportation, such as the subway, train, or bus, consider offering your seat to an elderly person, who might need to rest more than you.
If you’re at the store, offer to reach for items on shelves that might be too high or low for an older person to reach. You might also offer to carry an elderly person’s bags to the car or unload their cart into the trunk.

, Older people usually don’t move as quickly as they used to when they were younger, which means it can take them longer to do even the simplest of tasks, such as crossing the street. Be respectful by showing some patience when you encounter them instead of trying to hurry them along.If an elderly person is slow to get off the bus, subway, or elevator, or just walking down the street, don’t push past them. Let them take their time, so they are comfortable and don’t injure themselves.
Don’t huff and puff if an older person on line in front of you at a store takes a little longer to pay for their items. Instead, try to be understanding -- you might even offer to help by lifting items out of the cart or bagging groceries.

, While it’s true that many elderly people have health issues that may require special assistance, aging doesn’t affect all people in the same way. Assuming that an older person has poor eyesight or hearing can be extremely condescending and make him or her feel self-conscious. That’s especially true if you make a big deal out of it, such as raising your voice every time you speak to him or her.If you’re unsure whether an older person has a vision or hearing issue, just ask. It’s better to be straightforward than to risk offending someone.

"
"
Visit them.,
Show interest in their lives.,
Don’t try to take control of their lives.",How to Respect Older People2," Older people can often feel isolated because they usually aren’t working any longer and it’s not always easy for them to go out. That’s especially true for elderly people who live in a nursing or retirement home. Take time out of your schedule to visit with the older people in your life as often as you can, so they know that they’re still important to you.If you’re very busy and can’t make it to see the older people in your life as often as you’d like, calling them can be a good alternative. You might even set up a time to call each week, so you have a schedule to stick to.

, It’s easy to think that older people don’t have much going on because they don’t do many of the things that they used to when they were younger. However, many elderly people are still active, and lead full, busy lives, even if that just means playing bingo, waking in the park, and gardening. When you visit or call the older people in your life, make sure to ask about their favorite activities.If your grandparent, aunt, uncle, or other elderly loved one has a hobby that they particularly enjoy, you might even offer to do it with them. That’s a great way to show them just how interested you are in what’s important to them.

, While it’s true that your elderly loved ones may need help with some details of their lives, such as chores around the house or making sense of tax forms, they probably aren’t completely helpless. You should offer your assistance, but it’s important to respect them enough to let them make their own decisions as long as they’re able to. "
"
Value their opinions.,
Ask for advice.,
Learn about their traditions.",How to Respect Older People3," You shouldn’t be so quick to assume that older people are out of touch with what’s going on in the world. In fact, because of their experience, they might have a different perspective that helps you think about an issue or topic in a new way.If your opinion differs from an older person’s, try not to argue over it. Instead, have a polite conversation where you’re both able to express your points of view, so you can really listen to each other.

, Because of their experience, older people can offer up a wealth of valuable insights, so it only makes sense to use them as a resource. Whether you’re having trouble in school, fighting with your significant other, or unsure what to do with your career, talk to the older people in your life to see if they’ve encountered a similar situation and can provide guidance., Cultural customs, practices and stories are usually passed down generation to generation, so the older people in your family probably have insight into your ancestors that you can’t get anywhere else. Ask them to share what they know about your family’s traditions, so you can learn more about them -- and where you come from.Making an family tree can be a fun activity to do with an older relative. There are a variety of websites, such as Ancestry.com, that can make researching your family easier, so your elderly relatives don’t need to remember all the details.

You may never have the opportunity to mend a bad impression, so it's important that you get it right on the first try.Generally speaking, this shouldn't cause you any stress. You merely need to think about the way you act and speak with new acquaintances. Greet them with a firm handshake. Make eye contact. Speak politely and clearly.;
, Acting the part also requires you to look—and smell—the part. Even if your behavior is impeccable, no one will notice your manners if you haven't bathed in over a week and you walk into the room with a disheveled appearance.


Shower regularly. Before you leave the house each morning, make sure that you've brushed your teeth, combed your hair, and applied antiperspirant.

Dress appropriately for each occasion, too. Last night's jeans and a wrinkled t-shirt is acceptable attire for a quick run to the convenient store or coffee shop, but not for your date or a meeting with your boss (even if your office dress code is casual).
Moreover, no matter what you wear on the outside, you absolutely must wear clean undergarments each day and for all occasions.

, There are times when a little swearing is socially appropriate, but if you're trying to act like a gentleman in a certain setting, that probably won't be one of those times.


The occasional expletive won't ruin your image as a gentleman, but if you swear frequently or tell off-color jokes in front of people who may not appreciate that sort of humor, you will probably seem rather rude.

, Make every person you talk with feel as though you are genuinely paying attention to the conversation. Be an active listener. Listen to the other person and add your own thoughts when the time is right.


Don't interrupt others while they are speaking or completely ignore something they've just said.
If continuing the conversation is unbearable, politely excuse yourself and put an end to it. Doing so would be more gentlemanly than rolling your eyes or otherwise making your displeasure obvious in the midst of the talk.

, When you're dining with someone else or in a group setting, wait until everyone at the table has been served before digging into your own plate of food. A little patience can go a long way.


When you're with party of six or more people, though, it might be more acceptable for you to start eating once you get your food. Look around to see what everyone else with a dish is doing. Their actions might tell you what would be socially appropriate in that particular situation.

, You can be a gentleman and still enjoy a drink or two. You cannot, however, act like a gentleman if you are utterly and undeniably drunk. Know how much alcohol you can tolerate before losing control of yourself and stay within that limit.


While in polite company, never drink enough to impair your speech or your good judgment. If you're not sure whether or not one more drink is a wise move to make, it's best to err on the side of caution and politely decline it.

, When you walk into a building, remove your hat. This is a small action that, if skipped, may not be missed much by most onlookers. When you follow through with it, though, the action tends to be noticed and appreciated


Removing your hat shows respect for the establishment you've just walked into. Even though none of the managers of that establishment might be there to appreciate your gesture, most people you'll be with will still recognize it as a sign of respect and can appreciate it as such, even though that respect may not be directly aimed at them.

, This is an especially courteous thing to do for women, the elderly, and the injured.


Giving up your seat demonstrates respect and consideration. By making this one simple gesture, you are telling that stranger on the bus that you value his or her comfort over your own. Any sane human being should be more than capable of appreciating that sort of generosity.

, When you reach the door first, hold it open and let the person behind you walk through before walking through it yourself. If you reach the door after someone else, grab and hold it for that person while he or she is still walking through it.


This is a good habit to pick up and use on an everyday basis. Open doors for everyone you cross paths with, regardless of age or gender.
Don't limit this action to building entrances and exits, either. For instance, you should also hold the elevator door for someone rushing to get on. Hold the car door open as a passenger gets into your car (especially if that passenger is a woman you're presently dating).

, When you're with a woman—romantically or platonically—treat her with respect. There is a time and a place for physical passions to come into play, but you must treat every woman as far more than a trigger and a release for your desire.


For platonic relationships, it's best to keep the physical contact to a minimum.
Similarly, the physical contact used during a first date should be relatively cautious and non-invasive. The shoulders, arms, and hands are usually safe zones. It's best to wait until she gives you clearance to do more before trying to take things any further, though.
Pay attention to her comfort level overall. Some women move faster than others, while others prefer to take things slow. Body language will usually reveal the difference between the two. Never push a woman to take things further than she's ready for.

, If a woman starts flirting with you while you're already in a relationship, you need to tell her that you're already taken. It is especially important to be honest about this when you are directly asked about your current relationship status.


You don't need to tell every woman you meet that you're in a relationship, of course. Doing so would require you to assume that every woman you meet will inevitably be attracted to you, and that's not a very classy assumption to make. This rule only applies when a woman demonstrates clear romantic interest or intent.

, Keeping your eyes off an attractive woman who passes by can be difficult, but you need to make an effort at doing so, particularly when you're on a date with another womanInstinct may tell you to watch the attractive waitress walking away from your table, but self-control should tell you to keep your eyes on your date.
As soon as you catch yourself looking at another woman, immediately turn your attention back to the woman you're supposed to be looking at. The damage inflicted by a glance will be much easier to undo than the damage caused by long stare.

, Instead of honking the horn and sitting in your car as you wait for her to leave the house, take the time to park the car and walk to her door.


Waiting in your car might seem sensible enough, but a gentleman is willing to slightly inconvenience himself for the sake of others. Getting out of your car to knock on her door or ring her doorbell demonstrates this sort of willingness.

, You don't need to stand for every woman who enters the room, but you should stand when the woman you've been waiting for arrives and approaches your table.


This doesn't mean standing every time she exits and enters the room, of course. Standing upon her initial arrival is usually more than enough to show your respect.

, Offer to take her coat upon arrival at your destination. Pull her chair out for her before sitting in your own place at the table. Before leaving, offer to fetch her coat and help her back into it.


Since these gestures are fairly uncommon nowadays, most women won't expect them. Some may even dislike them and will be sure to let you know how they feel. For the rest, though, these small acts of consideration will usually come as welcome surprises.
Note, however, that the staff at many higher class restaurants and formal events will do this instead, so you won't always have the opportunity to make the offer.

, On a first date, you should reach for the check and offer to pay it. She might accept your generosity or still insist upon splitting the bill, but it is a good idea to put the offer out there nonetheless.


Of course, if you're on a tight budget, it may not be possible to pay the entire tab for your date. If you can afford to do it, though, it's worth considering for a first date.
If she still offers to split it, try thanking her and telling her she can make it up to you next time. If she still insists upon splitting the bill now, then let her. It's better to cave in than to create a scene.

, When the two of you are walking beside a road, take the position closer to the curb. This is a small, subtle gesture that may go unnoticed at first, but it demonstrates the sort of consideration a gentleman is expected to have.


The idea is to stand as a guard between her and any water that might splash up from a puddle as a car passes through it. Even when there are no puddles to concern yourself with, however, social etiquette still deems it as a polite move to make.

, There's nothing wrong with walking hand-in-hand, but if you're looking for a traditional, classy alternative to catch a woman's attention, try offering her your arm instead.


For a casual first date, offering your arm might seem more than a little out of place. You'll need to pay attention to the mood before deciding whether or not it's appropriate.
This gesture is almost always welcome at formal events, however. It can also be a smart move to make when you're walking over icy or uneven ground.

, Make sure that she reaches her car safely. When appropriate, make sure that she gets home safely, too.


Offer to walk your date to her car. Get her a cab instead of leaving her to get her own. Walk her to her door if she let you drive her home. When the two of you are close enough to exchange phone numbers, ask her to send you a text after she gets home safely.
Unfortunately, the world can be a dangerous place for a single woman, especially after dark. While some women may take offense to your concern, most will understand and appreciate it. Moreover, being outwardly concerned for her safety may ultimately help her feel safer around you.

Switch on the auto-lock feature.",How to Extend the Battery Life of an iPad," Your iPad drains battery power when searching for and attempting to connect to the nearest Wi-Fi or cellular network tower, so if you're not planning on using Safari or apps that require these features, shut them off.


Go to ""Settings"", ""WiFi option"" or ""Cellular"", and tap the off switch.;
, Data that is updated regularly includes email notifications and RSS feeds.


Go to ""Settings"". Tap on ""Mail, Contacts, Calendars"" and go to ""Fetch New Data"". Tap ""Manually"".
Alternately, tap ""Hourly"" to increase the fetching interval.

, The usefulness of this step depends on how many emails or IM+ you usually receive; if you get a lot, this step is probably worth using as this can deplete battery life.


Go to ""Settings"", ""Mail, Contacts, Calendars"" and ""Fetch New Data"". Turn off Push.

, It goes without saying that the brighter the screen, the more battery power your iPad consumes. Turn the brightness down to the lowest setting you find comfortable, but make sure you can still see your screen.


Go to ""Settings"", then ""Brightness & Wallpaper"".Select ""Auto Brightness"", which will allow the iPad to adjust brightness depending on the brightness of your location; or
Drag the slider to the left to lower the default screen brightness. 25 percent to 30 percent brightness should be sufficient for daytime use, and for most people, it should also work during nighttime.

, Active use of maps and other location services will drain battery life. If left on, Maps updates continuously, and you do not need that app draining your battery.

, For example, BrickBreaker HD looks great in high-definition, but playing for long periods of time drains battery life like a hose.

, It's a quick and convenient way to disable all of the iPad's wireless features like cellular data, Wi-Fi, GPS, location services and will increase battery life. It's also a good idea to use Airplane mode in areas where 3G is patchy or weak.

, Extremely high or low temperatures can cause the battery life to decrease. Keep the iPad environment between 32ºF and 95ºF(0ºC and 35ºC).Be careful of using an iPad case when charging the battery, as this can prevent adequate ventilation, increasing the temperature of the iPad and potentially damaging the battery (charging releases heat).

, Apple recommends updating regularly because engineers look for new ways to optimize battery performance and when they find any ways of doing this, they pass these on via software updates., This means that your iPad's screen will turn off after a set period of time if left inactive. It doesn't power off the iPad, just the screen.


Go to ""Settings"", ""General"", and tap on ""Auto Lock"". Set the interval to a short space of time, such as one minute."

To delete photos added through iTunes, see the next section.;
, When you start up the Photos app, you will be shown a list of your albums. Open the album that contains the image(s) you want to delete. You can only delete images from within a single album at a time.


You can also select photos from the Collections or Moments pages.
If you delete images from the My Photo Stream album, they will be deleted across all of your devices. Photos on your Camera Roll will be removed from your device only.

, To delete a single image, tap it to open it, and then tap the Trashcan icon in the lower-right corner. Tap the ""Delete Photo"" button that appears to confirm that you want to delete the image.


Deleting an image is permanent, and it is not especially easy to recover a photo after it has been deleted. See this guide for details on how to recover any photos that you accidentally deleted.

, You can delete multiple images from an album at once by selecting them all before deleting. To select multiple images, open the album you want and then tap the Select button in the upper-right corner. You can then tap each picture you want to delete to add it to the selection.


Once you have all the pictures you want to delete selected, tap the Trashcan icon in the upper-left corner, and then tap the ""Delete (#) Photos"" button to confirm.

, You can delete any albums that you have created on your iPad. Deleting an album will not delete any of the images in it. You cannot delete albums that were synced from your computer (see the next section).


To delete an album, open the Albums page in the Photos app. Tap ""Edit"" in the upper-right corner, and then tap the ""X"" button in the corner of the album you want to delete. Images will be returned to their original location (Camera Roll, My Photo Stream, etc.).

, Photos that have synced from your computer need to be unsynced in order to delete them. If you try to delete these photos directly from your iPad, the Delete option will not be available.

, You will need to manage your synced albums in order to delete the photos from your iPad. Select your iPad from the Devices menu.

, You will see a list of albums that have been synced to your iPad. You can only sync and unsync full albums.

, Scroll through the list of synced albums and uncheck any that you don't want appearing on your iPad.

, Unfold the locking flap and gingerly slip it from the tight clutches of the case. Go slowly and don’t stretch the case - patience grasshopper! As you remove it, notice the top has two small access slots for the mic/earphone jack and power switch.

, Thread the strap material through the ring and fold as shown.

, Position the ring and strap as shown so that the strap lies on the interior of the case and the ring just protrudes through the access hole. The ring should be just at the access hole without excess strap material protruding. It will stretch slightly with use.

, Note the right side strap is positioned to avoid the hump on the back of the case.

, The iPad makes a good straight edge.

, One at a time, carefully run a bead of cement down the line and press the straps into the cement. Only very little should protrude. Using wax paper from the kitchen, gently press the strap to spread the cement.

, Using a paper cutter, cut about 30 sheets of used office paper 8 ½ by 6 ½ inches (21.5 cm x 16.5 cm) to fit inside the case. With the wax paper still in place, put the paper on top, as shown, and place several large books on top to press the assembly. Leave for at least an hour to dry. (Some suggestions for heavy books: Anything by Edward Tufte, MC Escher or NASA.)

, Now you can carry your iPad around without worrying about setting it down and leaving it somewhere!

, Photos stored on your iPad can take up a significant amount of space, especially if you have Photo Stream or turned on. The easiest way to reclaim this space is to connect the iPad to a computer, back the photos up to the computer's storage, and then delete all of the photos on the iPad at once after the backup process is complete.


If you are using the iCloud Photo Library on your iPad, it will always download a copy of every picture you have stored in iCloud to your iPad's local storage. Click here for instructions on minimizing the amount of storage that this will take on your iPad by reducing the quality of the preview images.
If you don't have a computer to back up your iPad photos to before deleting them, you can use iCloud Photo Backup to store them in your iCloud storage. You'll then need to delete the photos using the Photos app on the iPad. Note that if you are using the free iCloud account, your photos may take up a significant percentage of your 5 GB of free storage.

, If you are using Windows, the Autoplay window should appear. If you are using a Mac, open the iPhoto program.

, Select ""Import photos and videos"" in the Autoplay window (Windows), or select your device and click the Import # Photos button in iPhoto (Mac).


If you are using Windows and the Autoplay window doesn't appear, open your Computer/My Computer window (⊞ Win+E), right-click on the iPad, and select ""Import photos and videos"".

, If you are using Windows to import the photos, you'll need to set the import manager to delete the files after importing before you start the import process. If you're using a Mac, you'll be prompted after the import process is complete.


Click the ""More options"" link in the ""Import Pictures and Videos"" box.
Check the ""Delete files from device after importing"" box.

, Before importing the photos, you can change your import settings to organize the photos as they are added to your computer.


If you are using Windows, click the ""More options"" link to see all of your sorting options. You can change the folder that pictures are imported to, as well as automatically rename the files as they are copied. You can also click the ""Add tags"" button to categorize the photos before copying.
If you are using iPhoto on a Mac, the photos will automatically be grouped by the date they were taken when they are copied to iPhoto. You can manually move them to albums or sort them using a different method., This may take a little while if you have a lot of photos to copy. If you've backed up your photos before but didn't delete them from the iPad, only new images will be backed up.

, If you are using Windows, you checked this option earlier, and the photos will be automatically deleted from the iPad after the import process is complete. If you are using a Mac, click the Delete # Items button to remove all of the photos that were backed up from your iPad.

, If you've installed a lot of apps on your iPad, they could be eating up a large amount of your iPad's limited storage. Games are one of the biggest offenders, with titles like Infinity Blade, Asphalt, Rage HD, and many others taking 1 GB each or more. Removing games and other apps that you don't use anymore can free up a lot more space than you may think.

While you can delete apps from your Home screen fairly easily, this method will sort your installed apps by their size and allow you to see how much space each app is taking up.
Don't worry about losing access to the apps you uninstall. All of your downloads are stored with your Apple ID, and you can redownload any app, free or purchased, from the App Store at any time.
If you want to back up an app, you can use iTunes to copy all of the documents and data associated with the app before deleting it. If you have iCloud Backup enabled, app data will be automatically backed up when your device is backed up to your iCloud storage.

,,, This may take a few moments.

, You will see how much space the data associated with the app is taking up.

, Tap ""Delete App"" again to confirm that you want to delete the app and all of its associated documents and data.

, You can potentially free up a lot of space by regularly cleaning out your apps., If you keep a lot of music on your iPad, its likely taking up a sizable chunk of your storage space. iTunes Match is a paid service from Apple that allows you to stream your entire iTunes library to your iPad (or any other Apple device or computer). This can free up tons of space, as you'll no longer need to keep any music files stored on your iPad. Click here for instructions on setting it up.There are some drawbacks to the service. Besides costing $25 per year, you'll only be able to stream when you have a network location. You can always download any of your songs to your iPad ahead of time if you're anticipating being without a network connection.
iTunes Match allows you to upload songs that you didn't purchase through the iTunes Store. You can also use services like Google Play Music to upload and stream your music.

, If you opt for a streaming service, or make the switch to internet radio, you can delete all of the music files from your iPad at once. Any purchased music will still be downloadable from the iTunes Store.


Open the Settings app.
Tap ""General"" and then select ""Usage"".
Tap ""Manage Storage"" in the ""Storage"" section.
Tap the Music app. You may have to wait a few moments for it to appear. If your Music app isn't listed, you don't have any music files actually stored on the iPad.
Tap the ""Edit"" button.
Tap the ""-"" next to ""All Songs"" and then tap ""Delete"". You can also delete individual songs this way.

, If you just want to delete certain songs, you can do so from within the Music app. Be aware that depending on your settings, songs may be visible that aren't actually stored on your iPad (iTunes purchases, iTunes Match songs, etc.).


Open the Music app on your iPad.
Find the song or album that you want to delete. Songs that are not downloaded to your iPad will have an iCloud icon on the right side of the song.
Swipe the song or album to the left to reveal the ""Delete"" button. If you cannot swipe a song, it means that it is not downloaded to your iPad and therefore not taking up space. If you cannot swipe an album, it means that one or more songs on the album are not downloaded on your iPad. You'll need to delete individual songs from within the album.
Tap ""Delete"". This will delete the song or album from your iPad. If you see the ""Remove"" button instead of the ""Delete"" button, it means you are in Playlist view. You must delete songs from the Songs, Albums, or Artists view.

, If you've downloaded movies, TV shows, or music videos from the iTunes Store, they could be taking up a lot of space. HD videos in particular can be huge. Removing videos after you watch them can make room for a bunch of other things.


Open the Settings app on your iPad, select ""General"", and then ""Usage"".
Tap ""Manage Storage"" in the ""Storage"" section.
Select the Videos app. If you have a lot of videos downloaded, it will likely be one of the last apps to appear, and should be located towards the top of the list.
Review your videos. You will see each video stored on your iPad, along with the size. TV shows will display the size of all the episodes on the iPad, and you can tap the show to see the size of individual episodes.
Tap ""Edit"" and then tap the ""-"" next to the video you want to remove. Repeat for any other videos you want to remove from your iPad.

, If you use your iPad to send messages through iMessage, saved messages could be taking up a large amount of space. This is especially true if you send and receive a lot of images and video through the Messages app.

, This is located at the top of the list of conversations.

, You can select multiple conversations.


When you delete a conversation, all of the messages and images in it will be erased. Be sure to copy down any important information and save pictures you want to keep to your Camera Roll.

, All of the selected conversations will be deleted., With the iOS 8 update, Apple introduced the iCloud Photo Library beta. This program allows you to automatically upload and store all of your photos on your iCloud Drive, making them instantly available on any of your devices. What this means is that every device that has iCloud Photo Library enabled will download and store a copy of each photo onto the device's local storage.


To save space on your iPad when using the iCloud Photo Library, you can opt to only store smaller versions of the image on your local storage, while keeping the high-quality version on your iCloud drive. This can save you a lot of space if you value having access to all of your images at any time.

,,, This will make the iPad download optimized versions of the photos to reduce the amount of local storage needed. Optimized versions of your iCloud Photo Library photos take up about half as much space as the full-quality versions.

, After enabling ""Optimize iPad Storage"" you can still seed the full-quality version by opening a photo. Opening a photo will download the full-quality version from iCloud, which may take a moment.

If you're going to set out some house rules on iPad usage, you will need to be showing good restraint and reduced usage in front of your child, so that he or she can see this is fair. If you can't restrain yourself, you'll need to play on the iPad out of sight.

, If you allow usage to last on an unlimited basis and your child is allowed to carry it all over the house, you may experience pandemonium. From draining the battery to leaving it in odd spots like inside your child’s dollhouse or the bathroom, the iPad may end up getting mistreated. Wrangle down your child’s usage and institute specific rules that must be adhered to if he or she wants to play with it. And make it clear that everyone using the iPad is subject the same rules, not just your child. Some good rules to institute include:


Designate a set play or usage place. Create boundaries as to where your child can play with the iPad. Do not allow your child to leave the pre-determined area with the iPad during play (it could be on the couch, in the kitchen or living room, for example). Exceptions to this can include when the whole family sits down to play on it (such as a dice game like Monopoly) or when you are actively educating your child using the iPad.
Implement a battery charging rule. Is the battery always drained after the kids have had their fun with the iPad? Make it a rule that after every use, your child must put the iPad back on the charger to replenish the battery. Have a designated recharging spot, show your child how to insert the cord with care and check now and then that the iPad has been placed back there carefully. And be sure to have all household members do the same after using the iPad.

, Make homework and dinner times totally off limits (this means the same for you too, unless it's being used for the dinner recipe, which is a good excuse for getting it back from any other person using it). Also, immediately before bed may not be such a good idea unless you're reading a book to your child from the iPad (in which case, you're in control). A rousing game of Angry Birds while trying to head off to dreamland may wind your child up rather than soothe him or her to sleep.

, Whether it’s a hard and fast rule, or you want to be flexible with the amount of time your child spends on the iPad, make sure you always know how long he or she is using it. One easy way to keep track of usage is to set the kitchen timer. The minute it rings, your child has to stop iPad time. If you have more than one child wanting to use it, you'll find the timing aspect will come naturally, and each child will tend to police time usage without too much intervention from you. Always set a time by which the iPad must be back in its recharging spot, regardless of whether or not your child used his or her allotted time.


With so many electronic entertainment items in the house, from game consoles of all sizes, the TV and DVDs, to laptops and MP3 players, and now the iPad, your role as a parent is to ensure that your child isn't simply hopping from one electronic device onto another in succession. Be sure that reading, homework, outdoor play chores and other activities are also being attended to.

, If you find that a particular application is highly addictive and either mesmerizes your child or puts him or her in a foul mood, ban it from being used. Monitoring what types of apps are being used is also a smart decision in order to maintain a level of appropriateness.


Do not allow your child to download anything by way of apps or internet items. Make this a firm and fast rule. If it is breached, delete the offending item, no matter how many levels your child has managed to gain in the meantime. Even though some items are free, you need to be strict to avoid inappropriate content being downloaded. And when it isn't free, it's your iTunes account getting drained if you've preloaded money.

, Remember how much money that iPad cost? You had to earn the iPad and so should your child. Making him or her earn play time will increase the amount of respect the child has toward using it and also increases respect for you. Instead of just letting him or her use it at their whim, make your child earn it by doing chores, demonstrating kindness or excelling in school. If you want to allow him or her to use it on a regular basis, fine. But only let your child continue to use it as long as behavior, grades and chores (if applicable) are in check.

, Just like when you give the iPad, you can take it away. You can also use the iPad for negative reinforcement or as punishment for bad behavior or not listening. Let the child know that he or she may be reinstated with iPad privileges but only if the negative behavior/situation changes. Stand strong, even if he or she pitches the biggest fit. Don’t give in until you see positive changes.

, If you need the iPad back immediately, institute tough love. It’s your iPad and he or she must return it immediately. Stand over your child; tell him or her that game is finished and that you would like it back right now. If your child resists, you will have to forcefully remove it from his or her death grip. In turn, ban further usage until your child has had a chance to think over his or her rudeness toward you and has apologized.


Be careful when removing the iPad from the child’s clutches because if it falls on the floor, it could crack or break.
If you experience resistance consider not allowing your child to use the iPad again. He or she must understand that using it is a privilege, one that may not return if the child can’t treat it as such.

, If you find that one iPad just isn't going around everyone who wants to use it in the family, consider saving up for another one. You could get the lowest end one with the least bells and whistles that can just be used for games for the whole family. However, all the rules about time usage, care of the iPad, and not overdoing it as outlined above will continue to apply. Moreover, the iPad shouldn't be used as a substitute for genuine play and learning experiences in the real world.


It's not recommended to buy an iPad specifically for a child under school age. Your young child should be experiencing a huge range of sensory experiences that an iPad cannot provide. Toys and experiences should be varied and iPad usage should be minimal and preferably supervised.
If you can't afford, or simply don't want, to get another iPad, consider spending more shared time on the iPad, doing family games, teaching each other things and using apps that encourage pair or group interaction. Even if you can afford another iPad, your family bonding and shared knowledge is likely to benefit from this approach enormously.
Another good tip is if you can't afford an iPad and you want a second iPad for your child, get the second best thing which is an iPod Touch. An iPad and an iPod Touch do share the same features after all so your child probably won't mind getting an iPod Touch instead except that it is smaller in size.

Have an idea what its primary purpose will be.,
If you already have a smart device, (Android, Windows, iPhone), stick with that.,
Choose a price range that's right for you.,
Consider the storage you think you will need.",How to Get the Right Tablet the First Time," What kind of tablet do you want to invest or spend on? This can be a variety of answers. And don't be afraid to spend a little more than you bargain for; in the end, you will most likely enjoy your tablet... a lot.


Want to do work and play at the same time? Choose the iPad.
Need to design artwork, Photoshop? Choose the Wacom brand.
Want to use a stylus with your tablet? Just go to the electronics store.
Want to just play (games, books, shopping)? Choose the iPad.;
, That will make both of them much more useful., Never buy a tablet for over $1,000 if you just intend to spend less than a couple of hours on it.

, How much storage do you plan on using? In most cases, when the storage (example: 16GB) goes up then the price goes up about $150 every time it doubles. If you're planning on having a low storage, a 16GB (gigabyte) storage is fine. If you plan on using a whole lot of storage, such as playing games or just using it for a while, try 32GB to 64GB. Having anymore than that would just cost more money, and you're probably not going to use it all.

If a serious interference like heavy weather conditions or electrical repairs are occurring near you or the Time Warner Cable offices, the problem is probably being worked on already. In that case, customer support lines at Time Warner Cable are most likely packed and calling will not achieve much.

, Check that the “input” selection on the television is on the right setting and that the channel is set to three.

, If your cable is still not working properly, there may be interference. Interference can be caused by weather, heavy appliances running or even the actual local stations. Here are some basic signs that interference may be a problem:


If you see a snow effect, it may be a temporary broadcast problem. In that case, check the other channels. If they are also experiencing snow, then it may be interference that will simply go away on its own. If the problem persists for more than a day, contact Time Warner Cable.
If you see speckled bands across the picture, it may be the result of external interference like the weather or a heavy-duty appliance running near the cable box. Try turning off the cable box and seeing if that fixes the problem. If the problem persists for more than a day, contact Time Warner Cable.
If you see straight or wavy lines diagonally in picture, it could be either interference or a problem with the TV not the cable box. If the problem persists for more than a day, contact television repairman.
If you see ghosting or double images then you are probably on a local station, not a basic cable station. The problem can be solved with fine tuning or with the local station correcting the problem on it's end. If the problem persists for more than a day, contact television repairman.
If you see the picture pulling horizontally, try adjusting the ""horizontal hold"" setting. This may be the result of your box picking up too much signal. If the problem persists for more than a day, contact Time Warner Cable.
If you see the picture is rolling vertically, adjust the ""vertical hold"" setting. If the problem persists for more than a day, call your TV repair service.
If you see the picture is too large or too small for the screen, check the set adjustments on the television. If the problem persists for more than a day, call your TV repair service.

, If you have been unable to solve your cable problems on your own, it's time to bring in a professional. Especially if the problem is one of the following:


If you see no picture on a lit screen, avoid tampering with the television or cable box. The problem is not likely on your side of the connection or something that you can fix yourself. Contact Time Warner Cable.
If you see a picture but no sound on every channel, avoid tampering with the television or cable box. The problem is not likely on your side of the connection or something that you can fix yourself. Contact Time Warner Cable.
If you see no light on the screen with or without sound, avoid tampering with the television or cable box. The problem is not likely on your side of the connection or something that you can fix yourself. Contact Time Warner Cable.

You may be in charge of finding a service provider near you on your own. If so, check the SCRAM systems website for a list of their locations.;
, You'll have to schedule an appointment for your SCRAM device installation, typically within a brief period of time established by the court order governing your release or probation.Make sure to leave at least 30-45 minutes for your appointment. In addition to installing your device, the agent will meet with you and discuss the use of the device.
Review any information you received from the court or probation office regarding the SCRAM device.
You also may want to make a list of questions to ask the agent regarding the device.

, Typically you will need to bring a copy of your court or probation office documents ordering the SCRAM device, as well as a government-issued photo ID. The agent will let you know of any other documents you'll need to bring when you come to your appointment.Take a moment to write down any questions or concerns you may have about the SCRAM device so you can talk to the agent about them during your appointment.
There may be other devices, such as home monitoring devices, that you also must have installed.
If you have other devices, you also may need to make sure you've met the technological requirements for those devices to be installed.

, When the date and time comes for your appointment, make sure you arrive at the correct location at least a few minutes early. This isn't a situation where you need to dress to impress. Ideally, you should wear loose-fitting clothing so the SCRAM device can easily be fitted to your ankle.When you arrive for your appointment, you'll be introduced to the agent who will explain the procedures to you and set up your SCRAM device.
This agent is not associated with the court, but you still should be careful not to say anything about your case or anyone involved in your case.
Typically the agent will go through a brief, prepared statement of information, and may show you a video before answering any questions you have.
You usually will have to sign a participation agreement before the agent will install the device. This agreement goes through your responsibilities and any costs you may incur.
Keep in mind that typically you are associated with all costs necessary for monitoring and maintaining your device.

, Once you've signed the participation agreement and the basic procedures associated with the SCRAM device have been explained to you, the agent will fit the device on your ankle.The first time the device is fitted, don't expect it to be comfortable. The device will be heavy, and will take some getting used to.
However, the device should not hurt. Walk around the room a little, and let the agent know if the device is pinching or chafing your skin so it can be adjusted before you leave.
The device should be able to comfortably move around your ankle. If your ankle swells or it otherwise becomes painful, call the agent for an appointment to have it adjusted – do not attempt to adjust it on your own.
You also should avoid putting anything between your skin and the bracelet. If it irritates your skin, the solution is to have it adjusted, not to put bandages or cloth between the bracelet and your skin.

, Before you come home wearing the bracelet, you need to remove or separate everything that contains alcohol so you won't accidentally use it. Even the smallest amount of alcohol can trigger an alarm.Pay close attention to personal care products such as shampoo and lotion, as well as cleaning products – they almost all contain alcohol.
If there are other people living in the home, they can continue to use these products, but you should separate them to make sure you don't accidentally use them.
Check through drinks and prepared foods as well to make sure no form of alcohol is listed as an ingredient.

, Many personal care products such as toothpaste, mouthwash, body wash, deodorant, and shampoo contain alcohol. If you use these products, you'll trip an alarm on your SCRAM device.Some products, such as mouth wash and antibacterial gel, you should just avoid entirely. Even those that claim to be alcohol-free may still contain trace amounts that could cause an alert from your SCRAM device.
All-natural or organic products typically are alcohol-free. Check the ingredient list anyway to confirm there are no types of alcohol included, even in trace amounts.
You also should be careful about over-the-counter cold medicines, many of which contain alcohol.
You may be able to get a list from the court, your probation officer, or the SCRAM device agent that includes products that are truly alcohol-free and common household and personal care products you should avoid.

, In addition to things you ingest or put on your body, there are a number of cleaning products and other things used around your home that may contain alcohol.In many cases you wouldn't have to worry about exposure producing a SCRAM alert, but you should at least be aware of products with alcohol in them.
This doesn't mean you have an excuse not to do any cleaning while you're wearing the SCRAM device.
But if you're cleaning with products that include alcohol, wear rubber gloves and take care not to get any of the cleaner on or near your skin.
You do want to avoid being around things, such as newly painted walls, that could emit fumes that include alcohol.
Avoid being around people cooking in alcohol, or eating any foods that were cooked in alcohol.

, Natural and organic products can be relatively expensive. If you can't afford them, there are plenty of alcohol-free alternatives you can find that will allow you to maintain your personal care regimen without breaking the bank.Particularly if you are going to have to wear the SCRAM device for an extended period of time, you may not be able to afford to switch solely to all those organic and all-natural products.
Additionally, unless you live in a larger city, you may not have easy access to many of those products. Ordering them online is an alternative, but you'll have to order in advance and pay additional shipping fees.
However, there are various products that are alcohol-free that you can use instead. For example, coconut oil is inexpensive and freely available, and can replace any moisturizers or lotions you used that previously contained alcohol.
Olive oil works too, provided you don't mind smelling like a salad.
Check also for personal care products intended for babies. Baby shampoos and lotions are alcohol-free and will be cheaper than adult alternatives from organic or all-natural companies.

, While you can take a shower with the device on, you won't be able to take a bath or go swimming while wearing it. Doing so will set off an alarm that you are attempting to tamper with the device.If you decide you want to take a bath, position yourself so that the ankle with the SCRAM device is out of the tub, as though you were wearing a cast. You may need someone's assistance getting into and out of the tub.
If you are doing intense exercise, you may want to consider covering the device with a sweat band.
This not only keeps the device dry but also keeps it from moving around on your ankle, which can cause chafing on your skin.
Avoid putting anything between the SCRAM device and your skin. This will trigger an alert that you're tampering with the device.

, In most circumstances, such as if you're going through security at a courthouse or an airport, there will be no reason to have your SCRAM device removed.However, if you are getting an MRI, X-Ray, or CT scan, you won't be able to wear your SCRAM device at all. It will have to be removed the day of the procedure, and then put back on.
To have the SCRAM device temporarily removed for a medical procedure, you typically must file a motion in court and explain your reasons to the judge.

, As a criminal defendant, you are entitled to an attorney. If you were ordered to wear the SCRAM device as a condition of pretrial release, your defense attorney may be able to get it removed.If you had a public defender and were ordered to wear a SCRAM device as a condition of your probation, that attorney usually will be unable to help you with a post-conviction motion. You'll have to find a private criminal defense attorney.
While you can file the motion on your own, hiring an attorney probably is in your best interest.
An experienced criminal defense attorney who is familiar with the judges will know which arguments will work and which won't.
He or she can help you craft an argument most likely to result in an early removal of your SCRAM device.

, To get your SCRAM device removed early, you must ask the judge for permission to do so and explain your reasons. This is done through a motion. Your attorney will get information from you regarding your life while wearing the SCRAM device, and other evidence that can be used to build your argument.Your motion often will include information about your background, particularly if you have no criminal record or problems with alcohol.
Essentially, the argument is that the SCRAM device is overkill because you don't have problems abusing alcohol.
The motion also may point out various aspects of your life that are made more difficult as a result of having to wear the SCRAM device.
If you're on probation, your attorney may want to speak to your probation officer. Your motion is more likely to be approved by the judge if your probation officer supports it.

, Once your motion is complete, it must be filed with the clerk of the court that originally ordered you to wear the SCRAM device. Typically, your attorney will take care of the filing process for you.The court will charge a filing fee, typically around $100 or less. If you have an attorney, they typically will pay this fee and add it to your court costs for the proceeding.
When your motion is filed, the clerk will set a date for the court hearing on the motion. Make sure you're available to attend this hearing, as your attorney probably will want you to testify.
The filed motion also must be served on the prosecutor in your case. If you are on probation, the motion typically must be served on your probation officer.
In some jurisdictions, you may have to serve the alleged victim in situations where you were charged or convicted of domestic violence.

, The judge will hold a hearing to decide whether to grant your motion and remove the SCRAM device early. In addition to hearing your arguments, the judge also will hear from any parties, such as the prosecuting attorney, who oppose early removal of your SCRAM device.The judge will be more likely to grant your motion if you have no prior record, and haven't had any prior issues involving alcohol.
You also tend to have a stronger case if you've been wearing the SCRAM device for awhile and there have been no alarms, including false positives.
This indicates that you've been following the rules. A lack of problems in your past tends to show that you will continue to follow the rules.
The judge will hear from prosecutors, or your probation officer, to find out whether they oppose your motion.
Keep in mind that if your motion faces strong opposition, the judge isn't likely to grant it.

, If the judge grants your motion, you typically must make an appointment with the service provider who set up your SCRAM device to have it officially deactivated and removed by an agent.When you arrive at your appointment to remove the device, you must bring government-issued photo ID as well as the judge's order granting your motion.
After the device is removed, you still should avoid drinking alcohol or appearing in places such as bars that serve alcohol.
If the judge denies your motion, there's not much you can do. Motions typically cannot be appealed.
However, if you're on probation, you may be able to file another motion later on. Provided you continue to follow the terms and conditions of your probation, the judge may agree to remove the SCRAM device later.

Check the obvious places.,
Try looking in hidden places.,
Think about where you've been.,
Bang on the bed covers.",How to Find a Lost Television Remote1," There's a good chance that you lost the remote in the room where you watch television. Many people tend to leave their remote near the television set, or near where they sit when they're watching T.V. It is very common to lose a remote in the couch., Check underneath books, magazines, blankets, and coats – anything that might be resting on top of the remote. Check between the cushions of couches and chairs. Look underneath and behind furniture.


Check beside the kettle, the shelf in the hall, the bathroom cabinet, and anywhere else you might have brought it with you.

, Perhaps you carried the remote out of the room, set it down while your mind was on something else, and accidentally left the remote in a strange place. Consider whether you might have left the remote somewhere en route to the bathroom, your bedroom, the kitchen, or the front door.


Check the fridge. If you had something to eat or drink during the past few hours, you might have left the remote in the fridge while grabbing your food.
Maybe you took a phone call recently, while you were watching television, and you set the remote down while you were on the phone. Perhaps you answered the door during your favorite show, carried the remote out of the room, and set it down in your entryway.

, This is useful if you watch TV in bed. The remote will often get buried under the sheets or covers and the best way to find it is to just run your hands along the bedspread until you feel something boxlike in shape. If this does not work, look under the bed, and then check the area at the foot of the bed.

Consider applying for a ""monthly payment plan"".,
If you qualify for finance, negotiate a payment plan.,
Weigh up your options and decide on what suits you best.",How to Get a Loan to Buy a Television1," Finance in the form of a loan, such as a personal loan or a loan that's processed by the seller of the TV (big, popular stores usually do this). Approach the staff in the store, and ask if they have finance options. Note that you may need to have a steady income (job, money coming in) to qualify for finance.;
, Most payments can occur monthly or weekly. Pay attention to the interest rate, do some research and compare personal loans of the same value with the finance offered by the store. You might find a better interest rate somewhere else, for the same loan amount. This means you pay less in the long run, and can reduce for monthly payments.

, Double check the terms for the finance, make sure you can meet them, and take your TV home!

"
"
Ask other members of your household.,
Find out if anyone has taken it.,
Get help.",How to Find a Lost Television Remote2," If anyone else has used the remote recently, he or she might be able to give you a lead as to its location. Perhaps this person placed the remote in a spot where you don't normally leave it. Perhaps he or she absentmindedly left the device in a part of the house that you do not often visit. Even if you don't find the remote right away, asking someone else can help you decide where not to look.

, Your teenager might have brought the remote to his or her room and forgotten to bring it back. Your toddler might have hidden the remote as a prank. Your dog might have carried the device off to chew on it! Think about who might have done such a thing, and why.


Check the kid's toy box. You never know when your son or daughter might have taken off with the remote!

, You don't need to find the remote alone! Ask your friends or family members to help you look for the missing device. It might help if you can give them an engaging reason to find the remote. If you find the remote, then you can all watch a movie together, or you can catch the program that's coming on in twenty minutes.

Be more mindful about your remote.,
Try designating a specific place to put the remote.,
Make the remote more visible.,
Consider buying a universal remote.These devices work with most brands of television, and they will free you from the need to keep a small fleet of easy-to-confuse remotes.,
Attach a GPS tracker to your remote.",How to Find a Lost Television Remote3," If you keep a closer eye on your remote in the future, you may be less likely to lose it. Try to be engaged and aware each time that you set your remote down. Take a mental snapshot of the device so that you remember where it is.

, Don't ever put the remote anywhere other than this place. It might be the coffee table, or next to the television, or in a dedicated ""remote control holder"" that is attached to your couch or table.


If you regularly lose the remote, consider buying a remote control holder so that you have a set place to put it.
Apply a Velcro strip to the back of the remote, then attach the matching ""opposite"" Velcro strip to the TV. Keep the remote firmly attached to the Velcro strip on the TV when not in use.

, Attach a strip of brightly-colored tape, or a reflector, or a long, fuzzy tail. Tie a ribbon to the device, or give it wings, or glue plastic legs onto it. Add anything that you think will make it easier for you to notice and remember your remote! Try not to add anything that will impair the function of the device.

, It's easy to find yourself using separate remotes for your television, your DVD player, your sound system, and other devices. You may find that it is easier to keep track of one remote than it is to keep track of, say, four.

, Several companies now sell small, relatively inexpensive tracking devices that link up to a smartphone app.Clip the tracker to your television remote in case you ever lose it again. You can set your smartphone to beep when the remote is close. Some apps will even try to find your remote when it is far from you."

Learn a new skill.",How to Ditch Cable," If you have decided that you want to give up cable TV at your house, you’ll first need to contact your cable provider. Let them know when your services are to be shut off and ask them what the procedure is for canceling.It’s likely that you signed a contract for a specific length of time when you initially began your cable services. Be sure to ask if there is a cancelation fee.;
, If you plan on replacing your cable television service with some kind of streaming device, you’ll need to make sure that you keep your internet service. It’s possible that your internet and cable services are bundled together on the same bill. Make sure you only cancel the cable, but keep the internet.

Check with your cable provider about exactly what products you want to cancel before they disconnect the service.

, You most likely have some equipment that belongs to the cable company – various cable boxes – that you’ll need to return. When you call to cancel your services, ask the customer care agent what you need to do about the cable equipment you have. Follow their instructions for returning the equipment. Usually you can either drop it off at the cable office in person or mail it back to them with a prepaid shipping label.If you don’t return this equipment, the cable company may stick you with a hefty bill to cover the price of the boxes.

, Be sure to watch the mail for your final cable bill. It should come a month or two after you canceled your services. Read the bill carefully to make sure that they didn’t inadvertently charge you for the equipment you already returned.If you don’t pay your final bill, the cable company may send it to a collection agency, which could negatively impact your credit score.

, If you want to watch television programs on your TV without paying for cable, you’ll need to purchase a streaming device that connects your television to the internet (either wirelessly via wifi, or by connecting a hard-wired cable). These devices allow you to access streaming content and watch it on your television.Some of the most popular streaming devices include Roku, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV.
Many smart TVs come pre-programmed with, or have the capability to download, the streaming apps directly to the TV. In this case, you won’t need an additional streaming device.

, If you already have a gaming device, check to see if it has the capability to stream online content (in addition to games). If you don’t have a gaming console, consider purchasing one for the multifunctional use of streaming and gaming.The two most popular gaming consoles that offer streaming capabilities are the Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One.

, Once you have your streaming device, you need to get some streaming services. Most of these services charge a monthly or yearly fee (usually still cheaper than your cable TV bill), but there are also some free services available.Some of the most popular streaming services include Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Now., There are quite a few options for finding online content through various websites or apps. YouTube is a great place to find many of your favorite TV shows online. They may be broken up into segments, but you can still access them online for free.Additionally, many cable networks offer episodes of their programs on their official websites.

, Television can often distract us from dedicating time to reading books, despite the fact that reading usually feels more productive and satisfying than watching TV. Choose some books you’ve been meaning to read, or find some newly released books and start reading a little bit each day. Devote some of the time you used to spend watching television to reading.Try checking out books from the library. Or get a Kindle device that can store a large amount of books in its internal memory.
Reading is actually good for you – it increases brain connectivity and memory abilities. But watching television has been shown to decrease verbal reasoning skills.

, If you want to ditch the cable, try shifting the focus of your free time to more outdoor activities. This will get you out of the house, away from the television, and will help you miss the cable programs less. If you sit around at home as you normally would while watching the TV, you will feel its absence much more distinctly.Try taking your dog for a walk or riding your bike to a friend’s house. Consider playing with your children at a nearby park or driving to the beach to spend a day in the sun.

, Instead of watching television programs at home, try reaching out to your friends and family more often. This is a great way to fill up the time you used to spend watching television.Invite your friends over for dinner or take a weekend holiday away with your family. Buy concert tickets for a night out with your best friends, or have a board game night with your neighbors.

, With all of this extra time on your hands, you could invest some in learning a new skill or hobby. These kinds of things will enrich your life and make you miss the television less.Take a painting class or learn how to play an instrument. Start jogging or join a group sports team.

Approach the subject nicely and see if they can loan you some money. It could be the whole amount, or half, whatever you can negotiate for.

, This may include interest on the loan, repayment frequency (monthly) in your case. Ensure that you have the appropriate funds to pay them, otherwise you and your friend/family member can lose a lot of money!

, A good method is to set up a regular or automated transfer with a certain amount of money, to occur at a set time every month. This can be done with most bank accounts online.


It's a good idea to write down a miniature contract, so everybody is clear on the terms and has a record of it. Something like ""Fred has agreed me to loan $3000. Repayments are to be paid monthly for 12 months, with each repayment consisting of $250, with no interest (0%). Fred ________ (Signature there) and I, Timmy _________ (signature there) both agree to these terms.""
The above mini contract is just an idea, it can be useful if one of you forgets the details, and may even be legally enforceable, depending on your local laws.

, Just don't forget to make your monthly payments!

, There are two ways to connect a VCR: With A/V cords (yellow, red, and white cords) or with coaxial cables. You can use either or both.

, Patch from Line Out of the first device to Line In in the next. Always go from outputs to inputs. Work with 3 cords at a time: yellow to yellow, red to red, white to white. The cords are physically the same. The colors help you stay organized. If there is no red port on one of the devices, that means that that it is not a stereo device. Leave off the red cord but understand that everything downstream from there will be mono instead of stereo.

, Start with the first VCR in the sequence. Plug one end into the 'OUT' or 'OUT TO TV' port. Then plug the other end to the 'IN' port on the next VCR or TV. This ""OUT to IN"" principle can be carried through to all the connections in your daisy chain loop. On the TV, this connector might be called Antenna In or RF.

, If the input is from AV cords, set the device input to VIDEO IN or LINE IN (or tune in to L1) . If you are using coaxial cables for the input, tune in to either channel 3 or 4 (see tips below). If you have used both kinds of connections, it is better to default to the A/V cords or ""Line In"".

Compression connectors provide the best connection and finish to your cable. The second-best type of connectors are ""crimp"" connectors. Avoid push-on or twist connectors.
Compression/crimping tool - Make sure it is compatible with the compression/crimping connector.
Coax cable stripper tool
Cable cutters
Connector installation tool - This tool is used for pushing the connector firmly onto the stripped cable.;
, Use your cutting tool to make a straight cut at the end of the cable. After cutting, use your fingers to form the end of a cable back into a circle.

, Most coaxial strippers can be adjusted to strip dual-shielded or quad-shielded coaxial cables. Use the included Allen wrench to adjust the stripper. If you don't adjust the stripper properly, you may strip the ground wire, damaging the cable.


The most common cable is RG-6, either quad- or dual-shielded. Make sure that the stripper is configured for RG-6 coaxial cable, and not another cable size such as Ethernet cable.
If your stripper is set to dual-shielding, but you try to strip a quad-shielded cable, not all of the shielding will be removed.

, Place the end of the coax cable into the stripper so that the end of the cable is flush with the far end of the stripper. Clamp the stripper down on the cable and spin it around the cable two to three times.


You can tell when the stripper is finished when you don't feel resistance anymore when spinning.
Don't pull the stripper off when finished. Unlatch it and open it to remove the cable.

, After stripping the cable, you should see two segment cuts. Pull the outermost segment off of the cable. This should reveal the center conductor wire.

, This will reveal the foil that insulates the cable. Find the edge of the foil and peel it off the cable. This should leave a single layer of foil around the white insulation.

, When you pull off the cable jacket, you will see a lot of loose ground wires. Fold these back against the cable so that the connector will be touching all of the wires when installed. None of the wires should be blocking the white insulation.

, Most cable stripper tools will leave the correct length of conductor wire exposed, but it doesn't hurt to double check before proceeding. The exposed connector cable should be 3.9 mm (.156 inches) in length.

, Use a pusher tool to firmly push the connector onto the cable until the white insulation is flush with the connector.


Make sure you avoid bending the bare conductor wire when installing the connector.
You may need to twist the cable while pushing with the tool to get it firmly connected.

, The process for compressing or crimping the connector varies depending on the type of connector you are using. Some require you to press down on the cable-end of the connector piece, while others require you to push the front and end of the connector piece into each other.


Squeeze the compression or crimping tool firmly. Most tools won't allow you to over-compress, but some can cause damage to the cable and connector if compressed too much.

, After you have finished compressing the connector, inspect it for any stray wires or loose connections. These can lead to a bad signal or nonfunctional cable.

Be sure to be using suitable equipment.,
Be sure to set the speakers in the right location.,Set the microphone on the podium so it will be at generally the correct height, and is securely held

,
Run the microphone cable to the PA system, and be sure to tape down the cables so that no-one trips over them!

,
Test the system with an assistant speaking into the microphone.

,
Be wary of any kind of echo or howling sounds as you turn up the volume.",How to Set Up a PA System," If renting the PA system, take a look at the components to make sure they are in decent condition. While you may not be able to fully test the system quickly, you will be able to notice broken speaker stands and things that can be a concern.;
, The speakers should be in front of, and never behind, the microphones, to avoid feedback.

,,,, The characteristics of these sounds can change once the room is full of people.


Be sure to have adequate volume before the event starts, and adjust the location of your speakers before the event starts.
Moving the speakers even just a few inches further forward can eliminate the threat of feedback. But remember, once the event starts, it's going to be impossible to do any more testing or move the speakers. Do it in advance.

Finish your cell phone conversations before entering the line or at least ask the person you're talking to hold on while you conduct your transaction.,

Eliminate any background noise.,

If it is raining, please turn off your windshield wipers before you get to the service window.,

Turn off headlights at night.,

Know what you want before you get to the speaker box.,

Speak loudly and clearly.,
Make sure that the order-taker understands your order.,

Be aware that you can order condiments at the speaker box.,

As much as possible, avoid ordering three to five items, only to then go back and change the first item.,

Extinguish all forms of smoking before you reach the window.,

Be prepared with your payment.,

Treat the line like an ATM machine.,

Prepare cup holders, and other holding areas in your car before you get to the pick-up window.",How to Practice Drive Thru Etiquette," If you're calling home to see if anyone wants something, do so before entering the drive-thru lane. Trying to gather everyone's order by phone as you're actively ordering creates a delay for you the customer as well as everyone in line behind you.
, Either turn down the volume or turn off any radios or CDs that are blaring noise. Excess noise may interfere with hearing the order. The employees need to hear the actual order, not what you are listening to in your car. If the restaurant has a drive-thru speaker behind the counter for the food line, people ordering inside can hear everything that happens around the service speaker. This includes the conversations held by other people in the car.(Yes! They can even hear you yell at or spank your children... it is very awkward!) Also, if you have a loud engine, it is advised to turn it off as well., Not doing so results in your wipers spraying dirty water, anti-freeze leftovers and grime on the service person., The last thing someone in a drive-thru needs is blazing headlights in their mirrors. Parking lights are acceptable. The only exception to this rule is if the area is not lit. You may turn the headlights back on if there is no one in front of you or when exiting the line., It's polite to know what you're going to have before you come to the speaker. Pondering and thinking at the speaker wastes the employees' time, as well as the time of the people in the back of you. Note that some places may have breakfast and lunch items on the same board, but will stop breakfast at a certain time (usually around 10:30 to 11 am). Some boards may have ""express"" items, or a limited amount, whereas a full menu can be accessible inside the restaurant., Speak loudly, slowly and clearly but not so slow that you cause the employee to feel like a child and not so loud that you're screaming at the employee taking your order. You'll always want the food line to know exactly what you want, so if there is any miscommunication or if something is wrong with your order, you may need to go into the restaurant to change it. Have one person talk into the speaker instead of people shouting out their orders from the vehicle. Finally, be sure to verify each item or meal before leaving the speaker., Cashiers at fast food restaurants have multiple duties and may not be giving you their full attention, they might also be speaking with a customer at the service window, or putting equipment away, etc. If you read out your full order in a single breath, it will probably be misunderstood. Take small pauses after different items (number one combo...with no pickles and extra mayo) and wait for the cashier to respond (""ok"", ""yes"", etc) before continuing., Don't be afraid to tell the order taker to add ketchup, mayonnaise, extra sauces, salt or pepper, and so forth at lunchtime, or jelly, butter, creamer and sugar, and so forth at breakfast to your bag. For the most part, it's free!

Note that some places charge for extra sauce. You can try to be slick and ask for it at the window but most places see that food cost slipping away and will charge you at the window.
Realize that asking for extras slows down the line. Patience is a virtue not much found in fast food lines.

, The order taking system is so high-tech that many restaurants with drive-thru service have the grill-staff wearing the same headsets as the order-takers so that they can hear and begin preparing your order as soon as you say ""cheeseburger."" So, if you order anything after said cheeseburger, then go back and say, ""Oh, can I have that first cheeseburger with no onions"", the grill team now has to make another cheeseburger for you, wasting your time and the customers behind you, and wasting food.

Reminder: By doing this, it means now you have an audience of at least 4-8 people listening to you screaming at your child for making changes––how awkward.




 ""Can I add a #4 large with a chocolate shake....I'm sorry my wife just called and asked me to get her something, too""

Do not add to or change your order at the window. As stated earlier, to speed up service, employees begin making the food as you're ordering it. If you change your order at the window, the grill team can't hear it and now they must stop making the next person's order and fix what you changed to not slow down the drive-thru. If your change is a big one (for example, completely re-making an item because you decided you wanted to take something off or substitute, or you added more items), chances are they will ask you to park aside and bring you the changed or added items so you don't slow down the rest of the line more than necessary. That's your time being wasted then but it's only fair since you've made major ordering revisions.

, Fewer people smoke nowadays and in many places, smoking is not allowed on food premises at all. Therefore, not everyone wants to smell your tobacco or marijuana products when they open the drive-thru window, nor do they want your smoke in their face. Remember, this is a window and when it opens, the wind carries the smell throughout the service area of the restaurant. The employee at the window isn't the only one who gets bombarded with it., Organizing your payment method should be carried out before driving into the line. Trying to search for and dish out change from the deepest crevices of your car seat at the last minute may hold up the line and people's orders. Worse for you, you mightn't have enough to pay!, Leave a good space between you and the car in front of you. Have respect for those around you and move forward when they do., Waiting for the customer to move things around while the employee is holding the bag or drinks out the window also creates a delay for the entire line of customers.

If your car is like your second basement, the need to create space for the food should be a paramount concern before you get in the queue to order.

The First Principle: It is not other people's responsibility to cope with your mobile phone use; it is your responsibility to use your mobile phone inoffensively.,
Following directly from the First Principle: You should assume that someone who asks you to turn your cell phone (or audio player) down or off is in good faith, and you should comply in good faith.,
Stay away from others while talking on the phone.,
Try not to talk on the phone in any enclosed spaces, even if you're more than 10 feet away from anyone.,
Don't talk too loudly.,
Don't put your phone on speaker.,
Do not talk about personal details in public.,
Don't multi-task.,
Know where not to use your phone.,
Don't use your phone when having a meal with someone.,
Turn off your phone at the movie theater.,
Learn to text.",How to Practice Cell Phone Etiquette," Please note that ""inoffensively"" is not defined by what you expect others to tolerate, but by what others do in fact find offensive. Ignore this principle, and you are sure to be rude.;
, They have a reason for asking, and it's probably not that they're trying to dominate you or hassle you or restrict your God-given right to free expression. (For example, people with temporal lobe epilepsy may find that certain sounds trigger seizures, and some people have neurosensory issues that cause extraneous noise to be a severe difficulty rather than a mild annoyance.)

, If possible, keep a 10-foot (3 meter) distance between you and anyone else whenever you talk on your phone. Most people do not want to hear what you're talking about.

, They can still hear you (because it's an enclosed space) and usually, they're forced to just sit there and listen (and maybe be annoyed to some extent).

, Generally you don't have to shout in the microphone to be heard on the other end. In fact, doing so often makes it harder for you to be understood. In addition, shouting on the phone disrupts people around you.

, Just as many people do not want to hear your end of the conversation, they don't want to hear the other person's either.

, Personal is just that: personal. If callers want to talk about personal details, tell them that you will call them back later, move someplace where you can have a little privacy, or switch to text messaging.

, Avoid making calls while driving, shopping, banking, waiting in line, or doing almost anything that involves interacting with other human beings. In some situations it puts your life and the lives of others in danger, and in other situations it can bother some people.

, Some places are inappropriate for cell phone usage, so avoid talking on your cell phone or having it ring while in the following places:


Bathrooms
Elevators
Hospitals
Waiting rooms
Restaurants
Auditoriums
Taxicabs
Buses
Trains
Meetings
Libraries
Museums
Places of worship
School
Lectures
Live performances
Funerals
Weddings
Movie theaters
While visiting relatives
Turn your phone off at any time that you are asked to when on a plane.

Or, in fact, anywhere else where people are likely to be disturbed, unless it is important and you can't go anywhere.



, Ideally, you should turn it off entirely. If you're anticipating an important call, let the person you're with know beforehand that you're expecting a call that you'll need to take. No matter what, don't hold a conversation at the table; step away, follow step 1, and don't stay away any longer than you would for a bathroom break. Never text at the table, even if the face-to-face conversation dies down. It will be seen as disrespectful.

, Even if your phone is on vibrate, people can hear it during quiet parts of the movie. The light from your phone's screen is also very distracting. Don't check the time, don't check your text messages; just turn it off until the movie is over. If you get an important call that you must answer, exit the theatre before taking it.

, When you're in an enclosed space, or you can't put yourself 10 feet out of everyone's way, it's inappropriate to talk but it's potentially acceptable to receive and send text messages. In such cases, keep the following rules of texting etiquette in mind:


Use the vibrate feature instead of an audible text alert.
Only text when you're standing still or sitting and out of anyone's way. Don't text while you walk or drive.
Don't text while doing anything that requires you to be attentive, such as waiting at an intersection for the pedestrian signal.
Don't text while at a meeting or conference. You should give the speaker your undivided attention.
Limit phone use during gatherings with your friends. Some friends (with or without cell phones) will find it annoying and inconsiderate.
Avoid sending others text messages containing anything that you would not say in real life. It is very hard to convey tones and sarcasm in texting and email, so realize that some things may come across as sounding unusual or even offensive. Never send a message with sexual overtones, or one that could be construed as a threat.

Carry your bag in front of you and low to the ground as you walk down the aisle in search of your seat.,
Utilize the overhead space above your own seat row.,
Avoid hogging the aisle.,
Take care when retrieving luggage from the overhead compartment!,
Keep your chair upright at least until you're told it can be reclined.,
Check behind you—is that person tall, or do they have a child on their lap?,
If you're a tall/big person or have a child on your lap and know that having the seat in front of you reclined will make you uncomfortable, choose a bulkhead or exit row seat (unless you have a child, in which case you should never choose an exit row seat).,
If you are traveling with one or more children, keep a close eye on them.,
If another passenger breaches etiquette by, for example, constantly thumping or yanking your seat back, and refuses your polite request not to do so, don't get any further involved.,
Avoid grabbing the back of the seat in front of you.,
No matter how much you love to make new friends on the plane, the person next to you might rather get some work done, or simply may not feel like being chatty.,
If you want to watch a movie on your personal DVD player, keep in mind your screen is visible to those behind you.,
Watch your elbows.,
Keep your stuff close.,
Get your own reading material—don't read theirs.,
Pack headphones for any portable electronics, especially games and DVD players.,
Don't get drunk during (or before) the flight.,
Be considerate of other passengers when you exit the plane.,If you know you'll need a connecting flight, think ahead and book your flight early so you can get a seat up front and exit quickly.,
Get up to use the lavatory or to walk around only when necessary.,
When you get up, don't yank on the seat in front of you for support; use the seat armrests.",How to Practice Airplane Etiquette," Holding it up and at your sides will inevitably knock seated passengers on their arms, shoulders, and heads. You can pull it along if it has wheels.
, Do not place your bags in the overhead at the front of the plane unless you are sitting in that row. Don't put your bag in a bin near the front of the plane for a quick exit -- it means someone else will have to wait until the entire plane has emptied to walk back to get their bag. Taking the storage space of other passengers is rude and can potentially delay departure as they search for storage., Remember that space is limited on board. Always be swift and alert while putting things in the overhead lockers, as other people need the aisle space to get around you and to their seat. Place the items that you will frequently use in your seat back pocket or under the seat in front of you.

, It may be positioned to fall on you or someone else. If you have a lot of bulky, heavy luggage in the overhead bin, wait until others have left before standing and blocking other people from leaving the plane (they may have another flight to get to), or ask somebody to help you get your luggage down while everybody is waiting to leave the plane. This will help with traffic flow and allows all passengers to leave the plane as fast as possible., Don't lean your chair back as soon as you get on. When you do recline your chair, do it slowly. Otherwise, you risk bumping the head of the unsuspecting passenger behind you who's getting something from the bag at her feet, or you could knock over the drink on his or her tray. Remember to return the seat back to the upright position during meal and drink servings, or if possible, wait until food and beverages are finished being served and cleaned up., If so, consider keeping your seat upright out of consideration, especially if it's a short flight. By reclining, you're taking space away from the passenger behind you; you may be more comfortable, but at someone else's expense. You can also ask them if reclining your seat would be all right. If you're someone who can't make yourself comfortable without reclining, then do your best to choose an aisle, bulkhead, or exit row seat when booking the flight so the person behind you has extra space., Not only will you have more space, but the person in front of you will also have more space and may decide not to recline their seat out of consideration for you. If you sit in the middle, however, the person in front of you is cramped, as well, and will probably want to recline their seat, whether you like it or not.

, Children have a tendency to bump, kick, or yank the seat in front of them without realizing it throughout the flight, which can make the person in front of them very uncomfortable. It's difficult enough to control some children on a long flight, but it's even more difficult to deal with an angry passenger in front of you.

If your child(ren) has difficulty flying, do everything you can to relax the child so you do not disturb other passengers near by. Bring plenty of books, games, snacks and other things to keep your child quietly occupied.
You can also try walking to the galley area of the plane to stretch your child's legs.
Change diapers in the restroom on the plane. In most restrooms there are changing tables and trash bins for diaper disposal.
When breastfeeding, use a drape, both for your own privacy and for the comfort of other passengers.

, Ask a flight attendant to handle the situation, and if they can't or even won't (this does happen), ask politely but insistently for the chief flight attendant (purser) to handle it., Grabbing the seat back as you walk in the aisle or in your row can be unpleasantly jarring to the person sitting in it. Copy the flight attendants who balance themselves in the aisle by grabbing the luggage compartments above their heads, rather than the seat backs., If a friendly comment gets a minimal answer, take the hint and leave them be. If you're traveling with children, try to avoid letting them think of passengers as playmates. Some passengers will smile to be polite, but may not be interested in playing ""peek a boo"" with the child., If your movie has nudity, graphic violence, etc. it may offend the more sensitive viewers (e.g. children) looking on. Using a smaller, handheld device to view movies, such as on an iPod Touch, may be more practical in this situation., If you're reading a newspaper or using a laptop, try not to let your elbows ""spill over"" onto someone else's personal space. Do your best not to hog the arm rests, especially if the person next to you is in the middle and has limited space to begin with.

Make use of your own arm rest and headphone plug outlet. Don't use someone else's because it's more convenient for you.

, If you put a bag or a jacket at your feet, don't let it spill over onto the legs or feet of the person sitting next to you., They'll notice, and it's nosy and rude.

If you're stuck in an aisle seat but still want to enjoy the view, don't lean over the person next to you to look out the window.

, Hearing someone else's music and sounds can be very irritating., You may be having the time of your life, but your fellow passengers may not think so (there are airlines which don't allow any passengers on board suspected of being over the limit on alcohol consumption)., Resist the urge to push your way out first; let those nearest the exit disembark the plane first. When your turn comes, move quickly so people with connecting flights can make it in time.

,, Go through your carry-on luggage at intervals. If you need something, think ahead and retrieve items you might need later on during the flight., If you want to get up but there is one or more passengers between you and the aisle, politely request that they get up to let you pass. Don't try to clamber over them; apart from the discomfort this will inevitably cause, you might injure yourself/them if you lose your balance and fall."

Clean your records.",How to Start a Record Player," For a record player to work properly, it needs to sit on a flat surface and be completely level.You will need a level with a bubble vial in the middle. Put the level on the table or shelf where you want the record player to sit. Adjust the furniture until the bubble appears in the middle of the vial. Once you see the bubble stay in the middle of the bubble vial, the surface is level.If the table, shelf or other surface is not completely level, you will never get the machine to work properly.You may need to put some wood shims underneath the furniture in order to get it level.;
, You should find a diagram of your record player in the owner’s manual. Learn the different parts of your record player:Start/Stop button or knob, which you need to press to get your record playing or stopping.
Cueing lever, which allows you to raise or lower the tone arm.
Speed selector, which allows you to select either 33 or 45 revolutions per minute, depending on the speed indicated on your vinyl record.
Record size selector on automatic record players. This selector allows you to choose whether you want to play a 12 or a 7-inch vinyl record.
Tone arm and cartridge, which reads the music from the grooves on the vinyl record.

, The record player guide or owner’s manual should include specifications for the correct tracking weight. You should see a counter-weight at the back of the tone arm. Turn the counter-weight until it aligns with the tracking weight recommended in your owners manual.Finally, set the gauge to 0.

For instance, if the manufacturer recommends 1.5 grams, you should adjust the counter-weight to 1.5 grams., The record player requires electricity, so you will need to plug it into a secure outlet., Place the palm of your right hand under the opening of the sleeve. Turn the sleeve upside down and let the record slide out onto your open palm. When you see the hole in the middle of the record, put a finger inside. Then, hold the record on the sides.Be careful not to hold onto the flat surface of the record, since it will get dirty and wear out faster.

, Put the record on the platter of your record player, with the hole in the middle of the record aligned with the pin in the middle of the platter., On the middle of your record, you should see the speed indicated. Typically, a twelve inch record will play at 33 1/3rd revolutions per minute and a seven inch record will play at 45 revolutions per minute.After determining the correct speed for the record, make sure your record player is adjusted for this speed by clicking the speed selector button.Some 12 inch vinyl records play at 45 revolutions per minute.
To adjust the speed on some manual players, you may have to take off the platter. Then, move the belt to the appropriate groove for either 33 1/3rd or 45 revolutions per minute. The appropriate groove should be indicated in your owner’s manual.

, For a manual turntable, you will need to press play and then press the cueing lever for the tone arm. The record should start spinning and the tone arm should rise., Move the tone arm over to the side of the record. Look over the top of the record player to align the tone arm with the outside of the record so that it can fall down into the first groove on the record., Once the tone arm is aligned with the record, press the cueing lever down to let the tone arm fall down to the record. The record will start playing.If you drop the tone arm down and it misses the side of the record or starts playing the wrong song, press the cueing lever to raise the tone arm back up. Then, try to align the tone arm with the side of the record and drop it down again.

, Unlike playing an MP3 player or a CD player, you need to manually stop a record player. You will need to raise the tone arm by pulling up the cueing lever. Then, move the tone arm over to the resting place and press the stop button or switch., If you are using an automatic turntable, you just need to press the play/stop button. The record will automatically play. When the side of the record is finished, press stop., The anti-skating mechanism makes sure that the tone arm does not move forward or backwards and skip over the record. If your record is skipping, turn the anti-skating mechanism until the tone arm stays in place while the record is playing.It is best to set it to a quarter of a gram or less., If you recently purchased a new cartridge for your record player, you will need a small screwdriver and some patience to install it. Align the red, blue, green and white wires with the terminals marked for these colors on the back of the cartridge. Once the wires are inserted, use a hex screwdriver to screw the cartridge into the headshell., To keep them playing smoothly, it is important to keep your records clean. Use a microfibre cloth, record cleaning brush or an anti-static record cleaning brush to clean your records.

If the records look dusty, it is time to clean them.If you have a record cleaning brush and a manual player, play the record without putting the tone arm down. Use the brush to remove any dust while the record is moving.

Make a formal introduction correctly.,
Make an informal introduction correctly.,
Make a group introduction correctly.,
Do not repeat names or reverse the introduction.,
Be delicate when you don't know a person's name.,
Use common sense when deciding what to call people.",How to Introduce People," If you want to introduce people to each other, then it's important to get the timing right. You don't want to to end up having blundered before the introductions have even begun by introducing the wrong people to each other or by interrupting a fantastic conversation just to get the details out of the way. Here's what you need to know:


If you find yourself in conversation with two people who don't know each other, try to introduce them as soon as possible. This can get a little tricky. Let's say you're with your college roommate, Amanda, when you run into your friend from high school, Jake, who launches into a story about a mutual friend. Poor Amanda will be standing there feeling awkward and bored while Jake rambles on. It's important to find an opening so that you can include Amanda into the conversation.
You should avoid introducing someone to people who are in the middle of a serious conversation. Maybe you're at a work event with a client, and you've been eager to introduce him to your boss. While this is an important introduction that should be made, you should avoid doing so if your boss seems to be entangled in a deep conversation with another person. You should wait for an opening, when your boss doesn't seem extremely absorbed; making introductions at the wrong time can lead people to not hit it off as well as they could.;
, This is important to know because the person of lesser rank or authority should always be presented to the person of higher rank or authority. In general, in a social setting, gender is the ""trump card"" and determines the higher rank; women are always ranked over men, unless the man is significantly older than the woman. After that, age is the next determining factor; an older person ranks over a younger person, which can be a helpful distinction if both people are of the same gender. Here's what you need to know:


Your 70-year-old mother-in-law is of greater seniority than your brand new boyfriend.
Great age takes precedence over most rank or authority, out of courtesy and respect. Your eighty-year-old male neighbor should be ranked higher than your fourteen-year-old niece (according to most people).
All other things being equal, the person you've known the longest should be named first: introduce your junior friend to your senior friend.
For social introductions, men are usually introduced to women, as a sign of respect. Gender is not a factor in business settings, where rank is more important.
Your relatives hold higher rank over your friends.

, In a business setting, women still have a higher rank over men, and older people still have a higher rank over younger people, but position trumps both age and gender. This means that if a young male is of a higher position than a woman, that the woman should be presented to the man because the man will have the higher rank. Basically, when it comes to a business setting, ""position"" determines rank first, and after that comes gender, and then age. Here's what you need to know:


Your boss will be of greater rank or authority than your colleague, partner, or best friend.
Your senior colleague takes precedence over your junior colleague.
Your customer or client should be introduced to your employees.
If you are introducing people of equal rank in the business world, then introduce the person you don't know as well to the person you know better. You should say the name of the person you know better first.

, This can be a bit confusing, but it basically means that you should state the name of the person of higher rank, and then ""present"" the other person to them. This makes the person of higher rank stand out as the more important person in the situation. Here are some examples:



Introduce a friend or significant other to a relative. The relative has a higher rank: ""Dad, I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Danny.""

Introduce a lower-ranking business associate to a higher ranking one: ""Mr. CEO, I'd like to introduce Mr. Underling.""

Introduce a client to a business associate: ""Mr. Client, this is Mr. Money, my associate.""

Introduce a younger person to an older one: ""Mr. Oldson, I'd like you to meet Sally Youngling.""

Introduce a man to a woman: ""Mary, this is Jeff.""

In a business setting, let rank take precedence over gender. If Mr. Thomas is a higher-ranking male than Mrs. Davis, Mr. Thomas gets the higher authority because of his business position, even though Mrs. Davis is a woman:"" Mr. Thomas, may I introduce Mrs. Davis.""

, You should do this only after you've introduced the people. If they have enough to talk about on their own, that's fine, but if you're trying to facilitate a business conversation or just helping people socialize at a party before moving along, then you can provide a connecting thread that can leave the people to talk on their own, or provide a bit more information about each person and lead them to make the connection. You can help connect the people by mentioning a common interest, a place they both know well, or even a person they both know. Here are some examples of ways to connect people:


""Elizabeth, have you met Fitzwilliam? I believe you both share a love of reading Jane Austen while walking on the moors.""
""Mom, this is my friend, Stacy. She teaches classes at your yoga studio.""
""Mr. Jones, this is Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith has been helping me on the Connor account. We never would have closed the account if it wasn't for your help, Mr. Jones.""
""Mary, I'd love for you to meet Mark Charles, my neighbor. Mark is actually a published writer. Mary has just started taking creative writing classes.""
""Amy, have you met Rick? Rick actually works with Jeff, your roommate. Isn't Jeff the greatest? I wish he could be here tonight...""

, Most formal introductions will relate to the workplace, but they can also take place during formal social events, or if you're with distinguished people. If you're introducing people in a formal setting, then you should use the first and last names of the people, along with the phrases,""May I present"", ""I'd like to introduce"", or ""Have you met..."" Some people think you should not use the word ""introduce,"" as it can cause confusion or come off as too direct, but it's up to you to decide. Here's what you should do:


Name the person of greater rank or authority first.
Use both first and last names, and include any title such as ""Dr./Sir"". For example, ""Dr. Jones, may I introduce Stephanie Smith. Dr. Jones is my art history professor. Stephanie is an art history major.""
Include relevant details as you introduce the two together, such as any established relationship you have with the person you're introducing. For example, you might say: ""Mr. Boss, may I present Mark Jones. Mr. Boss is my boss. Mark Jones is my associate.""

, For a less formal occasion, such as your backyard barbecue, you can simply present both people to one another by name by saying something like, ""Fitzwilliam Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet."" You can also connect the people more casually and say something like, ""I've been dying for you to meet...""In an informal setting, you can worry less about how to phrase everything and more about getting people talking.


Using first names only is fine in informal situations.

, In this case, you will need to spend a little time introducing the newcomer to each individual of the group unless it's a small, informal group where a general introduction would suffice and it's neither time-consuming nor disruptive to name each member of the group while you have the group's attention.


For more formal, larger groups, introduce the newcomer to the whole group first, then take the newcomer to each person and introduce by name: ""Caroline, this is Fitzwilliam, my boss; Lydia, this is Fitzwilliam, my boss,"" etc. Continue working your way around the group in this manner.
Though you may think it's funny or just easier to say, ""Mary, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Mary,"" this doesn't actually help get a conversation going. Besides, it's rude to ""everybody,"" because it makes it seem like you don't think it's worth it for Mary to get to know each person. Of course, use your discretion: if you're at a loud party and Mary just got there, it may be overwhelming to introduce her to twelve new faces immediately. Instead, ease Mary into the conversation and introduce her to a few people at a time.

, In both formal and informal cases, you do not need to reverse the introductions. It's obvious to both parties who is whom. Repeating names or reversing the introduction can make things a bit tedious, and you'll be making a social blunder.

, We've all been there. You try to introduce two people when you realize that you just completely forgot the name of the person standing in front of you. There are two approaches you can take:


Politely excuse yourself and say, ""I'm so sorry, would you mind reminding me of your name?""
Try to be sneaky. Say, ""Have the two of you met?"" Then pause and wait for the people to introduce themselves. This isn't a perfect maneuver, but it can help you in a pinch, especially if you've forgotten the name of a person you've met several times!

, The general rule of thumb is that you should introduce people to each other by what you normally call them. For example, if you're great friends with your former professor, Lucy Houston, you can just introduce her to your boyfriend as ""Lucy,"" if that's what you always call each other. If you're in a more formal situation and the person has not given you permission to call him or her by his or her first name, and you have always called the person by ""Dr."" or ""Mr.,"" then you should keep doing that.


When in doubt, go with the more formal option. It's better to have your boss say, ""You can call me Bob instead of Mr."" instead of having your boss bristle when you call him ""Bob"" instead of ""Mr.""

Make time a part of the invitation.,
Have a schedule.,
Never forget your ""me"" time.,
Don't let being a good host make you uncomfortable.",How to Handle House Guests That Stay Too Long1," Prevention is the key. Present a clear and obvious start and finish date/time for their stay--whether it's a dinner party or an overnight guest. If anything, this allows you to save face if it comes down to showing them the door.


Get it in writing. If an appropriately formal event, consider invitations in print with an end time to really make it known.
Mention how the time has passed, or how close it is to the end of their stay. A sympathetic ""I can't believe the weekend's almost over"" or ""What a shame you're leaving tomorrow"" is a sly way to remind them of when it's time to go.;
, Particularly if your house guest has come for a vacation, have a rough itinerary of what you'd like to do together, with at least one thing being the last thing you do. Whether you save the best for last, or just want to relax on the final day, having activities as sign-posts for your guest's stay is a convenient way of reminding them when their stay is up.


If hosting a party and you weren't able to establish it beforehand, a short ""I think this might be it for me"" from the hostess will have guests understanding that the current activity is the last.

, No matter how long your guest is staying (but especially if it's on the long side), always leave time for you to relax alone in your own home. Let your guest know ahead of time just when this will be so there's no confusion. Make them aware of when you usually go to bed and get up, so that they can avoid interrupting your sleep.


Also consider making it clear which parts of your house your guest can wander in. It's awkward and unnerving to find your guest in your bathroom when you never thought to clean it.
If desperate, think about buying your guest tickets to event, or any other outing. Try being honest and suggest you need the house to yourself, even if only for a bit.

, As a rule, only be a bad host if you've got a bad guest. But whether it's first thing in the morning or right before bed, you might not always feel like playing maid and concierge. Be firm when trying to get this point across to your guest: you have no intention of lowering your standard of living on their behalf.

"
"
Be specific with dates of arrival and departure.,
Be respectful of the host's time.,
Communicate clearly about comings and goings.,
Be flexible with your time.,
Share the household bathroom respectfully.,
Ask before helping yourself to food.,
Respect cultural and familial differences.,
Offer to make contributions.,
Do your own laundry.,
Offer to help at mealtimes.,
Bring a gift to show gratitude.,
Be appreciative.,
Thank your hosts for the stay.",How to Be a Good House Guest," Don't keep your visit open-ended. Also, don't book an airline reservation before you first discuss it with your host. If your host has agreed to certain dates, don't try to add on to those dates without discussing it, and respect that your host may have to discuss your stay with their spouse or housemate.


Avoid overstaying your visit. Even though you have been graciously invited into their home, your hosts may have rearranged their normal routines on your behalf. Their hospitality also requires their investment of time, energy, and money.
If you are staying for a period longer than three days, consider putting the arrangement on a business footing, or finding ways to leave and stay elsewhere for a few days to give your hosts some private time.;
, Don't show up earlier than the time you had agreed upon. Your host may not be ready for you and an early arrival could inconvenience them considerably. If, for some unforeseen reason, you caught an earlier connection or you had an extra day's vacation and want to arrive earlier, call them first.


Avoid showing up later that you promised. This may upset many hosts who worry about what might have happened to you. If you are delayed for any reason, call them and explain.

, If you will not be with your hosts all the time, discuss your plans beforehand to make sure that you will not inadvertently inconvenience them. Don't leave their home, even for a short outing, without telling them. Your host should not have to guess whether you went out or not.Be quiet when arriving back late, and, if given a key, use it. Turn out the lights and check to make sure that the door is locked behind you.

, The living space designed to accommodate you on a short-term, temporary basis is the full-time home of your host. Make a conscious effort to adapt to their preferences and patterns. To be clear, ask about their expectations of you during your stay.


Ask if you are expected to share meals with them or at which time they would prefer you to turn out the lights. It is especially important to accept that others have to live in the house, too.

, If the house only has one bathroom, ask when it is convenient for you to use it. Consideration is also expected if you are sleeping in a living area near the only bathroom; remember, others may need to use it after you go to bed.


Remember to flush the toilet and put the lid down. Don't leave a dripping faucet, and turn off the light when you're finished.
Don't rummage around in their cupboards looking for a toothbrush or other essentials; instead, ask your host if they have any spares.

, Avoid taking the last of anything, especially the last of leftovers that are not easily reproduced, or expensive items. If you must eat your host's food while they are unavailable, a good idea is to pick up some more to replace what you ate.

, For example, you may be an omnivore staying with a vegan family, but it is polite to at least try what they serve you. Do not criticize your hosts' preferences. If eating a certain kind of food is a violation of your cultural or religious beliefs, let your hosts know before you arrive.Adapt to your host's lifestyle. There may be children, pets, elderly parents, or others in the home with whom you may be unaccustomed to living with. Go with the flow and try to learn something from the experience., Even if you're not eating at your host's home, offer to purchase the groceries. Remember that your hosts have probably already been shopping for extra groceries and spent a considerable amount of time and money to get ready for your visit. You could either bankroll their next supermarket trip, or offer to go out and buy things for both yourself and for them (ask them for a list)., Don't be embarrassed about asking whether or not it is okay to do your laundry at your host's place. They understand that after a few days you'll have dirty underwear.


Ask your host when the most convenient time for you to do your laundry would be, emphasizing that you don't want to cut into the household's normal routine.

, This doesn't mean crowding the host out of the kitchen, but instead it means collecting plates, carrying out dishes, offering to wash up or stack the dishwasher, cleaning off the counters, and taking the garbage out. You could even offer to cook a meal or two yourself.

, Offering something as a way of thanking your hosts in advance is a thoughtful and caring gesture. It demonstrates your appreciation of their important efforts to make your stay a good one. Considerate, inexpensive gifts include a bottle of wine, a box of chocolates, a basket of fruit, or a bouquet of flowers., Express that you are pleased with the local food, sightseeing, and other attractions. If your hosts have provided you with a home-cooked meal, show your appreciation through compliments and by offering to take care of the next meal., Help them clean up anything that you may have moved during your visit. Also don't rush out of the house when you are leaving, since the hosts might assume that you did not appreciate your stay.Leave a thank-you note on your departure. It is polite to leave a small token to show that you are grateful for their hospitality. A handwritten card makes a thoughtful token of appreciation.

"
Suggest an outing.,
Do something boring.,
Use body language--gently.,
Fake having to leave.",How to Handle House Guests That Stay Too Long2," Offer your guest(s) a trip to the mall, or simply a walk around the neighborhood. Make the suggestion as ""one last thing before you go."" Getting the guest out of the house is the biggest step, and afterwards you can simply show them to their car (or have a taxi waiting) rather than inviting them back inside.


If hosting a party, try not to leave anyone behind. The idea is not for some to leave and for one or two to stay behind and raid your pantry.
Make sure everyone has their things. If the plan is to have the trip out be out for good, don't allow any excuse to get back inside.

, Here's where the tactics begin to lose some subtlety. Consider switching from video games to a roaring game of pick-up sticks; or from chatting over drinks to helping you wash your cat. Plenty of guests will opt for the door over something they'd rather not do.


While this is a tactic better suited to partygoers, the house guest who's stayed a day or two over will think more fondly of home or a hotel if they're no longer being entertained.
Make sure the door is always an option--don't suggest an alternative with such zeal that guests feel obligated to participate., Look busy, or agitated. If it's the last day of a house guest's stay, act like it. Gather your guest's things and move the conversation from the living room to the doorway.


Consider making their bed or re-fashioning their room as it was before they arrived.
Try being appropriately unavailable as the end of their stay approaches; start working or doing things around the house., How subtle you choose to be is at your discretion; it could be anything from ""I've got to run"" to ""My grandmother is in the hospital."" Only the worst guest would consider staying in someone's home during a family emergency. Alternatively, you could pretend another guest is coming to take their place.


Careful getting caught in a lie--if you can actually manage to have somewhere to be, all the better. But if you say your grandmother's in the hospital, be sure your grandmother is aware, and that your guest doesn't work in the emergency room.

"
"
Tell a ""bad house guest"" story.,
Use a friend.,
Find a new place.,
Offer to get their stuff together.,
Give them chores.",How to Handle House Guests That Stay Too Long3," This is a not-so-subtle way of letting your guest(s) know the limits. Consider doing so before the guest overstays their welcome, so they know their boundaries in advance. If they persist, offer a sly ""you're being a little like right now"" to really drive the point home.

, If able, have a friendly guest scoot the impolite guest towards the door. Invite a good friend over the day the house guest is meant to leave, and have them leave simultaneously. Have her repeat your hints about the time, or about how ""we really should get going,"" etc. It always helps to have an example of a good guest to show the bad guest just what they're doing.


If you're especially worried about an overstay-er for a party, get a friend to give them a ride. This way, when the friend knows its time to leave, the overstay-er has no choice but to leave with them.
Know that the friend has to leave as well. Don't recruit someone else to show a bad guest the door (unless they're just that bad) and try to keep them around--booting the overstay-er will usually be an all-or-nothing affair., For overnight guests who test your hospitality, suggest they visit a hotel instead. If it's a guest to a party, and is someone who just insists the party never stop, offer an alternative venue where the party doesn't have to stop. Suggest a bar or a dessert place to end their night.


Be careful not to become responsible. Play the host who, unfortunately, cannot host any longer, but don't apologize for setting limits. Don't pay the cab fare (unless you're desperate), don't buy the hotel room, just be direct and get them elsewhere.

, The final act of a kind host is to see that their guest makes it comfortably out the door. To assure your guest that time has come, gather their things and put them by the door. Ask them questions about their leaving on the day of, or things such as ""Are you sure you left nothing behind?"" These are just more unambiguous signs that their stay is over.


For party guests, offer them a last drink or piece of dessert. If the latter, suggest they take some home with them--and meet them at the door with the bag.

, If a guest has truly overstayed their welcome, let them know they ought to start pitching in around the house. Have them pick up after themselves, and suggest they do a fair share of the dishes and the tidying up. At worst you've a new helper around the house. However, most house guests would be reaching for reasons to leave once doing dishes entered the itinerary."
"
Ignore your guest(s).,
Do something they don't like.,
Entertain someone else.,
Tell them to leave.",How to Handle House Guests That Stay Too Long4," Stop being social, and give them as cold a shoulder as you can. This is definitely a last resort, as it meets rudeness with rudeness, but some guests are so dense as to never take a hint. When your guest begins to feel more like the cable guy and less an invited guest, the door will be all the more appealing.


Don't leave them happy, though. Plenty of terrible guests would be thrilled to sit watching your big TV in silence. Act as though the TV is ""out of order,"" and tell them that they're on their own for dinner. Stop being a host, and start being a roommate.

, Forget boring, if you know your overstaying guest well enough, do whatever bugs them. Play obnoxious music, insist on reciting Elizabethan poetry, keep the channel locked on C-SPAN--whatever you have to do. House guests who overstay do so because, for whatever effort it would take to leave, they'd rather stay where they are. Turn that reasoning on its head, and your guest will be out the door in moments., If you haven't a good friend there to move your guest to the door, invite one over. Then, pay exclusive attention to them. Make the overstay-er feel as though they're intruding on an intimate meeting of good friends. This, hopefully, will reveal the guest's impoliteness more clearly and have them apologizing all the way to the door.


For guests who stay several nights, pretend this good friend has come to take the room they had been using. Make this appear to be a long-standing invitation, so the overstay-er has no choice but to find new room and board.

, This is the ultimate last resort, and there's not much to it. For the guest for whom none of the above had any effect, there is nothing else to do than to tell them, directly: ""You need to leave."" By this point, don't ask them to leave--tell them. Do as bars do: shut off the lights, hang up the chairs. Make it unthinkable to stay any longer."

Read the situation.,
Figure out what she wants.,
Give her some affection.,
Let her express herself.,
Be a good listener.,
Don't try to minimize her problems.,
Ask her if you can do anything to help.,
Don't try to say you know exactly how she feels.,
Tell her you're sorry for how she feels.,
Just be there for her.,
Distract her.,
Do some easy tasks for her.,
Check in on her.",How to Comfort a Girl," What is the girl really upset about? Is it something completely devastating, like the loss of a grandparent, or something a little more manageable, like a fight with a friend? The problem can help you find out what she wants the most. If she's dealing with a real loss, then you don't want to try to make her laugh or distract her with a ridiculous story; but if she's just dealing with some friend drama, then you can take a more lighthearted approach. But don't talk much about that reason, or she will just get madder.


Not all problems are created equal. The more you know about the situation, the better you can know how to respond.;
, This is important. If she says, ""I want to be left alone"" and she really means it, then you should give her some time to herself and not make her feel worse by sticking around when she just wants alone time. But if she says that and wants you there, then it's harder to pick up on; if you know her well, you'll know if she really wants to cool off or if she's just saying that because she doesn't want to bother you.


Is she the kind of girl who is often upset or is this the first time you have seen her like this? If she's been upset before, think of how you reacted then and try to do the same thing if it worked out.
Ask if she wants to talk. See if she wants to have a conversation about the problem or if she just wants you to be there to offer moral support.

, Okay, so most girls would like a hug or some affection when they are upset. This is true if you're dating the girl or if you're close to her and she doesn't feel like you're making a move. Some girls, however, may not want a hug right when they're upset, and that's okay too. If you're close to her, just putting your arm around her or touching her shoulder, hand, or knee will make her feel better.

When she's upset, what she wants most of all is to feel that you're really there for her, and giving her some affection will do this.






Bring her a tissue, a cup of tea, a warm blanket, and anything else she needs to feel more comfortable.

, The thing she wants most is to tell you exactly how she feels, if she doesn't just want to be left alone. So, let her cry, let her talk, let her kick her furniture if she has to. Don't get in her way and try to pose concrete solutions, ask a million questions, or get in the way of her just letting you know what's going on. If she just got upset, then it's likely she hasn't processed the situation yet.


Don't try to jump in and offer a million solutions at first. When she wants your advice, she will ask for it. But for now, focus on just letting her let it all out.
You may think you know exactly what to do, but this is not the moment to just jump in.

, If the girl is upset, then she wants you listen more than anything else. She's not looking to hear your twenty most important thoughts on the matter and wants a kind ear instead. So, let her talk without interrupting to ask questions or give your opinion, make eye contact, and contribute little comments like, ""I can't imagine how hard that is for you..."" to let her know you really care. Let her finish and don't cut her off.


You can nod and show her that you really care, but don't nod too eagerly or she'll think you're rushing her or faking it.
Avoid distractions. Put away your phone, keep your focus on her, and don't look around the room. Don't make her think you have somewhere else to be.

, If you want to make the girl feel better, then the worst thing you can say are things like, ""It's not the end of the world"" or ""It's going to be okay."" Sure, you may be able to see that she's upset about something that isn't that big of a deal, like a failed test grade, or a break-up with a loser she was only dating for a few weeks, but you can't let her know that, or she'll just feel worse. In the moment, she just wants to be upset and to talk about her feelings, not to be told that they aren't a big deal.


You may think that you're helping her by putting things in perspective, but you'll only be making her feel worse for feeling upset, and she may turn on you.
She wants you there for support most of all, not your own opinion.

, Once she's gotten it all out, you can ask her what you can do to make her feel better. Maybe it's a concrete situation where you can go do something, whether it's help her figure out her car insurance situation, help her mend a relationship with a friend, or even help her save some money by helping her fix something yourself. Maybe all you can do is go with her to do something unpleasant and offer moral support. Or maybe she really has to do it alone, but you can help just by being ""on call"" if she needs you.


Just asking the question will let her know that you care and that you want to do something more for her. This will make her feel better about the situation.
It's likely that she feels very lost and alone. Asking her if you can help will make her feel more liked and wanted.

, She wants to be heard, not told that you know exactly how she feels. Maybe she lost a grandparent and so did you, and you can help out by saying you've been through it too; if it's such a direct situation, you can mention this, but in general, don't try to compare yourself to her or she'll think you're fighting for attention. The focus is on her. If she's going through a bad long breakup, don't compare her three year relationship to your three month relationship, or she'll cry, ""It's not the same!""


It's better to say, ""I can't imagine what you're going through,"" or ""I can't even begin to understand how you feel..."" Most of the time, this is more often the case, and will make the girl feel justified in her feelings.

, This is nice and simple. Just say, ""I'm sorry that you're going through this,"" or ""I'm sorry that you're dealing with such a difficult situation."" Even though it's not your fault, just a little apology can show that you really sympathize with the situation and that you wish that things were different. This will make her feel better, even if there's not much you can do.


She may say, ""It's not your fault!"" and you can just say, ""I know, but I still feel bad."" That will make her feel like you're really on her side.

, Sometimes, you can't help, you can't say much, and you can't do much to make the situation better. If she got some really bad news, all you can do is to be there with her and to let her know she's not alone. If you had big plans that weekend, see if you can cancel them to spend some time with her; if she has something to do, ask if you can do it together. Sometimes all that you can do is offer your time and your loving presence. You can't just comfort her and say you have to go and fall off the radar for a few days, or she will feel unwanted.


Let her know that she will be a priority for you. You may have other things on your mind, but you won't let her out of your reach.

, She may want to be alone after being upset, but if you can, try to get her out of the house as much as you can. Even if she doesn't feel like socializing, getting out into some fresh air is guaranteed to make her feel better and make her forget about her problems, if only for a little while. Here are some things that you can try:


Invite her to see a comedy. A lighthearted movie will make her laugh and feel better for a little while.






Take her out to dinner or for coffee or ice cream. Just a simple treat will make her feel better. Plus, if she's upset, she may be forgetting to eat and take care of herself. Just don't take her out for a drink -- if she's upset, alcohol is not the solution.






Take her out on a walk. Getting some light exercise and fresh air can help her clear her head and feel more centered.
Don't invite her out to loud events with lots of people, or she'll feel overwhelmed and unable to deal.

, She may be feeling so overwhelmed that she can't deal with her daily life. So, bring her a cup of coffee or lunch when she needs it; offer to clean up her room if it's getting out of control; do her laundry if it's necessary. If she's upset in class and can't focus, take some notes for her. If she needs to put gas in her car, do it for her. It won't take long to put an extra effort into your relationship and it will help her feel less overwhelmed.


Obviously, you shouldn't let her take advantage of you. But doing some light chores or tasks for her at first can make a big difference.

, This is an important part of comforting the girl. Even after you're done talking to her, you need to offer your support. Make sure to call her, text her, visit her, and see when you can hang out again. You don't have to be annoying and text her asking if she's okay every few hours, but you should check in every once in a while to let her know you care.


Even sending her a funny note or funny YouTube clip can make her laugh and make her feel special.
Be creative. Send her a card or a bouquet of sunflowers. Let her see that you care about her beyond your conversation.
Just let her know you're thinking of her. If she wants to be left alone, you don't have to rehash the conversation every few hours. A little message to let her know you care about her can go a long way.

Introduce Interfaces.,
Add IoC Container.,
Add Service Locator.,
Replace specific object creation with Service Locator resolution.,
Move to Dependency Injection (Optional).",How to Introduce Inversion of Control Into an Existing Application," The first thing you must do is introduce Interfaces for any classes that you want to pass via the Inversion of Control container. Without an interface, your code will be just as tightly coupled as it was before. IoC containers are also designed to use interfaces as a way of resolving necessary references. Interfaces can be introduced without changing the logic of any of your code, thus minimizing the QA required.


First create the interface itself and attach it to the class (the method of doing this will vary from language to language). Once this is done, scan through the code and ensure that any references to the concrete class are changed to be references to the interface. The only exceptions are the locations where the class is created - these must remain references to the class.;
, Once the interfaces are added to your project, you must add the IoC container. It should be initialized once at application startup to provide the proper services in response to requests made by the application. When this step is complete, the container will as yet be unused but available for use.

, When coding new applications, Inversion of Control is best done using Dependency Injection. However, this pattern assumes that DI is used throughout the application and it is normally not practical to convert an entire application to DI in one step. The solution is to use the Service Locator pattern during the conversion.


Using the Service Locator pattern allows you to convert objects to the IoC pattern slowly over time instead of requiring a massive conversion effort. Once an application is fully converted to Service Locator, it can be a trivial step to further convert it to Dependency Injection.

, Once the service locator is installed, you will be able to sweep through the application and find all code that creates new objects. Replace those lines with calls to the Service Locator instead. You may now remove any references to the libraries that contain the concrete classes.

, Service Location is an IoC pattern that works well, and it is possible for the conversion effort to stop here. However, if you prefer to use strictly Dependency Injection, it should be a trivial exercise to convert the code further. First add an appropriate constructor method to each class – one that expects all dependent classes to be passed in. Once all of the constructors are created, you may remove the Service Locator and allow all objects to be created via Dependency Injection.

Finished.

",How to Clean Your iPad2," The market is flooded with iPad cases; they're everywhere you look, making the decision of which one to buy even harder. Here are some general tips you can use when searching for an iPad case:


Get something form-fitting that doesn't impede use of the device. You want something that will act as a kind of second skin to the iPad, but a skin that doesn't make using the iPad hard or cumbersome.
Unless the products fit extremely well, stay away from leather cases. Leather cases are pretty and make the iPad something to behold, but they aren't form-fitting, letting loose dust and grit get between the case or cover and the iPad itself.

, You don't have to clean your iPad after each and every use, but if you use it frequently, giving it a quick minute of your undivided cleaning attention will ensure that the iPad lasts well into its glory years, smudge- and grime-free.

, Moisture + iPad opening = disaster. As a general rule, try not to use liquids when you clean the iPad to preserve its oleophobic coating.


If you feel like you must use a liquid to clean the iPad, go for something like the iKlenz Cleaner Solution. This kind of solution repels dust and kills bacteria as well. If used properly, this cleaning liquid should also give a streak-free shine.

The cost of such cloth varies. For cloth recommended by companies for their products, the price can be considerably higher simply because of the recommendation. Look around for a good deal on such cloth or substitute with a cheaper but still effective microfiber cloth.;
, It is usually much easier to see where to clean when the device is switched off.

, This will remove the majority of simple imperfections.

, It may actually be enough to just breathe over the screen and use that moisture to clean with.


Read the instructions accompanying the cloth you're using. Some of them need to be made slightly damp before use. If this is the case, skip this step and follow the cloth's instructions instead.
If dampening a cloth, it is best to use distilled water or a cleaner specifically designed for cleaning touch screens.

, Don't over-rub though! And if there is any dampness left, just leave it to air dry.


Do not put too much pressure on the screen when cleaning it.

, To wash the microfiber cloth, soak it in warm, soapy water. The warm water serves to open the fibers and release the grime that may have gathered. Scrub the cloth lightly while soaking it (not too hard or you will damage the cloth). After soaking, avoid squeezing out any excess water, let the cloth out to air dry. If you're in a hurry, you may want to blow dry it. Do not wash any screens with the cloth until dry (or lightly damp) to the touch.

Look at what you currently use.,
Consider the pros of iOS.,
Consider the pros of Android.,
Consider the pros of Windows.,
Set a budget.,
Look at the app selection.",How to Choose a Tablet Computer1," When it comes to buying a tablet, the main choice you will need to make is the operating system. The operating systems for tablets fall into three basic camps: Apple (iOS), Google (Android), and Microsoft (Windows). The one you pick will be based a lot on the kind of things you do on your regular computer and smartphone.If you already have a smartphone with one of these operating systems, you may want to consider picking up a tablet running the same OS. Both Android and iOS behave almost exactly the same across devices, making getting used to your device much easier. This will also allow you to connect your devices easier and share things between them.
If you regularly use services provided by one of these operating systems, (iCloud, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.), you may want to pick a tablet from the same OS. This isn't necessary, however, as there are apps available for all devices that allow you to access other services.;
, Apple's iOS is what powers the iPad, the device that kicked the tablet market into high-gear in 2010. iOS is known for it's intuitive interface, and Apple products are revered for their construction quality.


Seamless integration with OS X and iTunes purchases.
Easy-to-use interface.
Tons of apps, usually first to get the latest and greatest.
iMessage allows you to send messages for free across all Apple devices.

, Google's Android operating system is the most popular mobile operating system on the planet, thanks in large part to the massive number of devices that can run it. Android used to be a bit more finicky than iOS, but updates have brought a large number of improvements over the years.


Seamless integration with your Google account and Play Store purchases.
Android devices can be significantly cheaper than iOS or Windows.
Lots of customization and rooting options for advanced users.
Large variety of models and manufacturers to choose from.
Android supports multiple user logins for one device.
The Android operating system can be modified by the manufacturer to be very customized. For example, the Amazon Kindle Fire runs a modified version of Android built around the Amazon ecosystem.

, Windows isn't available on as many devices as iOS or Android, but it can be a good choice if you work heavily with Office and other Microsoft products. Windows 10 is currently the main Windows mobile operating system, and some versions are as full-featured as a regular computer.


Can run a variety of Windows programs, including Office. Surface Pros run a full desktop version of Windows 10.
Seamless integration with your Microsoft account and Windows Store purchases.
Pairs well with Xbox. Smartglass allows you to use your tablet as a secondary interface for many Xbox 360 and Xbox One games.
Most Windows tablets come with detachable keyboards.

, Low-end tablets start at around $200 USD, while the highest-priced iPad will set you back $800 USD. A lower price usually means less processing power and limited storage. The quality of the display will also suffer on the low-end models.

, Apps are the main point of having a tablet, and the selection of apps will dictate a lot of what your device can do. You can browse each operating system's app stores using your web browser. Take a look through the app stores and see which operating system has more apps that appeal to you and your app budget.Not all apps are optimized for tablet use, but more and more are releasing tablet versions.

Try tablets out in a store first.,
Test to see how the tablet handles loading and closing apps, as well as switching in between open apps.,
Check out the specifications.,
Check out the camera.,
Choose a size.",How to Choose a Tablet Computer2," Even if you're planning to buy online, see if you can try out a few different tablets at a retail store. This will give you a basic feel for how the models perform, and can help drive your purchasing decision. Just don't let the salespeople try to talk you into something you don't want.

, Try out a graphically intensive game (if one is available on the demo model) to see how the tablet handles a high load.

, There are a few different specs that you'll want to pay attention to when shopping for tablets. Different specs will be relevant for different tablets. For example, if you're deciding between iPads, the processor won't make a difference since all new iPads share the same processor. When comparing Android tablets from different manufacturers, however, processor and RAM specifications become much more important.Resolution - This is the size of the display, expressed in the number of pixels shown on the screen. The larger the resolution, the clearer your image will be.
Processor - This is the chip that drives the tablet. A tablet with a quad-core processor will generally perform better than a tablet with a dual-core processor. If you are looking at iPads, all new iPads share the same processor.Battery life - The published battery life can't usually be trusted, since it is measured under the most optimal conditions set by the manufacturer. Try to find some reviews online to compare battery life with normal usage.
RAM/Memory - This is the memory that allows your tablet to multitask and run memory-intensive apps. This specification is really only apparent if you're comparing Android models.
Storage - This is the amount of space that the tablet has to store media, apps, and any other files and documents. Storage is the primary difference between different tablets in the same model line. Check if the tablet supports SD or MicroSD for storage expansion. As more and more people store files in the cloud, the need for large amounts of physical storage has gone down.
Cellular - If you want to use a cellular data plan to be able to browse the internet anywhere you have a cellular signal, you'll need a tablet that supports SIM cards. All tablets can connect to wireless networks that you have access to.

, If you plan on taking a lot of pictures with the tablet, check out the camera options. Generally, tablets do not have the best cameras, though some models make a point of touting powerful cameras. Most tablets have a camera on the back and a less-powerful camera on the front for video chatting.

, Tablets generally come in two different sizes: 10-inch and 7-inch. Screen size is a personal preference; larger screens allow for easier video watching and typing, while smaller tablets will generally be more portable. Apps generally work with both 10-inch and 7-inch tablets, though some are only optimized for one size.


Be sure to check out the screen brightness and clarity as well as the size.
Some tablets offer different sizes (8.9"" for example), but most tablets will fit into one of these two sizes.

Understand how you want to use the tablet.,
Consider the device’s memory.,
Compare displays.,
Pick a size.,
Establish a budget.,
Consider Android tablets if price, form factor and Internet browsing are high on your list of needs.,
Look at Apple if you want apps, better form-factor, sharp display and you are flexible on price.,
Compare Kindle for eReaders and surfing.,
Review the Microsoft tablets running Win 8.,
Consider a phablet like the Galaxy Note 2 and 3 if the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy does not have enough storage, browsing power or display.,
Don’t purchase a tablet between November and January.,
Consider waiting three to four months after a new model comes out to purchase it.,
Expect to get a bigger discount or deal on a non-Apple iPad.,
Purchase a tablet direct from the manufacturer, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft or Amazon, if you want to buy the newest model on the market.,
Try eBay or another auction site if you are open to purchasing refurbished tablets or models.,
Shop at a cellular network provider if they are offering special financing when you sign up for a monthly plan.,
Try supermarkets, like Tesco, Costco, Walmart or Argos, if you are shopping for an older model.,
Go to a shop only if you want your tablet immediately.",How to Buy a Tablet," Different tablets excel with eBooks, movies, music, work/productivity, play games, check emails and browsing. As you go through the process of choosing, make sure use is at the forefront of your mind.;
, For most people who plan to listen to music, watch videos, download apps and view photos, the biggest storage size is better. Storage can start at 16 gigabytes (GB), but can go as large as 128 GB.

, Generally, the newer the model, the sharper the display. The pixels per inch will make a big difference when playing games, viewing photos, watching videos and more.

, 7 to 8-inch screens are considered small, while 8.9 to 10-inch tablets are considered large. At the small end is the Galaxy Note 2 and 3, a “phablet” that counts as both a phone and a tablet between 5 and 6.9 inches.


Screen size is measured diagonally from the top right corner to bottom left corner. This is similar to computer screen and TV screen measurements., You can expect to pay between $200 and $1,000 for a tablet. Few people can buy any tablet on the market, so get a good idea of what you can afford before you go searching through models.


Included in the budget conversation is the monthly charge. If you only plan to use it from home, a Wi-Fi only model doesn’t require an extra charge per month.
However, a cellular service that provides data around the clock will cost $80 to $100 per month.

, The Galaxy Tab, LG G Pad 8.3 and the Google Nexus are top Android tablets that come in a variety of sizes. After Apple, Google Play has the largest list of apps available. , The Apple Store has the most apps available on tablets. The new Apple iPad Air is the lightest and slimmest model yet.


Following up close behind are the iPad mini 2 with Retina display and iPad mini, which are smaller tablets if you don’t need a 10-inch display.

, If eBooks are your goal, then a Kindle paper white is cheap and easy to use. If you want an amazing display, eReader capabilities and high functionality for apps, music and videos then the Kindle Fire HDX 7 is at the top of its class for a relatively low price.

, Tablets like the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 are excellent for people looking to work heavily on their tablet. You can use Microsoft’s Office suite and use it as a laptop or tablet. Microsoft tablets come in several different sizes. The Surface is heavier and may not be the best option for commuting or plane travel.

, Although phablets only account for two percent of data usage, they may be gaining in popularity thanks to their portability, usability and performance.


If you need to get a mobile plan to cover your tablet for travel, combining your phone and tablet in 1 device may outweigh the disadvantages of a smaller display.

, This is when prices are highest for the Christmas season. You are less likely to see manufacturers offering discounts, especially on the newest models.

, One study showed that most PC tablets drop by about 27 percent during that time. Apple tablets drop by 4.5 percent., Apple has garnered up to 70 percent of the market share, although that number seems to be dwindling. Prices are a lot more flexible with Android, Microsoft and other models.


Kindle prices are also more inflexible; however, the Kindle has released models across several price points that stay fairly steady.

, When a device is new, the manufacturer offers the lowest price for several months to a year.


An added advantage of purchasing from Apple is that they will engrave your device for free.
Look for discounts on shipping or free accessories when you are buying from the manufacturer.

, If price is your largest factor, then these sites will offer cheap prices. You must take some risk by not being able to vet the seller before you buy.

, If you want Internet on the go and not a Wi-Fi model, chances are you can tie your tablet to your phone plan and snap up a tablet at a cheaper price.


Avoid purchasing tablet accessories at a mobile wireless outlet. You can find accessories online at far cheaper prices.

, Before new models come out, they may deduct $20 to $50 from the purchase price.

, Use a store like Best Buy, Apple Store or Currys to compare different brands. Then, make sure you compare the purchase price to the manufacturer’s price before you pick up your tablet from the store.Don’t compromise your tablet purchase based on what they have in stock. Ask the store to order it in or purchase it online from a trusted seller.

, These basic control keys are used for controlling applications and other basic commands:



The home button: This is used to jump to the home screen of your Android device. If pressed in between another activity (game, or application), the OS puts the activity in the background. Using this button will, usually, not shut down any application or game; instead, it will run in the background.

The back button: This is used to go to the previous page or activity.

Multi-tasking button: Android tablets running Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) and higher will have a multi-tasking button (parallelogram-shaped button). Tapping this button will give a list of all applications running in the background. Swapping a running application to the left or right (in the multi-task screen) will close the application. This is particularly useful to clear RAM and speed up the device.
Older Android tablets may have a Menu (or settings) button (represented by three parallel horizontal lines). This button gives the user access to additional options for particular apps. This button is not found on devices running Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean out of the box.

, Different tablets run on different versions of the Android OS. The Android version can be found in the About Tablet section of the settings panel.


Most tablets run on Android Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) or higher.The latest version of Android is Lollipop (5.0.x). Generally, the higher the version of Android, better will be the device performance.
Some older tablets run on Android Honeycomb (3.x). Honeycomb was a tablet-specific version which wasn't available for mobile phones running on Android.
The OS version gives a brief idea of the features packed in a tablet. For example: Tablets (and phones) running on Jelly Bean version have Google Now(voice-assistant service by Google) in-built.

, Google Play Store has a vast collection of tools, applications and games that will make your Android experience much better.


Download an office app that will help you view and/ or edit documents. Most Android tablets come with an in-built document viewer. If you want to download a free office editor for Android, try downloading the Kingsoft Office application.

Note: Smart actions may not be available on all devices. However, you can download similar apps from the Google Play Store.

Adjust Screen Timeout. The screen timeout time can be a drain on the battery, especially if it is too long. Setting up a screen timeout is the one of the best ways to save power while your tablet is on.

Create your own wallpapers, widgets, etc.

, Speeding up your device can be done in a number of ways:



Update your version/ firmware. Device manufacturers roll out updates occasionally to fix bugs, reduce lags, and improve performance. Be on the look out for updates for your device.
Download a task-killer and anti-virus applications. Some devices come with an in-built task manager while most don't. Task manager will allow you to close the apps that are running in the background (and use up RAM). Anti-virus application will keep you safe from any external threats.
Remove unneeded widgets from the home screen. Widgets are useful to quickly access important apps or get information. However, unneeded widgets use up a lot of processing power and will slow down your tablet.

, Syncing is an efficient way to transfer data like pictures, videos, contacts, messages, emails, and more, between many devices (including your PC). To configure synchronization options for apps or accounts, go to Settings -> Accounts & sync.Sync your Gmail emails, contacts, calender with Windows Outlook or other accounts.Set up Gmail in Microsoft Outlook.

Decide how you will use the tablet.,
Compare the different processors.,
Know how much storage you want.,
Determine if you need a good camera.,
Determine if you want a large- or small-screened tablet.,
Chose a store.,
Compare tablets.,
Purchase the tablet.",How to Buy an Android Tablet," This question defines the remaining steps and is the most important.


Is the tablet only needed for watching videos, Instagram, and Facebook? If so, most tablets today can handle that. Users can save money by purchasing lower-end tablets for these purposes.
Is the tablet going to be used for multimedia and gaming? Then a higher end tablet will be in order. These tend to have more storage for taking HD pictures and video, as well as higher level processors and cameras. For more multimedia and gaming use, tablets with expandable storage, such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nvidia Shield, are useful.;
, There is a lot of information out there about processors, but a few basics can help a user to make the best decision.



Cores. The more cores a processor has, the faster it will be (dual core, quad core, etc.) Many tablets today run quad core processors; however, great deals can be found with dual core tablets, as they contain older technology but are perfect for basic tablet tasks. Dual is two, and quad is four. However, the majority of tablets in the stores have quad core processors.

Clock speed. On most advertisements for tablets, there will be a number that is listed alongside the number of cores in the tablet. These should be listed with the Ghz next to the number (2.2Ghz, 2.7 Ghz, etc.). The higher the number, the faster the device, at least for the most part. If you use a lot of apps and games that require a faster device, you will want to look for a tablet with a higher clock speed.

, Without getting too deep into different memory sizes and what not, here are some basics. There are two basic types of memory on a tablet: main storage and RAM.


The main storage is where applications, media (pictures, videos, etc.) are permanently stored.
RAM is always the smaller of the two memory types. RAM is basically live, active, memory that the tablet uses to run multiple apps all at once. Higher end tablets run high amounts of RAM for so that they can run multiple processes at once.
The average tablet today comes with about 16GB (gigabytes) of storage; however, the amount of RAM can be different. It ranges from 3GB on the high end to 512MB for older, more basic tablets. (1GB is 1,000 MB.)
A lot of memory is necessary if you plan on downloading lots of applications, taking and storing lots of pictures, or loading videos and music to your tablet. However, if you plan on using Cloud based storage systems mainly, you may be able to get away with smaller amounts of storage.

, The camera in a tablet is going to be digital and, therefore, will measure the picture quality based on megapixels (MP); this is called the resolution. While this should not be the only factor, it is an important one. iPads generally come with an 5MP camera (sometimes called a shooter). For Androids, this is more mid-range. Android tablets can come with a 2MP–16MP shooter.


With tablets, most people don’t find the camera to be a big selling point as the size of the tablet can be 7+ inches and can be awkward to use.
The more MP, the more space will be taken up in storage for each picture or video taken.
Many newer tablets come with two different cameras, one facing the user (front-facing) and one facing away (back camera). The front-facing camera will have a lower resolution, usually around 2MP or so. It is mostly used for selfies and video calls.
Video quality is also important. Most tablets with an 8MP back camera will shoot in HD (high definition) video, giving clear, crisp video. However, a few tablets with lower MP front-facing cameras are capable of this as well.

, The screen on today’s tablets is a very important feature for many users. Lower-resolution screens can make many pictures, videos, and games look grainy. There are a few basic things to understand when choosing the right screen.


Is it HD or not? There are two different numbers associated with screen resolution, and they should be displayed like this: 1280 x 720. This particular resolution is the lowest HD screen available. Anything lower is not considered to be HD.
Generally, the higher the resolution, the more expensive the tablet.
Today, high-end flagship tablets can come with QHD screens. These can have resolutions as high as 2560 x 1440.
Another important determining factor is the actual size of the screen itself. Tablets generally come in size of 7+ inches, with one of the largest being 24 inches (Nabi Big Tab).
A final important factor is the pixels per inch (PPI) measurement. The PPI of a screen determines how sharp the display is when zoomed in. Edges of text and the like can become grainy even on HD screens that have a low PPI. However, this number is not very important for basic tablet functions. Facebook, email, texting, and pictures all still work fine. They are more important for photo editing and graphics.

, There are many different places to purchase an Android tablet. A few are online stores, mobile carriers, and electronics stores. These will all have different ranges in deals and packages for different tablets. Make sure to compare pricing differences between each market.


Online markets can be unsafe. However, places like Ebay have user protection to safeguard user information and ensure that returns and refunds are enforced.
Online markets are also much more likely to have older, or more basic, tablets available than other markets.

, Do not simply pick up a tablet and buy it. Make sure to compare tablets to each other. Especially if price is important make sure not to jump at the first tablet that catches the eye. Here is a side-by-side comparison of two very different tablets. One will be an example of a budget/basic tablet, and the other will be high-end.

Update Windows Media Player on your PC.,
Add your files to the Windows Media Player library.,
Turn on your LG Smart TV.,
Turn on your DLNA server in Windows Media Player.,
Browse the shared files on your LG Smart TV.,
Start watching streaming content.,
The file I select won't play, or isn't appearing on the list.,
Video playback is choppy.,
Video playback is slow, or there are errors with audio or syncing.",How to Connect PC to LG Smart TV1," SmartShare is a program on your LG Smart TV that allows you to stream media files directly from your computer to your LG TV over your home network. This lets you watch movies or listen to music stored on your computer without having to transfer it using a USB drive or burn it to a DVD.


SmartShare works best when both the computer and TV are connected to your network via Ethernet cable. You can use it when one or both devices are connected wirelessly, but you may experience hitches or low-quality playback.;
, In order to stream your computer's media files to your LG Smart TV, you'll need to connect both the TV and the computer to the same home network.


For best streaming performance, both the TV and the computer should be connected to the router via Ethernet.

, This is a media program that comes installed with every copy of Windows. You can use Windows Media Player to share your media content with the LG TV. Updating Windows Media Player will ensure that you get the most stable experience.


You can find Windows Media Player in your Start menu, or by pressing ⊞ Win and typing ""windows media player"".
Click the Help menu in Windows Media Player and select ""Check for updates"". If you don't see the Help menu, press Alt.

, If you aren't already using Windows Media Player to play media files on your computer, you'll need to add the files that you want to share with the TV to your Windows Media Player library.


Click the ""Organize"" button at the top of the Media Player window.
Select ""Manage libraries"" and then select the type of content you want to add (Music, Videos, etc.).
Click Add... and select a folder that contains the media files you want to add. Repeat this for any other media folders.

, You'll need the TV turned on in order to allow it as a trusted device in Windows Media Player.

, Now that your library is full of the content you want to stream, you'll need to allow Windows Media Player to share it using a process called DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance). A DLNA server ""serves"" the files to your LG Smart TV over the network.Click the ""Stream"" button at the top of the Windows Media Player window.
Select ""Turn on media streaming"" and click the Turn on media streaming button.
Check the ""Allowed"" box next to your LG Smart TV in list of connected network devices.
Click OK to save your changes and start the DLNA server.

, Now that the DLNA server is running, you can use the TV to browse and play the files that are being shared.


Press the ""Home"" button on your TV remote.
Select the SmartShare from the menu.
Select your computer from the list of connected devices.

, After selecting your computer, you'll see a list of all the folders and media files in your Windows Media Player library. Select one to begin playing it.The computer running the DLNA server will need to be turned on and logged in in order to stream the files.

, This is most likely caused by an incompatible format. Windows Media Player works for streaming most files, but it can have difficulty with files like .mkv.


In order to play formats incompatible with Windows Media Player, you'll need to use an alternative media server such as PS3 Media Server. Despite its name, PS3 Media Server will stream to anything that supports DLNA, and can play virtually all file formats.

, This is likely caused by a problem with your network connection. If you're connecting your TV to your router wirelessly, you'll want to use a 5 GHz N connection. Ideally, everything should be connected using Ethernet.

, This may be caused by an overloaded CPU on your computer. When streaming media, try to ensure that there are no other programs running at the same time. Optimizing your computer's performance will help improve your streaming, especially for older computers.

Understand the process.,
Measure the distance from your computer to your TV.,
Get a cable that has room to move.,
Connect the HDMI cable to your PC and to one of the HDMI input ports on the TV.,
Note the label for the input port on the TV.,
Turn the TV on and switch to the proper input.,
Switch your computer screen to the TV.,
My computer doesn't have an HDMI port.,
I'm not seeing an image on the TV.,
I'm not getting any sound from my computer on the TV, or the sound is still coming from my computer speakers.",How to Connect PC to LG Smart TV2," You can use your LG TV as your computer's monitor and speakers by connecting your computer to the TV via HDMI. Nearly all modern computers have an HDMI port, though if you're using a Mac you'll likely need an adapter.


The HDMI cable will transmit both the digital HD image as well as the audio from your computer to the TV.

, Make sure to measure from the HDMI port on your computer to the HDMI port on the back of the TV, accounting for slack so that the cable can rest.


This will obviously be a bit simpler if you are connecting a laptop instead of a desktop, as you can place the laptop closer to the TV.
You can use HDMI to connect a HTPC (Home Theater PC), which is dedicated purely towards playing media on the TV.

, Take your measurement and get a cable that is at least a few feet longer. This will ensure that you have enough slack to work with if things need to be moved around.


There is very little difference in an HDMI cable that costs $5 and a cable that costs $70. Since HDMI is a digital signal, its either ""on"" or ""off"", and the cable doesn't affect signal quality. The difference in quality only becomes apparent with longer cables.
HDMI cables are compliant with standards up to 40 feet (12.2 m) in length. There are longer cables available that will technically still work, but they are likely not complying with standards. If you need to run HDMI over extremely long distances, you'll likely need an amp to boost the power.,


If you have a graphics card installed on your PC, you may have two HDMI ports. Connect the cable to the same location that your monitor is plugged into. For example, if your monitor is connected to a DVI port on your graphics card, connect the cable to the HDMI port on the graphics card.

, This will let you know what input to select when you turn the TV on.

, The HDMI inputs should be labeled ""HDMI"" on your input menu.

, Once the TV is turned on to the correct input, you can switch your screen over to it on your computer.


Press ⊞ Win+P and select the method that you want to the image to appear. You can send the entire image to the TV instead of your computer monitor, you can mirror the displays so that the same image is displayed on both, or you can extend your display so that the TV becomes an extension of your computer's desktop.

, If your computer doesn't have an HDMI port, your best bet will be to get a USB-to-HDMI converter. This will allow you to plug the converter into your computer's USB port and then connect an HDMI cable from the converter to the TV.

, There could be a couple of different issues that are causing this problem:


Check the HDMI connection on both the computer and the TV. Make sure the plug is connected securely on both.
Ensure that the TV is on the correct input, and that you've properly sent your computer's display to the TV using the ⊞ Win+P menu.

, Sometimes when you switch displays over HDMI, the audio output settings won't change automatically. You can manually change them so that audio comes from your TV.


Right-click the Volume icon in your system tray.
Select ""Playback devices"".
Select your TV from the list and click Set Default and then Apply.

Next, place your projector where you would like it to set.,
Now, connect your coaxial cable to your turner device.,
4 Lastly, this is more of a side note for your benefit.,
Finished.

",How to Connect Cable Tv to a Data Projector," Acquire your projector, another TV, digital cable box, or VCR/DVD combo. The extra TV, cable box, or VCR/DVD combo will be used as your channel selector. Also make sure that you get a sizable amount of digital input cables (Red, White, Yellow tipped cables; often seen on modern digital devices such as video game inputs.) so that you can run them from your channel turner to the projector for placement of your devices.;
, Now here is the most complicated part. (Its really easy!) Select turner device. If it is a TV, take the input cables and connect them to the ""out"" video cable slots on the back of the TV(Red, White, Yellow), then connect the other side of the cable to the video inputs on the data projector. If this is done properly one it has been set up the projector will display what is on the TV. If you are using a digital cable box it is even simpler. Just connect the input cables from the video ""out"" slots on the digital cable box, and the input video ""in"" slots on the projector. If you are using the VCR/DVD combo it works the same as the TV. Find the video ""out"" slots connect the cables to these slots (Once again they are Red, White, and Yellow; will have the word ""out"" underneath them), and then connect the other end of the cables to the projector ""in"" cable slots.

, If it is your TV, the coaxial plugs into your TV as if you are watching cable on your TV. The digital cable box will have a port for the coaxial cable and that is where you plug it in at. The VCR/DVD combo has a coaxial ""in"". Once the coaxial is in you should be able to tune to different channels via the cable box, TV, or VCR/DVD combo. Using the menu on your digital cable box, TV,or VCR/DVD combo; you can channel search to set up your channels. Note that if you are using a TV, the projector will only show what the TV shows. So if the TV is off, then the projector will give you a blank screen. Also make sure that the projector is set to the video input signal so that will pick up the images.(Do this by pressing the input button on the projector, or its remote until it shows the image or an indication of the input cable channel.)

, Most projectors that are cost efficient do not have high quality sound. If you have a sound source that you would like to use, such as a surround sound, simply unplug the RED and WHITE cable from the project(NOT FROM YOUR TUNING DEVICE) and plug them into the RED and WHITE audio ""in"" slots on the separate sound source. If you are using a surround sound, the slots will be provided and all you would have to do after plugging it in would be to turn on the surround sound, select the audio channel, and then the sound will come through the speakers of your surround of the TV that your watching.

You can do so by typing ""micro USB to HDMI"" into a search engine and selecting a pertinent option (e.g., something from Amazon).Make sure your device is compatible with your chosen cable before purchasing. You can do this by typing your device's name and the cable's name into a search engine and reviewing the results.
If you don't already have an HDMI cable, purchase one now. HDMI cables go for around $10 online.;
, This should fit into the charging port at the bottom of your phone., Your HDMI cable will fit in the opposite end of the converter., The roughly trapezoid-shaped HDMI port(s) should be on the back of your TV. HDMI ports usually have the word ""HDMI"" printed next to them.

Take note of which input is listed below the HDMI port (e.g., Video 3).
Your converter may come with a USB power cable. If your TV doesn't have a readily-available USB port near the HDMI port, you can plug the USB power cable into your Android charger unit.

,, How you do this will depend on your TV model, but you can usually do so by pressing the ""Input"" button on the top or side of your TV.

Determine your cable size.,
Choose the right connectors.",How to Connect Coaxial Cable Connectors1," Cable terminology can be confusing. Look on the side of your coaxial wire for the size designation. In most homes, the two most common sizes are RG-6 and RG-59.


RG stands for ""Radio Guide."" The numbers of the various versions of RG cable refer to the diameter (59 meaning .059, and 6 meaning .06, etc) and internal characteristics of the cable, including the amount of shielding and the cable's attenuation, which refers to how much signal loss there is per length of cable.
You may also see the term RF used with these cables, which stands for ""Radio Frequency.""
Most non-industrial coaxial cable is now known as RG-6, although the previous thinner lower-quality standard of RG-59 is still used in some applications and older homes. Commercial installers may use a thicker RG cable, like RG-11(which is only used if the distance from the source tap to your point of termination at the home is greater than 200 feet)
RG cables used in homes for ordinary purposes should be 75 ohm (RG-6 or RG-59).
Be aware that all cables (and their connectors) come in a variety of qualities. Get the best quality cable you can.;
, Most connectors for home video installations are made with F-Style connectors. However, it is possible your system uses N-type connectors.


Be aware that there are several types of F-type RG-6 cable available, primarily screw-on and crimp-style connectors.

Screw-on connectors are easy to use, but are less secure and can leave a small air pocket. Some people believe this may affect your signal quality.
Crimp-style connectors have two parts: a ring (or crimp) and a terminator. They are typically more difficult to install, but can attain the greatest lengths and best connections when used correctly.


Know that to make a connection you will need a male and a female connector of the same type.

Male connectors have the center wire sticking out, while female connectors have a space for the center wire to stick into. Be sure to use the opposite gender to the connector you will be making. Most cables end in male connectors.


Use an SMA (sub-miniature Version A) connector for very small coaxial cable.

Cut the cable flush.

,
Trim the outer cover (usually black rubber) back 1/2"".,
Carefully pull back the inner braiding (second channel) outside the outer cover.,
Trim back the (usually white, but may be clear) dielectric plastic from the inner core cable.,
Push the connector down over the cable end so that the copper core of the coaxial cable sticks out.,
Screw the connector into the end of the cable.",How to Connect Coaxial Cable Connectors2,",

Be very careful not to cut into the metal braiding directly beneath the outer housing. The braiding may be both ""loose"" wire and a foil-like metal present in shielded wire.

, Check to make sure none of the braided wire gets wrapped around or touches the copper center conductor.

,


Be absolutely sure not to scratch or nick the center conductor. Any damage to this conductor can severely impact your signal.

,


Be sure the dielectric (aluminum foil) is trimmed so that it does not enter into the terminator of the connector.

, The thread will cut into the outer housing and wrap the shielding weave, making a tight fit.

"
"
Place the crimp ring over the cable end.

,
Trim the outer cover back about 1/4"".

,
Trim the shielding, wire wrap and dielectric back to the bare inner wire.

,
Leave about 1/8"" of dielectric.

,
Place the terminator over the end of the wire so the copper core sticks out through the hole.

,
Push the crimp-style connector down into the cable end so that the tube of the connector goes between the foil and the outer housing.,
Crimp the ring around the outside of the cable.

,
Trim any loose wires.

,
Cut the inner core wire flush with the end of the connector.

,
Tug on the connector to make sure it is attached.

Determine which of the following computers you want to hook up to the television.,
Look in the back of your television to find what type of visual cable you can use.,
Buy the appropriate cables and adapters.,
Make sure that you order cables that are long enough to reach between your television and computer, while still allowing you to access your computer.

,

Use your television remote to scroll through the types of input.,
Look at the picture that appears on your computer.,
Stream videos and other content by bringing it up on your computer.",How to Connect a Computer to a TV," The type of computer will determine the type of cable and/or adapter you need.


If you have a laptop computer, look at the port in the side and/or back of the computer. Older laptops may have a VGA port, a rectangular port with about 15 pins that is used to hook the laptop up to a monitor or an S-port, a small round port. Newer laptops may have DVI ports, or you can use a USB adapter to connect newer laptops to the cable that connects to the television.
If you have desktop computer, you can use your VGA port to hook up your computer to your TV. This is the port that you use to connect the monitor. You may also have an S-port option, with the small round port.
If you have an Apple computer, you can order an adapter to hook up to the DVI port, USB port, Firewire or Thunderbolt ports and the video cable. Check your owner's manual to determine what is available to you. USB adapters will be the least expensive option, followed by Firewire and Thunderbolt.;
, You will look for the ""input"" options, of which there may be several.


If you see a round port with about 7 pins, this is an S-video input (similar to the round port on a laptop or desktop computer). You will need an S-video cable if both computer and TV have S-ports, or you can use an S-port to USB/mini-DVI adapter in combination with the S-video cable.
If you see a rectangular port, like the 1 you use for hooking up computer monitors, then you will need a VGA cord. If the VGA port is only available on 1 end, use a VGA to USB/mini-DVI cable adapter to connect the computer to the VGA cable.
If you see a smaller rectangular port, this is most likely a mini-DVI port. This has a rectangular side with pins that will connect to the TV and a mini-DVI or HDMI port, like that used with most cell phones and digital cameras that will connect to your computer.
If you have a rectangular input with square holes, this is a DVI port. A DVI port will often connect using a cable that has a mini-DVI port on the other end.
Lastly, newer TVs and computers usually use an HDMI cable. Unlike all the other cables, this transfers video and audio from the computer to the TV. Usually, you will not need an adapter, unless you do not have a HDMI port in your laptop.

,


Search for the right cables online using terms like ""VGA to DVI cable."" If your terms bring up an adapter, you will probably need to buy a video cable and adapter.
If you are using any port other than an HDMI cable, you will need an audio cable. The audio cable will hook up to your laptop's headphone jack or a speaker jack on your desktop.

,, Your computer is more likely to recognize the TV if you turn it on with the cables plugged in.

, String it around to where your computer is located.

,


Connect the adapter to the video cable, if you are using an adapter.
If using an audio cable, insert the audio cable in the audio port in the back of the TV. String the other end of the audio cable toward your computer and connect it to the speaker or headphone jack on the computer.

, Wait a few minutes. Turn on your computer.

, You will select ""HDMI"" or ""Video Port"" to activate the computer connection.

, If it has a distorted image, adjust the aspect ratio on your computer.


To change the aspect ratio, you will need to go to your computer's system and display set ups. This is usually available through ""My Computer"" and ""Display"" on a Windows Computer and ""System Preferences"" and ""Display"" on a Mac.
Mac systems will usually adjust automatically to a video connection.

, It should now play on your television.

Determine existing PC hardware.,
Determine the existing outputs of cable or satellite set top box.,
Locate an NTSC (or newer, ATSC) Tuner / Capture card (referred to as a ""tuner card"" forward).,
Use a USB tuner if no slot is available or it is desired to not enter the PC case.,
Consider an ATSC tuner card if you are able to receive digital broadcasts via antenna from a nearby digital TV broadcaster.,
Install the tuner hardware and software in the PC.,
Connect any additional sources to the tuner card as desired.

",How to Receive Satellite Signals (and Other Sources) on a PC," Determine if there are unused High Speed (2.0) USB ports. Open the computer (after shutting down) and check for unused expansion slots and type. Most common slot types in modern PCs are PCI and PCI Express. An unused AGP slot will not be suitable. Use the image below to help identify slots. Click on any image for an enlarged view.;
, If using a cable or satellite converters to provide TV signals, inspect the back of these devices. There will likely be a range of output jacks from which to choose. Use the image to help identify the jacks listed below:


Coaxial or RF - This provides a single threaded jack that usually produces both a 480i Standard Definition (SDTV) video and audio (mono) signal on TV channel 3 or 4. This jack looks like the one used to connect cable from dish or cable company to the set top box.
Composite - This is a single yellow jack and can output an SDTV video signal only.
S-Video - This single jack output provides video signals of slightly better quality than coaxial and composite.
Component - This is a red, green and blue jack output of 480i SDTV and 480p EDTV (Enhanced Definition), 720p, 1080i and 1080p HDTV (High Definition) video only.
HDMI - This single jack provides uncompressed resolutions of SDTV through HDTV video signals and high quality digital audio (though not Dolby Digital 5.1 signals) in a single cable.

, Obtain a tuner card with a matching (a) slot type (PCI or PCI Express) and (b) matching input signal / jack type to the cable or satellite output / jack type.

, Disregard matching the slot type if using the USB interface. Only the coaxial jack (or RF) includes both audio and video over the same cable (the HDMI jack will pass both audio and video as well, but as of this writing, no such tuner card offers HDMI inputs). In all other cases, separate audio cables will be required to patch from the set top box into PC sound card (or tuner if equipped). This is done by connecting the set top box's red & white (to provide left & right stereo audio signals) into the computer sound card, or connecting a SPDIF jack (either fiber optic or standard styles) if installed on both the set top box and the computer. The SPDIF connection will provide 5.1 Dolby Digital audio signals out should be used if the computer has more than just two speakers, otherwise inexpensive stereo cables will work nearly as well. Currently, tuner cards support one or more coaxial, composite and s-video jacks. An inexpensive NTSC tuner card is all that is needed for any of the arrangements described above. The tuner card is not limited to receiving only cable or satellite set top box signals - any compatible source and jack combination may be connected such as VCR, DVD, Video Camera, etc., with matching connectors

, ATSC tuners are the new TV standard in the US after February 2009, when analog TV signals are scheduled to cease. Older, NTSC tuner cards will become cheaper as retailers try to rid their shelves of obsolete products. But, most ATSC tuner cards are backward compatible to NTSC, and will allow viewing of the new, digital (and HDTV) signals. If equipped with the necessary jacks, it will allow input of any of the other signal sources listed above. An ATSC tuner connected via USB should not be connected to the older, slower ""Full Speed"" (version 1.1) USB ports. High Speed (version 2.0) ports connected directly to the motherboard or expansion card are ideal (do not use a multi-port hub).

, Install as per the manufacturer's instructions to complete installation.

Now align the dish to Hotbird 13° E. First set the right elevation for your location.,
Get the best signal as possible.,
Now, if you found the satellites and have enough signal, you can do a channel scan on both satellites.

",How to Install a Monoblock Lnb," You should have an 80 centimeter (31.5 in) dish without multi feed adaptor.;
, It's very important that you mount the left device on the dish, if you stand behind the dish an look into the sky. The left eye should now be in the center of the dish. This points to HotBird 13°E

, Most Monolock LNBs use DiEqC A/1 for Hotbird and DiEqC B/2 for Astra.

,, There are several websites to find out the proper elevation for your location. Then move the dish slightly from south to south-east until you have signal strength and signal quality on your receiver. You should find signal indicator in the same menu as you can set the DiEqC settings.

, You should reach at least 80% signal strength and quality to get a good signal.

Use a soft, lint-free cloth to remove fingerprints and smudges.,
If you must use a liquid, spray-- a minimal amount of--the cleaning solution on the soft cloth, not on the screen.",How to Clean a Plasma TV Screen1," It may recommend a particular product or method that is best suited for your particular TV.

, Doing this is not necessary, but it's preferred, especially if you're going to use a cleaning solution spray. Since Plasma TVs use more power than and generate more heat than LCD TVs, it is best to turn it off AND allow ample time for the unit to cool to the touch before attempting to clean the screen. Failure to do this may cause your cleaning solution to evaporate before it has had enough time to remove any dust, dirt, or contaminants on your screen.Some sources suggest unplugging the TV.

, Avoid wood-based products (paper towels, toilet paper, tissues) because they can scratch the screen. If stubborn dirty spots persist, go to the next step. However, be advised that some manufacturers, such as Pioneer, recommend no liquid at all on the front of their plasmas, lest it seep into the plasma display.

, If the moistened cloth is not cleaning sufficiently, you can spray additional SMALL amounts on the cloth. At no time do you want the cloth wet to the point where the solution drips or runs down the screen! See previous point for the reason why. Use either just distilled water or non-ammonia or non-alcohol-based window cleaner. Ammonia and alcohol are substances which will eventually cloud any plastic with microscopic ""crazing,"" with the effect of hazing and dimming the displayed image. After wiping the screen gently, follow up with a dry cloth.

Have a basic understanding on why 3D technology can fatigue you.,
Understand the importance of always using caution with any new technology.,
Take care with children's use of 3D technology in the home.,
Enforce breaks for all users, whatever their age.,
Monitor yourself and listen to your body.,
Have patience.",How to Protect Yourself from 3D Fatigue," 3D imaging works by sending different image information to each eye, to create the illusion of depth.The reality is that the 3D technology requires that your sense of depth perception needs constant tricking. In so doing, your eyes keep trying to refocus, and cannot succeed, but keep trying to do so. Your eye muscles become fatigued and your brain begins to tire from the confusion.The exact intricacies involved are far more complex and if you're interested, it's a good idea to do deeper research.;
, While technology is wonderful when used correctly and in a balanced manner, over-use and misuse of technology is the bane of our lives. We cannot thrive if we overload our senses, lose our sense of time, or abandon our creativity to constant technological stimulation. For this reason, be cautious when adopting 3D technology in your home, for all users. Realize the impact of 3D technology will take years to unfold and being wise in the process of using it will ensure that your usage is healthy.

, Children under your care are your responsibility and their potential vulnerability to over-use and over-stimulation by 3D technology is something you must be careful about.


Ensure that use of 3D technology is moderate. With your children's senses still under development, the precautionary approach suggests using common sense and not overdoing exposure to 3D technology.
Monitor the usage and behavior of all children to determine good exposure levels that work for your children. If you see any behavioral changes that are not healthy or normal by the standards of your own child, pull the plug or minimize/police usage.
Consider not allowing very young children to use 3D technology at all. At what age you draw the line is up to your parenting decisions but consider the maturity, developmental stage, emotional stability, and any addictive tendencies of your child when reaching your decision. Speak with health professionals for guidance about any concerns you have.

, Give your brain and eyes a rest by taking frequent breaks to do something else entirely:


Consider practicing an eye refocusing exercise, such as exercises suggested for taking breaks from computer screens.

Stretch your whole body. Go for a walk, do some stretches, run up and down the stairs, do something to stretch all your muscles.
Change the pace. Go and read, have a nap, ring up a friend and talk on the phone, write a poem, clean your teeth, water the plants, walk the dog, etc. Give yourself a real change of pace break.

, Every person's reaction to constant stimuli differs. If you find yourself reacting badly, you will need to take additional precautions. For example, if you find yourself losing a sense of reality, experiencing migraines or seizures, feeling nauseous, etc., you have found your own personal limitations that require immediate attention.


Seek medical advice immediately for serious issues such as seizures, migraines, etc.
Limit time spent with 3D technology if you are experiencing any sensations of reality change. Talk to your doctor or health specialist if needed.
If you are a highly sensitive person (HSP), or somebody who is easily overwhelmed by external stimuli, you might need to take extra care when using 3D technology.

, Devin Coldewey advises that it might be a good idea to opt out until the technology improves.Given that the quality of the products involved in home 3D technology is still under development, it's wise advice. Delay your gratification for the sake of a healthier, more enjoyable experience later.

",How to Clean an LCD Television,"


As a general rule of thumb most manufacturers do not recommend using alcohol or ammonia based cleaners which can have a chemical reaction with the device surface. The other hazard comes from detergents that use abrasives as the cleaning agent.;
,

, Micro cleaning cloths are the best but you can use any soft cloth that does not replace the smudges and debris with lint. Spray a small amount of your cleaning solution on to the cloth.

, (Repeating this step maybe required if this is the first time you have cleaned your 2 year old device). Once you have the debris on the rag start turning the rag to a fresh surface and continue to wipe up any leftover cleaning solution. Each time you turn the rag to a new surface wipe with just a little less pressure on the screen. At this stage you are really polishing away any streaks left by the cleaning solution.

, We recommend that you rinse or wash the cloth out occasionally. Our clothes are dryer safe but we tend to lose them with the single sock so air drying is our preferred method.

Turn off the device and let it cool.,
Dust the screen with a microfiber cloth.,
Wipe off the area around the screen with the cloth.",How to Clean a Plasma Screen1," Before you touch the screen, it needs a chance to cool down. You may wish to unplug it too, particularly if you plan on using liquid anywhere on the device. Give the screen five minutes to cool. After waiting, move your hand close to the screen. Eventually, you won’t feel any heat when you touch it., Use only a soft, lint-free cloth or else you can scratch the delicate screen. Wipe the dry cloth over the screen to remove dust and fingerprints. Unless you have stubborn stains, this will be enough to clean the screen.Even paper towels are too abrasive to risk using on plasma screens.

, Use the same cloth from before to remove dust and debris from the rest of the device. Avoid using liquid if possible, since the liquid can drip into the device and onto the screen.

Dry the screen with a clean cloth.",How to Clean a Plasma Screen2," For stubborn stains, you will have to use water. Load lukewarm water into a spray bottle and spray it onto the cloth. Alternatively, dip the cloth into lukewarm water and squeeze out excess moisture.Distilled water is better to use than tap water. Tap water, even after filtration, contains minerals and chemicals that can build up on the screen over time.Never spray liquid directly onto the screen.

, Pass the cloth over the screen. Most stains will come off without you having to press down on the screen. Continue to wipe the screen using minimal pressure until the stain is completely removed.

, For the worst stains, you can add a squirt of a gentle detergent, such as Dawn, to your water. Spray the cleaner onto the cloth or dip the cloth into the water. Wring out excess moisture before use., In large quantities, isopropyl alcohol can damage the screen. In a pinch, however, it can remove tough stains. Dilute it into a cleaning mixture by adding one part isopropyl alcohol to four parts water. Dampen a soft cloth with the mixture and use it to wipe off the stain.Vinegar can be substituted in for isopropyl alcohol. However, it dries slower.Other strong, abrasive substances such as ammonia and benzene will certainly damage the display. Check the label on any liquids you intend on applying to the screen.Commercial cleaners for plasma screens are available. Some include isopropyl alcohol in the mixture, so consult the label first.

, Use water or the gentle detergent mixture for clean the rest of the device. Dip the cloth into the water, making sure to wring out the excess. If the cloth drips, it will leave water that can run into the device or back onto the screen. Wipe the cloth gently over the surfaces of the device.

, Take another microfiber cloth and wipe it over the screen. Dry off the rest of the device as well with the cloth. Make sure all moisture has evaporated or been picked up by the cloth. Once the screen is completely dry, you may turn the screen back on.

Wipe off the screen regularly.,
Keep the vents clear of dust.,
Turn off the screen when not in use.",How to Clean a Plasma Screen3," Whenever dust and fingerprints begin to accumulate, wipe the screen off with a soft cloth. This will keep the picture as clear as possible. Also, remove stains before they have time to settle. This way, you won’t have to depend on liquid cleaners., Wipe the box of the device with a soft cloth to remove all dust. Anything blocking the vents disturbs the device’s ability to cool. TVs, for example, that are well-ventilated last longer.

, Plasma screens suffer from burn-in, which happens when the screen’s pixels are damaged. Do not pause images on the screen and leave them on there for more than ten minutes. Also, keep brightness levels as low as possible and turn down the contrast level in dim light."

Read the owner's manual.,
Turn the screen off.,
Start with a dry microfiber cloth.,
Dampen the cloth.",How to Clean a LED Screen1," Most devices with LED screens come with an owner's manual. That manual will often describe the best method to clean the screen, as well as the best cleaner to use. It will also tell you what to avoid. If you can't find your manual, you can often find it online by searching with the product number., LED screens do heat up some when they're on, so it's best to turn them off before cleaning. Let it sit for a while until it's cool. Doing so can make it easier to clean, as some of the static electricity will dissipate, which in turn will help release the dust., Rub the screen down in gentle circles using just a microfiber cloth. The cloth will likely pick up most of the smudges on your screen, as it is able to pick up both dirt and oil. If it's not working, you may need to add water next.Scrub gently. If your screen is extra smudged, you may be tempted to really put some elbow grease into it. However, LED screens can be fairly sensitive, so don't press down hard. If you press too hard, you could end up with a cracked screen.Using paper towels or sponges you have around the house can damage the screen. A microfiber cloth is soft enough not to scratch the surface, but it is both able to hold water and capture oil, which are good qualities in a cleaning cloth. Plus, its fibers easily remove dirt. A soft, lint-free cloth will also work.
Start with a clean cloth, as dirt in the cloth can scratch the surface.Make sure you don't use fabric softener on the cloths, though, as that can lead to a layer on the cloth that will inhibit cleaning.

, Add some water to the cloth. Wring out any excess liquid. You don't want so much water that the cloth is sopping. Rub down the screen in gentle circles with the cloth, focusing on areas that are particularly smudged.Never spray water or cleaner directly on the screen, as it can seep into areas it's not supposed to go.

When it's extra smudged, try adding a tiny bit of dish-washing soap. Dilute it heavily. Even a single drop in a cup of water may be enough., Dip a new cloth in the cleaner, as you've already picked up a lot of dirt with the last cloth. You can also spray the cleaner onto the cloth instead of dipping. Wring out any excess, and rub down the screen in a circular motion. This method should remove any smudges that are left., If you can't get into the corners with your cloth, a cotton swab may solve the problem. Put a bit of cleaner on the swab, and rub it into the corners to get out the smudges."

However, window cleaner is fairly strong, stronger than what you want for cleaning an LED screen. It can strip the sensitive surface, so it's best to avoid it., When browsing electronic cleaners, avoid any that don't specifically say they are alcohol- and ammonia-free. While some sites recommend using equal parts of isopropyl alcohol and water on LED screens, the truth is any alcohol or ammonia may strip the coating off your screen., If you use a cleaner that your manual specifically says not to use, that will likely void your warranty. Reading your manual ahead of time can save you a lot of grief in the future if you ever need to take your electronic device in for repairs."

Take the room where you will be watching your new television into consideration.,
Check out the size of your viewing room.,
If mobility is important, make sure that the stand is on wheels and is of a size that is easy to move around the room.,
For many people, the price of the unit may also be a factor.",How to Choose an Lcd Tv Stand," Flat screen tv stands come in a variety of elegant styles and choosing the right one will complement your viewing environment. Since LCD TVs usually comes in a wider variety of sizes than plasma TVs, their stands also come in a wider variety of sizes. An important factor in deciding on the right stand is in matching the furnishings already in your room. Rooms with a more contemporary design would be suitable for modern glass tv stands or stands made of brushed metal. Black tv stands tend to look more high-tech as well. Wood stands made of materials like oak, may be more suitable for homes with more traditional designs and furnishings.;
, This is an important factor when shopping for either LCD or plasma TV stands. Depending on the layout your room, corner stands may be the ideal choice. They are designed to fit nicely in a corner of a room while taking up only as much space as necessary. You could also opt for a swivel stand, though they may require a little more space between the wall and the tv set up. It can be really handy to have your tv on a swivel to enable you to turn the TV in any direction for better viewing angles, no matter where you are in your room.

, Perhaps you'll even want to move your television around to different rooms in the house.

, Flat panel tv stands range in price from around $100 and can go as high as a few thousand dollars. There are some amazing and classy units out there which can cost a pretty penny. Cheap LCD TV stands aren't hard to find either, but be careful about sacrificing quality in order to save a few dollars. The stand that you choose must be able to support the weight of your flat screen TV. Make sure that you check the manual that comes with your TV and find out how much it weighs. Then look at the specifications of the stand that you're considering in order to be certain that it can support the weight of the television.

Follow the directions carefully, paying particular attention to any warnings against particular chemical cleaners.Be aware that following a cleaning procedure not listed in the manual, or using prohibited chemicals, could result in your warranty being voided.;
, To safely work on your TV, you’ll need to disconnect it from any electricity, especially if you are planning to use a liquid cleaner. This protects you if any liquid makes it into the casing. Turning off the power will also make the screen go dark, which will help you to see any dust or debris., With a TV this size, you do not want to risk it falling on you during the cleaning process. If your TV is mounted to the wall, check the connections before proceeding. If your TV is on a stand, make sure that it does not wobble if you apply light pressure to the screen. With a smaller TV you might be able to lay it down before cleaning, but this is not generally a good idea with a big screen model.

, After you unplug the TV, let it sit for at least five minutes before cleaning. Modern TVs do not generate as much electricity and warmth as earlier models. However, they do heat up slightly when turned on and this heat can cause dirt and grime to stick to the surface. Allowing for a cooling period will reduce the dust and the build-up of static electricity., You may have received a cloth when you bought the TV or you can buy a quality cloth in the automotive care or electronics sections of any general store, such as Target. A microfiber cloth is ideal because it absorbs oil and debris in a very gentle way. It is less likely to scratch a TV like a paper towel or rough towel might do.Make sure that the cloth is a large enough size so that you can cover the entire TV’s surface. For example, many doctors will give you a small microfiber cloth for glasses, but these are too small to use in this case.To keep your microfiber cloths in the best shape, wash them after each use without adding fabric softener., Once you have a proper cloth, go slowly and wipe over the surface of the TV. Look at the cloth to see how much dirt or grime you are removing. When you’ve wiped down the screen once, stand back to see if you need to do another round. This method will not work as well if the dirt is heavy. Instead, you should use a dry wipe down in the same way that you would a quick dusting., Get a spray bottle and fill it with some warm, distilled water. Or, take a bottle of lukewarm distilled water and drip a bit on a microfiber cloth. Your goal is to make the cloth damp, not soaking wet. Use this damp cloth to then wipe down the screen.Distilled water is the best to use as it contains fewer minerals and deposits. If you use tap water, then the deposits can stick to the screen and attract even more dirt over time.

, If your application of water doesn’t have the desired effect, then make a mixture from half vinegar and half distilled water. Dampen the cloth with this mixture and re-wipe the grimiest areas. Try not to use this too often, however, as it can prove abrasive to the TV screen.Depending on the manufacturer recommendations, you may also be able to use a mixture made from distilled water and fabric softener or dishwashing liquid.If you use any type of mixed cleaner, it is a good idea to go over the screen once more with a cloth dampened by water only.

, Do not spray whatever cleaning mixture you use directly onto the screen of the TV. Instead, place the cloth in your hand and spritz a bit onto it from a bottle. This will allow you to control the dampness of the screen. It will also keep liquid from running down into the frame area., It may seem like a simple solution, but don’t use cleaning wipes unless they are specifically designed for big screen TVs. Cleaners or cleaning wipes with alcohol can prove too harsh on the screen and can lead to discoloration. Windex is also too harsh, unless you purchase the Windex cleaner made specifically for TVs., As you wipe the screen, apply enough pressure so that some of the moisture transfers. Keep your touch light and move from area to area. Resist the urge to press heavily on deeply soiled areas as this can damage the screen’s pixels. Instead, do multiple light cleanings until the grime comes off., You usually go with circular motions when cleaning glass or other smooth surfaces. However, for a TV, it is best to wipe from side-to-side in a methodical way. You can also add in a layer of top to bottom wiping, if needed. This ensures that you cover the entire surface of the TV and it allows you to keep the pressure even., When you are finished, it is best to use a dry cloth to wipe down the TV’s surface. Remove any moisture and then leave it to air dry. Wait until the TV is completely dry before you plug it back in and turn it on., It is a good idea to have a designated cloth, or multiple ones, just for use on the TV frame areas. It is likely that the frame and accessories will accumulate more dirt and grime and you don’t want to take the chance of transferring these materials onto the screen during a later cleaning. Again, a microfiber cloth is the best type to use.If you clean your frame area every week or so, you should be able to do so without using a liquid cleaner. It will be enough to dust with a fresh cloth., The remote is probably one of the dirtiest parts of a TV, as it is used regularly and has a great deal of contact with your hands. You can wipe down the remote using a dry cloth. However, you may need to dampen it a bit with water or vinegar in order to remove any deep dirt. A vinegar mixture will also help to sanitize the remote., If you can remove the coverings on your speakers, then you can lightly go over them with a lint roller or vacuum attachment. If the speaker coverings cannot be removed, then take a damp cloth and lightly wipe over them to remove dust."

Check the television sticker.,
Search the internet for the manufacturer and model number.,
Choose the peripherals you want to connect.,
Use HDMI connectors if your television supports it.,
Use optical cables for older audio receivers.,
Component cables are the next best for digital sets.,
Add a converter box.,
For analog sets, prefer S-video connectors.,
Use composite RCA connectors for older sets.,
Forget the gold-plated cables.",How to Choose the Best Cables to Get the Most from Your Television," Look on the back or side for a sticker that shows the manufacturer, model number, serial number, and date of manufacturer. For example, you may find that your television is a Samsung J5500.;
, The inputs and outputs technical specifications tell you what audio and video connectors are used for that model. Look for these input and output jacks on the back of the television. Digital televisions have HDMI input jacks while analog sets have coaxial, RCA, or S-video connectors. In the example, the Samsung J5500 includes HDMI, component in, and composite in connections plus Dolby Digital and DTS Studio Sound audio., While your television supports a variety of devices, you may only want to connect the ones you actually own. For those, check the stickers, look up the technical specifications, and see what input and output jacks are on the peripheral. With what you have learned about your television and components, you are ready to choose the right connectors.

, High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) cables are preferred to connect your television with your audio receiver, DVD or Blu-ray Disk deck, newer game consoles, and other devices with an HDMI or mini-HDMI port. The HDMI signal conveys the highest definition video plus digital audio signals, ranging from stereo up to eight channels of 24-bit audio.

, While both HDMI and optical cables, also called TOSLINK, carry digital audio, including support for Dolby Digital, only HDMI can carry the higher resolution audio, including the formats found on Blu-ray decks: Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio. However, optical cables are not affected by electrical problems such as ground loops or radio frequency interference. Always prefer HDMI since it carries both video and audio in one cable. Use optical cables for older receivers or speaker sound bars that do not support HDMI., Component cables, also called YPbPr, provide signal separation so that the displayed television image is nearly identical to the original image, unlike S-video that uses color multiplexing. Component cables end in color-coded RCA connectors: green for Y, blue for Pb/Cb, and red for Pr/Cr.

, To receive digital over-the-air television channels on an analog television, use a digital-to-analog converter box, also called a digital TV adapter. Run coaxial cable from the television antenna to the converter box and then to your peripherals. For older sets, you may need 2-way splitters to send the television signal to your television and other devices. , They provide better image quality than composite video but lower color resolution than component video. The four-pin mini-DIN cable carries two synchronized signals: Luminance (called Y or luma signal), a black-and-white wide-bandwidth television signal, and Chrominance (called C or chroma signal), containing the color information of the video. The audio channels require their own separate RCA cables.

, The RCA connector uses three color-coded wires to carry separate audio and video signals, yellow for composite video, red for the right audio channel and white or black for the left audio channel. These cables are widely used with analog VCR and DVD decks and older game consoles.

, If a low-priced DVI, HDMI, or optical cable transmits a signal to your television, then it works and there is no reason to buy a more expensive cable. Look online for the best deals on connector cables."

Call DIRECTV.,
Inform the representative you want to cancel.,
Ask the representative about important details.",How to Cancel DIRECTV2," By calling, you’ll be able speak to a representative about canceling your subscription. Calling is the only way to cancel traditional service. In addition, when calling you may be able to get information about your account that is not available on the internet.

Call customer service at 1-800-531-5000.
You’ll likely have to hold 5 to 10 minutes, depending on when you call.
Consider calling during low call volume time, such as between 10am to 2pm on week days.
Follow the prompts of the automated system. They’ll direct you to representatives who specialize in helping customers who want to start, upgrade, downgrade, or cancel service., After waiting, you’ll be connected to a DIRECTV customer service representative. The representative will likely specialize in customer retention and will ask you questions and try to stop you from cutting off your service.

Be polite.
Tell the representative that you want to cancel your DIRECTV. For instance, say “I’ve decided that I no longer need DIRECTV service.
The customer service rep will ask you why you’re canceling. Be honest with them. If it’s because you’re switching to wired cable, tell them.
They may offer you alternative packages., Once you’ve made it clear that you do indeed want to cancel, you need to ask the representative about any specifics related to your cancelation of service. These specifics will help you settle questions associated with no longer having service and settling your account.


Find out when your cancelation will be effective in terms of service. For example, will you lose service on the same day? In addition, find out when you will no longer be billed for service.
Inquire about the details of cancelation fees. This fee ranges from $15 to $250, depending on the amount of time left on your contract.
Inquire about the specific pieces of equipment you’ll have to return.
Ask if the representative can give you a preliminary account statement balance. This will address whether you owe money or if you have a credit on your account."
"
Disconnect your DIRECTV equipment.,
Return your equipment.,
Check your final bill.",How to Cancel DIRECTV3," After canceling, you’ll want to disconnect your equipment from your TV. By disconnecting the equipment, you’ll make sure you are ready to return it.

Make sure to disconnect all receivers and remotes and collect them together.
If you rented any other equipment, like a video recording device or an internet router, you’ll have to disconnect that as well., DIRECTV will inform you about how you can return your equipment. If you don't return it, you'll be assessed fees.

If you’re returning your equipment by mail, they may provide you with a return kit and instructions on how to prepare your return. Make sure you follow the instructions and pack your equipment correctly.
Depending on where you live, you may be able to drop your kit off at an ATT or DIRECTV location or affiliate near you. Search the internet, the DIRECTV website, or ask customer service if the company has a location near you.
You usually have 21 days to return DIRECTV's property., After you’ve returned your equipment, you’ll receive a final statement from DIRECTV. Your final statement will detail all charges and inform you of whether you need to make a payment to the company. The statement will detail:

Final service charges.
Charges associated with lost equipment.
Cancellation fees.
Credits to your account."
"
Time your cancellation.,
Be polite.,
Inform the representative of the contract's language.,
Escalate the call.",How to Cancel DIRECTV4," If you cancel at the right time, you may be able to avoid a cancellation fee. This will ultimately depend on your billing cycle, how long you've had your service, and when you're slated to renew your contract.

If DIRECTV informs you of a rate hike, they may also allow you to cancel your service without a fee. This often occurs in December.
Cancel at the end of your contract. If you cancel right before your contract is up, there either won't be a fee or it will be really small. Most contracts are one or two years long, so pay attention when renewal time comes around.

, When calling to cancel, you should always be extremely polite to the customer service representative. This is important, as representatives (and their supervisors) may have discretion when it comes to waiving your cancelation fee.

Ask them how they are doing when they inquire the same of you.
Tell them ""thank you"" when appropriate.
Don't groan, complain, use profanity, or insult the representative.

, If the representative denies your initial request to waive the fee, read them the contract. There is specific language in the contract which indicates that the company has discretion over whether it will assess a fee.

Read the most important clause to the representative. It reads: ""you may be subject to an early cancellation fee if you agreed to a programming agreement with DIRECTV."" This clause suggests that they do not have to charge you., If the representative says they're not allowed to waive the fee, escalate the call by asking to speak to their supervisor. The supervisor might have abilities that the initial representative did not.

Inform the supervisor that you enjoy DIRECTV's service and may sign up with them again in the future.
If they tell you they can't waive the fee, ask them to reduce it.
Inform the supervisor that the contract was confusingly worded.
Threaten to contact the Better Business Bureau or the Federal Communications Commission about DIRECTV's misrepresentation of its service contract."

Check the number of ports.",How to Choose an HDTV," If you are putting an HDTV in an existing home theater cabinet, make sure you know the maximum size that will fit. Measure the TV enclosure diagonally, as this is how HDTVs are measured. For example, a 50"" HDTV is 50"" from corner to corner, but is less than that horizontally.;
, As you get further away from the TV, the recommended size increases for best picture and viewing experience. While you will still be able to enjoy your TV from anywhere in the room, you can get the best experience by optimizing your screen placement and seating arrangements. When it comes to distance from the TV vs. size, THX recommends:


3.5–5 feet (1.1–1.5 m): 35"" class
4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m): 40"" class
5–7.5 feet (1.5–2.3 m): 50"" class
6–9 feet (1.8–2.7 m): 60"" class

, Mounting larger TVs requires larger brackets, which can make the mounting more expensive. Wall-mounting TVs can be difficult, especially for larger models since you need to really ensure that the mount is securely fastened.

, While the ""bigger is better"" mentality may be a little outdated, one of the most common complaints from new TV buyers is that they should have purchased a bigger model. If you can afford it, consider bumping up to the next size class.

, Traditional LCD TVs use CCFL lighting to show the pixels on the screen. LED TVs use LEDs to light up the LCD display. So in essence, they are the same type of TV with different lighting configurations. LED TVs typically provide better color and picture quality than CCFL LCDs, and are also much more efficient. LCDs, on the other hand, are typically the cheapest TVs available.

, An edge-lit LED is thinner and cheaper than a backlit, but since the lighting only comes from the edges, it can lead to a slightly washed-out picture. Backlit LEDs are slightly thicker and more expensive, but will give a much more uniform and clearer picture quality.

, Plasma TVs in general are not being produced anymore, with the exception of LG and Samsung. This means you will likely see few or no plasma models on the showroom floor of your local electronics store.Many people still consider plasmas superior, as they provide better picture quality and look the best in dark rooms. They are also viewable from the most angles. They are often heavier and more power-hungry than the other models, and suffer from the worst glare in bright rooms.

, 3D TVs were a big thing a few years ago, but support is starting to fade. Networks that embraced 3D such as ESPN have started to drop support, and 3D has become less of a selling point for home movies. You can still find plenty of 3D TVs, and if you're a fan, the lower prices mean now is the best time to buy.

, The two main resolutions for HDTVs are 720P and 1080P Both of these are considered ""HD"", though 1080P is sometimes called ""True HD"". Most 1080P TVs can switch to 720P mode depending on the input. Not everyone can tell the difference between the two, but 1080P will result in a clearer, sharper picture.


The larger your TV, the more noticeable the difference between 720P and 1080P will become.
720P-only TVs have largely been phased out, except in the smallest models.

, These have 4 times the pixels of a 1080P TV, and the sharpness difference can be startling. You may need to be viewing from a specific distance in order to actually see the difference, and a lot rests on the viewers visual acuity.


There isn't much out there yet that takes advantage of 4K. TV channels are not yet being broadcast in UHD, and when they do they will require new hardware to convert the signals. Netflix has a very limited selection of 4K content, and only a few Blu-rays have been treated to a 4K remaster. At this point, buying a 4K TV is more future-proofing than anything. 1080P content will still look great on your UHD TV., You won't get HD picture from a VHS player, and only certain devices are capable of outputting at 4K. Not all TV channels broadcast at the same resolution. The PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii U are the only video game consoles that can output at 1080P. Computers with high-end video cards can output resolutions even higher than 4K UHD.

, The majority of specifications, especially the contrast and refresh rate, are designed to confuse and overwhelm the consumer. They largely don't mean anything on paper, and differences should only be checked by comparing models in person.

, When looking at HDTVs in person, check the compare the contrast settings for a few models. There is no industry standard for measuring contrast, so specifications mean virtually nothing when compared against each other on paper.Contrast is one of the most important factors in picture quality. It is the difference between the darkest black and the brightest white that the TV can display. If the TV can produce a large range between the two, you will be able to see more at the intended brightness and color settings.

, This is the second-most important factor for picture quality. Too little color will make the picture muted and weak, while too much will make images look fake and unnatural.

, The refresh rate of traditional TVs is 60 Hz, which is the number of times that the screen can refresh in one second (60). The refresh rate is determined by the source, and getting a TV that boasts a refresh rate of 120 Hz will not be beneficial unless you are using an input that is able to output at that refresh rate.The most common use for a 120 Hz TV is to connect a computer to it, as most modern computers are able to output at that refresh rate. This enables a much smoother desktop and gaming experience.
Not everyone can perceive the difference beyond 60 Hz. Some people feel that displaying 60 Hz content on a 120 Hz display feels unnatural.
When purchasing a 3D TV, ensure that the refresh rate is at least 120Hz.

, Your TV is only as good as the devices you can plug into it, and you'll soon regret your purchase if you have to switch cables for your devices all the time. Make sure that the TV you pick has enough HDMI inputs for all your important devices. If you have some older equipment, make sure that it has inputs for those as well, such as VGA, component, and composite ports.


Other things to look for include Ethernet ports or Wi-Fi for smart TV services and USB ports for digital cameras or a Chromecast.

Leave the tint setting alone.",How to Calibrate Your TV," Factory settings are the settings for the TV when it has been purchased new.


These settings are not the ones you want permanently as they are designed for the in-store setting with lots of bright, ambient light. However, you should reset to the factory settings so that you can use it as a foundation when calibrating the display for your own environment.;
, Some televisions are equipped with an ambient sensor which is used to automatically adjust the television color based on the environment. Unfortunately, dynamic modes tend to result in bright and garish pictures, so it's usually best to avoid using them.

, The brightness setting isn't actually a control for brightness, but rather the level of blackness. Raising brightness is really just reducing the blackness. Adjust the brightness levels until your eyes feel comfortable watching the screen.

, The contrast setting isn't actually a control for contrast, but rather the brightness of the white. Adjust the contrast levels until you can distinguish between dark blacks, light blacks, dark whites, and light whites.

, The sharpness setting adds information to the picture so that it looks more crisp. If your television is high definition, then you most likely do not need sharpness and can reduce it. If your television is not high definition, sharpness can help to improve picture quality.

, Most televisions have their tint setting calibrated correctly straight out of the factory, so the factory setting for tint is likely the most optimal already.

Think about the size and type of TV antenna you have in mind.,
Evaluate the range and gain that the broadcast antenna is likely to provide.,
Consider the ease of installation.,
Determine the ease of use associated with a particular design of TV antenna.,
Compare the costs.",How to Buy a TV Antenna," For people living in a high rise apartment in a metropolitan area, a simple indoor antenna that can be placed discreetly on the top of a television cabinet will often pull in all the local channels and sub-channels with ease. People living in 1-story houses located in that same area may find that an outdoor antenna that can be mounted on the roof or at least on the upper casing of a window may be necessary in order to receive those same channels. Renters will need something that is relatively small in scale and can be mounted and removed with ease, while homeowners can go with one that is larger and more permanent.;
, Most antenna producers make certain assumptions when identifying the average range of an antenna, such as the level of the general terrain and the antenna being suspended a certain level above the ground. Take the average range and gain with a grain of salt if you live in hilly country or a low-lying area of the city.

, For an indoor antenna, all that is usually required is plugging the unit into a digital converter box attached to an analog TV set or directly into a newer high definition set, and then positioning the antenna for the best reception possible. Outdoor antennas may require running additional cable as well as mounting brackets that can be used to keep the antenna in position.

, Many outdoor antennas are equipped with remote controls that make swiveling the antenna a simple task. This is in contrast to the antennas of decades past that had to be turned manually in order to bring in different channels.

, The TV antennas of today are often compact, with some indoor and outdoor models being as small as the average magazine. Cost does not necessarily mean greater range or gain, although you will pay a little more for an antenna that is omni-directional or capable of picking up signals coming from multiple directions. If you live east of all the broadcast towers in town, going with a less expensive antenna that picks up signals from one direction will work just as well as the more expensive models,

If you are attempting to connect a MacBook to your TV, check out this guide.

A VGA port is roughly rectangular with 15 pins in 3 rows of 5. It's how you connect your laptop to a docking station.



 


An S-video port is circular with either 4 or 7 pins.






A composite video port is a circular jack, usually color-coded yellow.






A digital video interface (DVI) port is rectangular, with 24 pins in 3 rows of 8. It is designed for high-definition connections.






A high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) port resembles a USB port, but is longer and thinner. Available in laptops since 2008, it is also designed for high-definition connections.





;
, This will depend on whether your TV is a standard-definition or high-definition TV. Video input ports are typically located on the back of the TV, but may also be located on one of the sides.

Standard-definition TVs usually have composite video or S-video ports. The display will not be as sharp as through your PC's regular monitor, however.






High-definition TVs may have VGA, DVI or HDMI ports. VGA connections provide an analog signal, while DVI and HDMI connections provide a digital signal of higher quality.







, If you have multiple options (e.g. VGA, S-video and HDMI), try to connect using the highest quality connection. HDMI is the standard for newer laptops and HDTVs, and will result in the best quality and least amount of work adjusting settings.

If your laptop's output port is the same kind as your TV's input port, get a cable with the same kind of connector on each end.






If your laptop's output port and your TV's input port are different, you'll need an adapter cable. Adapters are available to convert DVI to HDMI or VGA to composite video. You can also get an adapter cable to connect your computer's USB port to your TV's HDMI port if your laptop has no HDMI port. Converters, especially analog ones, typically result in a loss of quality, so avoid them if possible.Branded HDMI cables are often marked up to be very expensive, but virtually any HDMI cable is more than capable of sending the signals to the TV with no loss of quality., Some computers and high-definition TVs can connect to the TV's audio and video with a single cable, while most require separate audio and video cables.

If you connect your laptop to your TV via HDMI, you will not need a separate audio cable as HDMI carries audio signal as well as video signal. All other connection types will require a separate audio cable.






Your laptop's audio output is a 3.5-mm jack marked with a headset icon. You can connect an audio cable from here to your TV's audio input if it has one or to external speakers if it doesn't.






When connecting the audio cable, make sure that you connect it to audio ports that match your video input.

, For older connections, it is recommended that you turn your laptop off when connecting to a TV. For HDMI connections, you do not need to turn your laptop off.

,, Most TVs have the input connectors labeled to match the input options on the TV. Switch to the correct input for the connection to your laptop. Consult your TV's user guide for instructions if necessary.


Your TV will need to be on in order for your computer to recognize it as a display.

, At this point, the method for enabling the TV display will vary from system to system. Some will show the image on the TV immediately, or will have both screens enabled. Others will not show anything on the TV yet., Many laptops have a “Display” key that can be accessed with the Fn (Function) key. This key will let you cycle through the available display options. You can extend your display to cover both screens, duplicate/mirror your display so each screen shows the same thing, or have only one screen enabled (either your laptop or your TV).

Windows 7 and 8 users can press the Windows key + P to bring up the Project menu, which will allow you to choose your display preferences.
If you don’t have access to either of these options, right-click on your desktop and select Properties/Screen Resolution. Use the “Multiple displays” menu to select how you want your image to be displayed on the TV.

, Oftentimes, your laptop’s resolution and your TV’s resolution will be different. This is especially true with older TVs. Right-click on the desktop and select Properties/Screen Resolution and select the display that you want to change the resolution for.

Most HDTVs can display up to 1920 x 1080, though some are limited to 1280 x 720. Both of these resolutions have a 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio.
If you don't see a recognizable image, you may have to disconnect your laptop temporarily and adjust your resolution before reconnecting your laptop to your TV. If you are switching between one active display, your laptop will need to have the same resolution as your TV.

, Some TVs will attempt to compensate for different aspect ratios by zooming the image. If you find that your screen is cut off around the edges when you are viewing on the TV, check your TVs settings to make sure that it is not zoomed in."

At the end of the day, the size of the TV will likely be the most important factor when determining the best TV for your budget.;
, TV displays are measured diagonally in inches in every region, so convert your distance. If you measured by feet, multiply by 12. If you measured by meters, multiply by 39.37.

, This is the approximate ideal size for your TV display so that it takes up the majority of your field of vision while watching.For example, if your viewing distance is 9 feet, the optimal screen size is about 70"" (9 x 12 x .6667). This may seem on the larger side, and should only serve as a recommendation. Price will likely be the biggest factor when it comes to screen size.

, 4K features a much higher pixel density than 1080p HDTVs, so you can sit closer without sacrificing image quality. This essentially means that you can get a larger screen than you may be used to. You'll get the most effect from a 4K TV if it is taking up a large portion of your field of view.

, HDR (High Dynamic Range) is one the the new display technologies built-in to many of the higher-end 4K TVs. HDR is used to create more dramatic contrast and display more colors than a standard display. Blacks are darker, whites are brighter, and the color palette is wider.


To confuse matters more, different manufacturers use different HDR standards. The most common is ""Ultra HD Premium,"" while others use ""Dolby Vision."" Both display HDR from content that supports it.
HDR is still only common on the most expensive sets, so you may need to sacrifice this feature if you can't find the right size in your price range.

, Nearly all TVs you look at should have a 120 Hz refresh rate. While you'll spend most of your time watching at 60 Hz, you still shouldn't buy any TV that has a refresh rate of less than 120 Hz.

, More and more devices connect to your TV using an HDMI port. If you have a game console and a Chromecast, that's two HDMI ports already. If you have a lot of devices you want to connect, make sure to find a TV that can support all of them.

, In order to view 4K content from a UHD Blu-ray player or other 4K device, you'll need to have it connected to an HDMI port that supports HDCP 2.2. This is a copyright protection technology, and many 4K TVs only have one HDMI port that supports it.

, An important factor to consider if you use your TV for video games is the input lag. This is the amount of time it takes a signal from your game console to reach the TV. Input lag is a nonfactor when watching movies or TV shows.


You may not be able to find the input lag on a TV's spec sheet. Check out sites like www.rtings.com for input lag tests on the TVs you're looking at.
""Response time"" is a different measurement, and is not related to input lag.

, The two most common display types for 4K TVs are LED LCD and OLED. If you can afford it, OLED will almost always provide a superior picture with better colors and more dramatic contrast. LCD will typically be much more affordable, and you can still get great picture from them.


OLED TVs will have much better viewing angles than LED TVs, as well as significantly less blur for fast images. Expect to see more and more OLED TVs as time goes on.
When shopping LED LCD screens, look for full-array backlighting (FALD) for better color contrast, and quantum dots for more accurate colors and higher brightness., There are several specifications you'll come across that can be safely ignored, as they are measured so wildly differently by each manufacturer, or they are essentially just marketing jargon:Refresh rate - For the most part, refresh rates are made up or inflated. You can rest easy knowing that any TV from the major manufacturers will have a suitable refresh rate for virtually all viewers.
Contrast ratios - These measurements are completely different for each manufacturer. They can be safely ignored. If you can, shop in person so that you can see the contrast differences yourself.
""TruMotion,"" ""MotionFlow,"" ""Clear Motion Rate,"" etc. - These are all marketing terms for high refresh rates, and don't really mean anything to the average viewer.

, You can buy a TV purely based off of reviews online and order sight unseen, but for the best experience you'll want to try to get your eyes on it. Be aware that many retailers calibrate the displays and the surrounding lighting for maximum ""pop,"" and the display may not look exactly the same in your living room.

, The major TV manufacturers all set prices that have to be matched at every store. This means that the specific model you want can probably be found for almost exactly the same price regardless of where you shop.


One of the exceptions to this is Vizio, which does not mandate set prices.
You may still be able to find discounts at club retailers like Costco.

, Pretty much every flatscreen TV will have middling to terrible speakers. You'll be much better off picking up an external sound bar and subwoofer, which can be found for as low as $100 and provide superior sound.

, TV prices are at their highest when they first release, typically in the spring. Prices will drop a bit heading into summer, and then drop drastically in the weeks leading to Black Friday.TV models are replaced essentially every year, and old models drop in price fairly quickly, so if you find a TV you want you can save a lot of money if you can hold off purchasing for a year.
Avoid purchasing any TVs that only appear on Black Friday. Many retailers will sell TVs made specifically to be sold for cheap on Black Friday, and their quality is significantly lower than the major brand TVs.

Decide on the amount of money that you want to spend on the purchase of an LCD TV.,
Consider what size LCD TV that you want to purchase.,
Choose a smaller size LCD TV to save some money if you are simply looking for a second one to put in a spare room.,
Read the reviews for the many different brands of LCD TVs that are available on the market.,
Weigh the benefits of having either a table top LCD TV or one that can be mounted on a wall.,
Conduct some research on the aspects of screen resolution and picture quality for LCD TVs before you take your first shopping trip.,
Take into consideration your HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) needs.,
Visit several stores to do some comparison shopping for LCD TVs before you make your purchase.,
Look at and watch the programs displayed on the floor model LCD TVs during your comparison shopping trip.,
Make a list of the brands and models of LCD TVs that best meet your needs.",How to Buy an LCD TV," The more expensive models offer additional features. If you simply want to watch television and are not interested in pricier features such as Blu-Ray or video games and you have a separate DVD player, then opt for the less expensive models.;
, If you have a large family with many viewers, perhaps a larger screen size would better suit your needs. If you are an avid viewer of action sports and movies, you may also be happier with the larger dimensions of a big LCD TV.

, Perhaps a smaller screen size LCD TV would best suit your needs for an extra television in a den or on the nightstand in your bedroom.

, Most of them are very good but check them all out so that you do not get stuck with a LCD TV that has given bad reviews or has consumer recalls.

, Most LCD TVs are thin compared to the older tube televisions and need a sturdy surface to rest on.

, Doing so will make you more informed and less likely to be swayed into spending more than you need.

, HDMI video ports provide connections for devices that you will hook up to your LCD TV. Video ports will allow you to attach cable or satellite modems and game consoles to enhance your home theater experience.

, It helps to actually see the images on the LCD TV to better gauge the screen resolution and quality. Look for the models that provide a clear, sharp image.

Buy what you need.,
Locate cameras correctly.,
Buy the right camera and lens.,
Buy the right Digital Video Recorder (DVR).,
Don’t try to do it yourself.",How to Have Perfect CCTV Installation," Every business has different CCTV needs. Some don’t need CCTV at all. Banks needs top level CCTV and a Barber Shop might need 2 good cameras only. Some businesses only need dummy cameras, and a dummy “protected by” sign. So before you get a quotation think “what do I really need? What are my objectives”.;
, Is the camera in the right position? Do you want to record the face or the back of the head? Cameras for monitoring purposes should be higher than eye level so they can see more. Cameras for identification and recognition should be at eye level so the best image of the face is captured.

, Can you choose right lens? Some people who try to do it themselves buy CCTV packages off a shelf. These packages usually have 4 cameras, all with the same wide lens, which can’t be adjusted. Wide lenses can only monitor. Wide lenses can’t be used for recognition and identification, because they do not give a clear image of the person. Evidence without recognition and identification quality images will not stand up in court.

, If the recording of live pictures is required then a higher specification of resolution – image quality – is required of the DVR. Cameras have four different technical levels of resolution. Highest quality is D1 then 2CIF, CIF and QCIF. Resolution quality must be balanced against recording speed to achieve higher specification objectives. Live pictures need at least 25FPS (frames per second). We recommend that identification cameras should have 2CIF resolution, at least, with the highest frame-rate, and that monitoring cameras use CIF quality at least. The DVR must support these requirements. Most DVR manufacturers say they achieve resolution and frame rate targets, but some don’t actually do the job required.

, Some of people think that CCTV is easy, but as experts we know it is not. CCTV technology is developing fast, so if you are not informed about up to date equipment, and recent technical advances you will miss out. Of course you can buy a kit and a manual in an electronics store, but are you sure it’s what you need, and are you sure it will work? How much time you will spend? Is it worth of it? Your result will most likely be a maximum 10% of potential and your money will be lost. A good professional will achieve NSI A standard. Can you?

These are just a few of the questions to be answered to obtain the correct transmitter for the application desired.;
, Use Google (or other search engine of choice) to look up ""FM transmitter kit"" Make sure that prior to purchasing; the transmitter selected is permitted for use in your country. Use of FM transmitters are highly regulated by government agencies and if used improperly may result in fines and imprisonment when caught. Don't forget to check any local electronics supply stores, too. Kits for all types of electronic projects are a popular staple at electronics stores, and the store should be checked if there is one nearby.

, Select a kit that will best perform the task within the budget and place the order. If ordering online, be sure to consider additional costs for shipping and the time it takes to be delivered.

, Most kits include all required parts, including circuit boards, components and even solder. Tools however, are not. Bare minimum would be a low wattage pencil style soldering iron with a small chisel or point tip. There is no need for an iron rated more than 30 or 40 watts. A stand or holder for the soldering iron will help keep it from burning surfaces and from rolling away. A solder wick is braided copper ""wire"" that when laid on cold solder and heated, will wick excess solder away. This is a handy item to have, especially for those who have never soldered before. A tinning compound is used to prepare a new soldering tip for first use. It is also used to clean the tip as it gets dirty. Most of these items are available in a soldering tool kit at Radio Shack and other electronics stores.

, Once the kit and tools have been brought together, read the kit directions completely before even plugging the soldering iron in. Review the components of the kit against the inventory list (extra parts are OK - missing parts will cause problems) If unsatisfied, either contact distributor or obtain any missing parts before continuing.

, Set aside at least the amount of time recommended in the kit directions to perform the assembly and soldering. Allow more time if this is the first time building a kit or using soldering iron. Lay out components and tools on a clean heat resistant surface. Assemble kit as outlined in directions."

Consider the size of your television set and the level of tilt or rotation you desire when you choose your mount. Some mounts fit up against the wall and do not allow you to move your television set after you mount it. However, other LCD TV mounts allow you to pull your television set away from the wall to rotate or tilt the angle of the television. These mounts typically cost more than the standard, fixed mounts do.

,









Interior walls are much easier than exterior walls because you will need to run cables through your wall. Exterior walls offer obstructions like sway braces or fire blocks that can make accessing your cables much more difficult.

, Make sure that nothing obstructs the view of your LCD TV when you determine where on the wall to place your mount.








, You can run an outlet to that location or install a clock-box, which the National Electric Code recommends.


You might also consider installing a surge protector that fits behind your LCD TV. They’re small enough to hide behind the television, but add extra electrical protection in the event of power fluctuation.

, Attaching your LCD TV mount with 2 bolts in at least 1 stud will help ensure that the mount stays in place once you attach the television. For heavier sets, experts recommend you attach the mount to at least 2 studs, positioning 2 bolts in each stud.








,, Various types of mounts involve different methods of attaching to the television, so be sure you read the instructions to provide the best protection for your television.









Remember to install safety screws that help keep your television from falling off if it’s ever pulled on or bumped into.

, Most of the time, these Input connections are on the bottom of the back or on the side of the back of the LCD TV.

Configure devices to work with your selected system.",How to Prepare for a Home Theater System," Determine how much space you have, keeping in mind space limitations for a TV, video devices, speakers, cables, and the furniture that will hold them. Also keep in mind the locations of power outlets and existing television cables and network access for applicable devices.;
, The TV should be at a comfortable eye level for the viewers, so a stand to keep it off the floor is advisable. The stand will need to be strong enough to hold the TV and wide enough to prevent people walking by from bumping into it. Other devices should be kept off the floor with adequate ventilation to prevent excessive exposure to dust and dirt. If floor space is a problem, consider wall-mounting a flat-panel TV. Before making any permanent placement decisions, remember to plan for cabling changes.

, Make sure the power outlets you want to use are properly grounded. In some homes, power outlets in one room can be unexpectedly connected to another room on the same circuit. If your home theater shares a circuit with major electrical appliances, it can cause unexpected problems. For example, when everything is turned on and someone decides to do their ironing while watching a blu-ray movie and someone turns on the vacuum in the next room, the power surge could damage the sensitive electronics of the home theater system even before the circuit's fuse or breaker shuts down.

, Taking some string and measuring approximately how much cable you need between each device can prevent an awkward pause when you go to pick out your cables and see five different length options and their alternatives.

, Many surge protectors offer warranty protection from power surge related damage and are worth the investment. Power surges can also come from the coaxial television, phone and network cables, so make sure your devices are protected completely.

, Most new TVs have at least one of each type of video/audio cable input. High definition devices will primarily use HDMI cable, but without a specialized video/audio receiver, hooking up multiple HDMI devices can be problematic. An inexpensive alternative to HDMI, though not quite as good, is to use component video cable with a separate audio cable. If the devices support it, you can get high definition audio with optical or coaxial audio cables. Most video devices come with standard quality composite cables (formerly called RCA cables,) but some TVs may only have one place for these. If you're using a laptop or computer with your TV, you may need VGA or S-video cable as well for the video, with a stereo Y cable for audio.

, Pick out the sizes and features that will work best for your space and budget. Any set of video and audio equipment in the personal entertainment market with the same connectors will work together, but some devices may have advanced features that work better as a bundle using HDMI cables. Most TVs will have built-in speakers with varying quality, but none will give the same experience as a 5.1 home theater speaker system. Most new TVs are considered ""Hi-Def"" now, but there are different levels of high definition with some differences that are more noticeable in certain situations.

, Especially if you pay in cash, the original receipt may be the only way to recover your funds should your products fail from normal usage (or disappointment.) Even if you purchase an extended warranty package, and if it's not registered with your personal information at the point of sale or over the phone, you will need the receipt to receive warranty coverage from the manufacturer.

, If you accidentally damage a device while positioning them, at least you won't electrocute yourself. (Or worse, the house...) Make sure there is adequate ventilation for each device wherever they have air holes in their casing. Audio systems in particular generate a lot of heat compared to video players, so consider placing them in a separate section of your home theater fixture.

, Make sure that the plugs are leading from OUTs to INs and that the cables are in the right place. If using component cables with stereo cables, don't mix up the red video component with the red audio cable. Place circular plugs in firmly until they are snug. Optical audio cables come with small protectors that must be removed before inserting, and have notched corners that fit in a specific way and click into place. HDMI cables should slide in easily with a light click and not fall out. Coaxial television cable has a single pin that goes in to the screw-like plug, so be careful not to bend it. With the coaxial cable ping in the plug, hold the cable while twisting the head of the plug so that the plug doesn't pull off. Some coaxial cables provided with digital tuners do not have a screw head and can simply be pushed on and pulled off. Audio systems that include speakers frequently have unique wiring plugs, so consult the manual for the system if necessary.

, Some power bars and similar devices have indicators for when the home's wiring system is faulty or unsafe for sensitive electronics. If such an indicator stays lit when it is in use, you may not be eligible for power surge related warranty coverage.

, Make sure high definition players are using the best type of signal for your television. Try selecting each device and testing their video and audio quality. The sooner you find any flaws or incompatible devices in your system, the sooner you can return them to the store for something that works! Don't get stuck with a device you have no use for because you were too busy enjoying the rest of your theater system.

Tivo sells Verified DVR expanders on their website, but it is also available through other technology companies.


Before getting started, be sure to disconnect the AC power cord from your wall and the Tivo system.

, The eSATA cord is used with external storage devices to increase the speed at which they send data. Connect it to the DVR expander and the Tivo box. Take care to protect the cord from being pinched or interrupted by any device that carries a strong magnetic field.

, A light should come on to indicate that it is connected to power. Wait 15 seconds for the expander to warm up and connect.

, Try to use the same electrical outlet as you used to plug in the DVR expander. If there is a glitch in the power source, both machines will turn off at the same time, which will help you to avoid connection problems.

Understand what's going on.",How to Make a Phone Ring Using Your Home Stereo," For old analog phones, you must set the ringing mechanism into low resistance mode. This is done so that less power is needed to ring the phone. The ring will still sound exactly the same. You can skip this part if you're not using an old, analog phone.
, Locate the two flat head screws on the top and bottom of the phone., Place the phone upright and pull off the plastic housing. No excessive force should be necessary. If you have to use force, the screws may still be caught on the housing., Between them, directly below the gong, you should see a small metal wire being held in place by a small plastic catch. Gently pull the metal wire out of the catch, and lift it over into the vertical slot next to the catch.,

Before the change:



 


After the change:







,

You have successfully set your phone into low resistance mode! Western Electric model 302s can follow a similar procedure, but the catches are laid out differently. If you are unsure about which setting the phone is on, you can ring the gong manually in each setting. The gong will move easiest in the low resistance setting.

,, Use two different colored wires if you have them. If you don't, mark two of the wires in some way., Leave the other end apart., Unscrew the screws at the end of these leads, and ignore the black and yellow leads., It does not particularly matter which side goes where.

That's it! You should now have an RJ-45 connector with four wires coming out of the back. None of those wires should be connected to the yellow and black leads, unless you have a specific reason for doing so. Most phones don't make use of these lines, but some two line phones may






Notice that, in the accompanying diagram, the same color wire are used in both the red and green connections. The wires on the green side are marked with a silver paint marker.

, Remember to follow these instructions precisely to avoid damaging to your amplifier or telephone.,

With the amp off and unplugged, connect the leads we made into the stereo leads. Most stereos have a secondary (B) set of speaker outputs, so you can use those without having to unplug any existing speaker setups.
Place same colored wires into the positive terminals for the left and right speaker. Positive is generally red on amplifiers, so just match your same-type wires to both go into red.
Place the other color pair into the negative terminals. Negative is generally black on amplifiers, so match your other same-type pair to go into black.
It does not matter which color goes to which, so long as you match positives and negatives. If you do this part incorrectly, you may damage your amp!


, This is generally a switch or button on the front of the amplifier. If your amp does not have such a switch, you should find a different amplifier to use.

If the amp doesn't have mono, and it's an el-cheapo that you feel like taking chances with, you can simply channel all output to either the left or right speaker, and unhook the unused lead-in from the back of the amp. Use electrical tape to cover the bare lead-ins that you won't be using, to ensure that they don't touch each other.

Note that this method will only give you half the power as if you used both leads. This is probably still enough.



, Note that your amp isn't on or plugged in yet., If you power on the amp before connecting the phone, it may cause a short circuit., You may need a headphone jack to RCA cable conversion wire to do this., Power it on with the volume down low, in mono-mode, and the correct set of speakers selected.

Keep in mind that most amps have safety mechanisms in place to prevent you from shorting or overloading them. If you've overloaded the amp and it has a safety, it will simply shut off. Some will try to power back on after a few seconds while others will require you to manually switch the power off and on. While it can't be guaranteed that your particular amp has this safety, most amplifiers manufactured after the mid 80s are safe. Always err on the side of caution.

, Make sure input is set to whichever auxiliary your computer is hooked into., Make sure your computer's volume is all the way up (not your amplifier!), Hold it to your ear like you're taking a call., If you can hear your source through the phone's speaker, then congratulations! You have successfully hooked everything up! #* Using your phone as a speaker set can be quite useful in its own right, but the best part is coming up next.,, YouTube is an excellent place to look, but you can also download a tone generator for more advanced applications. Be sure no other sound is playing!, Nothing should be happening yet., Once sufficient volume is reached, the phone should start to ring! Don't bring the volume up more than you need to!

Congratulations, you did it! Play the tone for 4 seconds on, 2 seconds off to get that characteristic, old timey ring. Have fun using this for good or evil purposes, just be sure to bring the volume back down and disconnect everything when you're finished!

, Here's an abbreviated explanation. Why should a loud 20hz tone make your phone ring?


When phones were standardized in the US back around the turn of the 20th century, it was decided that a 20hz AC current would be used to activate the ringer of the phone. Phones were early adopters of AC current because it traveled over longer distances than DC, and the sine-wave nature of the current could easily be used to move the gong's solenoid. Unfortunately, it is hard to produce a 20hz AC current without special equipment.
When you play a 20hz tone, what you are actually doing is approximating 20hz AC current. The higher the volume is set, the more power is sent to the phone. With a powerful enough amplifier we can ring the bell. Even at full volume, most unmodified older phones won't ring with the output of a consumer grade amplifier, which is why we set the gong into low resistance mode. Your phone has this setting because of rural houses far away from the central telephone offices. Lucky thing for us!

Calibrate your TV.",How to Hook up Surround Sound," The number of speakers you will be connecting will determine the type of surround sound you use. The most common setups are 2.1, 5.1, and 7.1.

2.1 is two front speakers and a subwoofer (the .1).
5.1 is two front speakers, a center speaker, two surround speakers, and a subwoofer.
7.1 is two front, one center, two surround, two back, and a subwoofer.;
, The subwoofer is omnidirectional sound, which means you will achieve similar results no matter where the subwoofer is placed. Many people like to place it towards the front of the configuration so that it is easily connected to the receiver.


Although subwoofers are omnidirectional, placing them against walls and corners will amplify the bass, making it difficult to control. Try to place the subwoofer in an area that sound can escape somewhat evenly. This will allow you to adjust the labels much easier.







, Make sure that if the speakers are marked that they are on the correct side. Front speakers should be placed equidistant from either side of the TV, usually around three feet from each side.

, Each speaker should be angled in slightly so that it point directly to the center of the seating area. You should be able to ""draw"" a symmetrical triangle between the two speakers and the center of the seating area.


THX recommends a 45° angle for your front speakers

, For the best audio quality, the front speakers should be raised up so that they are ear level with the audience. You can either use speaker stands or your home entertainment cabinet.


If you are setting up a 2.1 system, you are done with speaker placement and can move on to Connecting the Speakers.

, The center channel bridges the gap between the left and right speaker. It helps when sound pans from left to right, and keeps dialog synced with moving mouths on the screen.Angle the center channel up or down so that it points at the audience.
Do not place the center channel behind the TV, or you will not be able to hear it.

, The surround channel speakers are what give the effect of sound happening around the viewer. They do not transmit as much sound as the front speakers, but enhance the action on the TV by enveloping the viewer.


Your two surround speakers should be placed on either side of the viewing area, pointed directly at the audience. You can place them slightly behind the viewer if you aren't using 7.1, as long as they are still pointed directly at the viewer. This means that they will be at a 90°-110° angle to the TV.

, Your surround speakers should be placed about two feet above ear level. Angle them down slightly so that they point at the audience. This will provide the best auditory experience. Use any included stands or available furniture.


If you are setting up a 5.1 system, you are done with speaker placement and can move on to Connecting the Speakers.

, Try to place the two back channel speakers as close to each other as possible. This creates a bubble of sound around the audience. The back channel speakers provide more ambiance and support the surround speakers.


The back channel speakers should be the same height as the surround speakers., All surround sound systems run through a receiver. The receiver processes the sound input and sends the audio signal to all of the speakers that are connected. The receiver should be near your TV so that cables can reach, and should have space all around so that it can properly vent.

, When installing speakers, there is a slight possibility of electrocution. To be safe, power everything off and unplug it from the wall.

, Some surround sound systems have ports for each speaker that you simply plug the appropriate connector into. Others use clips that hold bare wire into the receiver. If your system uses clips, you will need wire strippers so that you can expose the bare wire underneath the protective rubber of the cable.

, Do everything you can to hide your wires as you run them. This will not only look better, but will prevent people or animals from accidentally tripping on them and pulling your speakers.


If you can, run the wires under the carpet or through the wall. This will give you the cleanest look for your system
Make sure to leave some slack at each end. This will keep the connection from becoming stressed, and give you room to correct errors.

, If your speaker cables already have plugs, simply plug them into the appropriate port on the back of the receiver. If you are using standard speaker wire to connect the speaker to the receiver, you'll have to go through a couple extra steps.


Measure out your cable length. Measure out your speaker cable from the spool. Make sure to give yourself extra room so that you can hide the wire and keep everything slack.
Strip one end. Use the wire stripper to pull about half an inch or so of protective rubber off of the wire. You should see two distinct wires. Make sure not to pull too much covering off or the bare wires could touch and short out.
Speaker wire is composed of two different wires: a positive and a negative. Both are exactly the same, but need to be lined up for both the speaker and the receiver. For example, if you connect one of the two wires to the positive clip on the speaker, you'll need to connect the same wire to the positive clip on the receiver.
Twist the bare metal threads and insert them into the appropriate clip. Secure the clip so that the wire is crimped into the port.

, Most subwoofers connect to the receiver via a standard RCA cable. You can buy expensive subwoofer cables, but you likely won't hear much difference than a standard cable.


The port on the receiver is typically labeled ""sub out"" or ""sub pre-out"".
If your subwoofer has multiple inputs, connect to the one labeled ""LFE in"" or the far left input if there is no label.
Using the dials on the back of the subwoofer, set the volume to about half and turn the ""low pass filter"" knob all the way up or switch it off.

, Most newer receivers support HDMI input and out, which allows you to connect HDMI-capable devices to the receiver and then connect the receiver to the TV.


If there are multiple HDMI inputs available, start plugging in devices in the order that you want them to appear on a menu.
HDMI transmits both audio and visual signal, so you don't need to worry about connecting any other cables.
Try to avoid stacking your devices (DVD player, cable box, etc.) on top of each other. This will lead to all of them generating too much heat, which can lead to equipment failure.

, If you are using any older equipment that doesn't support HDMI, you can connect via component cables. These are five-pronged sets of cables; three for video and two for audio.


Plug the three video prongs into the matching colors in the input that you want to use.
Plug the two audio prongs into the matching stereo audio input. Make sure that it is linked to the video input that you plugged the video prongs into, otherwise your sound won't appear with the video.

, These are the oldest of the connectors that are still in widespread use., A composite connector is a three-pronged cable with one prong for video and two for audio. This is the lowest quality connection that most surround sound systems will support.


Plug the yellow (video) prong into one of the available matching inputs, and then connect the audio cables to the linked audio inputs.

, For best results, use an HDMI connection to connect the TV to the HDMI Out port on the receiver. You can use older connectors, but they will result in much lower quality. Most modern TVs support HDMI.

, You'll have a lot of cables going into your receiver when all is said and done, so do what you can to keep things civil. Use twist ties to keep cables organized and bunched together.

, Before you start testing everything, you'll want to ensure that all of your connected devices are properly transmitting audio to take full advantage of your speaker setup. In general, you'll want to enable ""Dolby Digital"" in the configuration menu of each device. Every device is different, so consult your manual for details.


For your Blu-ray player, make sure to enable uncompressed audio. This is typically labeled ""bitstream uncompressed"" or ""pass-through"".

, Nearly all new receivers come with a microphone that you can use to automatically configure up your levels. Make sure that the mic is setup at the center of your viewer area, preferably at ear-level.


When running the auto-setup, step out of the room so that your body doesn't block any sound and mess up the levels.
Try to keep the room quiet while you run the test. Avoid running the dishwasher in the other room, keep the dog out, etc.

, After the automatic setup is complete, you'll want to go back into your settings and tweak a few things. Of primary concern is the subwoofer settings.


Navigate to the ""Bass Management"" section of the surround sound menu.
If you only have small satellite speakers for your surround speakers, set them all to ""Small"". Set them to large if they have a powered subwoofer built-in.
Set the subwoofer's crossover frequency to 80Hz as a starting point. If you are only using smaller satellite speakers, you can try setting it to 100-120Hz. This will make the bass more directional however.
Specialists recommend your subwoofer crossover frequency be at least 10Hz higher than your speaker's lowest clean frequency.

, Once you've finished your initial setup, it's time to test it out! Put in your favorite album or movie and give it a good listen. If it sounds good, you're probably done! You can always go back into the settings and tweak each speaker to your preference, and there are lots of resources available online about crossover frequencies., Although this doesn't have anything to do with the sound of your surround sound system, a well-calibrated TV will make a good home theater system even better. See this article for more details.

As a general rule of thumb, when purchasing for your bedroom, 32 inches (81.3 cm) is a good size, and when purchasing for your living room, anything under 40 inches (101.6 cm) will likely be too small.


More specifically, the size of your television should be proportional to your intended viewing distance. In general, the size of your television should be approximately half the viewing distance. For example, if you intend to watch your TV from 7 feet (84 inches) away, then you should aim for a 42 inch (106.7 cm) television.
The size of an HDTV will be one of the primary indicators of its price range. HDTV sizes range anywhere from 32 inches (81.3 cm) to 60 inches (152.4 cm) and the price difference between those 2 ends is around 300 percent. For example, if a 32 inch (81.3 cm) television costs $400, then a 60 inch (152.4 cm) television with the same features would cost around $1,200. When purchasing an HDTV, be sure to buy one that fits within your acceptable budget range.;
, In general, plasma screens deliver a much higher quality picture than LCD screens. However, LCD screens tend to take up less space, consume less power, and are noticeably cheaper than their plasma screen counterparts.


There is a third screen type called LED. LED screens use a a little less power than LCD screens, but they offer no additional benefits. Very few people can tell the difference in quality between an LCD and an LED screen. LED screens are also more expensive than LCD screens.

, On paper, 1080p is simply better than 720p because it denotes a higher quality picture. However, if you sit further than 6 feet (1.8 m) away from your television, you won't be able to discern the difference between 1080p and 720p. Furthermore, the higher-quality 1080p is unnoticeable on screen sizes that are too small.


If your television is smaller than 40 inches (101.6 cm) or if you're going to be viewing from over 6 feet (1.8 m) away, then forget the 1080p. If you have a large television and you intend to watch it close up, then you may benefit from the 1080p resolution.

, Most home media technology--DVD players, Blu-ray players, video game consoles, etc.--is now moving towards HDMI standardization. Older media devices will likely utilize the component-video input, which consists of a set of 3 input plugs: white, red, and yellow. Before purchasing a television, be sure you know which devices you intend to plug in so you can purchase a television that can accommodate those inputs.

, Contrast ratio refers to the difference between a screen's brightest white and darkest black. On paper, a higher contrast ratio is always better than a lower contrast ratio. Unfortunately, contrast ratio measurements are not standardized at all, so comparing the contrast ratios between 2 televisions will rarely result in a meaningful conclusion.

, Refresh rate refers to the frequency of screen image updates, so 60 Hz would mean 60 screen updates per second. On paper, a higher refresh rate will produce a much crisper picture. However, due to limitations in the human eye, most people will not be able to tell the difference between a 60 Hz and a 240 Hz screen. As long as your television is refreshing at 60 Hz, you have nothing to worry about.

Be aware that plasma is probably ideal for you if your TV room is a dark one.,
Decide whether you want 720 or 1080 vertical lines of resolution.,
Look at the contrast ratio specification.,
Check in some stores to determine for yourself whether you can see a difference from the distance from which you will be watching.,
Plasma TVs are faster than LCDs and are best for a Home Theater experience.,
Decide whether you want a consumer or a commercial set.

,
Determine which features you need, which are ""nice, but not critical,"" and which you are unlikely to use.,
Consider whether you want to buy on the internet or from a local retailer.,
Focus on a manageable number of models by weeding out those that don't meet your criteria.

,
Check out ""expert"" reviews, such as CNET and Consumer Reports.,
Look at the sets you are considering in more than one store.,
Don't get paralysis from analysis.,
Use comparison shopping sites like DealMine.com or Yahoo Shopping to discover how prices vary at different stores.

",How to Buy a Plasma TV," Plasma TVs have a very shiny screen and reflect light creating a glare that is akin to trying to read a glossy magazine with a shiny light. If you have a Tube television and you have glare now, you are used to it.;
, 720 units have fewer pixels on the same size screen and are generally only available in 50"" or smaller screens. Although 1080 is the current broadcast HD and ""Blu-ray"" standard, many people find it hard to tell the difference between the cheaper 720 plasma TVs and the higher resolution 1080 displays. If you are sitting 8 feet (2.4 m) from the TV or farther, you will most likely not be able to tell the difference between 720 and 1080 on a 46"" set or smaller. The best way for you to decide is to go look at the same program on the two TVs side by side at a local retailer.

, The higher the ratio the more ""real"" the picture appears. 800:1 is the lowest. New models offer 30000:1 ratio (or better). Higher contrast ratios generally mean better ""true blacks"" in the picture. Blacks which are too gray reduce or wash out subtle dark details and muddle shadows and other ""gray"" color information.

, If you can, decide how much you are willing to pay for that difference.

, LCD televisions are rated at 60HZ or 120HZ (240HZ coming soon), all plasma TVs are 480HZ. This refers to refresh rates that minimize blur when watching scenes with rolling fog, ocean waves or smoke.

,, Consumer sets have more features, flashier styling, and (sometimes) better warranties, as well as having to meet somewhat more stringent government standards. Commercial sets offer great value. They provide very good picture quality for the money, but tend to be minimalist in styling and features, and things like table stands, HDMI/DVI inputs, tuners and speakers are extra cost options that can drive the cost up beyond the consumer version if you add them.

, The former is usually less expensive, but if something goes wrong, returning the big, expensive machine could be a hassle. Also take into account that you can avoid paying sales tax when buying from many online retailers, which can save you hundreds on an expensive TV. Commercial sets are scarce in local stores while many internet vendors do not offer the consumer versions.

,, Read user comments on various sites all over the net. Reviews are invaluable, because choosing a TV set on a sales floor does not always reveal facts about a particular TV's reliability over time.

, Too much depends on the picture settings, ambient lighting, and even the quality of the video feeds.

, There will always be something new arriving soon. Prices will always drop over time. The fact is, most current plasmas are very good and their prices are reasonable for the pleasure they provide.

, Lutron has simple IR light switches and when interfacing with the MX3000 controller you can individually assign the IR output to control individual light switches. There are also whole house lighting systems that can be controlled via RS232 commands. An off color rope light in a crown molding helps with mood lighting that can add ambiance to the room. Red rope light tucked under the base trim is a cheap way to re-create the theatre style aisle lights.

, Run at least one HDMI cable from the projector to the component rack. Perhaps a monitor cable, Cat 5 (IR and/or RS232 control and programming, RG-6 (may want 3 or 4 just in case HDMI options are not available). Cat 5 to the home router which will connect to the hub/switch in the component cabinet. Consider running all power back to the component rack (projector, sub, and seating)- this will allow you to build an “extension” cord that plugs the devices (projector/sub/other?) into the power conditioning units. Cat 5, RG6 and 16/2 speaker runs to the seats (seats are for the bass shacker/butt kicker option). 7.1 surround means 16/2 (min) wire to 2 speakers in the rear, middle and front, plus an additional 16/2 for the front center speaker. RG6 or long subwoofer wire from component rack to the Subwoofer location. 2/3/4 RG6’s wires from Satellite and/or Cable provider to component rack. Consider conduit to all locations.

, 720p, 1080i, 1080p, High Def v. ???? These are all very confusing numbers and letters for the average. The basics are DLP is better. 1080i is the high def being provided by the satellite and digital cable providers. It looks great! 1080p is the current high spec. If going on 1080p make sure all the secondary components are capable of the same numbers/letters.

, Flat and dark is a good option. If it is a dedicated room, try a dark maroon on the walls and flat black on the ceiling. It is a dark room even with multiple can lights on, but it works well. For a dedicated home theatre you should look into acoustical paneling for the walls as well. This helps with the audio quality within the room and helps isolate the sound from outside rooms.

Draw a rough draft of the room you are working in.,
Run wires where they will not be disturbed.,
For power cables (source cables) try to make the supply socket reach the electronic cabinet (the place with all your devices).,
Do not try to make wires 'just long enough'.,
If wires must be visible, try to ensure that they are not strewn across the floor, getting in the way.,
For thick cables, letting them hang off the ground is a good option.

","How to Hide Entertainment Center, Stereo (Surround Sound) & TV Wires"," Make note of where your components will placed/mounted and measure the distance from the origin of the wire to the connected component. Add several feet to measurement to deal with unforeseen obstacles.


For speakers, always use a thick gauge high quality wire (check Radio Shack or MonoPrice.com ).;
, The best route is around the edges of the room concealed under carpet or the base board. When running through doorways, there are two ways of going.

, This is usually simpler with a single power extension cable, rather than extending the power cables for all your devices.

, A bit of slack never hurt anyone, and it makes future adjustments easier.

, Instead, try to keep them orderly, preferably tied up.

Purchase a wall mount from a reputable plasma TV dealer, and ensure that it fits your TV.,
Consider what you will be doing with your cables.,
For mounting your TV on a stud wall follow the next few steps.,
Attach the mount with the screws.,
If you are running your cables through the wall, now would be a good time to drill a hole into the wall to run your cables.

,
Hang the TV on the mount.,
Double check the stability of the TV, and ensure that it is firmly in place.

,
Connect your wiring and enjoy your TV.

",How to Wall Mount a Plasma TV," Ensure you are purchasing the correct wall mount for your TV AND for the type of wall you will be mounting your TV on.;
, If you are mounting your TV on a stud wall it is possible to thread your cable down the space behind the wallboard. Running the cables this way looks great but involves a lot of effort. An alternative would be to use a surface mount conduit. There are several easy to fit conduits available on the market that can produce some outstanding results.

, Other wall type require that you follow the mount manufactures guidelines.


Locate the wall studs in the wall you wish to hang the TV on. It is critical that the screws holding the TV to the wall are screwed into the solid wood of a stud, not just into the wallboard. The best way to find a stud is with a stud finder, which is available at any hardware store for less than $20. Be sure to find the center of the stud for the best results.
When you find the center of a stud, mark it with pencil on the wall. Measure the vertical distance between the screw holes on the mount. After deciding how high to mount the TV, mark with pencil where you will place each screw.
Double check that the mount will be level using a level. It is crucial that you mount it level. It will be hard to fix after the fact if you do it poorly, so please measure twice.
Use big screws. Try #14 x 1.5 inch screws. For #14 screws, drill a pilot hole 13/64"" in diameter first.

, Double check to ensure that it is level.

,, Usually, this involves attaching rubber/plastic mounts to the back of the TV, placing them through holes in the mount, and letting it settle into place.

Many Comcast cable boxes have multiple HDMI ports. Make sure you're using the HDMI Out port on the box and not the HDMI Input ports.
If you don't have an HDMI port on your TV, you can use a coax cable to connect the ""To TV/RF Out"" port to your TV's coax port. This will not result in high definition image.

, If you have multiple TVs and have active coax outlets, you can use digital adapters to connect your cable to additional TVs. Each adapter will need its own coax wall outlet.


Connecting a digital adapter is pretty much the same as a regular cable box. Use a coax cable to attach it to the wall outlet, and HDMI or coax cable to connect the adapter to the TV, and then connect the power adapter.
Make sure all of your digital adapters are connected and powered on before starting the activation process.

",How to Set up a DTV Digital Converter Box and Antenna," The converter box must be near the television as it will be connected to your television with an included cable (or cables). The converter box will also be operated by an included remote control, so it must not be behind an object that will block the remote control signal. Additionally, the converter box must be plugged in, so must be near a power outlet or power strip.


Read the labeled connections on the back of the converter box so you know where to connect the TV and antenna.;
, If using a power strip, also turn it off.

, If you have an older antenna that will not connect directly to an RF coaxial connector, see the section for older TVs at the bottom of the Steps section. Any free-standing antenna can be used, but it is recommended that an antenna that is designed to pick up DTV signals be used for optimal reception. Inexpensive rabbit ears as well as more powerful wall-mounted and outdoor antennas are readily available.


When using a typical rabbit-ear style antenna, set the antenna near the television. Connect one end of an RF (coaxial) cable to the ANTENNA RF IN connector on the converter box. Connect the other end of the cable to the TO TV connector on the antenna. It may be more convenient to connect the RF coaxial cable to the antenna first, or the RF coaxial cable may already be connected to the antenna if it was previously connected directly to the TV. The antenna may also have a CABLE IN connector that looks the same as the TO TV connector. Be sure not to connect the TV to this connector. If the antenna is powered, plug in the included power adapter, but leave the antenna off until all other components are connected.
If using an external or otherwise mounted antenna, assemble it and attach it to a secure object. If the antenna is external, the RF coaxial cable that connects the antenna to the TV will need to pass through your house, usually via a hole that has been drilled in the wall. Connect the RF coaxial cable to the antenna, and connect the other end of the cable to the ANTENNA RF IN connector on the converter box. If the antenna is powered, a segment of cable that was included with the antenna will probably need to be installed between the converter box and the antenna along the same RF coaxial cable that connects the converter box to the antenna. This segment of cable will be connected directly to the converter box ANTENNA RF IN connector, and the RF coaxial cable that runs to the external antenna will be connected to the other end of the powered segment. The powered segment must be plugged into a power adapter that is plugged into a wall socket.

, Depending on the supplied cables, the design of the converter box, and the design of the television, there may be different ways to connect the converter box to your television. Most converter boxes will have a connector for an RF coaxial cable and connections for composite cables. If you have an older TV that will not connect directly to an RF coaxial cable or composite cables, see the section for older TVs at the bottom of the Steps section. Composite cables consist of one yellow video cable and two audio cables. The audio cable for the right speaker is red and the cable to the left speaker is white.


The most common way will be to connect the converter box and the television with an RF (coaxial) cable. This type of cable should be supplied with the converter box. Simply connect one end of the RF coaxial cable to the TV RF OUT connector on the converter box, and then connect the other end of the RF cable to the similar cable connector that is on the television. This connector on the television should be labeled as VHF/UHF.

As an alternative, the converter may also be connected to the television with one composite video cable and two audio cables instead of with the single RF coaxial cable if these connectors exist on your television (the converter box must also be connected to an antenna with an RF coaxial cable). This option is especially useful if you will be hooking up a separate audio system or self-powered stereo speakers, as the video and the audio are passed through separate cables. The composite video cable connectors on the converter box and on the television will be yellow, while the composite audio connectors will be red and white. The red cable is for the RIGHT speaker, and the white cable is for the LEFT speaker. Hook up the audio and video cable to the converter box. Then connect the yellow-tipped video cable to the yellow VIDEO IN connector on the television. Next, connect the red-tipped audio cable to the red AUDIO IN RIGHT connector on the television, and connect the white-tipped audio cable to the AUDIO IN LEFT connector on the television.

, The converter box may be included with a power adapter or may have a permanent, standard power cord. If it has a power adapter, merely plug the adapter into a wall socket or power strip and plug the power adapter into the converter box. If using a power strip, plug the converter box into a powered-off power strip, then turn on the power strip.

, Batteries for the remote control may be included with the converter box.

, It controls many TV and converter box functions. If the remote included is a universal programmable remote, it will be able to control all TV functions after it has been manually set to do so.

, This is not done with the converter box remote, but with the TV remote or by operating the TV manually (unless the remote can be programmed to be used specifically for the TV). The converter box will only show images on the TV when the TV is set to one of these channels. The converter box must also be set to channel 3 or 4, whichever corresponds with the channel that the TV is set to. This may be done manually by means of a switch on the converter box, or using the on-screen converter box menu (see next step).

,


If the converter box can be set to channel 3 or 4 using the on-screen menu, set it to the desired channel if necessary.

, Enter the on-screen menu and allow the converter box to automatically scan for channels. Automatic scanning will find available channels and exclude all others. If you don’t receive many channels, you may need a better antenna or it may be necessary to place your antenna in a different area.


If you know that certain channels should be received but aren't picked up right away during the automatic channel scan, you can add them using the on-screen menu, and adjust the antenna until they are received.
An additional channel scan can also be performed using the on-screen menu at any time to search for and add channels that were not picked up during the initial channel scan.
Channels that are received and were added to the channel list but are not desired can be removed using the on-screen menu using the channel edit (or similar) function.

, Bad reception using the converter box will look ""pixelated"" or ""blocky"". The antenna may need to be adjusted or put in a different location. Bad reception may also present as a ""NO SIGNAL"" or ""NO PROGRAMMING"" message on the TV screen, but this may also indicate that there is no channel to receive whatsoever. To check signal strength for a particular channel in real time, use the ""signal strength"" or similar option using the remote control. Adjust the antenna while using the signal strength option to see what antenna arrangement or location provides the best picture. If using an antenna that is mounted away from the TV, such as a rooftop antenna, one person can monitor the signal strength indicator on the TV, while the other moves or adjusts the antenna.

, The converter box may initially show the TV images in aspect ratio formats that are designed for widescreen HDTVs. There will be multiple different image sizes or aspect ratios seen on the TV depending on the channel and/or the specific show, and the aspect ratio can be adjusted via the converter box menu to better fit standard 4:3 analog TV screens.


Shows that are shown in widescreen format can fill the screen on the left and right sides of the TV, but not on the top and bottom of the TV screen. Even though some of the top and bottom of the TV screen is not used, this is a desirable format because more of the original filmed image can be seen on the screen.

To display shows in widescreen format (that fills the screen on the left and right sides), choose ""letterbox"" or the equivalent aspect ratio option. The ""auto"" option may also achieve the same result.


Some shows will be shown in a 4:3 format that will completely fill the TV screen. Shows shown in this format should completely fill the TV screen regardless of the aspect ratio format that has been chosen.
Some shows will only fill the middle of the screen (there will be unused areas of the TV screen on the left and right sides as well as the top and bottom). Such shows may be in a shrunken 4:3 format or in a shrunken widescreen format. These shows will need to be cropped to properly fill the screen.

To ensure that the picture will always fill the TV screen relatively well for all channels, adjust the aspect ratio to ""cropped"" using the on-screen menu.

Understand the difference between types of TVs.,
Compare contrast ratios.,
Consider how well each TV type handles fast motion.,
Think about power.,
Consider the television's lifespan.,
Consider price.",How to Pick a Flat Screen TV1," The three most common types of flat screen TVs are Plasma, LED, and LCD. These types are explained as follows:



Plasma TVs create a picture by sending an electrical charge that is applied to a small sheet of tiny plasma cells.

LCD TVs are composed of liquid crystal compressed between two glass plates and backed by a fluorescent lamp. When you apply an electrical charge to the crystal, an image is created.

LED TVs are LCD panels, but instead of using the fluorescent (CCFL) backlight lamp, they use an LED backlight.;
, Contrast ratio describes your TV’s ability to display bright and dark images at the same time. The higher the contrast ratio, the better the picture quality will appear. If your TV has a poor contrast ratio, you'll lose detail in extremely bright and extremely dark scenes. While this isn't usually a huge deal, it can be a factor in making your decision. Generally, plasma televisions have the best contrast ratios. Backlit LED televisions come in close second. Edge-lit LED televisions and LCD televisions will have slightly lower contrast ratios.


Most LCD screens start at a contrast ratio of about 600:1, while plasma screens start at 1,000:1. Both types can reach up to 10,000:1. However, because there is no standard measure for contrast ratio exists at this time, manufacturers tend to exaggerate the actual output of their TV models. Consult product reviews for additional assessments.
In addition to higher contrast ratios, look for good image quality on black colors. While brightness can be adjusted, many LCD screens have difficulty creating deep blacks, which can result in a picture that appears faded.

, If you watch a lot of fast-paced sports, a plasma TV may be your best bet, since they show the smoothest motion. However, LCD and LED TVs have improved greatly in this field in the last five years, and are both relatively good at showing motion.


Note that plasma TVs run the risk of being permanently damaged by ""static images,"" such as network logos or status controls on video games. These images present a high risk of burn-in that permanently alters the screen.

, LCD televisions usually only require a single fluorescent backlight, whereas plasma TVs require every sub-pixel to be lit individually. Generally, it will cost about 50 percent more to run a plasma television for a year than an LCD television. LED screens use the least amount of power. They use about 40 percent less energy than an LCD TV..

, While none of these televisions have particularly short lifespans, the plasma screen has the shortest half-life—60,000 hours (in other words, it will take 33 years for the TV's brightness to be half a new TV's brightness if used for 5 hours a day). LED televisions generally have a half-life of over 100,000 hours. LCDs fall somewhere between the two.

, Generally, LCD screens are the most affordable options (they may be your only option for smaller screen sizes). Plasma TVs are generally only available as larger screens and are slightly more expensive than their LCD counterparts. LED screens are the newest TV technology and are much more expensive. LED screens are also more difficult to find in stores.

Use a low-voltage box to mount a wall jack.,
Connect the cable box or modem to the newly installed jack.",How to Install Cable Television," RG6 is the standard for cable installation, can can be used both above- and below-ground. Make sure that you purchase about 10%-20% more than you think you’ll need in case of unforeseen complications.;
, Connect a coaxial cable to the distribution point located either on the ""pedestal"", which emerges from the ground, or on an overhead utility cable at some point near the place where cable is to be installed.


Note: It is illegal to connect cables to the distribution point without getting permission from the cable company.

, Run the cable to the point the cable is to enter the subscriber's home or other. There are two different ways you can run this cable to the home:


You can bury ""flooded"" coaxial cable from the buried distribution point or pedestal to the point at the subscriber's home or other structure where the cable will enter. When burying cable, you may want to run it through PVC piping to help prevent it from being accidentally cut by a shovel.
You can run a special aerial cable with molded suspension wire from the distribution point on the overhead utility cable to a point on the eaves of the subscriber's home. Screw a hook into the eaves to which the far end of the molded suspension wire on the aerial coaxial cable can be looped and fastened.

, Drive a grounding spike into the earth at or near the point where the coaxial cable enters the home or other structure, or locate a cold water pipe in the area. Fasten a 12-gauge grounding wire to the grounding spike or cold water pipe at one end and to a coaxial cable grounding block at the other. This will form a connection to the earth that will ground the coaxial shield in the cable and also serve to divert lightning strikes.

, Use the coaxial cable stripping tool to remove the insulation in layers from the coaxial cable and the external woven wire ""shield"" of the cable. Place a connector on the end of the stripped cable and crimp or compress it.


When terminating the cable, ensure that there are no loose wires poking out of the connector. This will lead to bad or no signal. Avoid using screw- or push-on connectors, as these can become loose very easily and lead to a bad connection.
See this guide for more details on terminating coaxial cables.
Fasten the coaxial cable from the distribution point/pedestal to one tap on the coaxial cable grounding block. Make sure that it is securely fastened.

, Fasten a coaxial cable to the other tap on the coaxial cable grounding block. This will be the cable that runs into the house. Make sure that it is long enough to reach the destination with one cable.

, Choose an entry point that will allow you to run the cable with the least amount of stress. Entering into the garage, basement, or attic will allow you to run the cables easier without having to go through as many walls.Make sure you seal the hole you drill after running the cable in.
Ideally, you’d want to run your cable through the attic, garage, or basement until you reach a point where you can go straight up or down through the wall to reach your desired outlet location.

, If you need cable jacks in multiple rooms, you can use a splitter to attach multiple cables inside the home. Every time you split the cable, the signal gets weaker, so avoid splitting too many times.


The splitter should be installed inside, preferably at the point where the cable enters the structure.
If you are splitting to more than two locations, you will likely need to install an in-line amplifier. This will boost the signal, allowing you to split to more locations without losing signal quality
For cable TV, buy a splitter rated at 5-1450 MHz.

, Fish tape allows you to easily pull wire through walls without having to tear the whole thing open. You can find fish tape at most hardware and electric supply stores.


Do not allow the cable to become bent or crimped, as this will cause signal degradation.
Don’t try to force the wire through the wall by pulling. Pulling can damage the cable, and most RG6 cable is only rated to 35 pounds of pressure.

, When stapling cable, do not staple at even intervals. When a cable is stapled, the foam jacket inside is slightly squished. This can cause some of the signal to reflect. If the staples are evenly spaced, this can lead to a double-image. Use as few staples as possible when running your cable, and try to use cable-specific staples if possible.


Do not run cable underneath carpet that will be walked on. Stepping on the cable will lead to the squishing of the foam jacket, hurting signal strength. Only run cables where no one will step on them.

, If the coax is too close to electrical wiring, you can get a lot of interference. Keep coaxial cables at least 6 inches away from any electrical wires. If you have to cross an electrical wiring, do so at a 90 degree angle.


Avoid running cables near heating ducts as well. Too much heat can warp and damage the cables.

, Avoid bending the cable at right angles when going around corners. Try to keep a radius of 2 ½ inches (6.35 cm) for the bend to avoid any signal degradation., Avoid using a standard electrical box, as this will force you to bend the cable at a 90 degree angle. A low-voltage box doesn’t have a large metal box protruding from the back, allowing you to gently curve the cable to the jack.Make sure that you tighten all your connections with a wrench. Hand-tightening will lead to loose connections, which can cause problems down the road.

, Follow the instructions for the piece of equipment to perform the initial configuration. See the guides below for detailed instructions on setting up common cable equipment.


Install a modem
Install a cable box
You can use an RF signal meter to ensure that enough signal is being transmitted through the cable.

Most flat screen TVs offer 720p or 1080p options, while the traditional resolution for tube televisions and for cable TV broadcast is 480i or 480p.",How to Pick a Flat Screen TV2,"


720p is the resolution for screens that have rows of 1280 by 720 pixels on the screen, regardless of the TV size. High definition cable and satellite channels, as well as more advanced DVD players, use this resolution.
1080p is the resolution for screens that have rows of 1920 by 1080 pixels on the screen, and is mainly used for Blu-ray, although Blu-ray players can also deliver content in 720p for TVs that do not have a 1080p input.

Think about where your TV will go.,
Think about what you want to hook up to your TV.,
Consider refresh rate.",How to Pick a Flat Screen TV3," Screen size alone, while an important factor, should not be the main priority when you pick a flat screen TV. Use your room size to dictate the size of screen you choose—the ideal viewing distance from the screen should be about twice the screen size.

, Video inputs determine what type of peripheral devices you can hook up to your TV.


Composite video is a standard minimum type of connection, which uses a yellow RCA jack for picture and a white and red RCA jack for stereo sound.
S-Video allows you to send component analog video through a Multi-pin socket. No audio is included in this connection
HDMI is the standard for high definition displays, and necessary for connecting Blu-ray players, HD satellite or TV and DVD players that can Up Convert DVDs to high definition screen specifications.
Some newer models also offer USB and other inputs for viewing images on your computer, digital camera or other digital devices.
The dongle for internet access on your actual television screen can take up a fair bit of room at the back of the TV, so if this is something you want, keep it it in mind.

, Refresh rate describes how often the screen image is updated. Refresh rates are measured in hertz, with 60-Hz as the standard. While most viewers do not notice the difference, a high refresh rate is most appealing to individuals who use their flat screen TVs for advanced video gaming.

You can only connect the Apple TV to an HDTV, and you'll need an HDMI cable to do so. The HDMI cable doesn't come with the Apple TV, but you can pick one up at an electronics store or online for cheap. When it comes to HDMI cables, there isn't much practical difference between a $10 cable and an $80 cable. You will also need to be able to connect the Apple TV to your network, either via Wi-Fi or by using Ethernet cable.


The first generation Apple TVs could connect via component (five-prong) cables, but this is no longer possible with newer versions of the hardware.If you want to connect your Apple TV to your home theater system, you'll need a optical digital audio (S/PDIF) cable.;
, Make sure that none of the cords will be stretched tight by the connection. You should also make sure that the Apple TV has room to breathe around it, as it can get warm during operation.


If you're using a wired connection to your network router, make sure that you'll be able to reach it with the Ethernet cable.

, You can find the HDMI ports on the back or side of your HDTV, or on the back of your home theater receiver. Your HDTV may have one or more HDMI ports. Some older HDTVs may not have HDMI ports.


Make note of the label for the HDMI port that you connect the Apple TV to. This will help you select the correct input when you turn on your TV.

, To be extra cautious, make sure it's plugged into a surge protector to protect against power surges.

, If you're connecting to your network via Ethernet, plug the cable into the back of the Apple TV and then into your router or network switch. If you're connecting via Wi-Fi, you don't need to worry about this.

, Normally the Apple TV will send audio through the HDMI cable to the TV, but if you use an audio receiver you can connect the Apple TV to it with a optical digital audio (S/PDIF) cable. Connect the cable to the back of the Apple TV and then into the proper port on your receiver or TV.

Research the possible options.,
Decide what level of coverage you want.",How to Get Cheap Cable Television1," There are various options available to consumers, depending on what you're after by way of basics, bundles and advanced uses. Knowing what options are out there can help steer your decision as to exactly what will meet your needs.


For example, in the United States, cable providers are required to offer a “basic cable option” that includes broadcast channels, local-access channels, and government and public-service channels. These packages are subject to government price control and are often available for under $20 per month. However, they are often not mentioned on the provider's website. The next step up is “expanded basic” or “standard,” which costs more per month but offers a wider range of channels. These are generally shown as the cheapest package available on the provider's site, even though a cheaper option exists.
Note that some providers may offer a small number of cable channels as part of their basic package.
Packages will vary depending on which country or region you're living in. While it's not possible to cover them in this short article, it is important that you read the fine print, as well as checking what your government communications agency sets out as the basic requirements for cable provision where you live. Your awareness of what is mandated by consumer or communications laws will help you ask the right questions to get the best deal.;
, If you want the cheapest possible package, you will certainly want to choose the “basic” package. If you want a larger number of channels for a relatively small monthly price, you may want to look into a “standard” package.


When choosing, be specific in the needs that you and your family or household has. For example, perhaps you all like sport but not arts, or you all like arts but not sport. It's a no-brainer to go for the package that favors what everyone likes the most. It gets trickier when some of the household prefers sport, and some arts, etc. In this case, you'll all need to reach compromises to keep down the costs.
Remember how many hours there are in a day. You can't spend them all watching TV. Having access to many channels doesn't necessarily equate to having the time spare to make use of the choice!
Don't forget the possibility of borrowing, hiring or buying DVD sets from the library, video store or retailers for shows you like. If there is only one or two shows you like on some extra cost channels, it might be cheaper to forgo watching them now and wait for the DVD to come out instead. Or, watch the show online rather than purchasing extra channels you rarely watch.
Read the fine print on making changes to your package. If you sign up for 24 months to a set of kids' channels and your kid turns teen and never watches them again for 18 months, be sure you can opt out of paying for those now-unwatched channels. Either that, or look ahead and don't sign up for channels where householder interest may wane over time.

Determine the frequency of the station desired to be tuned.,
Calculate the length of the antenna.,
Improve the antenna design.,
Cut the feed line.,
Prepare the antenna for connection to the feed line.,
Prepare the feed line for connection to the antenna.,
Tin the exposed twin lead wires with solder.,
Solder the antenna and feed line together.",How to Make an FM Antenna," The antenna is tuned to a certain length, based on the frequency of the connected radio. Regardless of the particular frequency, the entire FM broadcast band (88 - 108 Mhz) of the radio's tuner will receive stronger signals from the antenna, with the largest increase seen at the frequency selected in this step, and slightly less as the radio is tuned away from the design frequency.
, The formula for a 5/8 wave antenna using typical 300 ohm ""twin lead"" antenna lead-in line is L = 300/f x 5/8 x 1/2; where ""L"" is the length in meters of the antenna and ""f"" is the frequency in Mhz of the station to be tuned. This can be simplified to L = 93.75/f. These instructions do not apply to round 50 and 75 ohm coaxial cables.

An antenna built for middle of the 88Mhz - 108Mhz FM band (98 Mhz) would be: 0.9566 meters (3.1 ft) or 95.66 cm (centimeters) long. For those more familiar with imperial units than metric, the formula to convert centimeters to inches is: cm X 0.3937. This means 95.66cm X 0.3937 = 37.66 inches long. This is a dimension for the top portion of the ""T"".

, The antenna improvement in this article is a design for a simple 5/8 wave ""folded dipole"" or ""T"" shaped antenna. This design will outperform any internal or telescopic rod antenna that may have been supplied with the receiver. It is also similar to those provided with some more expensive home stereo receivers.

To improve upon this simple design, simply double, triple, quadruple, etc. this value as such: 37.66"" x 2 = 75.32"", or 37.66"" x 3 = 112.98"", and so forth.
The original 37.66 inch antenna will be outperformed by a 75.32 inch version; and it will be out performed by a 112.98 inch version - and so on.
Of course, there is a ""point of no return"" when the multiple is so great that the signal at the ends of the antenna cannot travel the entire length due to the electrical resistance of the wire. This limit is around 100 meters (a little more than the length of a football field).

, As described above, this antenna looks like a ""T"". Thus far, the calculation has been for the top horizontal part (top of the T) of the antenna. A vertical (bottom of the T) needs to be connected to the top horizontal to facilitate connection of the antenna to the receiver's antenna terminals. While both the horizontal and vertical parts function as an antenna and in this wiki are the same type of cable, the vertical portion is referred to as the feed line.

Cut a length of twin lead that is equal to or a multiple of the length calculated above AND will be long enough to extend between the receiver's antenna terminals and the horizontal portion when installed.
600 Ohm Ladder Line and 450 Ohm line are physically larger than 300 Ohm Twin Lead and is rated at 600 and 450 ohms respectively; as opposed to 300 ohms for twin lead. These cables can be used, but require the use of a different formula to design. Standard 300 Ohm twin lead cable was selected because it enjoys wide availability.

, Locate and mark the halfway point on the length of the horizontal portion of the antenna.

Use a razor knife to cut a 1 inch (2.5cm) long slit (centered on the halfway mark), parallel to and between the two wires in the antenna's twin lead cable.
Cut through one of the twin lead wires at the halfway mark.
Strip the insulation from the cut ends of the wire at the halfway point and the ends of the entire horizontal length (this should be about a 1/2 inch (1.27cm) from each side).

, Use a razor knife to cut a slit between the wires of the twin lead about an inch (2.5cm) in length at both ends. Carefully remove a half inch (1.27cm) of insulation from each of the wires on both ends., Re-twist the individual strands of all wires to keep them tightly grouped together. If soldering is not an option, skip to the next step after stripping insulation from the wires indicated at the end of this step.

Apply a small amount of electrical grade soldering flux (do not use plumber's flux as it contains acid). A small 20 to 50 watt soldering gun or iron to heat the wires is sufficient.
Shortly after the flux melts, apply electrical grade solder to the wire near the soldering gun's / iron's tip (use of straight solder or flux core solder is fine - but do not use acid core solder).
Apply just enough solder to the heated wire so that melted solder flows back into the insulation, then remove the solder and heat from the wire. Do this for both wires at (1) both ends of the feed line, (2) both wires at both ends of the horizontal antenna piece and (3) both wires at the cut made at the center of the horizontal antenna piece.

, Solder the two wires at one end of the horizontal piece together and repeat for the other end (if not soldering, create a solid electro-mechanical connection by tightly twisting the wires together instead of soldering).

Lay an end of the feed line at the center of the horizontal antenna piece so that the soldered leads of are close to each other. The left wire of the feed line should be soldered to the left wire of the antenna, and the right wire of the feed line should be soldered to the right wire of the antenna. When complete, the antenna will look like a large ""T""
When completed correctly, a path can be traced that starts ""up"" on the right side wire in the feed line cable at the bottom (or vertical) of the ""T"" that continues via connection made to the wire in the bottom right half of the horizontal half of the ""T"" and continues to the twisted wire connection at the right-most end on the horizontal ""T"". The path continues across the entire top of the ""T"" of the antenna to the twisted wire connection at the left-most end. Here, the path continues on the wire in the bottom left horizontal half of the ""T"" to the twisted wire connection to left side wire in the vertical feed line of the ""T"". The path continues ""down"" the vertical and finishes at the end of the left side wire - next to where the path started.

Choose the right size TV for your room.,
Pick the right type of TV for your room’s lighting.,
Know that higher resolutions have better picture quality.,
Purchase a video source.",How to Set Up a Home Theater System1," While it is often tempting to get the very biggest screen you can, choosing a TV is more of a science than “bigger is better.” You should choose your TV based on the size of the room and how far away people are from the screen to get the maximum enjoyment for the maximum amount of people. In general, you should be sitting 1 ½ - 2 ½ times the screen size away from the TV. That means if you want a 70” TV screen you should have at least 9–15ft of room between the TV and your closest couch.TV sizes are measured diagonally, from the top left corner of the screen to the bottom right corner of the screen.
Projectors allow you to adjust the size of the screen as long as you have a large blank wall on which to project the video. You generally need 12-15 feet between the projector and the wall to get the best results.;
, One of the biggest considerations when buying a TV is the type of lighting in the room around it. When properly matched, the right lighting will lower the strain on your eyes as you watch TV and make your picture quality even better. Cost and general picture quality are also considerations, of course.


Screen Types:Plasma: Often cost-effective at large sizes. Best in dark rooms. Superior contrast and wider viewing angle to LCD screens.LCD: Brighter screens make this a good choice for bright rooms. LED LCD (LCD screens lit by LEDs) are higher quality and have lower power consumption.OLED: Highest quality picture, but expensive and untested in long-term use.
, Resolution is one of the key factors when trying to improve your TV’s picture. The more pixels, the higher the resolution. This is why 2160p, also known as “4K Ultra HD,” is more expensive than 1080p, “Full HD,” or 720p. The “p” stands for the number of pixels on the vertical edge (going downward) of the screen. More pixels give the picture better clarity and color.


Some systems are labeled with an “i.” such as 1080i. This stands for “interlaced” pixels, which broadcast slightly differently. While most TV manufacturers have moved past 1080i, you should know that the picture quality is roughly the same, though 1080p has “won” the battle with consumers., Your home theater system won’t do much if you can’t play anything from it. The most common video sources are DVD and Blu-Ray players. “Smart players” like AppleTV, Roku, and Google’s Chromecast, however, have surged in the home theater market because they can stream any internet video, from Youtube and Pandora to Netflix or HBO Go.


DVD/Blu-Ray player: DVD players can only play DVDs, while Blu-Ray players can play both Blu-Ray discs and DVDs at higher quality.Smart Players: AppleTV, Chromecast, and other streaming devices stream online videos and may include other apps and websites. They cannot play discs.Smart DVD/Blu-Ray: A disc player and streaming device in one.

Find a cable provider in your area.,
Call your cable provider.,
Ask for the “basic” package.",How to Get Cheap Cable Television2," Not all cable providers are available everywhere. Find a provider that operates in your area first. You can do this by doing an Internet search such as “cable provider + ”. If you find that the provider isn't offering as good a deal as ones you've researched online, this will be a time of negotiation, in which you can point out what you'd like and what is offered elsewhere.

, Remember that providers are not required to advertise the “basic” package in the United States, and so most list only the “standard” and higher packages on their websites. That means, if you want the cheapest package, you will need to call and discuss your desired package in person, rather than purchase online. Any special tweaks needed to be made to your package will have to be done over the phone, or in person, where possible.

, The operator may try to sell you the “expanded basic” or “standard” package when you ask for “basic.” Politely insist that you want the most basic package, not the standard package. If pressured, remind the operator that you know the company is required to sell it to you. If they're particularly insistent, simply tell them it's all you can afford and it's that or nothing (most salespeople want something over nothing).


Ask about pricing and available channels. If you have favorite channels you're hoping to get, be sure to clarify the availability with your package, as you may or may not be able to get cable channels such as ESPN.

"
"
If you decide that you want more channels than those offered by the “basic” package, you can search online for the cheapest deals in the “standard” tier.",How to Get Cheap Cable Television3," An Internet search for “cheap cable” will bring up many websites that allow you to compare all of the different packages offered by cable providers in your area. Type in your zip code and research the different options available to you. Perhaps draw up a chart to compare the pricing and which channels and features you get for the money; doing this will help you to quickly visualize which provider is offering you the best deal for your money.


Be wary of deals that may offer a low monthly rate for a limited period of time, only to increase the price after that period ends.

Consider whether you prefer watching movies, listening to music, or a bit of both.,

Place two stereo speakers on either side of the TV for simple but high-quality sound.,
Purchase a component surround sound system for movie-theater style sound.,
Build your own surround sound system with 5 speakers, a receiver, and a subwoofer.,
Recognize that audio is as important as, if not more important than, the TV.",How to Set Up a Home Theater System2," All home theater systems can handle both movies and music, but if you exclusively watch movies then you might want to pass on 4 high-end speaker boxes. Ask yourself if you spend more time with your iPod or plopped in front of the TV.’’’Movies and TV:’’’ Most movies are multitrack (sounds come from many different speakers), meaning 5 or 7 smaller speakers will create a more immersive movie watching experience than 2-3 expensive, large speakers. This helps you create realistic surround sound.
’’’Music:’’’ Speaker quality is more important than quantity. Invest in a good receiver and purchase 2 hi-fi speakers to get the best quality sound you can., The popularity of home theater systems has led many companies to bundle all of the necessary equipment together for one price. Ranging from several hundred dollars to several thousand, many large retailers have a variety of sound system packages depending on your needs. Some considerations to consider include:

,


’’’Number of speakers.’’’ Base your decision on the size of your room – small rooms (200 sq. ft) might only need a sound bar while large rooms (700+ sq. ft) might need a large 5 or 7 piece speaker set.’’’Receiver:’’’ Receivers allow you to run your entire home theater system, TV and audio, through one box and one remote. While many complete packages come with a receiver, some smaller and cheaper sets may connect right into the TV.

, You will often see phrases like 5.1-channel surround sound, but there are few explanations for what this means. The first number, 5, tells you how many speakers are included in the package and the second number, .1, indicates how many subwoofers are included. So a 5.1-channel system has 5 speakers and 1 subwoofer.


5.1-channel and 7.1-channel are the two most popular speaker packages, offering a subwoofer, two speakers in front of you, two behind you, one in the center, and one on either side (for 7.1)., Sound bars are long, thin speakers that fit right under your TV to deliver decent surround sound on a budget. They connect right into your TV without a receiver and can be installed and used in minutes.


Sound bars attempt to bounce sound off of the walls and into the room evenly, effectively creating the illusion of surround sound.Some sound bars can be paired wirelessly with a subwoofer, bringing deep, room-rumbling bass to your system for a fraction of the cost of a full speaker system.

, This option is best for small rooms that want a fuller sound than a sound bar with minimal set-up. You’ll need a receiver tucked near the TV. You can then connect each speaker to the receiver, connect the receiver to the TV, and start enjoying high-quality sound.


This is a good option for someone who wants to build their own system. If you already have a nice pair of speakers or a receiver you can quickly convert them into a nice home theater system., Often sold as 5, 6, and 7 speaker sets, pre-matched surround sound systems are perfect for people who want great audio but don’t know enough about sound to buy the parts separately. The set-up is more intensive than a sound bar or stereo system but mostly consists of running wires to each speaker from an included “control center” or receiver.


High-end systems often come with built-in music apps, iPod connections, and the ability to add more speakers over time.
Some systems are wireless, making set-up even easier., If you want to take full control of your home theater system and get the best sound you should consider building your own system. This is best for people who already have a few pieces, like a nice TV, speakers, or Blu-Ray player, but want to expand. To do so you’ll need the following components, or parts:


Two raised, front facing speakers.
Two rear speakers at the back of the room.
One subwoofer, usually tucked in the corner.
One multichannel receiver, capable of accepting 5-7 audio inputs.
One small center speaker (optional)
Two side speakers (optional)
High-definition TV
Media Player (DVD, Blu-Ray, Apple TV, cable box, etc)., A Home-Theater company recently did a test on its employees to illustrate how important sound is. They showed the same movie twice on identical TVs, once with average sound equipment and once with a high-end system. The employees not only noticed the sound; 95% of them even thought that the TV itself had a higher quality picture because of the sound. The moral of the story: don't spend your whole budget on the best TV and forget about your speakers."

Place the TV and couches first.,
Draft a floor plan for your room to find the center.,

Place side speakers in-line and above the viewers.,
Place the rear speakers side by side along the center of the back wall.,
Put your subwoofer along the front wall, preferably in the middle.,
Add any additional speakers up high, in the front.,
Clear the path to the speakers.,
Alternatively, install in-ceiling speakers.,
Once you’ve planned out your speaker location, install them according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",How to Set Up a Home Theater System3," Design how you want to experience the room before wiring anything or putting down speakers. Place a TV along the wall or in the corner, somewhere where there will not be a lot of glare or light. Place couches or chairs in comfortable watching position.


Make a note of your ""main"" couch. Where is the place you will watch TV the most often? This will help you place speakers later on.

, Once you’ve bought the speakers and receiver, you need to figure out where to put them. Make a simple drawing of your room highlighting where you are sitting and where your TV is placed. Make notes of your furniture, doors, and windows so that you can accurately plan out your system. You want the speakers to “meet” at your ""main couch"" to deliver the most realistic surround sound.


Plan the speaker placement before you begin running wires to make set-up as easy as possible.

, One speaker goes on either side of the TV and they both point inwards. If you are looking at the speakers from your couch they’ll be at a roughly 45-degree angle to you.If you were to draw lines coming from the speakers, they would meet at ear level in the center of the room.

, This speaker is usually smaller and is designed to deliver crisp dialog right to the viewers. It should be front and center so that it clearly broadcasts to the entire room.Many people mount this speaker just above the TV if they have room.

, Side facing speakers should be parallel to the viewer, offering sound from the right and left. If you cannot fit them in line with the couch, place them slightly behind the viewer and angle them towards the couch. They should always be 2 feet or more above the viewer, pointing downward., This allows them to work together to grab your attention. There are also alternate set-up ideas, such as separating the back speakers and pointing them inward, that help provide the feel of surround sound if you don't have dedicated side speakers.


If you are using only 5-speakers, prioritize side-facing speakers before rear speakers.

, The subwoofer brings the big, gut-trembling bass notes and works best up against a wall. Try to fit it near the middle of the wall if you can, but it can be to the side if the TV is in the way., Very complex systems, like 9.1 surround sound, come with extra speakers meant to add sound from up top, like in a movie theater. Mount these above your two front speakers, angled in and pointing down at the viewer.

, If you can’t see the speakers from where you are sitting, the sound is being blocked off. Reorganize your furniture and speaker position to get the maximum sound possible.


Bare walls and floors cause sound to bounce around, so you can improve your acoustics with rugs or furniture along the walls., Four speakers, two in front of your viewing area and two behind it, will provide high-quality surround sound, but at a price. They often come with auto-calibration as well, meaning the speakers will shift and change volumes to get the best possible surround sound.


Dolby Atmos speakers come in both ceiling and floor models, allowing you to mix and match them to make high-quality surround sound from top to bottom instead of from side to side.

, Most pre-packaged home theater sets come with the right mountings, casings, and stands, which makes installation easy. Once you’ve got your speakers where you want them, feel free to tweak them a bit to get the sound you love. Every room is different, so every room will have an optimal angle and placement for your speakers.

Troubleshoot your speaker system if you can’t hear any sound.",How to Set Up a Home Theater System4," The signal is the movie on your Blu-ray, the TV show from Netflix, or the music from Pandora. Following the flow of the signal will help you figure out the right inputs and outputs on your gear. Everything starts at your media source (Blu-Ray player, Apple TV, etc.) because this is where you movie is located. On some TV’s this is known as the “source components.” Think of your movie as a physical object: it “moves” from your media player to the receiver, which sends half of it to the speakers (sound) and the other half to your TV (picture). In general, your signal flow is simple:


Media player (source output) connects to the receiver (source input).
Receiver (audio output) connects to the speakers (audio input).
Receiver (signal/source output) connects to the TV (signal/source input).If you are not using a receiver, connect directly to the TV. You will then send the TV audio (audio output) to the speakers (audio input) if you have a sound bar or speakers.

, Reduce the risk of electric shock by turning everything off and unplugging the TV and receiver. Make sure your speakers are off.

, HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is the industry-standard cable for home theater, and for good reason: it can send audio and video signals through one cable. This will not only save you time, but massive headaches. Every modern TV and sound system will have HDMI inputs. The cable is the same on both ends, which resemble flat, two-tiered USB cable ends.


All HDMI cables are built identically, so do not be fooled into buying a $50 cable when a $5 HDMI will work exactly the same way.If you cannot use HDMI for some reason, consider buying a converter. Bring your old cable into a local electronics store and ask them if they can help you change your connection.

, If you don’t have and HDMI cable you can also use RCA cables, which is a collection of a Red, Yellow, and White input. Attach one end of the cable to the output of the media player and into the receiver’s matching “source input” port.


If your receiver does not handle video (ie. it is an audio receiver, not a home theater receiver), then you should plug your media player directly into the TV’s “input” port., This is almost always accomplished with an HDMI cable, but some advanced systems may connect wirelessly. Simply attach your receiver’s “source output” or “video output” into one of the inputs on your TV. Remember the input you chose – this will help you select the right input on your remote to see your movies.


If your receiver does not handle video, you need to reverse this connection. Think of the source flow again. If the information is coming from Blu-Ray player to the TV, and you want the sound to come out of your speakers, you need to send sound from the TV “audio output” to the receiver’s “audio input.”

, At this point, you should have everything you need to test the video. Turn on the TV, receiver, and media player and switch to the correct input number on your TV (this corresponds to the input you connected everything to, it's labeled on the back of the TV as HDMI 1, Component 2, etc.). You should see a picture from your DVD player or smart device. For troubleshooting:


Check all of the inputs. Are any connections loose?
Attach the media player (output) directly to the TV (input), skipping the receiver, to make sure that the media player works.
Check that you have the right signal flow. Things should go “out” from the media player and “in” to the TV.

, This is often the most complex part of any home-theater installation because every room has different needs and challenges. While the basic wiring is easy, hiding the wires professionally takes time and forethought. Speaker wire is actually two attached wires, a red and a black. The wire runs from the back of the speaker to the receiver’s “Audio Output” ports. Connect one wire to the red “input” on your speaker and the red “output” on the receiver and do the same with the black end to connect your speaker.


Some modern speakers have plugs instead of speaker wiring. In this case, the wires are color coded for easy access.
Most speaker wire is covered in a wax sheath to protect it. You must use scissors or wire cutters to trim this sheath and pull it off, exposing the bright copper wire inside. This wire makes the connection, not the sheath, so you must remove the wax to get your speakers working.

, Once you can get them to work, move on to the rest of the speakers.

, Surround sound works because the DVD tells the receiver where to send the information. If there is a stalker creeping up in the movie, you want your rear speakers to sound like leaves are crunching behind you, not the front ones. Make sure you attach each speaker to its appropriate channel, which is usually labeled (""rear audio,"" ""front speaker,"" etc.).


Some pre-packaged systems have label ports while high-end systems can automatically detect which speaker goes where, allowing you to plug them all in anywhere. If there are no labels on the back of the receiver, simply plug them all into the “audio output.”
The subwoofer is usually labeled as a “sub out” or “sub pre-out,” and may need a specific subwoofer cable., This not only looks professional, it prevents people from tripping and ripping cables or pulling down speakers accidentally. Run cables under rugs, staple them to the baseboards along the sides of the walls, or run them through the walls if you are comfortable with carpentry.


There are a variety of services, including teams at Best Buy or Geek Squad, that will run your wires for you for a fee.

, Speakers are generally easy to attach, but that doesn’t mean problems won’t arise.


Check the channel on your receiver. When you plug in your speakers to the receiver, you’ll often see them categorized as “audio output, channel 1.” This means your receiver can handle multiple speaker formats. Make sure the channel on the front of the receiver matches the channel you plugged yours speakers into.
Check the inputs. They should be firmly attached. Make sure that the same wire connects the red end of the speaker to the red end of the receiver or they won’t work.
Test your speaker by plugging in an iPod or music player and testing that before trying a DVD.

The particular bits you will need depend primarily on your cassette deck. See the Things You'll Need section below for a comprehensive list of options.


Almost all cassette decks have a 3.5mm headphone jack. If your computer has a headphone jack, you will need a cable with a 3.5mm stereo plug on each end, or a cable with suitable adapters so that both ends have a 3.5mm stereo plug.
Many cassette decks have unbalanced line outputs. You'll recognize those as having red and white plastic rings. You will need a cable with two RCA plugs on one end, and a 3.5mm plug on the other. You can also use adapters.
High-end cassette decks may sport balanced line outputs, with dual 3-pin XLR-F connectors or balanced 1/4"" phone jacks. For these, you will need cables that have XLR-M or a 1/4"" phone plug on one end, and plugs to match your computer sound input hardware on the other end. If you're using a balanced-output cassette deck, it's likely your computer sound hardware has balanced inputs. If not, you will need an adapter to turn your balanced signals into unbalanced ones. Consult with your local audio supply store for the best fit for your hardware setup.;
, Plug one end of your cable into the headphone jack of your cassette deck, and the other to the line input (not microphone input) of your computer. Most line inputs are blue with what looks like arcs or waves spreading outwards above it. They are usually next to the speaker/headphone output (green) and the microphone input (pink). If you will be using Audacity, make sure it's set to ""line input"" by clicking on the menu next to the microphone icon.


Make sure the plugs are inserted completely and are secure, or the sound won't be clear.
If your PC or laptop does not have a line-in, you may also be able to use the microphone-in port. Note however that the microphone-in port is probably monophonic, not stereophonic.

, Connect the red and white RCA plugs on the cable to the matching red and white jacks on your cassette deck or receiver. (Note that some receivers have a special ""recording output,"" which is fine to use as well—it delivers the same output levels as the line out of a cassette deck). Insert the 3.5mm plug into the line in jack on your computer.


Make certain the plugs are inserted completely and are secure.
If your PC or laptop does not have a line-in, you may also be able to use the microphone-in port. Keep in mind however, that the microphone-in port is usually monophonic, not stereophonic.

, Plug in the XLR or phone plugs into the left and right outputs, and the other end of the balanced cables into your computer's sound input. If you are plugging into an unbalanced 3.5mm line input jack, you will need an adapter that converts the balanced outputs to unbalanced outputs, and matches the connector of the line input of your sound card.


Note: under no circumstances connect your speaker outputs to any input of your sound card. This will, in all likelihood, destroy your sound card, and could possibly damage your amp as well.

, In order to get the best recordings, you will want to ensure that you have just the right amount of signal coming in. Too loud, and your sound will be distorted. Too quiet, and there will be a lot of hiss and muffled sounds.

, Open the Sound control panel by clicking the Start button, then clicking Control Panel. Type ""sound,"" and then click Sound in the results.


Click the Recording tab, then click Line In, then click Set Default.
Click Properties, then click on the Levels tab. Move the volume slider to the right to increase the recording volume, then click OK. When you're returned to the Sound dialog box, click OK.

, Open the Sound control panel in System Preferences. Click on the Input button at the top of the window, and ensure that Line In is selected in the list.


Set the Input volume control in the Sound control panel to about 75%. Set the headphone output of your cassette deck to 0.
Locate a loud passage on the tape you're going to record from, then press ""Play"" on your cassette deck. Keep an eye on the meters as you slowly increase the output volume on the cassette deck. When the meters in the Sound control panel are flashing regularly around 80% (about 12 ""LEDs"" lit), you have a good recording level. If you need more level after the cassette deck output is at maximum, increase the Input volume in the Sound control panel. If you need less volume, reduce the level from the recorder. This will give you the cleanest signal overall.
Note: unless you have a very high output from your headphone jack, there is little risk of damaging your sound card using this method. By setting the output of your cassette deck to zero, then increasing gradually, you ensure that your sound card is not damaged.

, This will depend on how many cassettes you want to convert, how good you want the quality to be, and how you plan on playing your recordings on the computer. This article will cover basic sound recording, such as Audacity and QuickTime, as well as professional sound recording apps.

, It's easily available, well-supported, and is an excellent choice for doing basic, high-quality conversions. There are no frills, and has relatively simple editing capabilities, which means it's super easy to use. That makes it a great option if you're bringing lectures, audio books, or other long, unbroken blocks of audio.


For Macintosh users, QuickTime X, which ships with OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8, is able to record external sources.
For Windows (and older versions of the Mac OS), QuickTime 7 Pro is available for purchase from Apple. Start with this link: http://www.apple.com/quicktime/extending/ then pick the OS that is applicable to you.
Whether you use QuickTime Player X, or QuickTime Pro, it's the same process when you're ready to record.

, Ensure that your tape player is plugged in, and that you have set the levels properly. If any cables are loose or insecure, your sound won't have very high quality.

, This will open a simple control strip (QuickTime X) or preview window (QuickTime Pro).

, Press the red button in the middle of the control area, then press the play button on the cassette deck.

, Your file will be automatically saved to the desktop.

, When you finish recording, your file will be automatically saved to the desktop. You may prefer to save the file in a new location, such as a special folder. How you do it will depend on what version of QuickTime you are using.


If you are using QuickTime Player X: click on the menu on the right side of the control strip to select a different destination for the file.
If you are using QuickTime Pro: choose a different default location in the Recording pane of QuickTime Player Preferences.

, Every PC ships with Sound Recorder, and for a free little utility, it's become quite useful. There are no frills, which means it's super easy to use, and also completely basic when it comes to editing. Like QuickTime Player X, it's a great option to use if you're bringing lectures, audio books, or other long, unbroken blocks of audio.

, Click the Start button, and in the search box enter ""Sound Recorder."" In the list of results, click Sound Recorder.

, Click ""Start Recording,"" then press the play button on the cassette deck.

, Press ""Stop Recording,"" then press the stop button on your cassette deck.

, After this, you can use other editing programs to further enhance our recordings, such as trim off silences, enhance the sound, etc.

, If you do not have it, then you will need to download it. Audacity is a free, open-source application that is loaded with features and capabilities. It's also far more flexible than many commercial applications!

, Make sure it's set to Line Input by clicking on the menu next to the microphone icon.

, The record button is shaped like a red dot. The recording my take a while, so consider doing some other tasks in the meantime.


To avoid forgetting about your recording, run a reverse line out of the computer back to your stereo system's room speakers. You have to click the monitor box in Audacity for this to work. This way, when the cassette is done recording, you hear the room go silent, and you can rush over and click the stop recording button in audacity.

, When you are done recording, stop both the recording and the cassette player. The stop button in Audacity is usually shaped like a gold square.

, Trim silences, normalize so you get maximum volume, break into tracks, etc. For more information on using Audacity, click here.

, This will allow you to edit the metadata of the MP3 for things like: track, author, decade, album, etc. It will allow music players, like iTunes and Android, to recognize what kind of MP3 it is, such as: country, jazz, and what era , 70's, 80'.

, For even greater flexibility and professional cleanup, there are a number of apps ranging from about $50USD to over $500 USD. The details of operation vary, but they all follow the same essential process as even the most basic sound recorder:


Make sure that Line Input is selected in the software setup.

, Press record in the software and hit the play button on the cassette deck. Record your piece, then press the stop button in the software, and finally the stop button on the cassette deck.


How you start and stop recording in the software will depend on the program itself. Each one will have a slightly different layout.

, The benefit with professional apps is that they allow you to split your audio into regions (for CDs) and perform many professional mastering functions using high-quality plugins.


Options in the professional category include Sound Forge by Sony—an excellent choice for this type of work—as well as PolderbitS and Cubase on the PC, Garage Band and Logic Pro on the Mac, and ProTools on either.

, Before you transfer your entire tape collection over to your hard drive, make sure you're getting a good recording. Record what you did, then give it a listen. If you set up your signal chain correctly, you should have a fairly clean digital copy of your old analog tapes.


If the recording is too quiet or too noisy (the music is quiet but there's lots ""fuzzy"" noise), the output was too low and the recording did not have enough signal to offset the noise.
If the recorded sound sounds like it's being played through a broken speaker or a meat grinder, your recording was too loud, and the sound's distorted. Back off the output level from the tape player, and try again.

, You may not need to do any editing, but if you want to cut out silences, erase some tracks, or change the volume, for example, most sound recording programs will allow you to do so. This procedure is quite complex if you have no experience with sound editing, and is beyond the scope of this article.


When editing, it is a good idea to keep the original file as a backup and change the names of edited files when you save them in case you find you made a mistake. When you’re sure you like the edited file, you can delete the original to save drive space on your computer.

, Once you have a basically good recording, you can improve it through judicious use of software tools. Chief among those is Normalization. Basically, it works by making sure the loudest peaks are at or near 100% of full scale—when all the meters are lit (or 0dB, depending on your metering).

, This is not something you will use for every recording you make. It can render a lot of music lifeless. It works by keeping the loudest sounds about where they started, and bringing up the level of the quieter passages. You lose the difference between the highs and lows—or dynamics—and in return, you get an apparently louder recording. When listening at home, this isn't necessarily desirable, but if you're making a CD for your car, it can be very useful.

, Depending on your speakers, how they're set up, and the quality of your overall playback system, adjusting the EQ to taste can be helpful. A word of caution, though: like compression, ""good"" EQ is subjective. While you may adjust the EQ so it sounds great on your system. But if you loan your CD to a friend with a different speaker system, it may come out sounding thin, or muffled, or honky, or just plain wrong.

, Once you've gone through the trouble of converting your old cassettes, Make saving a copy of your recording the first thing you do before you start doing destructive edits (normalization, EQ, compression, etc.)

Prepare to mount your TV.,
Choose the location for your hanging TV.,
Create a wiring network so you'll be able to connect your television to the power supply and input sources (cable, VCR or DVD player).,
Get the mounting system that matches your television's specifications.,
Use the installation guide that came with your mounting system to get detailed instructions on hanging your TV.,
Finished.

",How to Hang a Plasma TV Over the Fireplace," First, you will need to know whether your television even has the features required to make it mountable.


Find out if your plasma TV is VESA compatible to ensure that it can be mounted. There is usually a VESA label on the TV or on the packaging box.
If the TV is not VESA compatible, look for a mounting system attached at the back of your television or packed separately in the television's packaging box. The mounting system is usually a rectangular piece of metal with 2 bars running across it. In other cases it can be a metal base with a rod coming out of it that has an attachment contraption at the end. Your television should at least have some holes at the back for screws to go in to indicate that it is a mountable TV set.;
, Ask yourself how high you want the TV to be and how easily you will be able to connect it.


The TV should be near an electrical socket and at a comfortable viewing angle (a few inches above the height of your head while it is in the viewing position).
The viewing distance should be at least 3 times the screen width. For example, if you have a 42 inch TV (106 cm diagonal length) the viewing distance should at least be 126 inches (318 cm).

, The best way to do this is to run the wires through your walls. This can be easily done through drywall but can be difficult on other types of walls like brick walls because it requires drilling holes. If you want to preserve your walls you can use external wiring and just use wire clips to run the wires along the edges of the walls.

, Some generic mounting systems are compatible with many televisions but you should still make sure to get a TV mount that matches your exact TV model. Your TV should be compatible with wall mounts, ceiling mounts, or both.


Wall mounts come in a variety of styles ranging from basic to tilting and swiveling. If you want to hang a plasma TV over the fireplace you may want to use a tilting or swiveling system since you may need to frequently adjust the viewing angle.
Ceiling mounts are good for locations where you want to save space and mount your TV at a height. They are ideal for putting a television in the corner of a bedroom but may not be suitable for other areas where you will be sitting up instead of lying down.

, Usually the instructions tell you to attach 2 separate pieces, one at the back of your television and the other to your wall. The 2 pieces can then be locked together to fix the TV to the wall. Some televisions and mounts come with installation kits to make the job even easier.

Consider the type and size of TV you have, the dimensions of the room, and your intentions going forward. How many people do you want to be able to fit? Is your entertainment room spacious--which will allow for richer sound quality--or will you have to reign your ambition in a little bit? How many speakers can you feasibly place? These are things to consider before you even start planning the physical placement of your equipment.;
, Typically, you want your seating to be positioned between the TV and the adjacent wall, not up against it; that way, you can run speakers behind your couch or chair, creating a surround-sound experience.


This is a good time to evaluate the sound flow of the room as well. High-backed furniture and superfluous items will block or distort sound; try to keep your entertainment room as clean and low-profile as possible. , You've probably seen designations such as 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, and so on. In these cases, the first number stands for the quantity of speakers, and the "".1"" signifies the use of a subwoofer. Pick a speaker system that pertains to the size and location of your room.


As a general rule, if you live in an apartment or similarly close-knit location, a 5.1 stereo system will probably be the largest one you need, since any considerate volume on a larger speaker system will be redundant.
Similarly, you should pick a speaker system for the space in which it will preside, not for the space you think it will eventually belong in. You can always purchase a 2.1 speaker system for a small room and add on later.

, Measure the distance from your TV to your couch, from your couch to your back wall, and from the corners of the room to where you will be sitting. Place tape where you intend to put the speakers; the main ones will sit in front of the TV, while the surround sound usually goes behind the viewer. You want your speakers to deliver approximately the same sound to everyone in the room, so keep this in mind as you plan.
You will need to test your subwoofer before placing it, so don't worry about it for now.

, It's easy to get carried away while looking at shiny new electronics, so set a reasonable budget--one that allows you to purchase what you need, plus a little wiggle room--and stick to it.


Remember that last year's technology will always be cheaper than this year's same model, and it often does roughly the same thing. Especially if you're trying to save money, don't buy brand-new tech.

, Basic home theater audio systems mandate a receiver for all of your audio and visual technology, a subwoofer, and several speakers, along with all the pertinent cables; depending on your needs and limitations, you might opt for more than one subwoofer and several extra speakers or an extra power strip.


Keep in mind the limitations of your chosen room; you may need to add stands or mounting brackets to your shopping list as well.
One of the nice things about setting up a multi-speaker audio system is its customizability: you can always add or subtract speakers as your environment changes. Keep this in mind when purchasing the initial equipment.
When purchasing a receiver, make sure it has enough outputs for the hardware you're running, since any DVD players or consoles should be attached to the receiver rather than the TV. Similarly, make sure it has the correct inputs and outputs for your hardware; you don't want to purchase an older receiver that only has analog input (the standard red and white cables) when your TV is capable of running an HDMI cable.

, Find a reputable brand such as Samsung, Bose, or Sony, and stick with that company as you research your technology. As you delve into specific models within these subsets, be on the lookout for common problems or longevity issues. Basics are always better to start with. You're better off getting a relatively plain receiver that does exactly what you need and no more than spending twice as much on a receiver with a ton of features you'll never use. The same logic applies to speakers.
It's a good idea to research features of specific brands and models; often times, these ""valuable"" features turn out to be unnecessary or downright negligible. Don't spend extra for nothing!

, Especially if you're buying equipment online, where it is often cheaper, make sure you buy directly from a retailer; while third-party providers often have seemingly incredible deals, there's always a solid chance that you'll end up getting an inferior product with no warranty.


Places like Best Buy and Walmart tend to stock reputable brands for a reasonable price.

, Brands will often try to trick you into spending exponentially more money than necessary on things like gold-plated HDMI cables or triple insulated speaker cable, under the premise that you'll get better sound quality. In reality, you're not likely to notice the difference in sound quality between cheap speaker cable and its expensive counterpart, so always err on the side of inexpensive when it comes to cables. Technology needs to be replaced often enough that, unless you have an extensive budget for your home theater audio system, it isn't worth buying the top-shelf products.


For example, if you don't own Apple products, don't buy a receiver that costs more because it has built-in Airplay. You will need to buy speaker cable to connect your speakers to your receiver's audio outputs--use this as an opportunity to stock up in case you suffer a short-circuit or a crimped wire.

, After you've bought everything and signed off on all the receipts, a sales rep will usually ask if you want a 3-year warranty or something similar on your equipment. Since $30-$40 extra is infinitely less than the cost of having to purchase everything again after your basement floods, consider obliging.

, Once you've hauled in your boxes of electronics, clear the entertainment room and lay everything out. Take inventory of what you have, and if you've forgotten something, go back out and get it before you start setting up.

, Before you plug anything in, place your receiver in front of (or underneath) your TV, then do a walk-through of where you want to place your speakers accordingly. For example, if you have a 5.1 system, consider placing 1 speaker directly in front of your TV, 2 on either side of the TV, and 1 on either side of the seating area. Leave your subwoofer alone for now.


Your setup will differ based on how many speakers you have, the layout of your room, and the height of your seating; this is simply a general reference.
The 2 speakers on either side of the TV should be placed firmly on the ground or a stand.
If you have a larger speaker system, place surplus speakers around or behind the seating area in an arc; this will enhance your surround-sound experience.

, From a top-down perspective, your front speakers should form an equilateral triangle with the center of your seating placed at the apex. Take the width of your room and the general number of people you hope to seat into account here--your speakers will need to be placed farther apart from one another if you hope to engage each member of a crowded room equally, whereas they can be fairly close together if you're the sole occupant.


Surround-sound speakers are best place to the immediate left and right of your seating arrangement, with the speakers elevated to roughly standing ear level. If you don't have enough room to the left and right, you can always mount the speakers behind your viewing area. , Once you've determined roughly where everything should go, attach your receiver to your TV and any existing pieces of hardware (consoles, Blu-ray, etc.). You should have a general A/V input (i.e., HDMI cable, optical cable, coaxial cable) to connect your TV to your receiver--this will differ based on your hardware, especially if you have older TV and receiver models. You may want to pull your TV away from the wall while you do this for ease of access.

, This is where you'll need your speaker cable; though some brands include these cables by default, you're better off buying your own.

, If you have a system higher than 2.1, plug in your remaining speakers to your receiver using speaker cable.

, Listen to a DVD or some music that you're familiar with; to figure out how to tweak your speakers' placement, walk around the room and take note of where the audio quality dips or otherwise sounds different than normal, then adjust the speakers accordingly.


Pay special attention to sound distortion; this can be especially indicative of poor speaker placement. To avoid distortion, make sure your speakers have plenty of room all around them to broadcast sound--don't place them in a corner or between objects. You may also need to play with your TV's audio settings to even out bass and treble.

, Since your subwoofer's sound quality will likely change based on the size and shape of your room, there isn't one universal way to place it, so experiment until the sound is balanced and refined.


A good rule of thumb with subwoofers is never place them directly against walls or in corners. Even with the right audio adjustments, this can distort your bass.
Entertainment systems with limited space usually resort to placing the subwoofer on one side of the TV, facing the seating area but not angled toward the viewer's head height like the other speakers.

, Walk around the room one final time to ensure your TV's audio is even and balanced throughout, experimenting with different bass settings to eliminate distortion as you go.


Remember that your end goal is to distribute the audio equally to everyone in the room; therefore, ensuring that the audio is consistent throughout the seating area should be your top priority.

Finally, ask for referrals!",How to Choose a Home Technology Specialist," In our technology driven era, many small integrators start businesses and survive just a short life only to learn it takes years of training and experience to be competitive in the consumer electronics world. Make sure the company you choose has been around a while - you need them to sustain to support your system!;
, Home technology companies specialize, much like the medical field, and you wouldn’t ask a dentist to fix your broken leg. It’s important to choose someone to help who is an expert in your home technology needs. The economical changes over the past few years have caused many businesses to reevaluate their product and service offerings. The problem is that a company, consider an electrical contractor that has 20 years of experience and is very reputable, is now marketing themselves as a home theater installation company. A few of their existing dealers sell the components, they know how to wire the home and connect the equipment and they can charge a rate lower than what you might find for a home theater specialist, so why not? For starters, they are experts in high voltage wiring and not home theaters. There are many aspects of a home theater that require expertise in design and installation to make the room a success. Additionally, the company may sell certain home theater products but not nearly as many quality options as an actual home theater specialist and certainly not the top quality automation products available to control them.

, Some integrators specialize in smaller projects and if you have a 10,000 square ft home, they may be incapable of the sophisticated design and programming required on a project that large in scale. And in the reverse, those integrators who only specialize in extremely custom projects may employ staff that are trained in sophisticated design and programming, costing you a higher hourly rate!

, Was your proposal a verbal “Um, about $50,000 for that theater” or did you receive a detailed printout with design documentation, a contract and warranty details?

, If your specialist doesn’t have them, that’s a problem. If they do, don’t just take them, call them! Sure, more often than not you won’t receive referrals that will speak too negatively about your specialist but you can hope for honesty. You can also consider all of the items mentioned above - what type of work has the specialist done in the past, scale of the projects and how smoothly did they go. If the referrals aren’t from projects similar to yours, take the hint and move on.

Make sure you have the space and money needed!,
Check around for deals.,
Know that all projectors work because they have a lamp inside of them.,
Performance.",How to Choose a Home Theater Projector," Projectors can be pretty expensive, especially if you want one of the newest models. Price can range anywhere from just under $1000 to well above $7500 or more.
, Oftentimes it's possible to get last year's model for much cheaper than the newest one on the market. Check ebayor craigslistto get ideas about prices.

, Lamps can be pricey and in some cases hard to get. Before you pick a projector (especially if you are buying used), check to make sure that it's possible to get a replacement lamp. Again, these run the gamut from a few hundred dollars to almost $1000. Check the price of the lamp for your projector and how much it costs. *Also note that manufacturer's sell projectors with lamps installed. If you are told by a vendor that you must purchase a lamp separately for a new projector, buy elsewhere.

, Lumens vs. contrast is usually the name of this game. Any projector over 1500 Lumens with a contrast ratio of 500:1 is typically going to work well in most settings. Optimally, there should be very little light in your home theater room to interfere. As for resolution, MOST (but not all) projectors can display 720p/1080i. Newer projectors can display at 1080p, but they are typically quite expensive. Check around and compare stats before you make a decision - there are a lot of factors to consider before you make your move.

Burn the file on to a CD or DVD or leave it on your computer.",How to Capture Analog Video," Many digital camcorders have A/V inputs that allow you to plug in analog devices. If your analog camcorder is broken or missing, you can instead use a digital camcorder that plays analog tapes.


If you have a fast computer with ample free space, however, you can use a USB converter to connect your analog camcorder directly to the computer.;
, Many digital camcorders have Firewire connections; to connect one to your computer, you will need a Firewire PCI card and a DV cable.

, Capture the video on your digital camcorder or allow it to ""passthrough"" to your computer.


Some digital camcorders have ""passthrough"" capability, where the raw feed from your analog camcorder will go directly through the digital camcorder and be captured in real time on your computer. Other digital camcorders require you to capture the analog video to the digital camcorder first and then manually transfer it over to your computer.

, Save the file.

, Consider the size of your analog video when deciding whether to use a CD or DVD to back it up. Burnable CDs range from 185 to 870 megabytes of storage capacity, while burnable DVDs range from 4 to 15 gigabytes, or up to 17 times the maximum storage capacity of a burnable CD.

Get some free software to figure out the box size.,
Type a speaker's details into the software.,
See if the software recommends a vented design or not.,
Figure out how big a box you will be happy with.,
Use the software to show you how the speaker will perform in your maximum sized box.,
Set the box's tuning frequency up, so that the line representing your speaker stays between 0 dB and -3dB for as long as possible towards the left (lower frequencies and therefore bass.),
Figure out the sized panels you will need to make a box from particle board or Medium Density Fiber fiberboard (MDF) 18mm thick or more should be fine.,
Glue (use pva wood glue in large quantities) and screw your sub together.,
Cut holes for the speaker, the vent (make sure the end inside the box will be 1 vent diameter from everything), and the amplifier.,
Launch yourself at the box with the PVA glue again, this time on the inside.,
Attach some plush carpet or proper speaker 'acoustic wool' (resembling the inside of a synthetic doona) to at least two walls of the box.,
Screw in the components and connect the speaker to the amplifier.

,
Use a long 'RCA' lead to connect the input on the plate amplifier to the .1 output on your home theatre amplifier.,
Listen for problems.,
Read some kind of home theatre magazine on how to set up a subwoofer in a room.",How to Build a Home Cinema Subwoofer Cabinet,";
, These funny numbers are T & S parameters named after some Aussie engineers. Sensitivity of a speaker is a measure of efficiency. Try and find one that is rated at more than 90 dB/watt at one metre and can take about 100 watts RMS of power. Parts express, Jaycar, and eBay are all good for various sub parts. Car subwoofer speakers WILL WORK FINE, as long as the overall ohm impedance is not lower than the receiver's.

, Try a few speakers until you find one that is suitable. Good ones are vented for efficiency and offer low low bass. This project has no vent ] but is still a solid performer. However, by cutting a round hole in it of the right diameter with the right length tube it would really take off down low.

, This may involve consulting your life partner. 130 liters (34.3 US gal) is pretty serious for a 12 or 15 inch speaker 100 liter (26.4 US gal) for a 10 inch. To calculate the volume you will be using the inside dimensions in cm (that way you will get the volume in milliliters) minus any bracing, amplifier, the back of the speaker and vents. Errors of 5% should not matter much.

, You will then be able to adjust the box's ""tuning frequency"" - don't worry about what this value is too much; just look at the graph and see if the vent is a reasonable length and diameter (see warnings).

, If it is still above -3dB at 35 Hz, you have some decent bass. The tuning frequency should end up somewhere between 20 Hz (wow you have got a decent speaker) and 40 Hz. All other things being equal, go lower. Below the tuning frequency speakers are relatively unhappy, so it pays to go low.

, (there is no need for any fanciness, just butt the pieces up against each other) Then get your hardware store to cut it. They will be straighter and squarer and more accurate than you (probably) which will make it easy to assemble.

, Screws at least twice as long as your MDF is thick are best. You will need to drill clearance holes to allow the screw to pass through plus smaller holes in the other pieces to allow the thread to go in. Go crazy and glue and screw some bits of wood onto the walls of the box to make it stiff. The box should vibrate as little as possible (the vibrating speaker makes the sound not the box - concrete anyone?) and be leak proof. Don't forget these brace bits (cleats) will change your box volume!

, 'Plate' amplifiers designed to mount in boxes are easy. Just remember to make sure that it does not touch the walls of its hole anywhere to avoid damage. Also remember it is a mains voltage device. If you spend 1.5 times on the amplifier what you did (or should have) on the speaker you will be OK. Matching the speaker to the amp watt for watt is good too. With an efficient speaker 200 watts is very very loud.

, Are all your corners sealed?

, Use glue. Do not stuff the box solid, this technique is for sealed, not vented boxes.

,, If you don't have one, most plate amps will create their own subwoofer channel and return the rest to your amplifier or direct to your speakers (see its manual).

, If it is a bit quiet and the auto on function does not work right (most plate amps will turn on when there is a signal) and if the plate amp has a stereo input then buy a cable that splits the single channel .1 into two identical wires and connect them to the stereo plate amp inputs.

, Or put it in the front corner and try the phase switch in both directions (don't panic if you can't tell any difference).

Know your own requirements.,
Research and purchase hardware.,
Assemble the system.
,
Configure the BIOS.,
Download and install a free distribution of Linux.,
Verify your TV tuner card is recognized by Ubuntu and functioning properly.

,Install a complete MythTV package, preferably one that is natively compiled for your own Linux distro.,Configure MythTV for a TV scheduling service such as SchedulesDirect.,Tweak your video compression level.,Set MythTV client to automatically launch on startup.",How to Build a Home Theater PC (HTPC)," Do you want to use this HTPC as a stereo as well? Will it store your MP3 collection and act as a server? What other users can you dedicate to it?;
, While almost any modern PC will work, specific component technologies will help your HTPC handle smooth recording and playback of video.
TV Tuner cards. Hauppauge has made their name a standard for TV tuners and other multimedia cards. The Hauppauge PVR-150 (a single TV tuner card) is more widely supported in third-party software than any other card. Multiple PVR-150 cards may be installed in one PC and recognized with any TV recording application without any customization. The same is true for the dual TV tuner card from Hauppauge, know as the PVR-500.






Memory. Almost any DDR memory is suitable for up to two TV tuners. For three or more TV tuners, DDR-400 or higher bandwidth memory with a CAS latency of 2 is recommended, and for DDR2, a CAS of 4 is recommended. Avoid DDR3 modules until the latency numbers are improved. Recording multiple streams of video while playing another requires decently low latency memory.






Case. You may buy a case specifically designed for HTPC systems, or use a standard ATX case. There is a lot of flexibility here depending upon where you plan to keep the system, and how much cooling you'll need. If you're opting to keep this in a central location such as a living room or den, you might want to focus on keeping the system quiet and dust-free. This is always a balancing act when higher performance components are utilized. Pick a case with more airflow and ventilation than you need for your components so that you'll be able to lower the fan speeds once its built.







,, Since this system will be powered on all of the time, one of our priorities is to minimize the time it's sitting idle while fully powered on. Not only does this conserve energy, but it also prolongs the life of your hardware. Inside of your system's BIOS configuration utility, you will want to set a timeout for a system standby mode. Some PCs will have additional controls for powering down components after so much idle time, while others will need to rely upon the operating system's settings to do this. Also, avoid using a suspend mode, as many operating systems have difficulty recovering from it.

, Ubuntu is one of the easiest and most popular distributions for MythTV since it already includes many of the individual components you'd need with other distributions. Feel free to choose a distribution that suits your need and expertise, but this guide will focus on Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn):
Download a LiveCD ISO image from a mirror site listed on ubuntu.org. An ISO image is an image of an optical disc that is ready to be burned onto a CD or DVD.






Burn the ISO to a spare CD using CD burning software such as Nero.






Boot your new HTPC to the installer CD.






Select the ""Start or install Ubuntu"" option or let this screen time out to select it automatically.






Double click on the ""Install"" icon once Ubuntu Live CD has loaded the desktop.






Select your language.






Select your location.






Select your keyboard layout.






Select manual partitioning scheme, and partition your drive(s) accordingly. This step assumes you have one large drive. For multiple drives, feel free to partition as necessary.






Create a root partition. For simplicity, this is where the system will boot, where Ubuntu will be installed, and where all applications and user data will be saved. At least 10GB is recommended for this partition, but feel free to select a larger size depending upon your needs. Make sure the type is set to the default ""ext3"", then type in a forward slash ""/"" for the mount point.






Create a swap partition. This should roughly be close to the same size as your physical RAM on the system, but anything less than that amount may hinder system performance. Anything double that amount is most likely overkill. Select ""swap"" as the type, and no mount point is allowed.






Create a partition in which to save your recorded video. The default type of ""ext3"" will work, but the ""jfs"" or ""xfs"" journaling file system types will speed up the time it takes to delete recordings. JFS will delete any file in 1 second or less, even if it's as large as 10GB. XFS will delete files quickly, but not quite as fast as JFS. The advantage of XFS is performance, but at an increased CPU overhead. Since an HTPC is not a dual-purpose PC with other applications running at the same time it is recording video, XFS is a good choice. Note that Ubuntu 7.04's installer may have issues with correctly calculating partition sizes for ""jfs"" and ""xfs"". For now, create a smaller sized partition, then ""grow"" it to use remaining free space once Ubuntu is installed. This is another worthwhile advantage of XFS over EXT2 or EXT3.






Select a user name and the default account to log into Ubuntu. Note that the name ""mythtv"" is a reserved account. Also, user names must start with a lowercase character, and cannot contain special characters. Next, create a password, and then select a name for the system.






Review the settings on the next window, then click on ""Install"".






Reboot your system when prompted to do so.






Install updates when prompted. Ubuntu should show a balloon-style message for updates in the top right of the desktop. Click on it and update everything listed. You will notice warnings regarding validated packages, but most of these should be from trusted sources. Review the list for yourself and de-select any you don't want if you're familiar with Linux packages. Otherwise, install all of the updates.

Choose the TV location before shopping.,
For the best results, get the biggest TV you can fit comfortably in the room.,
Pick the right type of TV for your room’s lighting.,
Don't neglect the thickness of the TV when shopping.,
Use resolution guidelines to determine picture quality.,
Know what inputs you need, specifically any device that can't use HDMI.",How to Buy a TV1," The room lighting, the size of the wall, the distance to the couches – all will matter when choosing a new TV. To get the best bang for your buck, you will want to know where the TV is going before purchasing. That way you can optimize the picture quality and size with regard to your current decor and furnishings instead of shuffling things later. You should know:


How far most people will be from the screen.
How and when sunlight in the room will hit the screen.
How big the wall for the TV is.;
, Think about how far away people will be from the TV. As a rule of thumb, you should be sitting 1½ - 2½ times the screen size away from the TV. So, if you want a 70” TV, you should allow for at least 9–15ft between the TV and your couch. When buying a TV, the size of the TV is the single most important factor to consider.


As a baseline, think of a 30"" minimum for a bedroom TV and 50-70"" for a living room TV.
TV sizes are measured diagonally, from the top left corner of the screen to the bottom right corner of the screen., One of the biggest considerations when buying a TV is the type of lighting in the room around it. When properly matched, the right lighting will lower the strain on your eyes as you watch TV and make your picture quality even better. OLED (organic light-emitting diode) TVs, while the most expensive, have the best picture quality in every scenario. That said, you have some options:



Dark or Dim Rooms: Plasma and OLED screens are best for dark rooms.

Bright, highly lit rooms: LED or LCD screens show off the clearest picture in bright light.

Normal lighting: LED or OLED generally work best in a variety of situations., TV is furniture, and is often the centerpiece of the room. So you need to make sure it will fit seamlessly into your living room without overcrowding or becoming unwieldy. Of course, thin TVs are easier to work with, but there are several other features that can make the difference:


Will you be buying a new TV stand, or using an old one? Ensure that the base of your TV fits securely on the stand and does not just out or balance precariously.

Can you mount the TV to a wall? This often saves the most space and eliminates the need for a bulky stand. You may, however, need an installation team if you are uncomfortable with carpentry.

, Resolution is how precise your image looks.The more pixels, the higher the resolution. This is why 2160p, also known as “4K Ultra HD,” is more expensive than 1080p, “Full HD,” or 720p. The ""p"" stands for how many pixels run up and down the screen in one row. More pixels give the picture better clarity and color.


As of 2016, 4K (4,000 pixels) is the current resolution champion, and prices are rapidly falling. By 2020, these TVs will be standard, and will thus last the longest. That said, 90% of consumers cannot tell the difference between 4K and 1080p -- the pixels are just too small for your eyes.
Don't buy a TV less than 1080p, since 720p is already dated and is not getting any younger.
Some systems are labeled with an “i.” such as 1080i. Just know that the picture quality is roughly the same as 1080p. 1080p has simply “won” the war over consumers., Luckily, this has only gotten easier, since almost everything uses HDMI cables these days. However, there are some devices, like a Nintendo Wii or the old VCR you can't part with, that will need older inputs. If this is a necessity for you, make sure you have a list of all your essential ports and inputs while shopping.


In general, 3-4 HDMI ports will cover all of your entertainment needs.
If you're confused about inputs and names, simply take a picture of the inputs and bring it with you to the store. Someone there will be able to give you specific advice."

Don't buy a TV.,
Appreciate silence.,
Read or write.,
Get your chores done more quickly.,
Realize this is a personal choice.,
Think about the benefits to your child-raising.,
Be cool about it.",How to Decide Against Owning a TV," If you have one, give it to someone else. Obvious step, but it bears saying. Maybe you don't feel you have to get rid of it altogether if you already own one. Put it in a closet or in a room you seldom use. Don't think about turning it on; put all the board games and sports gear in front of it!


Try not having a TV during a vacation. Hire a cabin without a TV and simply do without. The lack of a TV will cause you and your friends or family members to resort to finding many other fun activities to fill the TV void and soon, you won't even notice it's missing.;
, Much of modern society seems bent on filling every waking moment with noise of some sort. Sometimes, it's conversation - that's pleasant, because you're really interacting with others. Sometimes, it's music. That can be pleasant, too - if you like the music playing. But most often, it's just background noise - a TV blaring away in the background, not really being watched at all. It's just white noise, but it's distracting enough to keep you from getting things you care about done. Instead, with the TV gone, appreciate the sound of... nothing. Now you're free to play music of your choice, or to listen to nothing at all as you go about your daily life.

, Many times, writers seek solitude and silence by going to isolated places, as Thoreau did with Walden Pond. You can now enjoy writing, listening only to your muse. Or you can enjoy a book, allowing your imagination to fill in the sounds from the story, since you'll probably be more completely immersed than ever before.

, Without the TV pulling you to the couch, you should be able to get your household duties taken care of much faster. Don't procrastinate - it's not like you're missing anything by doing them right away.


If you've been used to watching TV while doing such chores as ironing or washing the dishes, find replacement distractions. Listen to music, listen to the radio (try a station that teaches you something new), or play an audio book. Another good way of dealing with larger chores is to break them down into a series of smaller chores, such as doing 15 minutes of ironing here and there instead of doing 1 hour of ironing at once. This makes it less tedious and there's less need for the TV relief.

, Much like the decision to become a vegan, to pursue yoga, or to quit smoking, this is your decision. After all, it's the way you want to live your life. Don't allow peer pressure to sway you. Don't argue about it, just smile and say, ""I find I'm getting more done now. I don't miss those TV shows enough to want to go back to the way I used to live."" And let the discussion end there.

, If you're a parent or guardian, not having a TV can really shake things up at home. Suddenly your children are left to discover a lot of other ways to entertain themselves, including making crafts, getting outdoors, using their imagination, and reading. The increasing concerns about using TV as a babysitter and the erosion of creativity brought on by watching the box too much won't be an issue in your home.


Be compassionate if you're at the receiving end of the ""Your kids are missing out on what all other kids have"" line; it's often fear of having to live TV-less talking. Simply smile and say something like ""They're having a lot of fun building Lego towers and tree houses. And their grades are amazing."" And if your kids want to watch TV when they visit their friends, let them; it's different strokes when in someone else's house.

, For some reason, just like some ex-smokers, some ex-vidiots tend to want to proselytize others. This can become quite obnoxious at times, admonishing others about their lives, and offering unwanted observations such as, ""Well, if you got rid of that TV, you might finish that screenplay."" Avoid making smug and superior statements when you're with friends who do enjoy TV and want to talk about things they've seen recently. Instead, listen pleasantly, enjoy their animated conversations, and refrain from attempting to bring them into your world.


Show them your world rather than tell them; do this by inviting them over for dinner - no TV makes for a nice after-dinner conversation. Remember - it's you who made the decision to be TV-free, and that is your right. But if your friends have not made the same decision, it's not up to you to ""improve"" them.

Understand which TV specifications don't mean anything at all.,
Opt for the highest color range possible only if you're serious about perfect quality.,
Only pay for 3D TVs if you're committed to the recurring extra costs.,
Purchase a Smart TV only if you don't have another streaming source.,
Avoid paying extra for curved TVs.",How to Buy a TV2," If it feels like there are eight billion TVs on the market, all with different stats and figures, you're not alone. These stats are meant to overwhelm you into buying something more expensive, but you don't have to fall for it. You can safely ignore the following terms and words when shopping -- they are just sales tactics:


Refresh rates (anything above 120Hz is fine)
Contrast Ratio
Motion Rate, ClearMotion, TruMotion, etc.
Viewing Angles
Premium HDMI ports (all HDMI will look the same, no matter the port)., HDR, or High Dynamic Range, is a newer color format meant to capture the greatest array of colors possible. The problem is that most sources (cable, Netflix, etc.) don't even send HDR quality color yet, so you'll likely notice little difference. That said, to better ""future-proof"" your TV, it might be a good option.


Obviously, more color is better. That doesn't mean that this small uptick now, however, is necessarily worth the extra $2-300.

, Unless you love watching 3D movies, skip this feature. Most companies have already passed over them, quietly shuffling 3D TVs out of their inventory because consumers were largely unimpressed. Why? Because you need expensive glasses for every viewer, a 3D compatible player, and extra-expensive movies that cannot be played on non-3D players. So, unless you really want to recreate the home theater experience at any cost, skip this feature.


All 3D TVs can play normal 2D movies. If you want the option, and money is no concern, you might as well go big for the 3D capabilities.

, Smart TVs have apps built in to show Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and other popular internet videos. While this may seem appealing, there are so many other streaming devices you can get cheaply that Smart TVs are often redundant. If you already have a way to stream media, skip the extra cost of a Smart TV.You can get a Google Chromecast, Roku, Amazon FireStick, Apple TV, or video game system with all the same features for $40-200.

, They are really just a fashion statement, with no real bearing on picture quality or enjoyment. Some people even lobby that they are worse, making it harder for a large group to all enjoy the screen from multiple angles."

Set your budget before you go shopping.,
Shop during November or March for the best prices on new TVs.,
Remember to save money for the sound system, which most TVs ignore.,
Spend your money on size, not fancy buzzwords and features.,
Never buy a TV purely based on its performance in a showroom.,
Read reviews before making any purchases.",How to Buy a TV3," TV's are sold more and more like cars, with gifted salespeople or advertisements attempting to up-sell you with fancy features and a load of techno-jumbled words. The best way to prevent spending more than you want is to come up with your maximum price before you enter the store or head online. When possible, be upfront about it -- tell the salesperson you will absolutely pay no more than this number, preventing them from showing you certain items. Basic pricing estimates, as of 2016, are:



32-inch: $150 to $500

39- to 43-inch: $250 to $1,100

46-to-52-inch: $380 to $1,600

55- to 59-inch: $450 to $2,500

65-inch: $700 to $5,000, TVs are expensive investments, and should last you many years when bought correctly. Waiting a month or two for enormous Christmas and Black Friday sales can be worth it, helping you get potentially better TV for your budget than you expected.


November is overwhelmingly the best time to get a cheap TV. Prices are always lowest on and before Black Friday, and you can usually buy them online.March, after the companies have debuted their new sets at the beginning of the year, is the next best chance at a cheap TV before the new models hit store., The slimmer TVs get, the worse they sound. Speakers need physical room to work, so ultra-thin sets often sound tinny. A basic sound bar is often your best bet if you don't already have a stereo system, and they are generally under $100. Still, remember to consider the sound when buying a TV -- it is worth accounting for when pricing., There are some features that will matter -- if you want a Smart TV, built in DVR, etc. -- but at the end of the day the picture size is the most important consideration. If you want a TV that will last and satisfyingly display everything from sports to video games, then bigger is better.Do not, however, just buy a big TV without accounting for the room size. Remember -- you want to sit roughly 1.5 to 2 times the size of the TV away for comfort, so a 60"" TV should have at least 90"" to 120"" of space in front of it.

, TVs in stores have artificially cranked up brightness and contrast meant to deceive you. They look great in a big row, with specially designed footage made to seem exciting, but they will under-perform when placed in your house and showing normal shows and movies.

Understand what it means ""to pull rank"".,
Decide whether pulling rank is something you're guilty of occasionally or frequently.,
Take a step back.,
Examine your motives.,
Think about a time when you have pulled rank on someone in your life.,
Make up your mind to stop pulling rank on people.,
Talk to someone.,
Improve your argument and discussion skills.,
Learn to be clear and precise in what you ask for.,
Maintain control by not allowing yourself to be sidetracked.,
Stop.",How to Avoid Pulling Rank," Certainly, you don't have to be in the armed services to do it. It can happen at home – ""It's my house"", or as a parent – ""I brought you into this world..."", or as a spouse – ""This is my way of doing it and you can lump it"", or as a colleague – ""I have 10 years of journalistic experience, so I definitely think I know more than you do about this"", and in many other contexts of your life. These examples are clear demonstrations of the many possible ways of pulling rank within your personal and professional life. Pulling rank is pretty much about using manipulation or one-upmanship to get what you want without being considerate of the other person's feelings, experience or knowledge and without being concerned at how arrogant or single-minded you're coming across.;
, Occasionally many people are tempted to pull rank when they feel that another person isn't taking them seriously or is attempting to push them around somewhat. Other times, it may simply be because you're tired and want some space back for yourself, such as when a spouse won't stop chattering or a teen keeps pushing your buttons. Occasional rank pulling can be easily apologized for and life goes back to normal. It becomes a problem when you use rank pulling tactics all the time as a way to make other people conform to your point of view, to override any dissension to your way of seeing things or to keep people in your life under control. Signs that relying on rank pulling tactics might be out of control for you include:


You're always reminding people about your qualifications, experience and expertise. Think about it this way though – if you feel that people need to be told, then it isn't obvious you have what it takes, which means that you're not actually performing to the standards you're bandying about.






You're always resorting to stand-over tactics to get others to do things for you rather than seeking collaborative, negotiated or compromised approaches to your relationships with others. It's ""my way or the highway"" as far as you're concerned and you feel disoriented and distrustful if new approaches are thrust upon you.






You insist that people acknowledge your interest and expertise in a matter even though everyone else about you has the same level of ability or knowledge. This is common in a workplace context or within hobby/volunteer/sporting etc. associations where passion drives everyone but you feel that your vision or drive is somehow superior to the passions of others.






You broach no feedback, talk back or dissension from people in your life, be they colleagues, subordinates at work, children or spouse at home, friends, etc. Should anyone persist, you feel easily hurt or angered that they appear to be overriding your status.







, Look at the situation. Try to pinpoint the real cause behind the need to pull rank over others. There are many possibilities but at the very least, ask yourself these questions:

Do I feel threatened?
Do I think people won't take me seriously unless I spell it out for them just why I matter?
Am I feeling that I need to take control over a situation or over people?
Do I have feelings of arrogance, disdain or condescension toward anybody or a group of people?
Am I finding things difficult to understand or is change threatening the ways I have always done things?
Am I behind the times? Is my knowledge outdated and I feel helpless?
Are people treating me differently from others around me because they're afraid of me or don't want to upset me?
Am I bossy?
Do I have personality disorders that I haven't sought treatment for?

, As well as asking yourself why you feel the need to pull rank, you also need to deal with what outcomes you hope to achieve by pulling rank on others. Pulling rank is often rooted in a need to control people and/or situations because you'd like to see certain outcomes assured. It involves believing that perfect outcomes are possible and you may well have perfectionist tendencies and very little leeway for what you perceive as stupidity, slowness or slackness in others. This doesn't mean you're aiming to be mean spirited or nasty necessarily but it can mean that you have emotional blinkers when it comes to other people's feelings and you are only concerned about getting things right than about caring about the people involved. Some things to ask yourself include:


Am I trying to cause emotional injury?
Do I want to hurt someone emotionally or mentally? Do I want them to feel that their efforts aren't good enough for me, for anyone?
Do I care if I hurt someone?
Do I take time to consider the feelings of the people I pull rank on?
Do I enjoy the feeling that people are responding to me out of fear or worry that they can't match up to my standards?

, What statement did you use to pull rank? Was it true or were you just ""blowing smoke"" to get the other person to react? What would be your response if someone said the same thing to you?


It is suggested that you write down some responses to the rank pulling statements that you've made recently, as if these statements have been made to you. Work through this to see just how hard it is to respond to such statements and to note how it feels to have someone pull rank on you and through that to thereby question your efforts, abilities, values, etc.







, Look for alternate solutions to getting people to listen to you and to follow your perspective. There are lots of ways, such as showing interest in what they have to say, listening to them and waiting respectfully for them to reciprocate, helping their ideas come into fruition as a collaborative effort, and offering to help teach instead of preach. Once you recognize that you are rank pulling and you can see the damage it's inflicting on your relationships, finding other ways to engage with the people in your life will turn into a much more fulfilling approach to your interactions. And you're far more likely to see the outcomes you really are looking for.


Realize that pulling rank isn't always wrong. Sometimes there may be an occasion when it is the only way to get an arrogant or wayward person to listen. But on the whole, it's a misguided approach to the majority of your relationships so be very wary of using it and be sparing in its application. It's the same as knowing when to pick your battles and which ones to leave!
Read How to give praise instead of criticism for some tips on how to turn a desire to criticize other people into a desire to praise and motivation to achieve the behavior you'd rather see in another person.







, If you are too close to the entire situation, it is a good idea to find someone who is not involved personally, so that you can talk it through. It can be a therapist, but it doesn't have to be. Try talking to a friend, a spiritual adviser, a counselor or even an acquaintance who is willing to listen. Be aware that we seldom listen to the free advice that we get from our friends; usually, we need to hear the same thing from a paid therapist before we listen, so be aware of that prejudice about your nearest and dearest.

, Pulling rank is your anger starting to spiral out of control and it will get worse if you lack the verbal and word skills needed to put across your point clearly without rancor. When it has gotten to that point, you are probably well on the way of losing self-control, or at the very least, you'll have lost control of the subject. Read widely on the subject of improving your discussion and argument skills, as well as on negotiating and being emotionally intelligent. In addition, there are many classes or workshops on communication that you can take both online and in your local area. In your own community, there might be classes run at night in community centers and high schools or specialist workshops run by therapists at their clinics. Ask your doctor or a therapist for a steer in the right direction.


Aim to learn skills of persuasion. Being gently persuasive can be far more effective and enduring than any amount of rank pulling and displays of power or anger.
Be amiable, friendly and kind. You will impress people far more with kindness and friendliness than with intolerance and irritability. It's a lot harder to let down or undermine someone who is kind but strong than someone who is angry but weak.
Distract. Learn to distract people from their bones of contention by offering better solutions, better ideas and better wins targeted at ensuring them of a winning outcome too, not one at their expense.

, People who pull rank are often so close to being explosive or impatient that they generalize and make all sorts of demands without being specific or reel off insults which hurt but solve nothing. If you know what you want (and this may be part of what you need to work on), then ask for it with absolute clarity and a sense of purpose. People sit up and pay attention to a person exuding purpose and clarity and will acknowledge that your determination is likely to exceed their refusal to come around to your way of thinking., There are times when the person with whom you are talking tries to derail the conversation in their favor by going left field with their comments and trying to make everything about themselves. Keep that in mind, and don't allow it to happen. Keep focused and continue to bring the discussion back to the point that you're trying to make in a gentle but firm manner. Eventually the other person will realize that you mean what you're saying and you're not going to be bamboozled by gloss or left field points. It is important to remain calm and to make it clear that once the matter has been discussed, it won't become a broken record between the two of you – resolve it, then move on. Don't hold grudges and don't bring up past issues again and again; this will let others know that you're strong enough to learn from past mistakes and to forgive others, making it easier for them to be more transparent and honest with you., If your argument or discussion develops to the point of shouting inanities at each other, like ""It's my house and I said so"", then it's time to take a break. If this happens a lot, try using a ""safety word"". When your talk is going nowhere, more than likely you both need to stop. Have an agreed upon word that, when said, stops everything, leave each other's presence for a break and return later when you've both cooled down and can resume a normal discussion.

Furthermore, if you've noticed any unquestionably illegal behavior such as stealing your things, assault, or trespassing on personal property, make an immediate note and call authorities. Depending on your age and situation, contact:


Police
School or workplace security
Teachers or administrators
Counselors or therapist
Parents;
, Stalkers thrive on secrecy and privacy. Notify your family, friends, neighbors and employers to not to give out your personal information, regardless of the innocuousness of the request or the identity of the questioner. Notify everyone to be cautious of any individual loitering around your neighborhood or place or employment.


Give security and friends the description and, if possible, license plate numbers for the stalker's vehicle., Having another person with you will greatly deter most stalkers from approaching. Walk out to your car with a coworker, join a jogging group instead of going alone, and ask someone to come along for errands. There is safety in numbers., This may include letters, phone messages, emails, lurking, or any contact the stalker has attempted to make. Record the date when each contact occurred and keep this record in a safe place. If possible, make copies and give them to a trusted relative or friend, or place them in a safety deposit box. This can be used as evidence if you need to consult the police.


Save every bit of evidence, as well as a copy. Keep them in separate locations.
Save all digital communications, such as emails and phone calls, as well.
Write everything down. If you can take pictures, do so. You can never have enough evidence, no matter how small or trivial it seems., If you have children, make sure that they are always accompanied to and from school and activities. Notify your children's school(s) not to give out any of your information, and provide them a list of individuals who are allowed to pick up your children. Ask staff to request that anyone on that list provide photo ID to validate their identity. If you cannot pick up your children, contact the school to let them know exactly who will be picking them up.


Give your children a ""secret word."" If the person who comes for the children does not know the secret word when asked (by the children), then your children do not go with him/her and instead call for help immediately.

, Some stalkers, if they are unable to gain access to you, will target your animals. Do not leave pets outside unattended (even in a fenced in yard), and do not have pet doors. Have contact information for animal boarding homes and no-kill shelters in the case of an emergency where you are unable to take proper care of your pet(s).

, Install more secure door locks, a stronger door, and a peephole. Make your windows and doors more burglar proof with shatter-proof windows or a bars. Install security lights and a security system. Put your indoor lights on a timer system so someone always appears home A dog (or even a 'beware of dog sign') is a deterrent to home invasions.


Ask police to do regular check ups of your property if you see the stalker outside or frequently driving by.
If you live in an apartment or condominium, ask management about its security policies and make sure that there is not a listing of tenants easily accessible to the public.

, Carry it in a proper manner and familiarize yourself with how it is used. Only consider carrying a firearm if you have proper training in their use and are in compliance with your state's firearm laws. Keep in mind that any weapon that you carry could be used against you during an attack. This is a subject that you should discuss with law enforcement and an abuse/stalking counselor.


Personal defense classes are a good way to protect yourself without having to carry a weapon or defense system., You must have a plan in place that allows you to protect yourself as much as possible. Have a safe place where all family members can arrange to meet in event of an emergency (the location only being known to a very trusted relative or friend). At this safe location, have needed supplies in a 'flight kit' (money, clothing, medication etc.), as well as emergency numbers for police, legal assistance, and abuse/stalking assistance.


Be ready to leave at a drop of a hat if needed. Instead of always worrying, have a plan in place so that you can flee without having to think or pack.

, Keep in mind that a TRO or an Order or Protection is to initiate and assist the legal process -- it can not physically protect you from a stalker who is inclined towards violence. You must be responsible for your safety even with a TRO or OP in place. Always carry on your person two copies of the TRO or OOP that was issued, so that you can easily provide one to police and the stalker can not falsely claim to police that he/she wasn't aware of the TRO or OOP. An abuse/stalking counselor or victim's advocate may better assist you in determining what the best options for your situation are.


When discussing your options, bring any evidence and logs of harassment that you have., You should never try to ""fix"" the situation or the stalker. You should avoid contact as much as possible. That said, especially in the case of former partners or friends, some contact is inevitable. The following steps will help you if you absolutely must see/talk to someone, but the interaction should be kept brief and to the point.


Never try to reform a stalker or assume that you can work through it. Your only option is to totally break contact., Simply state that you are no longer interested in pursuing a friendship with them. Keep it quick and simple, then hang up or leave. Never add terms, like ""we could hang out if..."" or suggestions that ""time will fix things."" Do not leave a door open for future harassment.


""I do not want to see you again, ever. Is that clear?""
""You and I are no longer together. You need to leave now.""
""This relationship is over."", Tell the stalker in as few words as possible that they are not to contact you. ""Do not contact me again."" Do not engage in a lengthy dialogue or set of apologies. Let them know that you will call the police if they try. Your goal is to inform the stalker that their actions are harassment and warn them never to make contact with you from that point on. Record how and when you gave the warning along with any future incidents.


Do not listen to ""their side of the story,"" no matter how much they beg. They are far beyond that point., Your stalker may try to deliberately rile you by making provocative comments. Any response, even a negative one, only feeds into the stalker's belief that he/she is getting to you. Be strong and keep walking, and refuse to listen to any voicemail messages. It doesn't matter how low they stoop -- just move on.


Don't try and fix things, retaliate, or get a point in. You want no contact at all -- nothing positive, negative, or neutral. The only thing you should say is, ""please leave before I call the police.""

, Unfortunately, these individuals may willingly or unknowingly provide information about you to the stalker, such as new addresses or contact information. Do not allow people to act as ""go-betweens"" in an attempt to make contact with you. The stalker must be completely cut out of your life.

, Find them on Facebook, Twitter, and any other online forums and ban or block them from contact. Set all social media profiles to ""Friends Only"" instead of ""Public"" view. In your phone's ""contacts"" section, find their number and select ""block caller."" You do not want them to get any personal information from you at all, and ending all calls is much easier than trying to ignore them.


If they know any of your passwords, especially your email, change all of them immediately.
While it is a pain, permanently changing your email and phone number is the best way to ensure they cannot contact you at all., Use this to keep copies of all documents pertaining to the stalking behavior. Also include important personal and financial papers, passport, social security and insurance information, and other vital information that you can access in the event of an emergency.


At the very least, put a lock on your mailbox. Do not let them get into personal information that may be delivered to you., Contact your phone company and ask for them to make your number and details private. You can also search yourself on the internet to see if there is anything you have missed. Refrain from mentioning your itinerary on social media. Finally, use creative usernames for Skype, IM and other accounts where people can search for you.


Do not use your real name online unless absolutely necessary. Something like SportsLover86 is far safer than anything that hints at your true identity.

, If you feel that your home is being watched, stay somewhere else, such as your parents' home or the homes of relatives or friends. If you are living away from family and have not yet made solid friendships in your new town, seek advice from a campus counselor or from the local police for alternatives or to request check-ups on your property.


If you must move permanently, leave early and rent a moving service to get your things discretely. Do not wait around the house with your things., Do not open unexpected packages. Never open anonymous mail. The same goes for emails and attachments.

, Keep everything close the chest, from living situations to your email address and phone numbers. While difficult, you must become more guarded and cautious to avoid leaking information to your stalker., This is no fun, but it is necessary. Ditch your longstanding running route, pick a new park or restaurant to frequent, and avoid the spots you're generally known to visit. Eventually, you may be able to return here, but for now they are common spots where a stalker might wait for you., Following these steps will prevent the stalker from spying on you and figuring out where you are and what you're doing. Be sure to set all of your social networking website information to ""private"" and make all attempts to block the stalker from accessing your information.

Be pleasant.,
Offer compliments.,
Look within.,
Don't take it personally.",How to Get Along With Difficult People1," Sometimes a relationship with a difficult person can be improved with a little extra kindness. Smile and say hello when you see the difficult person you are dealing with. Being friendly isn't a sign of weakness.Sometimes a little humor can go a long way. If you can tell a friendly joke, this could go a long way toward lightening the mood.;
, In some cases, a person may be difficult because they feel that they are not being heard, appreciated, or understood. Making an effort to point out something they've done well once in a while may also improve the relationship., If you truly want to improve a relationship with a difficult person, it's important to consider whether or to what extent the tension in your relationship with this individual might be caused by your own actions or attitudes.Is it possible you've been rude or done something to offend the person you are having a hard time with? If so, you should offer a sincere apology.It's also possible that your mannerisms toward this person are not communicating that you are listening or being mindful of their needs or feelings. In this case, improving the dynamic may be as simple as changing some of your non-verbal communication (e.g. gestures and tone) to show the person that you are listening, that you understand, or that you are not against them., If, after considering your own behaviors and attitude, you conclude you are not responsible for this individual's difficult behavior, try not to take their rudeness personally. The issue isn't you, it is their attitude.Even if this is the case, try to be compassionate. Keep in mind that this person might be treating you poorly because of some hardship they are experiencing in their own life.That doesn't mean you should let them abuse you, but being understanding may help improve the relationship.

Note how they act around you.,
Consider how you're feeling.,
Work through some possibilities before reaching your conclusion.,
Ask yourself.,
Ask others.,
Confront the person if you know them.,
Avoid contact with the person if the mean behaviour continues.,
Move on.",How to Determine Why Someone Is Treating You Poorly," What are some of the more overt signs that this person is not behaving in a very nice way and has mean-spirited intent? Some of the possible signs might include: gossiping about you to others, ignoring you, saying hurtful things to you, breaking or stealing your stuff, belittling you, setting you up to get into trouble for something you didn't do or say, calling you names, implying that you're not as clever/good-looking/well-connected/valuable, etc. as them, intimidating you, leaving unfriendly/unkind messages about you on social networking sites, or breaking promises they swore they'd meet.;
, What feelings or reactions do their words and actions give rise to in you? If you have a feeling that you're being picked on incessantly, that things being said are aimed at provoking or undermining you, and that everything the person says or does around you leaves you feeling negative, hurt, or demeaned in some way, then it's possible that this person is behaving in a mean way.

, Our own feelings tell only part of the story and sometimes we can get them very wrong because we haven't understood things from the other person's perspective. Thus, while you may be convinced that the actions or words of the other person are mean-spirited in intent and outcome, it remains important to work through some of the possible motivations or causes behind their behaviour. Doing so may give you a better idea of what their motive is; sometimes people are unintentionally hurtful or have been thoughtless without purposefully being mean-spirited. Whatever the act or comment, there is always an underlying cause which is good to understand before you take action against the person. Here are some things to ask yourself (and be be honest when answering):


Could it just be your imagination? If you're having a bad day, people can sometimes seem angrier and meaner than they would on a day in which you were happy; this is just the way your mind works, conferring your own nuances and feelings onto others.
Could they have a crush on you? Sometimes a person can try to gain your attention by being mean or insulting you, or they might be embarrassed and using it to deflect you temporarily. Not all people do this and if a person is seemingly being mean to you, it doesn't mean they have a crush on you and if it is a crush, you'll probably get other vibes and the mean behaviour is unlikely to go on for too long.
Could they be trying to teach you a lesson? Often young people, or even older people, take well-meaning advice or tough love from friends and family as being remarks intended to hurt or wound. Constructive feedback is not mean-spirited though, and people who love you could just be trying to help, so don't confuse the different approaches.
Could they be jealous? Do they say things to put you down or build themselves up? This could be the case if they're insecure, and what they're trying to do is to make themselves seem better than you. In this case, it is more a statement of what they think of themselves than what they think of you but it can be hard to see that when confronted with it.
Could you have accidentally insulted them? Without knowing it, you may have actually insulted them first. This is especially common among friends who don't want to upset each other; they may not want to confront you about something that you said or did, so they take out their passive anger on you by being mean instead of openly talking about their feelings.
Could they have troubles of their own? People who are unsure of how to reach out to others may take out their frustrations using anger - making other people feel bad seems like a convenient way to make yourself feel good, but it's always at the expense of the other person. Stress is a big cause of people being mean - someone may snap at you for no reason other than that they're feeling stressed and they've lost their ability to self-control their emotions. It's important to recognise when someone's simply venting their emotions in contrast to someone who is actually intending to be mean to you. Again, this isn't so much a statement about you, but concerns how they feel about themselves.
Could they just dislike you? This is probably a result of a number of the reasons given above (having personal issues, being jealous of you, even mixing you up with someone they didn't like from their past, etc.), but in many cases, people who are being mean to you don't do it because you've done something to hurt them.

, Why do you need validation from them? Do you need them so much that you would have to supplicate them to make yourself better? Its fine if they don't like you, who cares? Remember you are being insecure needy if you care.

, Get the opinions of others, especially your parents and friends, so you can decide what to do next or to help you become clearer on why this person is behaving in this manner. Never ask for advice from friends that may dislike the person you're asking them about; there is a risk in this case that they'll only paint the person in a negative light, possibly in order to make you have a fight or continue aggravated interactions with this person. The best people to ask are your parents or spouse, a trusted mentor or very trusted friend, or family; usually you'll find someone who is neutral and external enough from the mean behaviour who is in a position to help you.

, It's important that you complete the steps above about noting factual evidence of the mean behaviour, considering your own feelings, and working through the possibilities before confronting a person. Alleging that someone is being mean carries a lot of emotional weight and if you haven't got your facts sorted, and you accuse rather than express yourself (using ""I statements""), then you may make them feel angry or stupid, giving rise to defensiveness in place of a constructive conversation. Be sure that you weren't imagining it and they weren't having a simple one-off venting session; it is better not to turn the proverbial molehill into a mountain. Express to the person how you feel about the mean-spirited behaviour you've witnessed and let them know that you're open to discussing any relevant issues with them if they want to, and that you're especially keen to clear the air should you have said or done anything to upset them.


Stay calm and don't demand an apology or recite what they said word-for-word; just ask that they be more mindful of your feelings.
If the person doesn't have an answer, give them time to come back to you later - the ball's in their court now and they can either continue being mean or stop.
If they continue, you know that you've told them how much it hurts you. You have confirmation that they're doing this on purpose now, and you can consider taking other actions.
If this person is not well known to you, consider having someone else come with you, such as a friend, counsellor, parent, or other trusted person.

, After you've tried to sort things out, there isn't much more you can do to influence them to change their mind if they decide to keep being mean. It probably means that either they do actually hate you (which again, is not usually to do with you – mostly it is to do with them) or that they feel they can't lose face by changing their attitude and carry on regardless of the facts before them (again, this is not about you but about their own insecurities). However – and this is the key part – you do not have to put up with someone trying to make you feel bad. Remove yourself from their sphere and don't listen to their taunts, spiteful attitude, or meanness. Ask your friends to stop repeating any of it back to you and suggest that they also remove themselves. Just let people know that you're not going to tolerate it anymore and make a clean cut. Even the meanest person gets bored when their target stops responding and they'll look for someone else to hassle.

, By this stage, if mending fences hasn't worked even though you tried and you've put up a good defensive strategy of avoiding them, then consider acting as if this person isn't a part of your life; just leave them out if it they should have nothing else to do with you . However, it's likely that there will be residual feelings in you about why this even happened and about how it has left you feeling. Remember that there's no point in dwelling in the past; you did all you could to reconcile with the person and to stop them being mean to you. Get on with your life and activities, surround yourself by people who aren't mean to you, and focus on what matters to you. By demonstrating that the meanness hasn't tripped you up or spoiled your other relationships, you thrive while the mean person gets to live with their meanness.


If the mean behaviour continues or escalates, tell someone who can make a positive difference - if it's school, tell a teacher, family member or adult immediately. If it's at work, tell human resources, a trusted boss, or even trusted co-workers. You need to ensure your own safety from retaliation in the instance where it appears that the person in question may have developed a vendetta against you.
If the mean behaviour continues in the home environment, you're in a more difficult position. If it's siblings, ask your parents to intervene and to set solid rules and limitations on behaviour across the household. If it's a parent, talk to your other parent first. If both parents are defensive and refuse to help you, ask for help outside of the home, such as close family not living with you, a church or school counsellor, a trusted adult mentor, etc. Don't put up with anything that endangers you emotionally or physically.

Pay attention to their conversations.,
Challenge their worldview.,
Learn the quality of their friendships.,
See how they treat others who are unlike in some ways.,
Observe how their personality is like.,
Mention people you know that they don't like.,
Ask around to see what they've been saying about you.,
Be compassionate.",How to Detect Arrogant People," Don't eavesdrop, but when they're talking to you or to those around you, listen to them. Is it always about them? Do they get mad or irritated if the center of attention moves to someone else? These are good signs of arrogance.


Arrogance and smugness are often a reflection of limited life experience, and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience ""have got something over them."" Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning (actions viewed by them as showing vulnerability), arrogant people tend to generalize from their limited, narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others.
Jealousy of your achievements or seeming lifestyle can cause another person to feel smug or arrogant about something they think they do better than you or own/have that you don't.
Arrogant people have an extremely strong need to look good. When you make them look bad - even if it is the slightest offense - they will usually be very mad at you. This happens when you question (or at least seem to question) their appearance, intelligence, athletic abilities, or anything else relating to their self-image.;
, Don't be aggressive––just skeptical and curious. If they get upset, gauge their anger. If it's minimal, they may be simply having a bad day. But if they're enraged, then they may see you as questioning their ""perfect little world."" And having one of those is usually indicative of arrogance.


At some point or another, most people realize that the world doesn't revolve around them. Arrogant people counteract this by creating an atmosphere that revolves around them, and get angry if they're reminded of the real world.
Ambiguity frightens arrogant people because it suggests imperfection, change, and lack of certainty (realities we all must contend with as best we can). As such, instead of accepting that the world behaves randomly and at times totally averse to one's preferences, the arrogant person seeks to control everything and everyone, which of course, is an impossible mission.
Reality hurts when it intrudes; as such, an arrogant person is less likely than other people to self-reflect or analyze, thereby not seeing their own imperfections. They may also give themselves undue credit for positive achievements instead of acknowledging the input of others or of circumstances.

, Don't be nosy or gossipy, but if they are happy with someone one day and hateful with them the next, that's a sign of them having a lot of fair-weather friends. That's a sign of arrogance since it is very hard to be a truly good friend to someone who's stuck on themselves. Prideful people have a strong need to look good, and being self-sufficient is an effective way to do that. Since being a good friend to someone usually, means helping them, they often can't stand the thought of a good friendship.


Ironically, arrogant people often can't understand why they don't have any reliable and supportive friends.

, In other words, how do they treat those with different beliefs, cultural backgrounds and ways of seeing the world? If it's inherently negative, then they're either over-zealous, ignorant of other people, or what to avoid those that contradict their fantasy land that caters to them and them only. Determine this based on their general personality and the people they're interacting with.


Many times, prideful people have a serious ""my-way's-the-only-way"" attitude. This is simply a protective mechanism for their false image or their fantasy land.

, Take note of how they act, talk, and use their social status. Do they have a general sense of ""coolness""? Are they a chatterbox? Do they act like they own the place, or act like the ""big dog""? Are they very keen on their self-image?


Many arrogant people have a false charm that no one seems to see through. But the arrogant person is usually more than happy to show their cruel side to those that they don't like.
When they are cruel, their friends will usually ignore it or not do anything to stop it since they're afraid that they'll be treated badly by their ""friend.""

, This isn't meant to begin a conflict, but to gauge their rivalries, annoyances, and enmities. If their condemnation seems to be reasonable, they probably aren't hubristic. If it's harsh, they are.


For the most part, arrogant people see people that they don't like as threats to their perfect little world. The more they hate someone, the more dangerous that person is to their fantasy land. And in turn, the bigger the threat, the harsher the criticism.

, If they have been saying bad things about you, they may simply not like you. If they're nice to your face, but talk bad about you behind your back like it's their favorite hobby, then they probably have a problem with pride.


Arrogant people often subconsciously know that they don't have any good friends. They compensate for this by creating the ""impression"" that they have a lot of friends - they have a ""quantity, not quality"" mentality. Then they simply insult their trophy friends when they aren't looking.

, Don't be judgmental of arrogant people or you risk having as negative an outlook as they do. Arrogant people are often trying to hide certain vulnerabilities and fears. Most of the time, the need for a strong and unquestionable self-image comes out of deeply rooted pain. Obviously, you also don't need to be taken in by their claims to be superior to you. Stay principled and detached. But you can reach out and see the genuine good in them and praise what is real, rather than perceived or forced, talent. Sometimes, having someone push through the brusqueness can free the arrogant person to be much truer to themselves, allowing them to stop shielding themselves so fiercely.


An enormous amount of vulnerability tends to hide behind arrogance. This leads to overcompensating so that the vulnerability is deeply suppressed. For example, if an arrogant person grew up poor but later becomes rich, he or she may be snobbish about everything they can now afford because they are covering up the fear of poverty from the past...

Keep your cool.,
Acknowledge their feelings.,
Communicate clearly.,
Focus on the issue, not the person.,
Be assertive, but not aggressive.",How to Get Along With Difficult People2," When talking to a difficult person, stay calm and rational, avoid the temptation to try to win the argument, and don't be drawn into a battle you don't want to wage. You are much more likely to reach a satisfactory outcome if you can stay calm and rational.Think before reacting. Even if someone is extremely angry or rude to you, formulating a calm response is the best approach. It sets boundaries, and sends a message to them that they need to calm down., As previously mentioned, many people behave in a difficult way because they don't feel heard or understood. Just showing that you are listening to what they have to say can sometimes improve the situation.It's a good idea to let the person know you recognize their feelings. Offer your perceptions of their feelings, and ask for feedback, saying something like ""It sounds like you're very angry right now, and I'm sorry you feel that way."" This shows your willingness to understand their perspective.Ask what they are upset about. You can further show your willingness to empathize if you ask them to tell you about their feelings.Acknowledge valid criticisms. If the person is being extremely critical of you, try to find a kernel of truth in what they are saying, and acknowledge the validity of the point, even if their criticism isn't entirely fair or accurate. This may reduce the person's sense that they are being challenged, even if you then go on to point out where they aren't being fair or accurate., When dealing with a difficult person, it is important to communicate in a clear and open way. Many conflicts arise from misunderstandings.If you can, try to talk to the person face-to-face rather than via email or other technology. This reduces the risk of miscommunication and may foster more empathy.If you must engage in a dispute with someone, bring written evidence for your perspective to the table,and try to steer the discussion toward fact-based argument rather than statements of opinion or emotion., Focus your conversation on the issue or problem you have to solve, rather than the person you are dealing with. This helps prevent the conversation from devolving into personal attacks and may lead to more rational thinking on the part of the difficult individual.This approach has the added benefit of projecting yourself as a problem-solver who really cares about the issue at hand and wants to change the situation for the better., Communicate in a way that allows you to express your views and ideas about the situation at hand in a clear way, but without silencing the other person or making them feel that you aren't listening or being rude.Where possible, ask questions rather than making statements. Difficult people often have strong opinions. If you can lead them to see potential flaws in their reasoning without telling them they are wrong, you can often avoid unnecessary conflict.For example, politely asking them ""have you considered this problem?"" might be more productive than saying ""your way of thinking about this doesn't account for this issue.""
Use ""I"" statements. When you do make statements, make them about yourself rather than the person.This can diffuse the feeling that you are challenging or blaming them.For example, saying, ""I never received that email"" is less provocative than ""you never sent that email."" Similarly, ""I felt disrespected by that comment"" could be less inflammatory than ""you were very rude.""

"
"
Pick your battles.,
Limit your interactions.,
Walk away.",How to Get Along With Difficult People3," Sometimes, it's better to just let a difficult person be difficult. It may be more productive to let a rude comment roll off your back than engaging in what might become a prolonged and heated argument.Similarly, you have a coworker who is very good at some specific task, it might be worth tolerating difficult behavior in order to reap the benefits of their positive qualities.

, In some cases, the best thing you can do is simply limit the extent to which you have to interact with a difficult person by avoiding any unnecessary contact..


For example, if the difficult individual is someone you work with, you might want to skip the department luncheon or the after-work happy hour sometimes to avoid unpleasant interactions with one of your coworkers., Sometimes, the best option is to walk away from the situation, or even the entire relationship. If this is an option, it may be worth considering.A short-term fix to the problems presented by a difficult person is just to say: ""I can't deal with this issue right now. Let's talk about it later when we've had a chance to cool off.""
If you have a personal relationship with a difficult person, you may need to consider ending it. This can be difficult, but if you have tried improving the situation and the person in question is not open to change, it may not be worth maintaining a relationship."
"
Recognize what your goals are in addressing these criticisms.,
Learn to recognize the common hateful beliefs towards LGBT people that are out there, and more importantly why these are incorrect or unfair.,
Learn to recognize hate groups commonly responsible for publishing misinformation about LGBT people.,
If your religious group, region, or school is anti-gay, consider seeking out organizations that have resources for LGBT members of those communities.,
Remember that you can't change everyone's mind in regards to LGBT issues, but at the very least you can make it clear that you're an ally to the cause.",How to Recognize and Respond to Common Unfair Criticisms Made Against LGBT People," It's a noble goal to want to rid the world of bigotry, but you can't actually change anyone's mind for them. Set the bar too high and you'll probably end up disappointed or burned out. An alternative option for a goal would be to let others know that not everyone agrees with messages about LGBT people and they have an ally out there. Another could be to at the very least get a bigoted person to begin to question their views.;
, Many of these ideas have roots in antiquated social mores or religious beliefs, yet still more are the result of anti-LGBT focus groups and organizations who dedicate themselves to churning out poorly conducted research and propaganda against LGBT people. Here are some of the main talking points you'll run into:


""LGBT people are destroying the American family/traditional marriage/the country."" Just step back for a second and let this one soak in. How would LGBT persons affect the marriages of straight people exactly? Beyond that, isn't it true that LGBT people are members of many peoples' families, and wouldn't these families benefit by having their LGBT members able to be in a relationship? Challenge someone who says this to think of one example of LGBT people splitting up a traditional marriage between two heterosexual people. Alternatively, look at the astronomically high divorce rate among straight couples and ask why ""pro-family"" organizations wouldn't be better served by trying to outlaw divorce instead?
""Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender people can't possibly be happy/don't lead happy lives/live lives of slavery."" This is really not true at all. In fact, closeted people seem to lead much more unhappy life than those who are able to live openly. Perhaps more accurately, bigoted people can cause a lot of distress in the lives of LGBT people which is depressing. Perhaps most unfortunately, rhetoric of this kind can come from mental health professionals who overlook the self selection bias, essentially, all the LGBT people they know have mental health issues because those LGBT people are their patients and have sought them for treatment. The most rigorous studies on LGBT people have found that they have rates of mental health problems, no higher than the general population, and therapists or other professionals who insist otherwise are simply furthering the stigmatization of a targeted minority.
""LGB or T people are so much more promiscuous than the general population."" There is a stereotype out there, especially for lesbian, gay or bisexual people that they are somehow more promiscuous than the general population. In fact, if you are LGB or T, it's often difficult to find other LGB or T people for dates or otherwise, which is perhaps part of the reason for LGBT social organizations and the like. Straight people, especially the promiscuous ones, don't usually have to deal with this difficulty. There certainly are some promiscuous members of any group, but it's not clear that promiscuous straight people are less promiscuous than promiscuous LGBT people.
""Lesbians, Gays or Bisexuals don't have lasting relationships."" There's something fundamentally unfair about criticizing people for not having lasting relationships when most of the time the legal avenues for long term relationships are blocked. Even worse is in certain social milieus that are unwelcoming towards LGBT people, wherein such relationships have to remain hidden, which puts extra strain on those involved. Beyond that, it's not as if straight people are paragons of monogamy and lasting relationships themselves, look at the divorce rate, or the current extramarital lives of some top (heterosexual) politicians (including supposedly pro-family ones).
""Bisexual people don't exist/ are just looking to hook up with as many people as possible/ can't make up their minds."" An entire article could be written about the flack that bisexual individuals get. There are a few sources of this, one being that it's difficult for some people to wrap their minds around the fact that a woman could be dating a woman at one point and a man at a later point and still be the same bisexual/pansexual person she was before, and not ""a lesbian gone straight"" or something similar. Also, because someone is bisexual does not necessarily mean they are dating both men and women at the same time (unless polyamory is their thing), rather, many by people wish to have one relationship at a time. A great deal of these sorts of ideas comes from the LGBT community itself, so it's important to be on the lookout for them.
""It's just a phase."" If someone has come out as LGB or T, in all likelihood it's because they had to work for a long time to figure out who they are, against the messages from society that they were LGB or T. An LGBTQIAA identity isn't something someone just goes for because it's fashionable.
""Lesbian/Gay/Bi/Trans people are all masculine/feminine/'insert attempted label here' ."" Anyone who's actually involved in the LGBT community would tell you that LGBTQ people come in all personalities, shapes, sizes, gendered and the like. The easiest one that comes to mind for me is the gay bear subgroup, definitely not a feminine group of men. Sometimes, people who are in high pressure traditional gender roles aren't comfortable being out (yet) and this can reinforce stereotypes like ""gay men can't play sports"" etc. For example, in the NCAA, there is an absolute dearth of openly LGB or T sports players, which is even more pronounced in professional leagues. This is slowly changing though, and many LGBT people can attest to having experiences with people in school or life who no one would have otherwise guessed were LGBT, if they weren't those people themselves though.

, Unfortunately, there are still enough people who feel strongly against LGBTs that major news outlets like CNN still allow people from known hate groups to regularly commentate as expert guests without being adequately challenged or identified as such. The most prominent anti-LGBT groups are The American Family Association (AFA), the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), the National Association for the Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), Concerned Women for America (CWA) among myriad others. For a more complete list, check the ""Southern Poverty Law Center"", a legal entity dedicated to keeping track of American hate groups. Any information coming from an anti-gay group can be summarily discarded as unscientific and biased.

, Most religious denominations have LGBT organizations than can provide helpful information for those who run into religious criticisms etc. Beyond that there are many worship options for religiously inclined LGBTs. For schools, if your school is public, consider starting a gay-straight alliance. If the school's administrators block this and it's a public school, the ACLU will help you challenge them and get your club established.

, It may not seem like there are many LGBT people out there, but there are, and it will probably be helpful for them to know that there are people sticking up for them.

Accept other people's personal choices.,
Put yourself is a LGBT person's shoes.,
Recognize that happiness is what's most important.,
Accept that LGBT people are just as good parents as straight people are.",How to Learn to Accept a Gay Marriage1," Don't transfer your personal opinions and beliefs onto same-sex couples. We all make choices for ourselves that others would disagree with. Just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean that it is wrong.


Everybody is different. As long is someone is content and satisfied with their choices, you shouldn't try to change them.
Remember that the choice to enter a same-sex marriage actually means that the people getting married are committing to creating a life together. This commitment will give them the added benefit of the economic and social support that comes along with marriage. In essence, they are making a good and sensible decision.;
, Well, not literally of course. The point is to try and think about the issue from another perspective. If you wanted to marry someone you loved and the state told you you couldn't, how would that feel? It would feel horrible.


This does not mean that you can ever really understand what it is like to be a lesbian or gay person if you are not. It simply means that you have to be willing to look at the issue from a perspective different than your own.
If two people love and care for each other enough to fight extreme social bias to express their love for each other, you should give them the credit of overcoming the obstacles that a good number of couples take for granted.

, While you may not necessarily agree with same-sex marriage, if the couple is happy in their relationship then you should not pass judgment. A happy gay marriage is much healthier than a bitter, miserable opposite sex marriage.


As long as people are happy together, it shouldn't matter to you what sex they are, or whether their beliefs clash with yours.
Same-sex relationships can be even more successful than straight relationships. Fore example, studies are beginning to show that same-sex relationships usually include clearer and more direct communication, leading to a better ability to work through conflict., Some people who oppose same-sex marriage argue that if people of the same sex are married they will want to raise children and that will hurt children. However, this argument is just not true. Scientific research has shown that the children of same-sex parents are on par with children raised in straight households.Research has shown that the things that impact children are their relationships with their parents, their parents competence, and the families economic stability. The sexual orientation of the parents does not impact the success of the child but the inability of parents to benefit from the financial benefits of marriage could negatively affect children. Thus, same-sex marriage could actually benefit the children of LGBT people."

Discuss same-sex marriage with your loved ones and friends.,
Have a conversation with other people who have worked to accept same-sex marriage.,
Seek out other advice.,
Research same-sex marriage.",How to Learn to Accept a Gay Marriage2," Sometimes it is important to discuss your problems with others. It is good to get input from those that you love and respect. This will show you, if nothing else, that feelings about same-sex marriage are varied and complicated.


For example, ask your best friend or husband or wife how he or she feels about same-sex marriage. Say, ""I am trying to accept a same-sex marriage. How would you deal with this?""

, One place this might be possible is at a meeting of PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays).PFLAG is an organization made up of straight people working to increase gay and lesbian rights. Many of its members, however, have not always been so accepting. They have had to work through problems accepting gays and lesbians and they may be able to help you do the same.


Don't be afraid of going to a PFLAG meeting even if you still have reservations about same-sex marriage. Remember, many of the people at the meeting were probably in your shoes some time ago and so they should be understanding about your struggles.
There are also online forums where you can discuss issues you are having with those who have also gone through them. One such forum is hosted by Empty Closets., Some issues we simply cannot work out on our own. If you want to accept a gay marriage but are struggling seek out the guidance of a counselor or a religious leader the is accepting of same-sex marriage. They will help you through the process and give you the time you need to work through your problem.


If you belong to a religious institution that does not accept same-sex marriage consider visiting with a religious leader from a different denomination or faith that does accept it.They may have a different interpretation of religious texts that can help you accept both same-sex marriage and your religious faith.
Look for a therapist or counselor who is accepting of same-sex marriage. They can help you to process your feelings and come to terms with the issue.

, If you don't, or can't, talk to anyone about this issue, then find information online or in books. Researching the subject will help you realize what the same-sex couple is going through, and it will give you the knowledge to support them, and maybe even yourself during this time.


Look for unbiased data on same-sex marriage. Because the issue is so political, there are a lot of websites out there with very biased information. Only take information seriously that comes from good sources. For example, the Pew Research Center is an organization that compiles scientific data from all over the US."

Don't interfere in the relationship.,
Sit back and let whatever may happen, happen.,
Choose your battles.,
Try to be happy for the couple.,
Stay away.",How to Learn to Accept a Gay Marriage3," If you can't come to accept and embrace a same-sex marriage, it's important to at least learn how to be polite and nice about it. For instance, if you interfere too much and try to end the relationship, you can damage your relationship with those involved. Trying to make or influence the couple's decisions will simply cause arguments, friction, and pass you off as controlling and narrow minded.

, You might not like the outcome, but it's not your life. Let the same-sex couple find happiness and faults by themselves. Don't try to teach them yourself. In fact, the success of the relationship may surprise you.

, Some methods for objecting to something you disagree with can do more harm than good. Don't charge in with no thought of the repercussions of your actions. You could make the situation worse.


For example, if the couple has children, you may feel that this is not an ideal environment for the children. But there is no way to change the situation after the fact, without causing the children far greater harm. A child who already knows and loves two parents of the same sex will not benefit in any way from being separated from one or both of them. This is a situation in which, even if the marriage ended, it would do more harm than good.
If your personal beliefs do not agree with same-sex relationships, don't pretend you agree but don't introduce or pursue the subject. As it's wrong to lie and put up masks with people, it's also not right to stir up trouble or pick at wounds. If you know that you are never going to totally be accepting of the marriage, then don't bring it up!

, Don't show them any hatred or disgust. Instead, show them love and open arms. This situation is probably hard enough to lay out on the table, so the couple will need all the support they can get. Do not sit in judgment of their actions, or feel you have to accept it.


Consider telling the couple, ""I am so happy that your are happy."" This doesn't bring your negative feelings about same-sex marriage into the conversation but is an honest expression of your feelings as well.

, If you can't find it in yourself to be supportive, stay away until you feel that you can be civil. This may mean staying away from a same-sex couple completely or just cooling off until you can control what comes out of your mouth.


If you are finding it hard to accept the marriage, it's a sensible idea to keep your distance until you do. Otherwise you may end up saying or doing something you will later regret. Give yourself the time and space to work on your problem without forcing it on the happy couple.

Show emotion. Showing emotions to a friend is an important and easy way to show them you really care. Being open can result in two things: Either you get hurt because you left yourself open or you are given secrets when friends confide in you. However, it's better to reveal your emotions than to bury them so deep that your friend finds you shallow. Give it a chance.;
, Kindness is a large part of developing and maintaining trust because in trusting your friends, you are giving them the gift of compassion and support. It is a great kindness to be able to readily show faith in another person and support them even when they don't feel that same level of faith in themselves. It is kindness that cements the growth of trust.

, If you ask a lot of questions of a new friend from the very beginning, they will see it as a sign that you are interested in them and their life. This will indicate to them that you're not someone who only thinks about themselves and your friend will begin to confide in you with their deeper feelings and even their innermost secrets.

, Being humble is hard at times but, if you master it, then your friends will not be afraid of you judging them. Being humble is the best approach to reassuring a new friend that you aren't arrogant or condescending. A humble person earns trust because humility is about placing the other person first. In acknowledging that you make mistakes and that you're not all-knowing, your new friends can see that you're an easy person to like and eventually, to trust.

, While you may consider it just horseplay or funny, they may see it as demeaning and lacking in respect for them. A person you don't know at the start is a person who will eventually want to confide in you. Teasing or making fun of them is not a good idea because a person who constantly makes fun of people is a person who can't really be trusted and may be insecure enough to be condescending toward the friend out of their earshot. If you tease a friend from the start, when that friend is ready to confide in you with something serious, they will pass.

, Friendship is about give and take, not about dumping all of your problems on your friend. Trust can be difficult to establish when one friend demands too much time, comfort, support, or reassurance from the other friend. This can cause your friend to feel hassled out and to be wary of what you're going to dump on them next.


Give your friends space. Clingy and needy friends are suffocating and suggestive of a lack of belief in the friendship enduring breaks. Giving each other space is a sign that you trust your friend to still be your friend without having to be breathing down each other's necks constantly. You know your friend will be there when needed, and your friend knows that too.
Another reason to avoid being demanding and/or clingy is to lessen the element of fear or worry driving the relationship. A person is less likely to trust if they feel that there is a risk that the needy or clingy person might transfer their loyalty to someone who seems more supportive at the time, and impart confidential information just to win over a new friend.

, Judging your new friend won't help them to trust you. Initially they may find your ""advice"" helpful but after a while, when your friends realize that you always think you know what's best for them more than they do, they'll be afraid to come to you with any confidences. Instead, treat your friends fairly, with respect, and with dignity. Listen to their confidences in a supportive and non-judging way and given them your unconditional support.

, Talking on the phone is an excellent way of getting your friend to open up and share new ideas and thoughts with you. The trick is to ask questions, to use your voice to suggest your emotions, and to try to be serious with them. All of these combined will allow your new friend to reveal things they are feeling at the moment. Eventually they'll confide in you and trust that you actually care about them.

, Being nice is something easy we can all do. Sharing your things, your time, and your dreams with a new friend is an excellent way for them to grow to trust you. Your new friend will think about the whole of your goodness every now and then. You can share candy, money, clothes, your time, your skills, and even your holiday home. It's really up to you.

, I know from personal experience that its not good to tell al secret or something else that its makes your friend not trust you anymore. I also know that it hurts your feelings very much when a secret goes around about you.

Confide in a true friend that you trust.,
Play it safe by ending the relationship gently.,
Drift away from the friendship if you’re non-confrontational.,
Confront the frenemy if you want to be direct.,
Expect your frenemy to be surprised or in denial if you confront them.,
Grieve and then move forward.",How to Deal With Frenemies1," If you're not sure whether or not this person is a frenemy, talk over your concerns with a friend you're absolutely sure about and happy around. This person may throw new perspective onto the situation that helps you to realize the value of your relationship with the frenemy.


Be certain who you're talking to won’t pass your concerns back to the frenemy.;
, A sort of middle ground between quietly leaving the toxic friendship and confronting your frenemy is to kindly and gently suggest separating. If you’re soft in your delivery and stay away from blaming your frenemy, you’ll avoid dragging out a bad situation and carrying resentment later on.When gently ending the relationship, try saying something like:


“While I care about you, I don’t think that we’re great for each other. I think it would be healthy for us to go our separate ways.”
“I think it would be best for the both of us if we took a little time apart.”

, If you aren’t someone who is comfortable with confrontation but you know that you’d like to cut ties with your frenemy, lessen your involvement with them over time. This way, you avoid the stress of a difficult conversation while still making a positive, healthy decision for yourself.Become subtly less and less available until they aren’t a part of your life any more. Don’t always respond to their texts right away and busy your schedule so that you don’t have time to see them.

, If you’re typically comfortable with facing problems head-on, talk to the frenemy outright instead of carrying this burden on your shoulders. Avoid acting vulnerable or distressed; simply stick to the facts and express how certain things that have happened make you feel. For example:""I felt really put down when you suggested my costume was too tight for me in front of our dance class. Did you really mean to be so unkind?""
""It really hurt me yesterday when you said I was too ditzy and easily distracted to be a good speechwriter. I know you think you said it in a joking and funny way but the joke was made at my expense.""

, Being forthright about your feelings is basically calling out the frenemy and forcing them to either own up to their unkindness or deny it.


If they deny what you accuse them of or become angry and refuse to discuss it, they most likely will not stop their hurtful behavior.
Remember that if they have an angry reaction, you’re no longer interested in a friendship with them anyway. At least the truth is out in the open and you can begin focusing on the more positive relationships in your life.

, It’s okay to feel angry, sad, or miss your frenemy at first, but let those feelings pass so that you can move forward in a positive direction. This is a good time to analyze who you are and what kind of friend you’ve been. Brainstorm the qualities you want in your friendships, and work towards being that kind of friend yourself.No one is perfect, so you may act like a frenemy from time to time too. Be honest with yourself and make necessary changes to ensure that your relationships are healthy and strong.

Joke around about their ""absentmindedness"".,
At a restaurant, ask for separate checks when you order.,
Get to the root of their financial woes.,
Assign the moocher a fair share in advance.,
Mention that it's the moocher's turn to treat.,
Turn the tables.,
Address any mutual friends.",How to Deal With a Mooching Friend," For example, if your friend chronically ""forgets"" her wallet, assume that she will do so the next time you go out to dinner. Before you leave for the restaurant, smile and poke fun: ""You sure you've got your wallet this time?"" If they want to borrow something that probably isn't going to get returned, you can say something to the effect of ""Pretty soon you're going to have my entire wardrobe!"" Maintain a cheery disposition - the moocher should register that you're on to them, although that's not always enough to make them stop.;
, If the moocher tends to not order anything, but then picks incessantly at your dish, cough lightly on your food and say something like ""You might not want to eat these nachos... I think I might be getting the flu. Why don't I order you a separate dish?"" When you order, ask for that dish to be on a separate check. If your friends might think that's poor etiquette, say something like ""I'm writing it off as a business expense; I have to have separate receipts in case I screw up and get audited!""


Casually mention on your way out to eat that you only brought enough money to pay for yourself. Or say when you're planning the outing that everyone will be paying for themselves. Make sure you stick to this when the bill comes!







, Sometimes people are genuinely in a pinch, but if you're reading this, the moocher in question is probably someone who chronically looks for a free ride, and who you suspect is too lazy or cheap to pull their own weight. Every time they're short on cash, make it a point to bring up his or her money issues in private, shortly afterward. Approach the matter delicately, but make it clear that you've noticed their pattern, so that they don't feel like their mooching can slip under the radar:


I've noticed, lately, that you've been having a hard time pitching in when we go out. Is everything OK?






I'm a little worried about you; you seem to be short on cash, even though you just got a job/raise. Did something happen?







, If you're planning a road trip or dinner party, sketch out who will bring what. Make a list, and ask the mooching friend what he or she will bring. If they lament their financial situation, empathize and ask them to bring one of the less expensive items, or suggest that they cook something (which is always cheaper, but at least it requires effort). Once moochers see their names on a list, it won't be as easy to skimp. Just make sure that whatever they're responsible for bringing, they're the only ones responsible for it, so that if they don't, it'll be noticeable to everyone involved.


This will also work for that co-worker or sibling or friend who doesn't chip in for a community gift (for a parent, boss, etc.) yet still wants to sign his/her name for the card. Make a list!






If you have a mooching roommate, put up a whiteboard outlining chores and costs. Cross off an item whenever someone completes their task or pays their obligation. This will make it obvious that the moocher never crosses anything off.







, This is where it starts to get a little more confrontational. If the moocher turns you down somehow, or seems to blow the question off, you must threaten to cancel the event, and mean it.


Since I drove last time, can you do it this time around? - Oh, you can't? Well, OK. I'm having second thoughts about going, anyway.






I covered the tab last week, can you cover it this week? - If you can't, that's fine. Maybe we should find something else to do. Can you cover a game of pool?






Since last time we had lunch/dinner at my house, do you want to do it at your house this time? - Well, if we can't pin down a host, we might need to cancel the get-together. I can host once in a while, but not all the time.







, Since there have been plenty of times when you helped them out, test them and see if they'll return the favor. Mooch off of them. ""Forget"" your wallet, ask them to loan you money, borrow their clothes, and see what happens. It may feel unnatural for you, but you might really discover your friend's true colors by doing this. Don't wait until you're really in a pinch, only to discover that many of your friends will leave you high and dry.

, If you have mutual friends with the moocher, you may want to speak with them about the moocher's behavior in as diplomatic a way as possible. It's best if you can present a united front. For example, say ""Joe's a really cool guy, and he's a lot of fun to hang out with, but I've noticed he really doesn't pitch in whenever we go out as a group, and I'm worried that it will put a strain on our friendship. It would be great if we could do something about it so we don't have to have problems."" If you don't want to (or can't) drop the friendship, you might need to have some kind of intervention. Financial issues can tear people apart, so don't let your friend's mooching habits ruin your relationship.

Don’t gossip about your frenemy.,
Stay calm, cool, and collected.,
Don’t let yourself be affected by their negativity.,
Put yourself in your frenemy’s shoes.",How to Deal With Frenemies2," It’s best to keep the “enemy” part of your friendship to yourself. It can be really tempting to share all of your negative thoughts with friends, but you don’t want to sink to your frenemy’s level. If the goal is to keep things running smoothly, gossiping will ruin that by stirring things up.This will also keep your frenemy from getting between you and your true friends. By observing the frenemy’s trash talking as well as your lack of it, your true friends will see you more clearly as the trustworthy one.

, Do your best not to react emotionally when facing a frustrating challenge involving your frenemy. Your frenemy will most likely find satisfaction in getting a rise out of you, so it’s best to keep a cool head and act like nothing’s bothering you. Turning the other cheek will also make you appear more kind to you and your frenemy’s mutual friends., Counter the negative things that your frenemy says and does to keep problems from developing.


If you know your frenemy always bails on the plans you make together, always have a back-up plan.
If your frenemy has a passionate view of religion that you disagree with, consider steering clear of that subject while talking to them.If your frenemy always has to be right, ask them a question about something they said that you disagree with instead of challenging them., It might be easier to deal with your frenemy if you look at things from their perspective. If they find it so necessary to be nasty and mean to you, there’s probably a reason for it and it may have nothing to do with you. While this doesn’t justify their meanness, understanding where they’re coming from may help you take it with a grain of salt.Maybe your frenemy is having problems at home and doesn’t know how to handle their stress in a positive way.
Your frenemy may act mean in an attempt to hide their own insecurities.

Identify a frenemy by their destructive criticism.,
Recognize a frenemy by their lack of consideration.,
Spot a frenemy by their immediate, persistent interest in you.,
Recognize a frenemy by their backhanded compliments.,
Reflect on how you feel after spending time with the person.",How to Deal With Frenemies3," If a person expresses disagreement with or disapproval of you in a way that makes you feel shameful and guilty, they’re likely being a destructively critical frenemy. When a true friend disagrees with you or your actions, they are instead constructively critical. This usually involves offering loving advice and help that doesn’t leave you feeling judged.Frenemies often mask their destructive criticism with humor.A frenemy may even have something negative or critical to say about your accomplishments and good fortune.

, While a true friend always keeps your wants and needs in mind, a frenemy will rarely make an effort to make your life easier or better.


For example, if you’ve been a vegetarian for years and the person invites you and others over for a meat-heavy dinner with no alternative options, then they’re likely being purposely inconsiderate., While it may not seem like it on the surface, a person who gives you lots of attention, tells you their secrets, and asks you personal questions right away probably doesn’t have your best interest at heart. Recognize immediate obsession with you as a red flag.


Frenemies try to get too close to you too soon because they want you to feel tied to them.
They’re probably giving you attention because they want it back for themselves., Frenemies are often masters at the art of backhanded compliments, which are those compliments that sound okay at first but turn out to be offensive. If this sounds familiar, you might have a frenemy on your hands.


For example, they may say something like: ""I like it when you wash your hair; that's when it looks pretty."" This is suggesting that you are ugly without your hair washed., When trying to figure out if someone is your frenemy, listen to your instincts. How does being with this person leave you feeling? Use your feelings to identify whether or not this is a healthy, positive, genuine relationship.If you feel uplifted in their presence, then they most likely aren’t a frenemy.
If they typically leave you feeling drained, defensive, and unsupported, they might be a frenemy.

Nurture your relationships.",How to Hide That You're in Love With a Coworker," The easiest way to hide your feelings is to simply treat them normally. In theory this is simple, but in practice it can be challenging. If it is difficult for you to keep things “as usual,” then limit your contact with that coworker as much as reasonably possible.For example, avoid going out for lunch with them unless a large group also goes. If you do go with a group, do your best to socialize with the other people in the group besides the one you’re interested in.
Think about how you would act around any one of your coworkers, and mimic that behavior with your crush.;
, This can be difficult, especially if they tend to initiate the flirting. However, reciprocating this behavior (or initiating) it will be one of the most obvious signals that you are interested in them. If you do flirt, you won’t be able to hide your love for them for long. Would you flirt with a coworker you're not interested in? Probably not.


For example, don’t laugh at every funny comment they say. You don’t have to be rude, but a small smile at a joke, and a change of subject will show them you’re not interested.

, Obviously, you should avoid touching your coworker in an inappropriate way, but you should also avoid all physical contact (with the exception of a professional handshake, when necessary). Don’t put your hand on their arm if they say something teasing, don’t come up behind them and put your hands on their shoulders, and don’t hug them. Besides being obvious signals of your interest, it is also considered unprofessional in many working environments.

, If you, your love interest, and other colleagues are debating an issue, don’t side with your love interest all the time. If it is an important business decision, and the coworker you’re in love with truly does have the best idea, then by all means point out why their point of view makes the most sense. However, with smaller, more mundane decisions, try to avoid siding with them if you can.


When considering different perspectives, try to separate the idea from the person offering the idea. This will help you treat everyone fairly and normally.
If you are in a position of power, don’t give all the best tasks to your love interest. Other subordinates will quickly pick up on this, and your secret won’t be safe. Try to continue to be as fair as possible.

, If you feel that you are having trouble keeping it professional, consider taking one or two days off work (either by calling in sick or using vacation days). Sometimes, a little space can really help clear the air and help you refocus on what’s important.


During this time away from work, try to remind yourself why you want to keep your love to yourself. Maybe it is your dream job, and you don’t want to jeopardize it, or maybe you’re already in a committed relationship. Whatever the reason, try to convince yourself that this is not a person worth complicating your life for. Ideally, when you return to work, you will feel refocused on the job and not the coworker.

, In some cases, you may work very directly with the person you are in love with. Hopefully, taking steps to act professionally will help you hide your feelings, but if you feel that you cannot comfortably continue to work with this person, think about asking your boss to work on something different.


For example, maybe you can work on a different project, or in another area of the office.
Don’t tell your boss the real reason you want to move. Instead, give them a plausible excuse. For example, you could say that while you enjoy the work you’re doing, you’re hoping for a big challenge, so you wanted to ask if you could work on an idea you have to improve business strategy.

, If you aren’t able to distance yourself from the coworker (e.g. if it’s your boss or if you have daily meetings with them, or work very closely together) do your best to keep chatting related to work things, or at least keep it as superficial as possible. The more you chat about personal things, the more you will feel connected to them.If they ask you what you did over the weekend, you can respond with something like, “Oh, nothing special. Just took care of a few things.” Don’t then respond by asking them what they did. Keeping your answer short and not reciprocating will discourage further personal chatting.
If you need to chat in order to avoid an awkward silence, bring up generic things like the weather, or a big work deadline that is coming up.
Disregard any innuendos from your coworker. Of course, awkwardness will ensue if the coworker with whom you're in love with starts making advances. If you notice that the other person is flirting with you, disengage from the relationship or try to cut or reduce contact. In today’s technologically driven corporate workplace, you can conduct a good amount of business via email or the company’s intranet if possible.

, In some companies, it’s quite common to go out after work for a beer or for dinner. If the coworker you are interested is going, don’t go. Make up an excuse about how you’re having dinner with a friend or that you have to run some errands before heading home. Staying away from non-work related events where they will be present will help you avoid fantasizing about what your relationship would be like outside the office.If you must attend some event where your coworker will be present, distance yourself from them as much as possible without drawing attention. If there is alcohol present, do not drink any! If you drink alcohol, you will feel less inhibited, which may result in letting your thoughts slip., This may not be possible in every type of job, but if you are able to do so without being suspicious, choose email or other methods of communicating that your company might offer. This will give you time to process your feelings until you can behave normally around your coworker.If he or she works in another department, minimize your contact. If you're lucky enough to love from afar, it shouldn’t interfere directly with your job. Minimize contact when in the break room or after work.
Don’t go out of your way to avoid your coworker, but graciously maintain a safe distance. If you're obviously trying to avoid this coworker, you could end up calling more attention to yourself, and people may wonder why you're going out of your way to avoid the person.

, Even if your company doesn’t have a policy against office dating, if you have decided not to pursue your feelings for your coworker, it can be helpful to make it a rule for yourself.


Not only will this help you stay true to your desire to keep your feelings to yourself, it will also help you in the future, should you experience romantic feelings for a different coworker. If a coworker approaches you to let you know they have feelings for you, you can easily and gently let them down by simply explaining that you don’t date coworkers because it is a rule you have set for yourself.
Consider your coworker to be completely off limits. Resign yourself to the fact that this relationship simply isn’t going to happen. The sooner you believe it, the easier it will be to cloak how you really feel.

, Try to figure out if it’s true love you're feeling or if you're simply infatuated. While both instances produce strong feelings, you may be able to “get over” infatuation a little quicker than true love. Intense feelings of attraction can often be brought on by the pressures or excitement of the workplace and seeing your coworker perform well in these situations. If you transfer being impressed into more intimate feelings, you'll need to sort out whether this is something more enduring or just fleeting but continued feelings of awe.


How well do you know this person? In some cases you may be loving another from afar, whereas in other instances your love might have grown steadily over time, because you work closely together and have had the opportunity to discuss personal values and shared interests.
Do you really know this person? Have you fallen in love with his or her true inner qualities or are you infatuated with their work persona?
Are you captivated by their seeming allure in the workplace? Power or leadership are alluring in a workplace context and can lead to infatuation.

, Dating a coworker can be very messy. Unless one of you leaves the company, there are many risks involved. Other coworkers might think that you are abusing power (if you date a subordinate) or seeking favoritism (if you date the boss). Furthermore, coworkers might view you as untrustworthy if you are dating the boss because they worry that you might report everything they do and say.In many companies, office romances are strictly forbidden. Breaking this rule could be grounds for termination.

, The nature of a working together commonly inspires romantic feelings. You spend most of the day with your coworkers, you solve problems and face challenges together. It’s no surprise that you might find yourself experiencing romantic feelings at work.It is important to remember this because when you have feelings for someone, especially at first, those feelings can be very intense. At times, you may find it hard to stick to hiding your feelings, but remembering that many people experience feelings for their coworker at one point or another can help you realize that it is a consequence of the conditions, not true love.

, Perhaps seeing the reasons on paper or thinking it through carefully will help to quell your love or affection for your coworker, and help you work toward getting that person out of your head. There are many reasons for not getting involved with someone at work.If an office romance is forbidden, think about all the time and energy it would take to hide your relationship from others. If you go out to places with workplace friends or invite them over, you'll have to juggle a very complicated schedule of keeping them separate. While it is possible, it's tiring and eventually the amusement and excitement will wear thin until you're just bursting to tell.
Ponder your co-worker's negative qualities. So they are highly attractive, but this person most likely has some negative qualities too. If you focus on something negative, it might lessen your attraction or interest. Perhaps it's his or her annoying laugh, insistence on always being right or workaholic tendencies. Whatever it is, let it loom large in your thoughts as a reason for not getting intimately involved.
Could you get all your work done or stay focused on projects if you're pining away for another who works down the hall from you? For some people, it can be difficult to hide romance. Think about the fact that having an in-office lover could derail your career.
Since you work together, and spend all day together, you won’t have much else to talk about. All there is to talk about is the same work you do together all day long and if you have similar annoyances, you risk darkening each other's opinions about others in the workplace in unhelpful ways.
Think about what would happen if you were to break up. For most, working with an ex makes work life more challenging, and there is a risk of wanting to sabotage one another's efforts. If you can keep it professional despite a breakup, then it is manageable but can you be sure of your ability to keep all emotions out of it post intimate relationship?

, Sometimes, when we are experiencing feelings that we don’t know how to cope with, it can be tempting to give into a habit that we find comforting.For some people, this is binging on unhealthy foods such as chips or ice cream. For others, drinking alcohol, smoking, or doing drugs are ways to avoid dealing with these feelings. Whatever your unhealthy coping mechanism, try to identify it, and when you feel the urge to engage in that activity, turn to a different, more healthy way of dealing with your emotions.
If you are experiencing strong emotions related to hiding your feelings, try talking to a trusted friend (preferably one who isn’t also a coworker) or family member about what you are feeling. If you’d prefer not to, you can also write what you are feeling in a journal. Either way, it’s important that those feelings have an outlet.

, Maybe you already have a hobby you enjoy. If so, renew your interest in said hobby. If you don’t have a hobby that you enjoy, think about something you’ve always wanted to try, and go try it. Not only will this distract you from your romantic feelings, it will also make you feel empowered, helping you to deal with the situation.For example, if you’ve always been interested in rock climbing, but never actually tried, then look for a climbing gym in your area. Sign up for a beginner’s course. Not only will you get fit and find a new hobby, you will also meet new people.

, For many of us, most of our day is spent working. Depending on your organizational culture, many of your friends might also be your coworkers. While this is fine if you’re not struggling to hide romantic feelings for your coworker, having friends that are not coworkers will give you a safe place to go when you’re not at work.Non-work friends will give you a place to vent about your feelings (if you want to), and will also broaden your perspective. You will realize that there is life and other people outside of work, helping you get over unwanted romantic feelings.

, It’s not impossible that you are already in a committed relationship. If so, take time to reflect on this relationship, and the reasons that you’re in it. If you’re not in a romantic relationship, focus on improving other relationships you have (e.g. with friends or with family). When we feel attracted to someone, it’s not uncommon to neglect relationships we already have, so try to refocus your energy on the people you care about, and that care about you.


If you want to date someone, then consider people outside the workplace that you are interested in. If there isn’t anyone, then consider [[Succeed at Online Dating|online dating. If that’s not your thing, try attending social events. You can also meet new people through hobbies, sports, churches, and volunteer activities.

Stay away from drugs.,
Go to a social place.",How to Beat Loneliness," Is it because you're confined in some way, whether it be a jail cell or prison even being grounded? Are you feeling lonely because of a bad break up or the death of a loved one? Is it because of a lack of an intimate relationship? Is it social loneliness which often occurs due to the lack of friends or companions. Is it because you are not yet a part of your community?;
, Think about anything other than your loneliness. Loneliness and depression often go hand to hand and depression occurs from lack of activities that you avoid doing. You can get your mind away from those things by simply jogging and letting your mind travel in that time-space of exercise, Picture yourself in a happier place. Listening to music while jogging, just listening to music or reading a book also helps. Transporting yourself mentally into another place, another time by using your imagination is key.

, It's now time to face your loneliness instead of avoiding thinking about it. Most people jump this step because they're not ready to talk or even see anyone's face. During this time, put simply, talking to someone about this problem, ignoring the fact that it is controlling your life can make a huge difference.

, Many people try to beat loneliness with too much sleep, expecting it to go away but that can make you depressed. Sunlight is your best friend. Noticing small things like air and light can keep your mind busy. Working out is also great because it diverts your mind towards a different direction. Your enemies during loneliness are TV, sleep, over-eating, all of which will lead you into depression.

, This doesn't mean start being super friendly but meeting someone can be anything from buying a dog to going on a date. Pets are wonderful to have because they help you through all the steps. They will keep you feeling up and will help you exercise, so you don't think about your problem. Most pets will even help you cope with your loneliness. Any companion would do but if it's a human being, that's just a bonus.

, That could mean avoiding anything from cocaine to even energy drinks or coffee. Now it is okay to drink coffee so you can stay awake longer, but don't overdo it. You need some sleep, at least 8 hours. Stay away from anything that will make you remember anything sad or bad once you have faced your loneliness. You don't have to keep reminding yourself; just know it's there and you can go on with your life. Even try to forget about everything: the more your mind is clear the better.

, It could be school, a place where there is physical activity, e.g. the gym and talk to at least one person. It could be the guy working at 7 11 or a hot girl/guy at the club. You have to talk just for 30 seconds everyday and practice this at least 3 times a week.

Don't count on being friends.",How to Be Friends After a Bad Breakup," Let's face it, time does heal wounds. You can’t expect to be buddies right after learning of an affair or some other act of betrayal. Chances are, you both have lot of unhappy feelings floating around that you need to deal with. Rushing things could make them resent you, cutting down of your chances of staying friends in the future.Give them time alone. Don't call them every day or text them every hour. You may think you need to let the other person know how sorry you are, and you'll want to contact your ex. However, your ex will likely be too upset to be in contact with you right now.;
, While you're taking time apart, it's important to spend time working on other (non-romantic) relationships. Call up old friends that you may have neglected a bit while in your relationship. Spend time with your family. Building up other relationships will take some of the pressure off of being friends with your ex, as you have other people to lean on.This time spent working on other friendships helps you see yourself as a single person, rather than a couple. When you do try to befriend your ex, you'll have an easier time being in a friendship as independent people.

, You need to take time to build yourself back up as an individual again, and that also means exploring interests that may have lain dormant while you were in a relationship. Pick old hobbies back up by working on them a little bit each week or joining a club in your community.You can also explore new interests, ones you've always found fascinating but never had time to explore.
Consider getting books from the library to learn more or taking classes on your hobby at a local community college, through your parks and rec department, or from a local museum.
Exploring hobbies can help you establish yourself as an individual, which is important in building a friendship apart from the couple you were together.

, Going through a breakup will likely leave you wanting to hang out on the couch with some ice cream and a few movies. While that's okay for a day or two, you need to push yourself to get up after that. You need to get up and get moving, staying with your regular routine. Doing so will help you move on and regain independence.Make sure you are getting your regular exercise in. If swimming is your thing, go swimming. If you like yoga, make it a regular practice.
Also, don't forget to eat healthy. Eating healthy will make your body feel better, which in turn will make you feel better.

, Often, when you have a breakup, especially if you're the one being broken up with, you think that you can't actually live without the other person. In that case, you may want to strike up a friendship. While having a friendship with the person is fine, developing your own sense of self is important, and that starts with changing the way you think about the relationship.For example, if you think, ""I can't live without my partner,"" change that thought to ""I absolutely can live without my partner. I don't need her to stay alive. I need food and shelter and air and relationships, but this one relationship is not the sole focus of my life.""

, If you want to have a friendship with your partner, you can't go back to them with all the hurt and anger you ended the relationship with. That means that you need to do some hard emotional work before talking to your partner again and letting go of some of the hurt and anger.Allow yourself to grieve each day that you need to, but only allow yourself so much time each day, such as half an hour. That gives you the space to work through your feelings, while not letting you dwell on them too much.Give yourself some outlets for grieving. Maybe you need to talk about it with a friend or write in a journal. Another option is writing a letter to your ex that you don't send, where you talk about how the relationship made you feel in the end. You need to find some way to work through the emotions your dealing with.

, The first step in moving towards a friendship is contacting the person again. Your ex may not be that receptive at first, so you may need to be persistent in contacting the person, moving through various channels. Let them know you'd like to talk to them in person. Tell them what the conversation is about, so they can be prepared.You could say or write, ""Would you like to have lunch or coffee sometime? I'd really like to clear the air between us and discuss the possibility of being friends.""
Having the conversation in person is important because it gives you both the ability to read each other's emotions.
Try calling first and setting up a time when you can talk. You may need to write the person a text or email to get their attention, especially if they are screening your calls.

, It takes two to tango. No relationship ends or lasts because of just one person. Both of you need to take responsibility for your actions and apologize for them. Apologies can be difficult, especially right after you break up, which is why waiting is so important. It gives you the distance you need to apologize freely and genuinely.Admit what you did in the relationship that helped cause the breakup. Look at your own thoughts and actions and acknowledge that you did do something wrong.
Apologize for the mistake. Saying “I’m sorry” is not enough. It is best to identify what you are sorry for and explain your reasons for behaving as you did. For instance, you could say, ""I'm sorry for the problems I caused in our relationship. I know I was distant at times, and I take full responsibility for that. Maybe if I had been more attentive, we could have worked things out.""
Don't be upset if the person doesn't apologize. You can't force an apology, and you're apologizing for what you did wrong, which should be given freely. It shouldn't be a trade to get an apology back. However, if the other person doesn't apologize, you may not be ready to be friends.

, You need to get what you want out in the open. Talk about how you see your relationship moving forward. You need clear boundaries for a relationship because you don't want to fall back into old habits. Of course, that means you need to have a clear understanding of what you want out of the relationship.For example, you may want to stay friends because you've been friends for such a long time. In that case, you may want to return to the friendship you had, if possible. You could say, ""I know we've hurt each other, and I feel bad for the part I played in that. However, we've been friends so long that I don't want to lose you completely. I know it may take us a while, but I'd like to try to go back to the friendship we had before we started dating.""
On the other hand, maybe you just want to stay in touch with the person without seeing them weekly. For instance, you could say, ""I still feel very hurt by what happened, and I know you do, too. I know we may not be able to be best of friends for a period of time, but do you think we can keep in touch? For example, do you think we could remain friends on social media?""

, You've stated your goal. Now it's time to let your ex talk. They may or may not want the same thing as you, and you may have to compromise or give up on friendship for the moment. The important thing is you both have a chance to put forward how you see the relationship going.For instance, you could say, ""Well, I've said my bit. What are you thinking? Do you think we could be friends? Or do you think we need to close that door completely?""

, Once you've figured out how to be friends, it's important to skip the old arguments. You aren't here to change each other anymore. You need to let those arguments go because you aren't going to fix anything by having them again.For example, if you notice your ex is spending money recklessly, once a point of contention between you two, just bite your tongue. It's not your place to say anything anymore.
You also may want to make this boundary clear. For example, you could say, ""I'm glad we've agreed to be friends. However, can we agree not to revisit old arguments? I promise not to needle you about spending money if you promise not to lecture me about my eating habits.""

, One important indicator that makes it easier to be friends after a relationship is whether or not you were friends before the relationship started. In other words, if you had practice being just friends already, that makes it easier to do so after a relationship because you already know how to act around each other in that capacity.

, Another way to determine if you can still be friends is to consider how your relationship went while you were dating. That is, if your relationship was very volatile and both of you were unhappy most of the time, you're less likely to maintain a friendship post-breakup. However, if you were both fairly happy but found that you just wanted different things, then you're more likely to survive as a friendship.

, If only one of you wanted to break up, that means the other still wants to be close. If that's the case, then you may want to avoid friendship or at least wait a while before trying to be friends. Otherwise, it will just cause a great deal of hurt to the person who wants to be more than friends.On the other hand, if you both agreed it was time to break up, that may make it easier to stay friends.

, Sometimes, you still want to be friends with an ex because you have other motives than friendship, usually having to do with getting back together. For instance, maybe you always want to keep the person ""ready"" as a backup if you don't find anyone else to be in a relationship with. These types of ulterior motives make for bad friendships, and you'll only end up hurting each other more because you will both have trouble moving on.Another example is if you think the other person will eventually change to a more compatible person. If he or she didn't change when you were in a relationship, you're not likely to change him or her after the fact.

, At the end of the day you two might not be ready to be friends. Some people are never ready to forgive. If they don't want you in their lives, what's so great about them that you need them in yours? You've given them a chance to be friends with you, if they are willing to give that up, chances are, they aren't worth your efforts or your friendship in the first place."

Be sure first.,
Cut off your ties with them.,
Remain polite.,
Make your stand clear.,
Do not entertain them.,
Watch them.,
Stay at your very best.,
Surround yourself with positive and like-minded individuals.",How to Avoid Unfriendly Friends or Friendly Enemies," Follow your intuition. Friends can insult each other unknowingly. When in doubt of whether they are friends or friendly enemies, you could just see if the one who hurt you is ready to apologize or looks not so happy after hurting you. If they seem perfectly at peace or if they do it again and again, you know you have a friendly enemy.;
, Most bullies do not change their ways any sooner. If they get to a point where they enjoy hurting or maneuvering plans to trouble you, they would be very sure of what they are doing. This is to say that they may come back to you with more trouble. Do not share, talk or indulge in friendly conversations with them. The more you avoid them when you meet them, the better you will find to protect yourself.

, Unfriendly friends become so or behave badly because of some emotional or mental situation. There are some who do it for the fun of it. Either ways, it is best to remain civil and peaceable. As they are the friendly enemies and not you. You could be yourself and not get into revenge or bad mouthing them. This may put your character under scrutiny too.

, It goes without saying that the more they know that you do not want to be friends with them, the better the chances of them not getting back to you. Keep your distance and do not share any of your experiences or stories with them. Allow them to feel left out if they would. This is a classic way to have them realize that you do not need them. When you don't need them, they would not be under the impression that they could manipulate your feelings and hurt you.

, In order to hurt you they may try to involve themselves in your activities or try to voice their opinion in your matters. Do not entertain their views or accept help from them. Try to do your work on your own or with the help of those who are genuine with you. If you do not need friendly enemies, they may not have an opportunity to hurt you.

, Once they realize that they are not having any bad impact on you, they may feel discouraged and change, temporarily. They may not look at you as an easy victim to their jokes, pranks and insults. But if you allow them to get back in your life as friends, they may get back to being friendly enemies or unfriendly friends.

, Whatever they are jealous of, you keep improving it. Unfriendly friends should not affect you enough to get weak or lose trust in your strengths. The number of such friends are not certain. Hence, it may work well for you if you stay focused with your work and do not think about what they do, say and think about you.

, You could choose to be by yourself if you have no other friends. If you do have good friends with whom who have similarities or are supportive, you could appreciate them and work with them."

Share your feelings only if you think your friend is being disrespected.",How to Deal with a Friend's Rude Spouse," In some cases, a person is only rude because of a particular situation. For instance, your friend’s spouse may be running late for a meeting or tired from a long night. If their rudeness is unusual, try to be compassionate and remember that everybody is rude sometimes.


If being rude isn’t typically your friend’s spouse’s style, simply shrug off the remark and act like it didn’t happen. However, if this is merely one incident in a stream of insults or offenses, you may choose to not ignore the slight.In fact, even if the rudeness is customary treatment, ignoring them still may be a good idea. Research shows that the silent treatment is the best solution for coping with rude people.Do your best not to internalize their remarks or mistreatment of you! Remind yourself that their comment was about them and whatever they are going through.;
, If the comment was directed at you, and you find it impossible to ignore, share your opinion. But, do so with care. Tell your friend’s spouse how you disapprove of the remark, and offer a polite alternative for how they should treat you in the future.


Imagine that your best friend’s spouse called you a prude. You might say, “Well, that was rude, and really none of your business. I’d appreciate it if you kept your opinions about my sex life to yourself from now on.” Then, you might redirect the conversation to a new subject to prevent any conflict from escalating.

, Put simply, you don’t owe your friend’s rude spouse anything. But, you do owe your friend the courtesy of trying to show their spouse respect. If you are of the opinion that the spouse is rude and ill-mannered, maintain surface-level interactions with them at most.Keep your dialogue with your friend’s spouse short and sweet. Stick to commonplace greetings and phrases like “Hello,” “Thanks,” and “See you around.” If you are displeased by their behavior, there’s no need to try to be their friend.

, Just as you probably care to show respect to your friendship, you also have the right to respect yourself and get some distance. If every time you come around, you have to witness impolite language or behavior, remove yourself from the environment.If your friend asks what’s up, offer your excuse in a gentle way like “I'm going to leave now, Betty. I feel uncomfortable with Tommy's comments. I'll see you next time.”

, If you expect your friend’s spouse to treat you in a certain way, and those expectations are not met, then you might unfairly attribute intentional rudeness to them. To prevent this from happening, reflect on your expectations and see if you can adjust them to be more realistic.

For example, if your friend’s spouse is usually rude, then you might go into any situation where they will be present with low expectations for how they will behave. This way, you will not be as disappointed as you might be if you set high expectations for the situation.

, Trying to find out whether your friend’s spouse’s rudeness is contextual or merely a part of their personality? See how they behave in other environments around different people. Doing this can help you understand how to interact with the person without having the rudeness affect you negatively.


Watch how the spouse communicates with your friend. Are they ever rude to them, too? What about with their children? In-laws? Coworkers? Neighbors? Complete strangers?
Now, notice how others interact with the person. Do they keep their exchanges short and simple? Do they simply ignore any rude comments like they didn't happen. It can be helpful to follow suit and do the same around the person.Remember that it is not your job to change or ""fix"" that person, or your friend's marriage for that matter.

, One powerful aspect of being around a person who is rude is knowing you have a choice in how you react. Of course, you can be rude in return. But, you can also choose to show kindness and compassion to the person. Break the cycle by trying to empathize with your friend's spouse.For example, if you hear your friend's wife make a rude comment about how the family doesn't help with the household work, you might ask, ""What's wrong, Rachel?"" Engage her in conversation. She may be acting rude because she is ignored by the rest of her family and simply wants some validation.

, If the way your friend’s spouse behaves makes you uncomfortable, talk to a trusted loved one about it. It may help to choose someone who also knows this person so that you can get their opinion on the behavior.


Reach out to your partner, other friends, or family and share your concerns. You might say, “I felt that Walsh was especially rude tonight. Did you notice his behavior, or was it just me?” Be very careful about the person you choose to confide in. Otherwise, what you say may turn into gossip and may even damage your relationship with your friend.
Their reaction can help you judge whether this was a one-off or if it’s a personality trait. In some cases, you may even realize that you were simply being sensitive to a comment that was meant to be light-hearted or humorous.

, If your friend’s spouse’s rudeness results in you liking him less and less, keep your opinion to yourself. It won’t help matters to go venting to your friend about their spouse. In fact, doing so could serve to create a wedge between the two of you.If you just have to vent your frustration about his rude behavior to someone, do so with someone who is unbiased. While you can choose to vent to others who know him, if they disagree about your critique of him, you can cause conflict in these relationships, too.
Instead pick a coworker or different friend and complain about how rude he is. These people can offer you the support or validation you crave without jeopardizing any relationships.
However, keep in mind that you may become resentful over time that your friend does not stand up for you. Sometimes an empathetic discussion about how you'd like to limit exposure to their spouse is a good idea. Just make sure that it is constructive and centered on problem-solving. People typically know when they have rude spouses and can be understanding.

, If he is rude particularly to you or to everyone in general, limit the amount of time you have to spend with him. If you dread going to your friend’s house, start inviting them to yours. If they always want to plan double dates, tell them that you really want to spend more time with them alone.


To prevent any tension and protect yourself from his rudeness, aim for more time spend with your friend on their own., It’s easy to pull away from your friend because you can’t stand to be around their rude spouse. Try not to allow the spouse’s behavior to negatively impact your friendship. Remember, you don’t have to like their spouse or agree with their behavior.Your obligations as a friend are to your friend only. So, do your best to buffer any awkwardness by spending more time with them alone, if necessary.

, It can be hard to stand by and watch someone you care about get mistreated. If your friend often takes own a lot of the harsh comments of their spouse, pull them aside and share your concerns. Resist the temptation to tell them what to do. Just let them know you noticed their discomfort, and you are there for them.You might say, “Peter was really hard on you earlier. I think you did a great job preparing the meal for the church” or “Don’t take what Jessica says to heart. Many of us think you’re great with the kids. I’m here if you ever need to talk.”

Before you immediately confront him, think about how you'd want to be treated.Don't overreact to his request to borrow (again). Take a moment, and be patient with your friend. Be calm and respectful.
Consider setting up the conversation by saying, ""I don't want any tension between us, but I'm hoping we could talk about you borrowing my shirts."";
, Sometimes talking with your friend in public may not be the best idea. Your friend may feel embarrassed or cornered if it's in front of other friends.


Make sure you, or your friend, aren't in a rush. If you or your friend are stressed or in a big hurry, you may not be able to talk in way that you both are engaged in the conversation.
Pick a moment when you can have privacy, and have your friend's attention.

, Don't avoid the topic, or make it unclear about what you're talking about. Keep the topic focused on what she borrowed, or is trying to borrow. Don't get roped into discussing other issues or problems that are coming up. Focus and be clear about what you need her to stop doing.Your friend may act defensive and try to talk about other issues. Be clear that you are willing to talk about her concerns too, but first you and your friend need to address this specific issue.
Consider saying, for example, ""I want to focus on talking about the way you've been borrowing my phone.""
If the conversation is getting derailed, you can redirect it back by saying, ""I see you're concerned about the work you've got to do. I'm open to hearing about that, but before we talk about it, I wanted to make sure we're clear about when it's okay to use my computer.""

, Use statements that are not accusing your friend of wrong-doing, but rather focus on statements that indicate how his behavior makes you feel. Consider the following statements as examples:


""It makes me upset when you take my phone without asking.""
""It made me anxious and uneasy when you borrowed my favorite shirt.""

, It's also important listen to your friend's concerns. Instead of saying what you want to say, and then tuning your friend out, or ignoring her afterwards, give your friend the opportunity to speak.


Use active listening skills to show that you're really paying attention. Make eye contact. Paraphrase what you heard your friend say. Be present in the moment. Avoid things that distract you.
Your friend may be going through a difficult time. Be willing to set your time aside to listen about what's happening, or why she is borrowing more. Allow her to give an explanation.

, If your friend is borrowing without asking, make sure that it's clear he needs to ask before borrowing, even if it's something small. Set an example by doing the same. Always ask to borrow something, rather than taking it.If your friend is always taking without asking, your friend may not understand how to respect your stuff, or personal boundaries. See if your friend is willing to change his ways. Think about whether spending time with a friend that takes your things without asking is a healthy friendship for you.

, Sometimes friends borrow things for a temporary fix, like if they need to borrow a phone or a car since they don't have access to one for a little while. Other times, your friend may seem to taking full advantage, when you said in the past, ""Feel free to borrow anytime.""Watch out for when friends continue to overstep, and take things on a regular basis without giving back in return.

, For friends that think friendship means they can take and take, and there is no limit. Respectfully, talk with her about limits. If she's always asking to borrow your clothes, consider telling her she can borrow something of yours once a week.


It's up to you to set the limits that you're comfortable with. If she is borrowing something that you think she will be careless with, you can also tell her, ""Sorry, I can't help with that right now."" Consider offering her solutions in addition to saying no so that she doesn't feel left with nothing.Ensure that your friend understands the value and importance of the item she is borrowing.

, Another boundary might be conditions on borrowing, such as replacing what is borrowed or having it cleaned. It can be irritating to reach into your closet for your favorite shirt only to find that it's dirty, or not being able to find the nail clippers, etc. Say something like, ""I don't mind if you borrow my shirt, but please wash it and put it back in my closet after,"" or, ""If you're going to use my nail clippers, please return them to the drawer right after.""

, Some things are delicate, too valuable, or have emotional significance. If your friend is asking to borrow something that just doesn't feel right to give him, help to be clear that this is particularly special to you, so unfortunately you can't share it at the moment.


Offer to share something else if you feel that would work. Or, be very honest with him why this cannot be borrowed. You can say, ""No, I can't let you borrow that. It's special to me, and I don't want it leaving this room,"" or, ""That's my favorite shirt, and I know you'll be careful when you wear it, but I would be really upset if something happened to it or it got ruined. You can borrow another one, though!""
If it's a family heirloom or special thing from when you were a little kid, as your friend, the person will very likely understand its significance.Say something like, ""That watch was a gift from my grandfather who passed away, and I'm just not comfortable letting someone else wear it.""

, Find ways to reduce your friend's need to borrow. If she needs to look at something on your phone, find out if she can use another phone, or her own at a later time. If she wants to use your clothes, ask if she would like to go shopping, or see if there are other friends who have items to be borrowed.


Depending on what your friend is borrowing, be creative in helping to identify solutions and problem-solve with your friend. It could help your friend to think of other ways to handle her needs.

, Talk with your friend as you normally do, even if you're having a problem with him borrowing your things. Don't give your friend the ""silent treatment,"" hoping that he will figure out what's wrong. Unless you openly communicate, it's hard to know what's on your mind, or on someone else's.


Consider saying something like, ""Just so you know, I'm always here if you want to talk about anything.""

, Be kind and honest with your friend. A good friend is kind, respectful, trust-worthy, and sincere. Be this to your friend, and she will likely be the same. While your emotions may be high at times with your friend's behavior, think before you act.


You may be shy, or wish to avoid conflict, but oftentimes this leads to passive-aggressive behavior. You let your friend borrow something, even though you're annoyed, so instead you act out against your friend at a later point or hold a grudge. A healthy friendship is more honest up front, rather than letting things sit and then get out of control. "

Determine the person’s motive.Question the other person’s reasoning for the remark.,

Determine if there was some truth to the statement.,
Use humor.Humor serves three fundamental purposes after an insulting remark: it thwarts a mean-spirited insult, it lessens any animosity, and puts a potential audience in your corner.,
Ignore the slight.If you’re not much of a joker – or you tend to come up with witty comments hours later – you can always choose to let the remark slide.,

The context can often help you determine whether an insulting statement is mean-spirited or simply blunt. Figuring out motive will help guide your response.


If you are hanging out with friends or family, consider how you all usually communicate. Do you often gently tease on another as a form of affection? Was the comment stated in the middle of a heated discussion or during light-hearted conversation?
If you are in a social event with strangers or casual acquaintances, consider the tone of what the person said. He or she may have been nervous to approach you and used a frivolous remark to start a conversation not knowing that the remark could be taken offensively.
If you are in a work environment, consider whether this form of communication is second-nature. Some employment environments are ripe with constant ribbing. Does this person often say similar things to others?
If this occurred with a romantic partner, consider the surrounding context of the conversation. Were you arguing and your partner threw out an insult? Or, did they merely make a comment about your behavior/characteristics in a reasonably neutral context?;
, Impulsively reacting to a perceived insult means you’re putting your emotions in the driver’s seat. Returning the insult also undermines figuring out the motive of the remark – the person could have been teasing you in a light-hearted way and you make the situation worse. What’s more, when you snap back after an insult, you give the person insulting you power. You might also end up making this person look like a victim to everyone else.

, In some cases, we feel insulted by others’ comments because there is some truth to their words. If you feel a slight sting because of someone’s remark, rather than taking it personally, strive to use the comment as constructive criticism.If the subject is something that you genuinely want to get better at, then pull the person aside and ask him or her for suggestions to improve.


If the person is not someone who you would like to enlist for help, turn to someone else you can count on for timely advice on improving in this area.

,


Let’s say you’re hosting a house party and your roommate makes the comment that guests should place their coats in her room since yours is always so messy. Respond with a witty remark, such as, “Yeah, that’s a good idea. You might step in the wrong place in my room and upset my pet snake.”

, Honestly, choosing to ignore an insult, whether light-hearted or mean-spirited, gives you a lot of power. It’s like saying to the person, “I don’t find that comment worthy of my reaction”.


Note that you would only ignore an insult if you thought it to be minor. Crude and offensive remarks should not be tolerated, so if a person repetitively does this you need to speak up.

, If everyone loved the same things and hated the same things, the world would not be as interesting. If an insulting remark was made as a result of a difference in opinion, try not to take it personally.Now, respecting others’ opinions does not mean you should not be true to your own. It simply means recognizing that others look at the work through an entirely different lens than you do.


An example for reframing the comment and acknowledging it as the other person's opinion would be to immediately think of ways other people have described you to the contrary. Perhaps your coworker called you lazy, but your partner always praises your ability to take initiative and put in extra effort. Having a contradictory example confirms the statement as that person's opinion rather than a fact.

, If you choose to address the insult, ask the person - immediately or sometime after - if you could speak with him in private. Pulling him aside demonstrates some consideration as opposed to calling him out in public. Calmly tell the person that you find his comments to be insulting and that you would like them to stop right away. If appropriate, explain to the person that you will go to someone in authority if the comments do not stop.

One possible response could be: ""I'm sure you didn't mean this, but I really felt hurt by your comment. Could you refrain from saying X in the future?""

, If the person continues to make insulting comments despite your urging him to stop, take your complaints to the next level. Reach out to a teacher, parent, supervisor, or other person in authority and tell them about the insulting remarks.


Do not feel guilty about making these complaints. You gave this person ample opportunity to stop. If he or she chose not to, the consequences rest in this person’s hands – not yours.

, Insults can easily make you feel like the spotlight’s on you, or that you are being attacked. Strive to effectively cope with being insulted by taking a moment to collect yourself first. Doing this ensures that you do not insult the person back, which could tarnish your reputation. It also allows you time to really think about the insult and determine the underlying motive behind it.


Deep breathing can be very effective when you are feeling anxious or stressed.
To perform deep, diaphragmatic breathing, take a slow breath in through your nose for 4 counts. You should notice your belly rising. Hold the breath for 2 counts. Then, release it for 4 counts. Your belly should deflate as you exhale. Perform 6 to 8 cycles of deep breathing for greater calm and clarity in stressful situations., It’s normal to feel hurt, embarrassed or even ashamed by an insulting comment. It’s okay to take the time to feel whatever you’re feeling. While you do not want your emotions in the driver’s seat, you also do not want to lock them away in the trunk. Use the acronym TRUTH to help you in feeling your emotions.

Tell yourself the situation. Stick to the facts.

Realize what you’re feeling. Decide which emotion describes what you are feeling.Uncover self-criticism. Identify any negative self-talk you are having about the situation or your feelings. Examples include “I shouldn’t let him get under my skin” or “Why am I being such a wimp?”

Try to understand yourself. Think about why you are feeling the way you are. Are your feelings justified?

Have the feeling. Feel whatever you feel. Cry. Punch your teddy bear. Jump around in frustration.

, You can't be perfect all the time. This has two different meanings: 1) you aren’t made of steel, and, therefore, immune to insults and 2) there are small quirks about everyone that others may comment on. Rather than judging yourself or your reaction to insulting remarks, practice tender love and kindness.


The easiest way to know whether you are showing yourself compassion is to consider how you would treat a friend in a similar situation. Would you get mad at your friend for having her feelings hurt? Or, would you rub her arms and tell her it’s going to be okay? Treat yourself how you would a close friend.

Determine if your friend can change.,
Decide if you can keep being friends.,
Avoid becoming emotionally dependent.,
End the friendship if necessary.,
Recognize that it is normal to end friendships at different times of life.",How to Handle a Fair Weather Friendship1," You may have a friend who isn’t around when things get difficult, but that doesn’t mean they can’t change. Think about your friend’s personality and passions. If you told them that they tend to disappear when negative things happen, what do you think their reaction would be?


If your friend already knows that they tend to run away at any sign of trouble, sharing with them that this hurts you may not do any good.
However, if your friend is oblivious to this character flaw, sharing it with them might show them something they didn’t realize about themselves, and they may be motivated to change.;
, Whether or not your friend would change if you told them that their behavior hurts you, you need to think about whether or not you can remain friends with them as they are now—that is, as fair weather friends. It usually takes people a long time to change if they change at all.


If you think you want to stay friends, you have to let go of your expectations for this friend to be there for you. Once you do this, you may be able to have a normal friendship.
If you decide that you don’t want to be friends anymore, you should act on this decision.

, If you decide to stay friends with a fair weather friend, you must let go of your expectations that they can be relied upon. This means not sharing emotionally charged or privileged information with them anymore. If they can’t be there for you in hard times, they are not someone who can support you at all. Limit the things you share with them.


For example, don’t tell them things such as family secrets. If a friend can’t be relied on to be available during hard times, they can’t be trusted at all, not even to keep secrets.

, If you have thought about your friend and realized you don’t have time to waste on someone who doesn’t understand the basic give and take of friendships, you might want to end the friendship. There are a few ways to do this, including gradual backing off and confronting your friend directly.


The slowly backing off approach is usually easier, but may leave your friend feeling mystified and sad, as well as lacking closure. This approach may also end with your friend gossiping about you out of hurt.Confronting your friend directly is painful for both parties, but it can be the best way because it shows that you respect your friend enough to communicate clearly.

, Studies show that people make a lot of friends in their late teens, have fewer friends in their 20s as they are settling down and having children, have more friends in their 30s as they get used to having kids, and then start shutting people out again in their 40s and 50s as they decide what is most valuable in life.You may be in one of these stages of life, and you can explain that this is why you are ending a friendship.

Listen to each of your friends.,
Ask questions to find out what is going on.If your friend are reluctant to share, then you may have to ask some questions to get them talking.,
Clarify if something is unclear or untrue.,
Keep what you have heard to yourself.",How to Get Your Friends to Stop Fighting with Each Other1," One of the best things you can do for both of your friends is to simply listen to what each one has to say. Sitting down with each of them individually can help them to express how they feel and it can also help you to see what the fighting is all about if you are not sure. Ask each of your friends walk you through their point-of-view and explain why they’re upset.


Make sure that you meet with each of your friends separately or else they may just start fighting with each other in front of you. Try inviting each one over to your house on separate days.
Give your friends your full attention while they are sharing their perspectives. Put away your cell phone, turn off the TV, and remove any other distractions before you start listening. While your friend talks, make eye contact and show that you are listening by nodding and making neutral statements, such as “Uh-huh” and “I see.” If something is unclear, ask your friend to clarify.;
, Ask open-ended questions to get your friends talking. Open-ended questions are those that cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO.For example, you might say something like, “What happened with you and Joe the other day?” Or, “It seems like you are upset at Christina. What’s going on?”
It may take a couple of questions for them to open up, but once they do, try not to interrupt.

, Since you have an outsider’s perspective, you may be able to clarify if something is untrue. This might be especially helpful if the argument started over a piece of gossip. If you have information that might smooth things over, then share it.


For example, if one friend is mad at the other because she thinks the other person said something about her behind her back, and you know that this is not true, then you could say something like, “No, that’s just a rumor someone started. I was there and she did not say that.”

, After speaking with each of your friends one-on-one, you may feel tempted to call each of them up and share what was told to you. However, this is a bad idea. Remember that your friends have shared their perspectives and feelings with you in confidence. Do not share anything that you were told unless you have permission from your friend to do so.

Accept it.",How to Know if Your Friend No Longer Likes You," If your friend is regularly insulting or belittling you, or starting arguments over all kinds of things, he or she is not being a good friend. If your friend is doing this, confront him or her, and ask them to stop. If your friend doesn't, that is not a good sign.Types of insults can include teasing, sarcasm, and cynicism, comments that may sound like jokes, but are meant to hurt you.Some insults are more subtle, like backhanded compliments (complimenting you for negative things) or guilt-tripping (where your friend blames you for his or her distresses and problems).In many cases, your friend may try to pass these insults off as humor, and ridicule you for taking them personally.
It is possible that your friend doesn't know he or she is insulting you. If you are concerned, confront them. If your friend didn't know, they may apologize right away.;
, If your friend doesn't like you, he or she probably isn't making much of an effort to stay in touch. This means not just talking, but emails, texting, or any other form of communication. If you and your friend aren't talking very much, it is hard to say that you are still really friends.This reduced communication can refer to frequency or length. You may not talk as often as you used to. Or, if you do talk, your conversations are now very short, and you find that you don't have much to talk about.
You can also see this if you are the one making an effort at communication. Friendship takes effort. If you are the only one trying to stay in touch, then your friend is probably not interested.

, Along with not talking much, chances are your friend won't have been keeping you up to date with changes in his or her life. Friendship takes effort, and you shouldn't learn new things about your friend only through other people or social media., If you try to make plans, and your friend says he or she is too busy, but is later out with other friends during that time, that would be a sign of rejection.


People change, have new interests, and new friends. If your friend appears to be doing other things with new people, then those new people probably fit in better with his or her new interests.If your friend is not spending more time with others, but becoming withdrawn towards everyone, that could be a sign of more serious issues, like depression.If this might be the case, gather others, and as a group encourage your friend to seek help.

, If your friendship is turning sour, your meetings will be tense, and you may feel anxious or uncomfortable in each other's presence.It's possible there is a larger concern that you are not dealing with, or maybe you two have grown apart.

, Ask him or her about the things you have been noticing that suggest he or she doesn't like you.Be open and honest about your concerns. It may not solve all of them right away, but may help you if your friend doesn't like you, or is angry about something in particular.


Be prepared to be conciliatory, especially if you think your friend is angry at something you may have done. Showing you are open to compromise and reconciliation encourages your friend to do the same.When discussing your concerns, it is better to use ""I"" Statements. Don't start your complaints with ""You,"" (as in ""You are..."") which makes your opinion seem like a fact. Instead, lead with how you feel when your friend does something negative towards you (""I feel...""). After that, name your friend's behavior and why it makes you feel that way. This makes you statement less accusatory.
If you think you were in the wrong, but are not sure why, it might be good to give an open-ended question. You want to give them an opportunity to talk, not give a simple answer to a direct question. Ask what is wrong, or what you did wrong.Be sure to give your friend some space after apologizing or asking for a response. This can be a lot to process, and you shouldn't expect an answer right away.

, Life leads people in different directions, and those directions may not include you or your old friends. Your friend may have new interests, and new friends that share those interests more than you do., Learning a friend doesn't like you can create a number of negative emotions. While you don't want to suppress them too much, it is best to use them as an opportunity to think more about yourself. Try to figure out what you are feeling (anger, fear, humiliation), in order to figure out what you can do next.Ask yourself what you think your friend meant. People don't always know the impact of their words and actions. Bringing it to their attention can get an apology. Or, perhaps they did mean it as a personal insult, in which case you will want to think about how much you want to keep this friendship.

, You may have been (or became) a toxic friendship. These can be bad for your physical and mental wellbeing, and you should not be afraid to end it.Is this person a true friend? If you have been growing apart, especially for some time, then your friendship has probably been ready to end.


Signs of a toxic friendship include: asking for advice, then belittling or ignoring it; dumping their issues on you without offering support for your problems; regularly picking fights or competing with you, and never being happy with your success.
In a true friendship, you and your friend will be supportive of one another, stay in regular contact, and be able to discuss disagreements respectfully and with some amicable resolution. True friendships take effort, and both of you need to be willing to put in the effort., It does you no good to force someone to stay friends with you. That will likely only make things worse. It does not mean you failed, just that things have changed."
"
Take the gradual approach.,
Make excuses.,
Take the direct approach.,
Send a long email or letter.,
Avoid putting them down.,
Offer to try the friendship again later in life.,
Unfriend them on social media.",How to Handle a Fair Weather Friendship2," One way to end a friendship that is not mutually beneficial is to simply back off from your friend. If your friendship is already touchy—for example, your friend doesn’t expect much out of you just like you don’t expect much out of them—this approach may work better because the bond is already less strong than with close friends. With close friends, this approach can be painful because your friend doesn’t know why you’re backing off which can trigger feelings of rejection.Start by communicating less frequently via text, phone, and social media. Comment on their photos and statuses less often, don’t answer their texts, and dodge their phone calls more and more often.
Stop sharing as much personal information with this friend, such as family secrets. When you confide in someone, that strengthens a bond. When you don’t confide, this sends the message that you don’t trust them as much.
The downside of this approach is that you might never get a sense of closure, and your friend’s feelings of rejection can push them to cause drama like gossip and spreading rumors.

, When you have decided to end a friendship with someone because you don’t want to deal with their lack of responsibility anymore, one thing you can start doing immediately is backing off from the friendship by making excuses. Try to make these real things rather than white lies so that your friend is not further offended.


”I have other plans” is one excuse that you can make.
”I’m busy” is another way to make excuses for not spending time with your fair weather friend.

, The other way to end a friendship is to tell your friend what you feel and have decided without being vague about it. This direct approach is useful if you have already tried the gradual backing off approach and your friend isn’t getting the message. This is also useful if your friend has hurt you deeply and you need to get them out of your life fast.Face-to-face conversation is best for the direct approach. This way there is no risk of miscommunication, and you can clearly emphasize your intentions with your tone of voice and body language.
This clear communication also avoids gossip and backbiting because you are taking guessing out of the equation. You won’t avoid hurting their feelings no matter what approach you take, but at least this way you give them an opportunity to clearly communicate it.

, If you feel uncomfortable with a face-to-face meeting, you can try the direct approach in an email or written letter, especially if you and your friend often communicate through these channels (or if you know that your friend likes to read letters). This way you can articulate your feelings, think about what you want to say, and make sure that your intentions are clear.Don’t send a text, even if that is how you communicate most often with this friend. Texts are generally viewed as quick, casual chatting, and that is not the correct setting for a friendship-ending letter.

, Don’t add insult to injury by putting down your friend for their foibles and character flaws. Even though you are probably angry about their behavior, be kind and civil about your decision. They are already going to feel bad enough that you don’t want them around anymore.


Make “I” statements, such as, “I am in a new stage of life now,” rather than “you” statements like, “You have let me down one too many times.”
Tell your friend how you feel, not how they have made you feel. Explain that you are doing this because of you, not because of them., You might ask your friend if you can revisit the friendship again in a few months, after each of you has had time to think about if this friendship is the best thing for your lives. By then, your fair weather friend may have poured their energy into other people and not have room in their life for you anymore, letting you off the hook.


This approach doesn’t eliminate all feelings off hurt, but it may minimize them because you aren’t shutting down your friend completely, just temporarily.

, Another way to communicate that you are trying to move on without your friend is unfriending them on social media sites where you have a connection, such as Facebook and Instagram. Although this blunt disconnection will most likely hurt your friend, it does communicate that you want to end the friendship in real life.

Look for patterns.,
Be objective.,
Ask yourself serious questions.",How to Handle a Fair Weather Friendship3," It is important to distinguish fair weather friends from real friends before you decide who you need to “unfriend.” You want to look for patterns such as not being available when you need a shoulder to cry on and avoiding talking about negative things. You may also find that this friend is insulting, insensitive, and needy without giving in return.</ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-spot-and-end-a-toxic-friendship/</ref>


Think about what they do when you ask to process an event or emotion. Do they make excuses so that they don’t have to talk about it?
When you are with them, do they tend to keep the conversation about things that are meaningless or at least lack depth?

, When evaluating your friendships and deciding who needs to go, you need to remain objective. Don’t be tempted to give in to this friend and make excuses for them. You may need to ask others in your life that you know for certain are not fair weather people for their perspective. They may be able to identify patterns that you can’t see.

, You may need to get serious with yourself and ask questions to determine if someone close to you is a fair weather friend. Ask questions like, does this person make jokes at my expense? Do they take resources from me without paying me back? Do they use me?


Fair weather people tend to be untrustworthy, and lots of behavior goes with this: making a big deal out of small things, only thinking of themselves, sharing secrets and spreading rumors, and so on."

Choose a time and place to meet.,
Make sure that your friends are both calm.,
Encourage your friends to use “I” statements.,
Help de-escalate any conflict that arises.,
Ask your friends if anything is unclear.,
See if your friends are ready to forgive each other.,
Look for ways to prevent a similar problem.",How to Get Your Friends to Stop Fighting with Each Other2," When having any kind of serious discussion, it is best to do so in a semi-private place with few distractions. A neutral place is best. Don’t have one friend come to the other friend’s house. Look for a quiet spot outside or a have your friends meet you at a café.


Make sure that your intentions for having them meet you are clear. Try saying something like, “I have heard both sides of the story. I think that if the two of you sat down and shared your feelings, then you could put this fight behind you. I will go along and mediate if you need me to.”

, If your friends are still emotionally charged from the argument, then it might not be possible to resolve the conflict. Encourage both of your friends to arrive in a good state of mind.For example, you could encourage your friends to listen to their favorite “happy song” before arriving at the meeting, or ask each of them to take five minutes to breathe deeply and collect their thoughts.

, Using “I” statements can help when two people are fighting because it reduces the chances that your friends will become defensive. “You” statements make people feel defensive.For example, if one friend says “You make me feel bad about myself!” then the other friend might feel the need to defend herself from this statement. This can start a cycle of blaming and defending that will go nowhere.
Instead, your friend could say something like, “I feel bad when you criticize what I am wearing.” This statement places the emphasis on how the speaker feels while still pointing out the other person’s behavior.
Talk to your friends about why it is important to use “I” statements during their discussion and encourage them to do so. If you notice one of your friend using “You” statements, then gently correct him or her. Say something like, “How does that make you feel?”

, If your friends start fighting right in front of you, it is important to defuse the situation. Do not allow it to continue. For example, if your friends start raising their voices at each other, then call a time out or suggest that you take a 15 minute break to cool off.If your friends cannot sit down and discuss the problem without arguing, then you may need to ask an adult to help mediate the conflict. Try asking a teacher or parent if he or she would be willing to mediate.

, Encourage your friends to ask each other questions during this conversation as well. It might be possible that the fight was caused by misinformation or a misunderstanding, so asking questions can be helpful.


For example, if one friend thinks the other friend intentionally left her out of something, but the other friend thought she already had plans, then that information is crucial.
If you are aware of any misunderstandings, then you could gently encourage one friend to ask the other friend about it. Try saying something like, “Didn’t you want to ask Susie why she did not invite you to the movies last weekend?”

, After both friends have talked for a while and shared their feelings and perspectives, they may be willing to apologize and forgive each other. However, don’t try to force this. If your friends feel ready to forgive, then they will probably do so.


Try saying something like, “Do you both feel better now that you have talked?”
If your friends are still upset with each other and are not ready to forgive and move on, then let them go their separate ways. Depending on what has happened between them, they might just need some time apart.

, To help your friends get along better in the future, it might also be helpful to look for a solution that might prevent a similar problem and discuss ways that your friends can put it into practice.This can come in the form of a new rule in the friendship or a pledge to do or not do something.


For example, if one friend was upset because the other friend did not invite him to go to the movies over the weekend, then the other friend might agree to send him a text even if she thinks he is busy.

Try not to take a side.,
Set yourself some boundaries.,
Avoid offering advice.",How to Get Your Friends to Stop Fighting with Each Other3," If you have two friends who are fighting, you might find that both of them will try to convince you to be on their ‘side.’ In the majority of situations, your best bet is to remain neutral and not take sides. Instead, help both friends think through what they’re fighting about and provide support for a possible reconciliation.There are always exceptions to this ‘rule,’ but it’s up to you to decide when to make such an exception based on your own personal beliefs and moral judgement.

, Before you decide to support your friends during their fight, possibly as a mediator, set yourself some boundaries. For example, make sure your friends understand that you aren’t a postman and that you will not be the one to carry a message from one friend to the other. If you’re friends want to pass a message to each other, they have to do it themselvesAnother boundary might be to tell your friends you will not help them if they simply start to rant and spew nasty comments about each other. Your goal is to help them get to a resolution, not help them be nasty to each other.

, It may seem counter-intuitive, but you may want to avoid offering either friend specific advice. It’s not because you’re being unhelpful, it’s because they need to figure out a solution on their own. You should be there to support them, but you can’t provide a solution for them.Instead of offering advice, ask more questions. For example, if you realize one of your friends isn’t able to see a specific point-of-view of your other friend, ask questions that lead your friend to realize and understand that point-of-view.
Beware that if you do offer advice that doesn’t end up working, you could end up being blamed by one or both friends for the bad situation they’re in.
If you feel the need to offer some sort of advice, ask first. Don’t provide unsolicited advice. Your friend may already know what they’re going to do about the situation and may just be looking for a shoulder to lean on, not advice.

Help them set realistic goals.As a friend, you can motivate your friend after making a bad grade by suggesting that he or she set a goal to improve the grade.,
Encourage better organizational and time-management skills.,
Recommend that your friend start communicating with teachers.",How to Make Someone Feel Good About Bad Grades," Sometimes, when someone we care about feels crappy, the best thing we can offer is a listening ear. Give your loved one the opportunity to air his or her grievances about academic problems. Being able to express oneself in this way can be incredibly soothing. Plus, allowing your loved one to vent shows that you care.Demonstrate active listening by turning to face the person and making regular eye contact. Nod your head or make appropriate sounds to show you’re listening, such as “uh-huh.”
When the person is done talking, try to reflect back what he or she has said using emotion. For example, you might say “It sounds like you’re really angry about your performance on the test.” At this point, simply let the person talk. Refrain from trying to “fix” the problem just yet.;
, It might pertain to academics or it might merely be an anecdote about a different obstacle you have to overcome. Just make sure that the message is clear—if you keep trying, you can overcome personal struggles.


It may be scary at first to open up and tell someone about a difficulty you faced. However, it’s important to note that sharing your story may help your friend see that everyone encounters hardships and that it’s entirely possible to succeed despite setbacks.

, Although you can’t fix the situation, there may be something you can do to help the person through it. Are you good in the subject that he or she is struggling in? Perhaps you could casually offer some tips on how to improve. Do you have pretty good study skills? Maybe you can share some of those nuggets of wisdom with your friend.


Keep in mind that your friend may not want your help. Instead of thinking in advance of how you will help, simply ask “Is there anything I can do?” and see what the person’s response is. If he or she wants help from you, let them make a specific request. That way you don’t put your foot in your mouth by coming off like you’re superior.

, Give your loved one a much-needed self-esteem boost. It’s normal for someone’s self-esteem to take a hit after performing poorly in school. Take a moment to offer a sincere compliment on some other attribute. Remind the person what else he or she has going despite having a bad grade.


You can say something like “I know it sucks that you got an F in math. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about that in English. You’re the best student in that class!” Just make sure the compliment is true and the person knows you’re not just saying it to make them feel better., If your friend is upset over bad grades, the very best comfort you can offer is your presence. Just be there. Extend a shoulder for them, if they’d like. It’s not really your job to fix the situation or make it better in any way, really. It’s up to your friend to deal with poor grades, but he or she will certainly appreciate you showing support and acknowledging that it’s a sucky situation., If your friend or family member just got news about bad grades, you could help cheer him or her up by planning a spontaneous trip. If you are able to drive, select an interesting destination that you can visit and return from within a day. If you are not driving, be creative and come up with a cool place you can visit around your community.


The spontaneity of taking an unexpected trip can help get the person’s mind off poor academics temporarily. This can also be a great way to shake up a boring routine and have a little fun., As the old saying goes, “laughter is the best medicine.” Make your friend crack up and roll over with giggles, if only for a brief moment. Laughter is a terrific way to cheer a friend up after getting a bad report card. Plus, studies demonstrate that it soothes tension and is good for your overall health.Browse YouTube for hilarious videos of animals or babies. Or, turn on your TV and watch a comedy. The point is to help your friend lighten the load for a bit and take some of the stress away.

, Has your friend or family member been locked up in his or her room sulking over bad grades? A quick and cost-free way to lift his or her mood and provide a distraction is to simply go outside. Aim for somewhere green and natural rather than a cityscape, if possible. Research shows that walking in a natural environment reduces the amount of cortisol, or stress hormone, in the body., Help your friend move his or her body and generate some endorphins with an old-school dance party. Put together a playlist of your favorite songs and show up on his or her doorstep ready to shake your groove thing! Dancing can improve mood and boost self-esteem in addition to providing an excellent work out.Dancing can also offer a method of release. Your friend may be able to express anger, frustration, and disappointment more easily by channeling these emotions into body movements., Remind your friend that everyone faces adversity at some point and it is what you do after that really counts. Express the importance of having a positive attitude about academics and staying persistent. Be sure you emphasize the significance of effort above ability.Not everyone can be a straight-A student, but everyone can put in effort and do their very best.


You can also research some empowering motivational quotes to share with your friend for a push in a positive direction. For example, a famous proverb says “Just when the caterpillar thought the world was ending, he turned into a butterfly.”, Just because the person got a bad grade does not mean that they are not ""good"" at that or able to do it. A bad grade is just a measurement of the person's skill at that particular point, and a bad grade can be improved with extra studying and practice. It's just a temporary reflection of what they knew at that point.


For example, you could say, ""I know that you don't understand multiplying fractions right now, but I know that you'll work extra hard to get a better grade on the next test!""
Or, you can say something like, ""I know that you're not happy with this score, but it doesn't mean that you are 'dumb.' It just means that you didn't understand this concept.""

, Setting a goal can give your friend something to focus on and making strides to reach it can offer a needed confidence boost.


Keep in mind that this goal should be realistic and attainable, not a stab in the dark. For instance, if your friend made an F on his or her report card, it would be unreasonable to strive to get an A by the end of the next grading period. Maybe the person can set a goal to bring the F up to a C or a B, which is more feasible.

, In some cases, you may be dealing with an exceptionally bright student who merely has trouble getting assignments turned in on time, or forgetting to complete them in the first place. If this is the case, your friend may benefit from learning some time-management and organizational strategies to help him or her become a better student. Some easy-to-implement tips include:Using a planner to write down assignments
Assigning different colors to certain subject folders and notebooks to keep materials organized
Aiming to complete projects at least a day or two prior to the deadline
Keeping a consist daily and weekly schedule
Stocking your backpack with everything you need to be productive
Keeping your work area clutter-free and distraction-free
Working for a period of time and then scheduling a short break (e.g. 30 minutes of work = 5 minute break)
Creating a note-taking system
Developing a reward system to inspire project completion

, Sometimes, teachers have no idea whether or not a teaching method is successful. Encourage the student to go in and talk to their teacher about what he or she is not retaining well. Perhaps the teacher can offer additional assignments to ensure that the material is understood or even suggest online learning tools to practice at home.Your friend may also need to adopt the habit of speaking up in class and asking questions as the material is being taught. Practice at home with him or her raising his hand and asking a question to achieve a better understanding.
Recommend that they go over their old tests with their teacher to narrow down which areas they don't understand or which portions of problems they are getting stuck on. You could also suggest that they ask their teacher for extra tutoring.

Show off your pets.",How to Make a Friend Jealous1," The number one way to make your friend jealous is to make him or her feel completely irrelevant to you. The easiest way to do this is to act like you have so many amazing friends who are such cool, Interesting people that you don't really have time for your old friend anyway. Here are some ways to make your friend feel like you have so many amazing friendships that you can't really bother with him or her:


When you're with the friend, talk about how amazing one of your other friends is. Talk about the other friend's great sense of style, humor, or her ability to be an amazing friend. Don't be too obvious about it -- just try to sneak this point into a conversation.

When another friend comes up to you, act all excited to see him or her by saying ""Hi!"" and giving the friend a big hug and generally turning into a chatterbox around the friend. When your old friend approaches you, don't ignore her, but just say ""Hey"" and act like it's no big deal that she's there. She will notice the difference.

You should always talk about the latest cool thing you did with your other friends without inviting your old friend to come along.
;
, One easy way to make your friend jealous is to make her see how amazing your relationship is. If your friend is single and really wants to date someone, then you should talk about what a great boyfriend or girlfriend you have, talk about the latest romantic thing he or she did for you, and brag about all of the fun weekend plans you have with your special someone.


When your friend calls, you can sound all excited when she picks up the phone. Then you can say, ""Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were my boyfriend/girlfriend.""

If you friend asks you to hang out, say you'll be doing one fun thing or another with your significant other, even if it's not true.

If your boyfriend or girlfriend gives you an amazing gift, don't be afraid to flaunt it to make your friend jealous.


, Another way to make your friend jealous is to talk about all of the amazing plans you have coming up, whether it's a trip to the beach with a few of your girlfriends, or a weekend getaway with your beau. You can even talk about how you're counting down the days until you can do these things, or you can talk about how you're preparing to hang out with your friends or significant other. Just talk about how excited you are to do fun things with people other than your friend.


Act like it wouldn't even cross your mind to invite your friend along.

When you're done talking about your fun plans, your friend might try to counter with something equally cool that he or she is doing. If this happens, act like you're hardly paying attention.


, If you want your friend to feel like you have too many great relationships to really spend time with her, then you can use your phone to drive the point home. When you're alone together, spend half the time texting other friends and laughing at their responses, or just giving the phone a sly smile every few minutes. Make it clear that talking to your friend is your last priority.


When your friend tries to get your attention, just keep saying, ""Uh-uh,"" and make it clear that you're not really listening cause you care more about what your other friends, who aren't even there, have to say.

You can even answer the occasional phone call while your friend is right there.

Just remember that this behavior, while effective, will also be incredibly annoying.


, If you have the cutest kitten or dog in the world, chances are that your friend is already jealous. You can make your friend even more jealous by showing her photos of your pet, posting photos of your pet on Facebook, or talking about how you don't know what you would do without your beloved pet at your side. This will be particularly effective if your friend has always wanted a pet.


If your friend is trying to tell you something important, keep changing the subject to something silly about your lovely pets.

Notice if your friend only reaches out when in need of something.,
Assess whether your friend can be trusted.,
Assess whether your friend excludes you.,
Watch your friend's actions.,
Watch for guilt trips.,
Assess whether your friend is controlling.,
Trust your instincts.,
Prepare yourself.,
Find a quiet spot.,
Be alone with your friend.,
Speak calmly but assertively.,
Seek an apology.,
Consider breaking it off if you feel that it's all about being used and nothing to do with genuine friendship.",How to Know If Your Friends Are Using You," If your friend only wants to talk to you or spend time with you when in need of help or advice, or if it is always about your friend's needs, then it's possible you're being used. Does your ""friend"" ever call or text to hear about your day? Or does he or she only run to you when in need something? It could be a ride to the store, cigarettes, a bit of weed, a place to stay for the night, you're their fall guy when in need of a quick fix.
Take not of whether this is a continued pattern of behavior. After all, helping out friends is a part of friendship; sometimes people get down on their luck and need help. But, if this is occurring all of the time, or it is the only context where you interact, then it is possible you are being used.;
, A real friend does not betray your secrets, particularly in a way that could damage you. To assess whether your friend can be trusted, think back on whether your friend has leaked private information about you; especially if it is for personal gain. If so, it is possible that you are being used.Think about her relationship with her other friends. Does your friend betray the trust of his or her other friends or otherwise use them? If so, this is a sign that that your friend could be using you as well.

, Does your friend often exclude you from social events? A friend who is not using you would be inclusive and inviting, particularly among a group of friends that you both already know.Keep in mind that friends do not need to invite each other to every social event that they attend; but if your friend never invites you to anything, and only reaches out when in needs of something, your friend could be using you.
If your friend mentions having plans with a group of friends that you also know, but you have not been invited, try asking if you can come too. Pay attention to the response. If there are no real logistical reasons why you could not attend and your friend still does not invite you, or makes up some flaky excuse for why you cannot attend, it is possible you are being used and this friend is not genuine.
An example of a legitimate logistical concern would be if your friends were going camping but there was no more space in the car for you.

, Actions speak louder than words; if your friend is always saying that he or she will return a favor but never does, it's possible you're being used.Here's an example where your friend could be using you: You take your friend out to dinner a few times because he or she was upset about something. Your friend promises to return the favor but then never does and continues to complain about the problem you were helping your friend with. If this goes on and on, your friend may be using you.
Ask yourself whether your friend is grateful. Does your friend seem genuinely appreciative when you help him or her out? If so, maybe your friend is not using you but just really is in need of some friendly aid. If your friend doesn't seem to care much when you help, this could be a sign of taking advantage of you.

, If your friend often tries to manipulate you with tactics such as trying to guilt you into things that you don’t want to do, it's possible you're being used.Ask yourself whether you would have helped your friend if she or he did not try to make you feel guilty or feel bad about the situation. If the answer is yes, then maybe you are not being used but instead are being helpful., If your friend is always trying to boss you around and tell you what to do, particularly if it benefits her or her friends, he or she may be using you.To assess whether your friend is controlling, consider the following: Controlling people often have tempers and use them to get their way. They may use other emotions, too, such as guilt, or sadness to get you to do their bidding. Be sure to watch for signs of emotional manipulation as it is a clear sign that someone is being controlling. Your friend may try to isolate you so that you have less outside social support and are more likely to give in and do as demanded. Your friend may attempt to accomplish this by criticizing your other friends and family in an attempt to get you to spend less time with them. , If it feels that your friend is being insincere, especially if this is a repeated pattern, you are probably right. To be sure, confront your friend. Ask whether he or she really means the things being said.Assess your friend's character. Be completely honest with yourself and ask whether your friend is deep down a good person who cares about you or whether it seems that he or she is motivated by selfish goals.
Character traits include things like your friend's level of honesty, integrity, sincerity, and trustworthiness. Think back on everything you know about your friend and his or her interactions both with you and with others. Think about how your friend behaves in relation to the aforementioned traits but also about the type of things that he or she says that relate to those traits, also.For example, if your friend talks about how he or she tells people to their faces one thing then does another, there is a chance your friend is doing the same thing to you, and it is possible that you are being used.

, If you friend means something to you, you should be sure that he or she is using you before you decide to cut all ties. You can do this by confronting your friend in a calm, rational way.Keep in mind that if deep down he or she is a good friend, he or she was not using you but was merely oblivious and will likely be willing to change. If your friend is using you and gets upset and you lose him or her as a friend as a result of the confrontation, that is probably for the best anyway., When you confront your friend, be sure to do it in a quiet spot so that he or she doesn't get agitated. Make sure you are in a place that you can both speak your minds freely without feeling overly self-conscious. Avoid places like crowded restaurants with tables close together.


Try bringing up the conversation with your friend on a walk in a nice park.

, Do not bring other friends into the mix, even if they have the same complaint. Having other friends there could be overwhelming and could scare your friend off or make him or her especially upset.


If one person criticizes you for something, you may be willing to take the advice and change. If several people criticize you at the same time, you may feel threatened and get offended; after all, it means that all those people had sat around and talked negatively about you, which could be frustrating., Explain your reasons for suspecting that your friend is using you and see what he or she says. Lay out specific details so that your friend cannot just shrug it off, call you accusatory, or a liar.However, do not be too nit-picky in your examples; your friend could turn the tables on you and call you petty.
Make sure you speak about your friend's actions and not his or her character. If you make it about specific actions, your friend will be less likely to get upset; if you call your friend a user, he or she may get upset and the conversation will quickly dissolve.
For example, you could say something like, ""I gave you rides when your car was being repaired last month. However, when my car broke down this week and I asked you for a ride to work, you ignored my request. I've realized that when I ask you for help you tend ignore me.""

, If your friend apologizes and is willing to change his or her behavior and you actually notice that he or she is changing for the better, there is a chance that your friend was not using you but was just oblivious to what turned out to be selfish actions. Sometimes people get caught up in their own lives and worlds and are not aware that their actions came across as selfish., Explain why you can't be friends with this person anymore and stop talking to him or her. Do not let your former friend convince you that they will change, especially if you've given them multiple chances already. This person will keep taking advantage of you if you let him or her back in."

These types of compliments can indicate jealousy.For example, a friend may find a way to make it sound like they're complimenting you, but work in an insult. Say you get a new job. A backhanded compliment may be something along the lines of, ""That's great. They don't usually hire people with so little experience, but good for you."";
, A jealous friend likely feels bad about themselves. Therefore, they are eager to downgrade the achievements of those around them. If you experience good news, your friend may look for something negative to say or a way to make you seem undeserving.For example, say you get an ""A"" on a paper. A jealous friend may say something like, ""Don't get ahead of yourself. We still have half the semester to go, so I wouldn't get too confident yet.""
Along with diminishing your achievement, some jealous friends may even go one step further and make comments that upstage any achievements you have. These friends may make comments that put emphasis that they somehow have gotten something bigger and better than your own achievement. For example, “I remember that tough calculus class I took. It was much harder than this class and I got “A’s” on all of my assignments and tests. I had the highest G.P.A in class.”

, Secure friends celebrate one another's achievements. While other friends may give an enthusiastic congratulations if something goes well for you, a jealous friend will react differently. They may say something curt like, ""Ok. Cool."" It will not sound like a sincere or excited congratulations., A jealous friend may start to pull away from you.

You may notice a jealous friend slowly pulling away.A friend you once saw often may claim to be ""really busy"" and constantly make excuses not to see you.
You may notice your friend makes time for other people in your social circle, but rarely has time for you anymore.

, A jealous friend will get tired of hearing about your success. You may notice your friend seems disengaged when you talk about things like your job, school, or a new relationship. They may look away, play on their phone, and not make comments or ask questions about your life., Jealous people tend to have a negative outlook overall. They may feel other people succeed easily while they struggle for everything. If your friend is jealous, you may notice general pessimism during regular interactions.A pessimistic friend will be generally dismissive of your new endeavors. If you want to, say, teach yourself a new skill, a jealous friend will list reasons why you should not, for example.
A jealous friend will be pessimistic about themselves too. If you try to suggest the solution for a jealous friend's problems, they will be quick to find reasons why this will not work.

, Jealousy can often manifest in imitation. If your friend is jealous of you, they may want to copy some of what you're doing to try to have a similar life to yours. You may notice your friend dressing like you, imitating your tastes and mannerisms, and talking and joking about the same subjects you do.You may also find your friend tries to upstage you while imitating you. If you start running for 20 minutes a day, for example, a jealous friend may start running 30 minutes a day.

, Your jealous friend may make frequent claims to you about how things or situations they feel are unfair. For example, they might say something like, “It is just so unfair that things come so easy for you. You get all the good paying jobs and I am stuck in this dead-end one.” Pay attention to these frequent references to unfairness, as many times they are blaming outside circumstances for why they cannot have or achieve what you have.

, Jealous people are often attention seekers by nature. Pay attention to how your friend acts around others. A jealous friend will always try to be the center of attention.A jealous friend may do things like show off on social media. They may post overly happy or positive things about their own life. You may also notice them friending your friends as they're eager to gain social approval from those close to you.
A jealous friend may seek attention in a group. They may try to make the loudest jokes or tell the funniest stories. A jealous person is likely to jump in and try to top someone's anecdote with something more outlandish.

, A jealous friend may begin excluding you. You may notice your friend is hanging out with others and not you. You may suddenly stop receiving invitations. You may also notice your friend is blowing you off. They may claim to be busy with homework one night, only to have you find out they went out with someone else., Think about why your friend may be feeling jealous and about where your friend is emotionally. If they're in a bad place, they may be more prone to jealousy. Without realizing it, you may be talking too much about yourself and your own achievements and accidentally encouraging some of the jealousy. In that case, you can try to make small changes to how you talk to your friend. The main idea, though, is to understand where they're coming from so you can talk to them about the issue effectively.Maybe your friend is going through a rough time. Have they had any recent setbacks? Difficulty at work or in romantic relationships can make someone more prone to jealousy.
Reflect on how you could be contributing to their jealousy. While your friend may be happy things are going well for you, if they're in a rough spot they may find it harder to be openly encouraging. You may be bringing up yourself and your own achievements a little too much.

, Do your best and try to come from a place of compassion and understanding. Chances are that your friend may be harboring many insecurities about herself that are expressed through jealous behavior. There could be a lack of self-esteem, low self-confidence, and maybe an undertone of sadness. Maybe she never had the same opportunities in life that you or others had.


Usually, people who are more comfortable with themselves have good self-esteem and do not exhibit jealous behavioral patterns. However, for people who are hiding insecurities, they are more likely to show jealous behaviors.

, After putting yourself in your friend's shoes, talk it out. Wait until a time when you're both free and let your friend know you want to talk. Say something like, ""I feel like you've been acting really jealous lately. I want to work through that because I value your friendship.""Go into the situation with an open mind. While you may feel your friend is being unreasonably jealous, they may have complaints on their own end. Maybe, without realizing it, you've been insensitive to their situation.
After sharing your feelings, give your friend time to express themselves.

, If you want to preserve your relationship, you should figure out a mutual solution. Tell your friend how they need to change and agree to change as well if you're contributing to the situation.For example, you could agree to ask first before sharing good news. At certain times, you friend may not want to hear about your successes.
Your friend can agree to let you know when they're feeling jealous so you do not go overboard talking about your own successes.

, If your friend continues to behave in a jealous fashion, it's okay to give the relationship a break. You can gradually taper off contact or confront the friend directly. Say something like, ""I think, given your jealousy, we could both use some space in this relationship right now. I hope you understand."" It hurts to lose a friend, but jealousy can be toxic. It's okay to distance yourself from it when necessary.

At the end of the day, what we all want the most is to be happy with our lives, and if your friend thinks that this comes so easily to you, he or she will get even more jealous.


Even if you have a small setback, just say, ""I know I'll do great next time."" Be relentlessly optimistic.
Talk about your favorite parts of school, sports, or any activities you're involved in, so your friend thinks you love every aspect of your life.
Talk about how excited you are for the future and talk about all of the things you want to do, whether it's to go to a great college, land an amazing job, or go kayaking in Hawaii. Your friend will be jealous that you have so much to look forward to.

, Though you may be feeling weak or insecure, you can't let your friend see that side of you. You have to remain confident, keep your head up high, and act like you have life under control. If you need serious life advice, ask someone else for it. You don't want to do or say anything that would make your friend think, ""So it looks like he/she isn't so perfect after all...""


Even if you're not feeling confident, having the right body language helps. Stand tall with your arms at your sides, your shoulders high, and take determined steps while looking ahead instead of at the ground.
If your friend reveals a weakness, you can try to help her out, but never try to comfort her by relating to her problems. You don't have problems, remember?

, Never look awkward or uncomfortable in a new social situation. Your friend should see that your attitude is to tackle any new social situation as an adventure, and that you're excited at the prospect of meeting new people, and therefore having new friends, that are even better than your current friend. Make it look like it's no big deal to make new friends, even if you're nervous on the inside.

If you're constantly talking about how amazing your life is, your friend will see that you're just trying to impress her. Instead, act like you're fine on your own, that everything is great, and that you don't really care what anyone, including your friend, thinks of you.


Sometimes, just letting your friend notice how lucky you are and how great your life is instead of pointing it out can be more effective.
Don't say, ""Isn't that awesome?"" or ""Isn't that great?"" after you talk about something in your life. Let your friend see that it is great.

, Your friend should think that you don't have any anxiety or nervousness when it comes to the opposite sex, and that you have a chill attitude that makes other people gravitate toward you. Don't talk about how nervous you are about meeting boys or how you never know what to say. Instead, talk about how cool it is to meet new guys or girls, or even act disinterested, like you couldn't possibly care about all of the attention you're getting.


And if your friend starts getting attention from the opposite sex? Act like you couldn't possibly care less.

Take hours to respond to her texts, don't pick up the phone half the time when she calls, and just always act like you're excited about something on the horizon. When you do hang out with your friend, make sure you never stay that long, because you of course have something more important to do afterwards.

Make sure your friend sees your things, and let it be known that she can borrow them, if she wants; this will show that you have superior stuff. You don't have to shove your cool stuff in your friend's face. Just letting her see you using it is enough.


Always be a step ahead of her. If she has a Blackberry, you get an iPhone; if she has Maybelline makeup, you get MAC or Chanel; if she has an Mp3 player, you get an iPod touch.

, So it obviously does take effort to look hot, but you should make it look like it comes completely naturally to you. Don't ever let your friend see you stressing out over what clothes to wear, what makeup to put on, or about how to wear your hair. You should figure all of that out before you see your friend, so what she sees is the final product, not the thought that you put into it.

If you get really good grades, you shouldn't talk about what an amazing student you are all the time. Let your friend hear it from someone else.
If you really want to be annoying, you can talk about how you really wanted an A in a class when all you got was an A-.
In general, don't ever mention the word ""studying."" It just isn't necessary for you, right?

, Who isn't jealous of an amazing vacation? If you're lucky enough to go on vacations regularly, make sure you mention them. You can do it casually, just by saying, ""I have soooo much packing to do before I go to Hawaii with my family next week."" Make it sound like it's no big deal, just a run-of-the-mill activity for you. If you know your friend doesn't go on a lot of trips, you can casually ask her what she'll be up to next summer, even if you know it'll be nothing.


You can post a few photos from your trip on Facebook, but minimize the enthusiastic captions. Let the images speak for themselves.
If you go on a fun trip with your friends, make sure you talk about how much fun it was, even if your friend wasn't invited.

, Social Media is the perfect place to inspire envy. You should aim to spend no more than 15-30 minutes a day on Social Media so it looks like you have a life and can't really be bothered with it, but when you do go on, make it count. Post pictures of yourself looking hot and see how many likes you get. Post pictures of you and your other friends and significant other having an amazing time.

Ask yourself some questions.,
Figure out if you experience jealousy.,
Figure out if you find yourself thinking about the person at random times during the day.,
Figure out if you somehow feel less complete when the subject isn't in your life.,
Ask your best friend if they think you like them.",How to Know if You Like Your Friend Romantically1," First of all, trying figuring out if what you feel for your friend is romantic or more of an intense friendship. As unsatisfying as it may sound, you may not be able to separate the two.



Why do you like this person so much? Is it because you can picture yourself together, as a romantic couple, or because you get along with him/her really well? Is it anything in between?

Do you genuinely think it could go anywhere? Do you think you two would be compatible romantically, or would the spark fizzle as soon as the expectation of love is there?

Will it ruin your friendship? This one is a little harder to figure out, because if the relationship lasts, you technically won't need to worry about the friendship being ruined. Either way, could you see the other person staying in touch if you did have a relationship and it ended?
The goal of these questions is to try to get you to think about the other person in a semi-romantic way. Once you do this, you should begin to experience emotions. What are these emotions like? Excitement, anticipation, butterflies, longing? Or indifference, nervousness, dread? Often, your emotions will tell you more about what you think than your thoughts will.;
, When it comes to the other person, do you often find yourself jealous when you know you really shouldn't be? This is a sure sign that the emotions you feel for your friend is a little more than just friendship.


Does the sight of him/her with another girl/guy drive you insane? Do you get a sinking feeling in your stomach when you see him/her with another person, and automatically suspect that they're dating? Chances are you like them romantically.
Do you get jealous when he/she spends a lot of time with his/her friends, and less time with you? Do you find yourself resenting their friends because it means you get to spend less time with them? Chances are you like them romantically.

, A sure sign that you're infatuated is if you're thinking of them often. Does every little thing remind you of him/her? Do your friends get annoyed because you constantly talk about and/or reference the person in their company? Do you constantly wonder what they're doing at that moment?

, Is your goal, at the end of each weekend, to have spent the most time with him/her? Is he/she the first person you call when you get back from a long vacation? Is it somehow weird when you two don't sit together at lunch?

, Often, another person will notice what's right beneath your eyes. Ask your friend if she/he thinks you like anyone, and see what their response is. You may be surprised.

Play computer or video games.,
Experiment in the kitchen and learn to cook.,
Do something artistic.,
Treat yourself to a movie.",How to Have Fun Without Friends1," Search for free games online if you don't feel like spending money. Otherwise, try out a multi-player online game to make friends while you're gaming.

, Cooking can be really fun, especially when you've got a playlist of your favorite tunes going and a spread of delicious, fresh ingredients. Search online or watch a cooking show for a recipe that inspires you, then make a shopping list and get to work. There's no pressure for it to turn out amazing--after all, you're not feeding a dinner party or a celebrity chef judge. The best part is that you get to eat the results when you're done!Baking and cooking will probably require you to use knives and the oven or stove. Make sure your parents are okay with you using these things, or ask them to help you prepare your dish.

, Take up painting, photography, writing poetry, pottery, scrapbooking--anything that gets your creative juices going. You don't have to worry about anyone judging your skills, so you can have total freedom of expression.


Enter your artwork in a contest. You could win money, meet other artists, and surprise your peers with your skills.

, Though people often go to movies in groups, it's not really a very social activity--there's no reason to talk or interact with anyone while you're glued to the screen. You'll quickly forget you're by yourself and will probably enjoy yourself just as much as you would if you went with a group.


Try cinemarathoning--buy a ticket for a matinee and then sneak into a second, even a third movie. Just make sure you don't get caught!

Try parkour.,
Go for a hike.,
Try a fitness class that might be embarrassing.,
Pamper yourself with a spa day.",How to Have Fun Without Friends3," Parkour is a fun way to make the world your obstacle course--try to find the quickest route from Point A to Point B.This might require you to jump, climb, and tumble, and it will improve your balance and teach you to make quick decisions.Start out slowly so you don't injure yourself and learn some of the basic moves before striking out.


Start out in your backyard or another forgiving, grassy environment.

, Going outdoors strengthens your immune system, promotes an active lifestyle, and encourages a positive, proactive attitude.Spending time in nature can make you feel peaceful and put things into perspective. A long walk along a gorgeous mountain path will remind you of the beauty of the world and help you realize that being on your own is okay.


Make sure you let someone know where you're going and what time you'll be back. That way, if you get injured on your hike, your parents will know where to look.

, Dance classes, Zumba, step class--these workouts are insanely fun, but can also be a little embarrassing while you try to work out the steps and follow the instructor. If you're surrounded by a bunch of strangers all trying to do the same thing, you won't feel so conscious and can just focus on having fun and dancing your heart out.


Yoga is another great, solitary workout. You can really focus on your movements. Plus, if you go to a class, chances are almost everyone there is alone, too.If you don't belong to a gym, just look up some videos for kickboxing, Zumba, or other fun workouts you can do in your living room., Give yourself a face mask, paint your nails and toenails, and sip on some chilled cucumber water. Try out some new makeup tutorials and finally figure out how to do a perfect cat eye. Just allow yourself to luxuriate and relax and feel like royalty for a while.Ask your mom if she wants to splurge with you--maybe she'll treat you both to a massage or a mani-pedi.

Shed your self-consciousness.,
Volunteer and meet people while putting your time to good use.,
Sign up for a meet-up or club for people with similar interests.,
Take a trip and explore somewhere new.",How to Have Fun Without Friends4," Most people are afraid to go out and do things on their own because they think other people will judge them, or they think they won't have as much fun as they would with a group. But actually, neither one of these things are true. We tend to overestimate other people's interest in what we're doing (few people will care or think about why you're alone), and we underestimate how much we will enjoy an activity if we do it alone.Don't let flying solo hold you back from going out and experiencing things. Chances are you will be way happier going out and doing something than staying at home instead.If you can't help but worry about what other people will think if they see you out alone, remind yourself that it takes some guts to do what you're about to do. If people see you out there enjoying yourself, shoulders back, not hiding that you're alone, you're going to appear more confident than anything else.
If you run into people from school and you're afraid what they'll think, don't hide from them or act embarrassed. Just act like it's not a big deal--yep, you went to see a movie alone. They probably wouldn't be brave enough to do what you're doing, so feel good about your solo adventure.

, Get involved with a cause you are passionate about and put your skills to good use. If you're good with your hands, look into Habitat for Humanity. If you're amazing with animals, spend some time at a local shelter, walking dogs and playing with kittens. If you're an environmentalist, look for opportunities to join a beach or forest clean up day. You'll be having fun, saving the world, and meeting cool people all at the same time..


Other possibilities include volunteering at a soup kitchen, visiting children and elderly people in the hospital, spending time with kids at the Boys and Girl's club, and tutoring.
Contact your church or a local political organization to see if they have any volunteer opportunities.

, Right away you know you have something in common with everyone there. Search online for free meet ups in your area--sci-fi lovers, hiking groups, photographers, foodies--and go to one of their events. You'll get to do the things you love and maybe make some friends in the process.


If you're a student, see what clubs your school has to offer.
There may even be a group for people who just don't feel like doing something on their own--like a movie in the park or visiting a theme park--and you can all go in a big group.

, Make a playlist of your favorite songs, pick a nearby town, park, or attraction that looks weird or interesting (world's largest hamster wheel, maybe?), and hit the road. You can sing along as loud as you want, stop wherever you feel like it--you don't have to worry about anyone else's agenda (or bladder getting full). The trip can be all your own.For some people, a long drive is a good way to clear your head and relieve stress. It gives you time to think and recharge but gets you out of the house at the same time.If you can't drive or aren't old enough to take off for another town on your own, see if you mom, dad, sibling, or an older cousin want to take an adventure with you.

Identify the emotions behind your jealousy.,
Pay attention to how jealousy affects your life.,
Evaluate how well-founded your fears are.,
Consider taking a self-test.,
Develop your self-confidence and self-esteem.,
Reframe self-critical thoughts when they surface.",How to Keep Jealousy from Ruining a Relationship1," Jealousy usually stems from other emotions. Often, it comes from feelings of insecurity. You feel like you're not enough for your partner, so you get jealous when your partner has an interaction with someone else. Whether or not that's the case for you, you still need to identify the emotions behind your jealousy.The next time you feel jealousy rising up in your chest, take a moment to think about what's underneath the dominant emotion. Are you angry that your partner is spending time with someone else? Are you feeling insecure? Are you unsure of your partner's feelings towards you?
If you don't have much time in the moment, reflect on your feelings later. Try to spend some time writing about it so you can understand what you're feeling.
Jealousy might also simply mean you have a keen sense of intuition. Being jealous is not always an overreaction; if your feelings are justified, you may be feeling jealous because you recognize that your partner is unfaithful or treating you poorly.;
, Jealousy becomes a problem when it's significantly affecting your life or your relationship, such as if you are constantly trying to check your partner’s phone instead of enjoying your time together, or if you feel compelled to show up at their home or place of work unannounced to check on them. It's also a problem if you feel like you can't escape it. That is, you can't let go of your jealousy even if you want to do so.Feeling jealous all the time can actually affect your health, including causing insomnia and depression. In some ways, it's similar to having chronic anxiety.

, Feeling jealousy can make you lose your head a bit. It's important to step back and think about whether your fears are founded or not. If you're in a well-established relationship, it's likely that your partner isn't trying to dismiss you or leave you behind. Think about each situation and decide if you really are justified in feeling angry or upset.For example, if your partner flirts a bit with a barista at the coffee shop but you've been together for five years and they've never been unfaithful, it may be you're blowing it out of proportion.
However, if your partner continually bails on you, often ignores you when you're talking, and flirts constantly with other people, your feelings are probably justified.

, If you're wondering how jealous you actually are and whether it's a problem, think about taking a self-assessment test on one of the major psychology websites. It will give you an idea of how much jealousy is affecting your life.For instance, you can take a test on a site like Psychology Today, which will give you short scenarios and have you pick how you would respond to that situation.

, Feeling jealous of other people may also stem from low self-confidence or low self-esteem.Try to work on building up your self-confidence and self-esteem. This will take some time and persistence.

Try making a list of all of your achievements and assets.Your achievements can be large or small things, such as graduating from college or getting a good grade on an important test. Your assets may be things like, your loyalty, honesty, intelligence, creativity, or any other qualities that make you who you are.
Give yourself a compliment every day as well. Try looking at yourself in the mirror and saying one nice thing about yourself every day, such as, “You look beautiful this morning!” or “You are smart and capable!”

, If you tend to criticize yourself or to compare yourself to others, then this may also be part of why you feel jealousy.You may be taking these thoughts and running with them. Work on noticing and challenging these thoughts when they surface.

For example, a self-critical thought might be something like, “She is so much more stylish than me. I never look that good!”
To check the validity of this thought, you might ask yourself questions like, “Is that totally accurate? What evidence do I have for that?”
Then, you might reframe the thought as something like, “She is a stylish dresser, but I have my own unique style. It is part of what makes me who I am and it is fabulous!”

Find out from your child which friend is bossing him or her around.,
Role play with your child.,
Discuss different options and approaches your child can take with this friend.,
Help your child write down the words he or she wants to say to the bossy friend.,
Have your child rehearse which approach and words he or she will use when standing up for his or her preferences.,
Pick a time for the confrontation.,
Tell your child to be prepared for different reactions from the bossy friend.",How to Help Your Child Stand Up to Bossy Friends," You will want to know exactly what this friend is doing or saying to your child. Make sure that the other child is not just being helpful, and your child is misinterpreting the behavior as bossiness. However, given that children are fairly tolerant to a point, the chances are that your child is correct and he or she is actually being bossed around.;
, Have your child act the part of the bossy friend. In turn, take on the role yourself of acting the part of a child who stands up to the bossiness. Model through role-playing how you generally want your child to react to the bossy friend.


For example: Suggest that the situation is one where the friend wants to go the beach but your child wants to stay and study. You could tell your child to act the part of the friend wanting to go to the beach during study time, while you play the role of the child resisting this offer. It might go something like this:

""Let's go to the beach. Studying is so boring.""
""I'd love to go to the beach but not now/today. I have to complete my homework assignment tonight. If I don't get it finished, I will be under pressure from the teacher and likely I'll get a bad mark. I don't want a bad mark. Maybe we can go to the beach tomorrow instead.""
""You're stupid. The sun is out now, it will rain tomorrow. Why don't you do the homework when it rains?""
""I don't like it when you suggest I am stupid. That makes me feel unhappy. I am going to do my homework now so that I don't feel pressured tomorrow. If it rains tomorrow, we can go to the beach on a day that it's not raining. And hey, I can help you finish your homework too if you like."" And so on...



, Either after or during the role play, stop and discuss what approaches are likely to work best. Does your child want to be very assertive or will your child feel more comfortably taking a softer approach? Through asking questions and seeing your child's reaction to the role play, you will likely quickly find out which approach would work best for this particular friend.


Some people do not take others seriously unless they are being told something forcefully. Other people respond to a softer approach with listening and understanding, but a firm and no-nonsense behavior will sure work better. As you role play, your child will probably alert you to the other child's personality, by saying things like ""But Shannon doesn't act like that"" or ""No, no, John would be yelling at me by now.""






Keep in mind the individual traits of the bossy friend. Help your child to formulate this knowledge in their own word choice and voice tone when confronting the bossy friend.







, This can be a short speech which is memorized or just some key points. This way, your child will know the exact words he or she will say to the bossy friend. Your child may feel nervous when he or she confront the bossy friend, so knowing in advance what to say (or the general idea) is helpful.

, Again, the role-playing is very helpful in clarifying the best responses, as well as giving your child the opportunity to rehearse.


Once the exact approach (softly-softly or boldly-boldly) has been chosen and exact words have been written or memorized, you can model for your child how to put the two together. Then, have your child practice exactly what he or she will do and say to the bossy friend. Your child should practice until he or she feels completely comfortable.







, Your child needs to decide if he or she will wait until the friend starts bossing, or if he or she wants to confront the friend up front, unprovoked. Should it be before or after school? Perhaps this bossy friend will be in a better mood to listen after lunch, although this assumption is taking too much for granted.The timing is an individual decision your child needs to make, along with feeling it's okay to be flexible about it if the first chosen time doesn't feel right.

, While your child knows his or her friend best, your child may not know how the friend will respond. Even though your child has picked the best words and approach, the bossy friend may get angry or become even bossier. The bossy friend may also apologize and your child should be ready to accept the apology and move forward with the friendship. So, after the inescapable ""confrontation"", your child will have to take a stand and accordingly so will you, as a parent.

Give practical support.,
Understand why the person has self-harmed.,
Don't judge.,
Ask them questions.,
Offer them help.The most important part is to offer your friend help.,
Listen to them.,
Show them your support.,
Tell an adult or other person of responsibility.",How to Help a Suicidal/Self Harming Friend," Your friend is doing something to themselves that has the potential to seriously injure them. Keep an eye on their physical well being. Watch for anaemia (some symptoms include tiredness, weakness, pale skin tone, possible shortness of breath) caused by blood loss. If they self-harm in public restrooms, be prepared to take action if they have been in the rest room for an extended period of time (be ready to enter the restroom, it might be a good idea to discreetly carry a small bandage and sterile dressing about your person, when with your friend). Help your friend deflect unwanted attention about any cuts, bruises or blood stains from curious, well-meaning teachers, associates or other people.;
, It is difficult to understand why a friend has self-harmed, since the reasons differ in every person (but are typical around low self esteem). A continual self-harmer, may also self-harm for different reasons. The first step is to have an honest conversation with them. It is crucial to make them feel comfortable, so don't push them into a conversation; let them understand that you're there for them. If they feel ready, the conversation will start itself.

, It's very easy to be very quick to judge people whenever we get the opportunity. Don't make that mistake. Your friend needs support and a shoulder to cry on, not judgement. You may feel tempted to give your opinion, but hold yourself back from criticizing your friend's actions. Look at ways to address the causes, not the symptoms.

, Once the conversation is opened, you will have to find out what made that person harm himself/herself that way. Ask questions, but don't overdo it. Your friend may think that you're trying to judge him/her.

, You may like to offer to go with them to a therapist or to help them talk to a doctor, parent or counsellor. Whatever you decide, let your friend know you're not forcing them to do anything, you're just offering help. If your friend refuses, understand that they might feel embarrassed to open up with someone unknown to them. The fact that you're listening to them is a help itself. They may very well be relieved just to share the fact they are self-harming with someone who cares about them.

, Without interruption. While your friend is talking to you, don't interrupt him/her. They may need to express themselves and not ask for a solution. It is a good idea to listen to them carefully and be particularly caring and understanding towards them. Also, do not ask to see their scars. Self-harming is a very personal topic, and your friend may feel embarrassed.

, Tell them that you are there for them if they need help another time. Your friend will almost certainly thank you for that. If your friend decides to get help, support them in every way possible. It's nice to know that someone cares, but don't overdo it and don't speak about his/her problem with others. It will only make matters worse and you will lose your friend's trust.

, If the problem gets worse, share the responsibility and tell someone in authority. Self-harm can occur in adults, in the work place. You don't have to be responsible for your friend at work if you can trust your boss to deal sympathetically with the situation, tell them what is going on. Your friend may get furious at you and may not talk to you anymore, because they feel you betrayed them. However, they will hopefully eventually understand your good intentions in the future.

Know what ""transgender"" means.,
Understand the definition of non-binary.,
Learn how to use pronouns.,
Know the difference between gender identity and presentation.,
Understand what ""transition"" entails.",How to Understand the Basics of Transgender Terminology," Someone who is transgender was assigned a sex at birth (male or female) that doesn't match their actual gender. This can be female or male as well as outside of the gender binary. Cisgender people are people whose assigned sex and gender identity match. Most people are cisgender.


Avoid terms such as ""biological sex"" or ""born a _____"". They trivialize identities as well as reduce transgender people to their genitals.
""Transgender"" is an adjective, not a noun or a verb. Don't call someone ""transgendered"" or ""a transgender"".
""Trans"" is short for transgender, and is also an adjective.;
, Someone who is non-binary does not identify within the gender binary of male or female. They may or may not consider themselves transgender, but non-binary is under the umbrella term ""transgender"".


Some of these identities include:

Agender, lack of a gender
Neutrois, a neutral gender
Genderfluid, switching between different genders
Bigender or androgyne, generally used to describe someone who is both female and male
Culture-specific genders, such as two-spirit Native American or First Nations people or Indian Hijras. These are labels to be used only by people of color whose cultures include such a gender.



, Usually (but not always), transgender people use different pronouns than the one of their assigned sex. Make sure to ask for them whenever possible! Most people only use one set of pronouns, but some genderfluid people switch pronouns. If this is the case, talk with them about how you'll know which one to use.


Traditionally, the two pronoun sets are ""he/him/his/himself"" and ""she/her/hers/herself"". While often used for binary cisgender and transgender people, many non-binary people do use these pronouns.
Other pronouns include ""xe (or ze)/hir/hirs/hirself"", ""they/them/theirs/themselves"", ""ey/em/eirs/eirself"", or ""ne/nem/nirs/nemself"".

While there is no ""official"", completely grammatically correct neutral singular pronoun as of 2015, it's still considered respectful to use the pronoun that a person says to use for them.



, Gender presentation is how a person expressed their gender to the world.


For example, if someone was wearing makeup, a dress, and high heels, that would be considered a traditionally feminine gender presentation.
Never assume someone's gender from their presentation. Both transgender and cisgender people can express their genders differently from their traditional gender roles. The term for this is ""gender non-conforming"".

, Transition is the process by which transgender people alter their bodies to match what they perceive their gender to be in order to ease gender dysphoria. It can involve hormone therapy (estrogen or testosterone with a hormone blocker for the one produced naturally), changing their legal name, pronouns, or presentation; or having surgery.


One doesn't transition from male to female or vice versa. That kind of terminology is considered outdated and implies that all transgender people transition. It also relies on the flawed idea of genitals being what makes someone a certain gender.
Try to avoid using terms such as ""sex change"". The preferred name is ""gender (or sex) reassignment surgery"", or GRS/SRS. There are special items that some transgender people use to change their presentation temporarily, such as chest binders, breast forms, or packers. These help minimize visible characteristics of their assigned gender.

Find a few high-quality websites, books, or other sources of information about your illness and share them with the people in your life.Consider talking with loved ones individually, in small groups, and on social media. Start by speaking with friends and family in person before you move on to less formal forms of communication.
You might sit down together and do a basic Google search about your condition. Communicate the symptoms you experience, explain what treatments you are undergoing, and the prognosis of your condition.
Encourage questions. You might say, ""Terry, we've been friends for a long time, and I don't want things to be awkward because of my diagnosis. Is there anything you want to ask me about the disease?"";
, Getting more information about your condition can give both you and your friends a peace of mind. Suggest that they accompany you to doctor's visits and specialist appointments to learn more about your illness and how they can help.Your loved ones may also be able to help by catching information that you might miss due to nervousness or being distracted.In addition to speaking with medical professionals, you and your friends can also participate in support groups for people with your condition. Speaking with others who have your illness can help you know what to expect and also get advice about how others can support you.

, Your friends may want to support you, but not know how. If you wish that someone would give you a hand with something, ask. You’ll get the help you need, and your friends will feel better about knowing exactly what to do for you.Consider asking a friend to pick up groceries for you, help you with chores around the house, take your kids to the park so you can rest, or just sit and talk with you for a while. Make a list of the things you are struggling to get done. If someone asks what they can do to help, give them one of the tasks.

, When managing your friendships, you can't sit around and feel sorry for yourself when friends aren't calling you back or never coming around.They may just not know what to say to you or how to help. Reach out to them and break the ice.


Call up a friend who has been a no-show and make a light-hearted joke. Say something like ""Geez, Rebecca, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, not cooties. It's not contagious. I would love to see your face more often!""

, You might feel hurt or angry if your friends go MIA, but their behavior says more about them than it does about you. Your friends may not know what to say to you, or they might find it too difficult to see you suffering.Seeing a friend come down with a chronic illness is hard for many people because it reminds them that anybody can get sick. People may disappear from your life because they don’t want to think about their own health and mortality.
Some of your friends might feel awkward around you because they don’t know how to act anymore. If they’re afraid of saying something wrong, they might start avoiding you altogether. Also, some people inaccurately assume that you want space while you are coming to terms with your diagnosis. Particularly if you have been less present socially due to pain or illness.

, If a friend says something that hurts your feelings, don’t hesitate to tell them how it affects you. Putting a stop to tactless jokes right away will make your friends less likely to say similar things in the future. If your friend cares about you, they will apologize and speak more carefully next time.Be direct. Say something like, “That’s pretty hurtful to me. I’d rather you didn’t joke about that.”
Be aware that your friend is probably not being intentionally hurtful. They may be making a poor attempt at humor because they don’t know what to say.

, Not everyone will be capable of giving you the same degree of support, but don't let this keep you from asking. Just be understanding if they can't make something work. Don't assume they do not have time for you. If a friend can’t be there for you all the time but still makes an effort to keep in touch and help you out occasionally, let them know you appreciate them.You might say, ""I know we used to spend more time together, and I'm not physically able to go out as much. I really appreciate how flexible you have been to still hang out with me.""

, To extend your social circle, which might be helpful if you currently have unsupportive friends, you might not have to look further than people you already know. Try striking up a conversation with a classmate, neighbor, or coworker. If you like their company, invite them to do an activity or get coffee with you.You can also get involved in a cause related to your illness and meet people with similar struggles.

, Talking to other people with chronic illnesses can be a great way to find social support and form new friendships. Look for a group in your area or search the internet for a virtual support group. You might also ask your doctor if they know of support groups in your area., If it’s difficult for you to spend too much time outside the house but you're still yearning for support, the internet can help you stay connected. A few options include using social media, writing a blog, or participating on chat boards for people with chronic illnesses. Here, you can find support from others who may be undergoing a similar struggle., People come and go, and sometimes old friends return after disappearing from your life for a while. Be willing to reconnect with people from the past to keep your circle of friends strong.For instance, if you see a high school friend who shares their journey coping with diabetes on Facebook, you might reach out to them. Say something like, ""Wow, I was so moved by your post the other day. I, too, have diabetes. I really need someone to talk to about my condition. Are you open to do that?""

, A therapist can provide a supportive and understanding ear when you’re feeling down about your illness. They can also help you cope with your illness in a healthy way and find ways to maintain a support network. Ask your doctor for recommendations, or run an online search for therapists in your area who have knowledge about your condition., If a friend repeatedly abandons you when you need them or says insensitive things, you may be better off without them. Dropping a friend might be difficult, but keeping a thoughtless or toxic person around will do more damage in the long run.If you decide to cut ties with a friend, talk to them first – they may not realize how their behavior is hurting you. You might say, “Lisa, I have always enjoyed our friendship, but things are different now that I have multiple sclerosis. I haven’t been feeling very supported by you…”

, Taking care of your physical, mental, and emotional health will help you maintain a positive outlook on life. Eat a balanced diet, do some gentle exercise, get enough sleep, and practice mindfulness techniques like meditation.Eating a nutritious diet, exercising, sleeping enough, and practicing self-care can help improve symptoms of your chronic illness and help you manage stress.
Avoid using alcohol to cope or overindulging in alcohol. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant and can lead to symptoms of depression, which is already a common problem for people with chronic illness.Share your health goals online with your social media followers to get some accountability from friends online.

, Getting lost in an activity you enjoy can help you stay busy and positive. Rediscover an old hobby that you’ve forgotten about, or pick up a new hobby that you’ve always wanted to try.Knitting, drawing, painting, and reading are a few options that are simple to start and won’t tire you out too much. If you have hand pain, consider using rubber grips to make your knitting needles or pencils easier to hold.

, Chronic illness can bring you down, especially if you add unsupportive friends into the mix, so look for ways to build yourself back up. Set challenges for yourself, remind yourself of your positive qualities, and focus on what you can do instead of what you can’t.When you're sick, it's common to dwell on the negatives and not notice the positives. Make a list of all your positive attributes and review it regularly. You might include traits ""being a good listener,"" ""having compassion for others,"" and ""being creative.""

Call out the behavior.,
Ask how you can help your friend improve.,
Be clear about what you want and hold your friend accountable.,
Modify your expectations.",How to Handle Unreliable Friends1," Your friend is often inconsiderate of your time. You’re better off recognizing the problem for what it is than making excuses for this person. If you want to continue the friendship, but don’t want to put up with the behavior, your best option is to say something. Maybe shedding light on the bad behavior will provoke change.


You might say, “Hey, Carla. You always seem to bow out of our plans at the last minute without any explanation. That makes me feel like I’m not a priority as your friend. What’s up with that?”;
, One way to lend a helping hand to an unreliable friend is to simply ask how you can help.Your friend may already be aware of his or her unreliable behavior, but doesn't know how to change it. By showing that you care, you may be able to come up with a practical strategy to help overcome this issue.


Listen to your friend and hear what he or she has to say. Your friend may have some suggestions about how you can help. Or, he or she may just be glad you are willing to show support when it's needed. Only offer suggestions if your advice is requested. Remember, you are trying to be a good friend, not fix the problem for him or her.
Say something to the extent of ""I see you struggle a lot to remember our plans. Is there something I can do to help you with that?""

, Sometimes, when we are frustrated with people, we give them a big list of all the things we don't want.This can lead to confusion and overwhelm. Instead, let your friend know exactly what you do want. Then, be sure to hold him or her accountable to meeting these expectations.


For example, tell your friend ""I expect for you to be on time when we make plans. And, if for some reason you will not be on time, I expect for you to let me know as soon as possible.""
If your friend agrees to meet this expectation, and then fails to do so, you must call him or her out on it. Say ""I am on time for plans with you. I expect you to do the same, or I will let you know that I am upset about your being late.""

, You may choose to change your expectations of the friendship. If the friend is a good friend who has suddenly seen big changes is his or her life, you may just have to move past the fact that there are going to be missed events.As friends start to have committed relationships and families, you may see a sudden spike in your best friend suddenly just not showing up and not calling to say why. This can be a sign he or she is having troubles adjusting to young children and not ready to acknowledge the huge impact kids have on life. If the friendship is solid and valuable, it is worth it to you to just accept this change.
Part of being a true friend is accepting your friend for who he or she is and loving him or her anyway.

Remain calm.,
Ask your friend and significant other to sit down and talk.,
Establish ground rules for the discussion.,
Ask each of them to write down their main concerns.,
Speak to each of them individually.,
Ask your friend and significant other to identify their issues with each other.,
Have them use “I” statements.,
Come up with a solution to the conflict together.,
Leave the conversation on good terms.,
Encourage your friend and your significant other to communicate.,
Defuse issues with humor.,
Hang out with your friend and your partner separately.",How to Handle Fights Between Your Friend and Significant Other," Though you may find it overwhelming to deal with fights between a friend and your partner, you should avoid getting upset yourself. Instead, focus on staying calm and acting as the voice of reason. Avoid the temptation to also yell, argue, or get frustrated with your friend or your partner.You may try to take a few deep, calming breaths when your friend and your significant other are fighting. You may also leave the room for a moment to calm down and then re enter the room when you feel more relaxed and ready to address the conflict.;
, You should then approach your friend and your partner to find out if they are willing to talk about their conflict. You may do this separately, talking first to your friend and then to your partner about having a discussion together. Try to get both parties to agree to an open, friendly discussion to address their issues with each other.When you talk to them, you may note that the fights between your friend and your partner are starting to really bother you and you are finding it difficult to handle the arguments. You may ask your friend and your partner to agree to work through their issues so that you can all hang out together without conflict.
For example, you may say, ""I am feeling uncomfortable around both of you and it makes me stressed out when you both fight with each other. Can we sit down and work this out so we can all hang out together in peace?""

, If your partner and your friend agree to having a discussion, you should all sit down in a quiet, private space. Then, you should establish ground rules for the discussion so it does not get out of hand. Having ground rules set will ensure everyone in the discussion treats each other with respect.For example, you may all agree to not interrupt each other when you are speaking to each other. You may make a rule to avoid name calling or swearing during the discussion. You may also agree to having time outs if the discussion gets heated or out of hand.
You may decide to act as the mediator in the discussion, where you help your friend and your partner communicate with each other. As the mediator, you should be given the right to enforce the ground rules so the discussion stays civil.
For example, you may say, ""As the mediator, I will enforce the ground rules of the discussion so it stays civil and productive.""

, To ensure that the discussion is productive and rational, encourage them both to make a list of what bothers them most so that they are able to stay focused on the discussion. Tell them to be specific so that once they start talking to each other, they are less likely to get emotional and off-topic., When your friend and significant other have an issue with each other, it almost always centers around their relationship with you, so you are not just a mediator. They are more likely to share their issues and the deeper reasons behind them with you than with the other person, so talking to them beforehand can help you resolve the issue faster. You may need to resolve the issues with them individually before coming together as a group.

For example, the issue could be caused by your friend feeling like you two don't spend enough time together.
On the other hand, your significant other might not like having your friend as a third wheel.
They may not feel comfortable revealing the truth to each other, but they will likely tell you.

, You can all work together to resolve the conflict by being honest about the issues between your friend and your partner. Your friend should take a turn explaining their issues with your significant other, and your significant other should take a turn explaining their issues with your friend. As the mediator, you should make sure your friend and your partner both avoid blaming each other or mocking each other.Each person should have a turn to express how they are feeling and why they believe they do not get along with the other. Make sure everyone else listens patiently while one person speaks so everyone has a chance to talk and be heard.

, Encourage your friend and your partner to use “I” statements when they talk about their issues with each other. You may tell them to express themselves using “I” statements and to avoid using “you” or “we” when they speak. This will help them avoid making assumptions or accusations against each other.For example, your friend may say, “I do not like how your partner treats you. I think they are disrespectful towards you and have a poor attitude.”
Your partner may say, “I have difficulty with how protective your friend is around you. I feel like they are always trying to sabotage our relationship and I am uncomfortable with this.”
Make sure that you take part in the discussion as well, using ""I"" statements for how you feel about the situation.

, Once your friend and your partner have discussed their issues with each other, you should all try to come up with a solution or a compromise together. This may mean that both parties will need to apologize and compromise so everyone can get along. You may encourage your friend and your partner to agree to a solution so you can all move on and be friendly with one another.For example, you may tell your friend, “I appreciate your concern about my relationship. But I need you to respect my decision to be with them and try to be civil with them, as my friend.”
You may tell your partner, “I understand why you may feel uncomfortable. But I need you to be supportive of my friendship and accept that my friend is in my life.”
Remember that sometimes the best solution is not asking the two of them to spend time together. It's okay if they don't want to be friends with each other. You can still maintain your relationship with each of them.

, You should then end the conversation on terms that feel positive and productive. You all may end up agreeing to disagree, as long as all parties feel less hostile to one another and willing to work on their relationships moving forward. You should all leave the conversation feeling more optimistic and less angry at one another.For example, your friend may agree to try to be more accepting and supportive of your romantic relationship moving forward. Your partner may agree to work on being okay with your relationship with your friend and getting along with your friend.

, Your friend and your partner can avoid fights moving forward by working on their ability to communicate with each other. You should encourage them both to try to have friendly, open conversations with each other. Over time, this could even lead to a platonic relationship between them, making your hang outs together much smoother.For example, if your partner gets irritated by something your friend does, you may encourage your partner to talk to your friend about the issue and work it out with them. You may advise your friend to do the same if they find something your partner does annoying or frustrating.
You may say, ""Maybe you should talk to them about how you feel. It's better than getting annoyed or upset at them in silence.""

, If your partner and your friend start to bicker, you may try defusing the situation by making a joke or a funny remark. Using humor can help everyone involved to pause and assess their emotions. It can also allow your friend and your partner to brush off the issue and move forward.For example, you may make a joke if your partner starts to argue with your friend over who pays the bill for a meal. You may say, “Why don’t we settle this with a game of rock, paper, scissors? Or flip a coin?”

, If your friend and your significant other just can’t seem to get along, no matter how hard you try, you may decide to hang out with each person separately. This may be an easier option, as you can then avoid any fighting or bickering between your friend and your partner. It may also put less stress on you, as you will not have to act as the mediator all the time.


You may also be conscious of hanging out separately with your friend and your partner when you are in a group setting. You may draw your friend away from the group for a quick chat and then join the group and hang out with your partner.

Give yourself time to calm down.,
Have a conversation with your partner.,
Be direct about your emotions.,
Talk about whether your jealousy has merit.,
Try not to lash out.,
Realize that relationships involve trust.",How to Keep Jealousy from Ruining a Relationship2," It's best to wait until you've calmed down to have a conversation. If you're still very emotional, it can lead to an argument instead of a discussion. Do something you enjoy that calms you down, such as listening to music, doing art, or reading., Once you figure out what you're feeling, it's time to talk it out with your partner. Tell them what's making you feel jealous and why. Even if your jealousy is unfounded, it can help to talk about it with your partner.For instance, you can say, ""I've been feeling jealous lately. Every time you go out with your friends from work, I can't help but feel jealous that you're not spending time with me. I want you to have your friends, and I know my feelings are unreasonable, but I felt like I needed to talk to you about it.""

, Being direct means telling the person about your feelings, not trying to coax them into admitting they were doing something wrong. In other words, say, ""I'm feeling jealous because of the way you interacted with that person,"" not, ""You sure were over there awhile, huh?""The second option can quickly turn to sarcasm and hostility, leading to fights, not discussions.

, If you suspect your partner is cheating on you, your jealousy may have merit. You should bring up these concerns when you talk to your partner. It's important to clear the air, so that both of you are on the same page.You could say, ""I feel like you've been spending a lot of time with lately. It's stirred up my jealousy, but it also makes me wonder if I have a good reason to be jealous. Are you having an affair?""

, Everybody is going to feel jealous at some point in their lives. The key is to not use that emotion to drive hostile actions in your relationship. If you act out in your relationship by lashing out at your partner or accusing them of hating you, that does more harm than just recognizing that you're feeling jealous.If you're feeling jealous, try to just acknowledge that you are having that emotion, and then let it go. Just by acknowledging it, you weaken its power.

, You may want to know for sure that your partner isn't interested in someone else. You could follow your partner to find out for sure. However, that breaks the trust you've built, which hurts your relationship. At some point, you just have to trust the commitment that your partner has given you.If you find you can't trust your partner, you may need to end the relationship with them.

"
"
Watch for signs of jealousy in your partner.,
Bring up the topic with your partner.,
Let your partner have time to talk and think.,
Ask what you can do to help.,
Tell your partner you will work through this with them.,
Reassure your partner of your love.",How to Keep Jealousy from Ruining a Relationship3," Often, feeling jealous will make a person lash out in hostile ways. Your partner may become oversensitive or seem overly possessive. They may seem overly concerned about where you are all the time. Identifying jealousy is the first step in dealing with it., If you've noticed that your partner is acting jealous, you need to have a conversation about it. Make sure to take note of how it's affecting you both and your relationship, so you can discuss the problems with your partner.You could say, ""I've noticed that you seem to be feeling angry or hostile towards me lately when I talk to other people when we're out. I've been wondering if maybe you've been feeling a little jealous. It's perfectly fine if you have, but I thought we should have a conversation about it because I can tell it's been building a wall between us.""

, Once you've brought up the issue, give your partner time to react to what you've said. They need space to talk about what they're feeling, and they may even need a day or two to think about what you've said. Listen to what your partner has to say and respond in kind.

, If your partner is feeling jealous, it's your job to help as much as you can. Ask what you can do to make the other person feel better. Keep in mind, your partner may ask you to change certain behaviors, such as how you interact with people.Nonetheless, you shouldn't have to completely change your life for an overly jealous partner. If your partner refuses to let you see anyone else at all, including long-time friends, that's extreme.

, Let your partner know that you will work through this problem with them, no matter how long it takes. Of course, you need to be willing to follow up on that promise. However, just letting them know you are willing to fight for the relationship can go a long way towards reassuring them., In some cases, jealousy stems from feeling insecure and having low self-esteem. In those cases, it can help to reassure your partner that you love them. It can also help to let them know what you love about them, as some people need to hear it on a regular basis."
"
Tell the truth when your partner makes an accusation.,
Skip the snooping.,
Make sure both of you back up what you say with action.,
Remember trust takes time.,
Consider seeing a therapist.",How to Keep Jealousy from Ruining a Relationship4," When your partner is feeling jealous and hurls an accusation at you, it can be tempting to lie. However, it's better to come clean and talk about what you're feeling in that moment.For example, if your partner accuses you of flirting with someone, you could say, ""Yes, I was being a little too nice to that person. I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings. I want you to know that while they're attractive, I'm totally in love with you, heart, mind, and soul.""

, If you're the jealous partner, you may be tempted to snoop on your partner to find out if they're cheating on you or being unfaithful. Unfortunately, social media makes this pastime all too easy. If you're looking for something to catch your partner on, you'll probably find it because you'll read too much into every interaction. The more you ""find,"" the more you'll want to snoop. Instead, it's best to avoid this activity altogether., That is, it's one thing to say ""I love you,"" or ""I value you,"" and it's another thing to show that in your actions. To build trust, you need to make sure that your actions aren't contradicting what you're saying.For instance, if you say, ""I value your time"" but you're constantly making excuses to get out of dates or time with that person, your actions are contradicting your words.

, You may want to earn trust overnight, but that's not realistic. It's particularly a problem if your partner has had their trust betrayed in the past, either by you or someone else. It can take as long as several years to earn someone's full trust., If jealousy is causing major rifts in your relationship, you may want to see a counselor with your partner. A counselor can help you work through your issues together, as well as help you identify what triggers jealousy in you or your partner.To find a therapist, first consult your insurance to see what coverage you have. Look at your coverage to find an in-network counselor. You can also ask for recommendations from close friends.
If you don't have insurance or your insurance doesn't cover therapy, look at sliding scale clinics, which charge based on your income.

"
Try to problem-solve together.,
Set personal boundaries.,
Learn to work around your unreliable friend.,
End the friendship.",How to Handle Unreliable Friends2," You may choose to talk to this friend about the value of the relationship and how to make it better. If the friendship is worth saving but the behavior is something you just can’t live with, suggest that you and your friend brainstorm some solutions.Be prepared to either work on the relationship or go with the changes that result if things do not change. Friendships change and this might be a time where you start to grow apart.
Remember you both have different personalities and perceptions so take the time to have an honest dialogue about why you are friends, whether you want to continue the friendship, and how to go forward.
Be sure to tell your friend how much you love him or her and value the friendship. This isn’t about hurting feelings or blame; it is about making the friendship stronger because you see value in it.

, Whether it’s a relationship with a friend, romantic partner, or family member, all healthy relationships should respect the individual boundaries of each person involved.If your friend is often unreliable, you may not have clearly set boundaries regarding what you are willing to accept and not accept in your friendships.


Put your well-being first and make sure that everyone in your life understands how you expect to be treated. Show them the same courtesy in kind. If the unreliable friend is often late, be assertive and tell him this is unacceptable. “Zack, every time we go out you’re nearly an hour late. I always show up when I say I will. I will stop making plans with you if this keeps happening.”
Setting clear boundaries about how you communicate and interact will help this process. It might just be a misunderstanding or something that happened unintentionally. But, once you make your boundaries clear, the behavior should improve.

, Many people with unreliable friends who have proven incapable of changing simply learn to work around the problem. This might be a suggestion for you if you have tried to help your friend change and nothing seems to help. Ways to work around your friend may include:Never making plans with this friend alone. That way if he or she is late or bails, it won't ruin the entire outing.
Having someone else to wait with instead of being on your own
Anticipating that any plans with this friend probably won't go as expected
Not stopping what you're doing to wait for your friend's arrival. Tell the person to text or call when they're right outside

, In an extreme case, you may just decide to end the friendship. If there isn’t a long-term friendship or you feel like this friend is not really invested in improving his or her behavior, this is probably the best move.If you feel like it is time to end the relationship, make a clean break without drama if that is possible. If this is a co-worker, agree to remain friendly but set a clear boundary about leaving the relationship strictly at work.

"
"
Analyze the behavior.,
Clarify the extent of your relationship.,
Decide if there is an underlying problem.,
Pinpoint the issue.,
Search for recurring problems.,
Look beyond this single friendship to other relationships.",How to Handle Unreliable Friends3," Try to figure out what your friend is trying to tell you through the behavior. Behavior is always communicating something; you just have to really look deep to see what your friend's behavior is signifying.Hiding anxiety or social phobias is one reason some people will avoid social situations at all costs. This would be the friend who seems nice and involved in things but at the last minute simply does not show up. He or she may not know how to tell you how scary social situations feel for him or her, and figure you are less likely to get hurt feelings by a no show.
A friend who comes up with excuse after excuse for not attending an event or even jokes about you overacting to a no-show may not really be a friend. In a normal relationship, if a friend misses an event for a real reason there would be an apology and a genuine concern for the resulting feelings., There’s a chance a friend who is frequently unreliable may not be as committed to the relationship as you are. Perhaps you were hoping to turn a coworker or social acquaintance into a closer relationship, but this person hasn’t gotten the message. Find out where you stand with this person.


A flaky friend’s motives may also be tied to a lack of boundaries on your friendship. Some people prefer for example to leave work friends at work and will never socialize outside of the office. If this is the case, he or she may not feel comfortable making that clear so invites are accepted but never followed through. This does not mean this friend thinks any less of you—he or she just doesn’t mix business with pleasure so to speak.
A friend may seem to be unreliable is that he or she isn’t really a friend in the same light that you think the person should be. If a coworker is only friendly in front of others because of status or a perceived value in the friendship, you may have a social climber on your hands., Part of how he or she got to the point of being that unreliable friend also includes the behavior after the problem. This may be as simple as acting like nothing happened because he or she forgets commitments or making a choice to act as if nothing happened.


The friend who always seems disorganized and forgets things in the office, loses documents and even misses work deadlines may have something more going on than skipping your event to be hurtful. If this is a new development for someone who is always well organized, this could indicate problems at home or a medical issue., It’s easy to say your friend is “flakey” or a whole list of negative descriptors, but what is the basic behavior you see as being negative? You may have a friend who just doesn’t show up to an event or is he or she simply forgetful?When you look at the specific behavior, also look at whether or not there is a pattern of behavior for you and for others. Are you the only friend he or she stands up or does the evasive behavior apply to many people in the office?
An unreliable friend may also fall into the category of only being your “friend” when it benefits him or her. This is a very different situation as it isn’t someone simply being forgetful but perhaps using the friendship for some sort of gain.
Defining the undesired behavior versus things that are just a part of your friend’s personality will help you deal with the situation. A friend who thrives on being spontaneous may seem unreliable because he or she will not commit to attending an event, which is very different from a friend who lies about attending an event he or she knows won’t happen.

, Is there a pattern to the behavior? Is your friend only flakey when it comes to social events or is he or she forgetful in different situations? Seeing a pattern in the behavior may show you an underlying cause of why he or she isn’t following through on commitments. If you can see a pattern when things are happening and when they are not you may find that the negative behavior actually has little to do with you.Is the negative behavior consistent or is the friend a good friend at times? If the friend is hiding a secret to explain the behavior he or she may be fine in some situations but not OK in others.
Is your friend a good meaning person who just seems to overbook to the point of disappointing others because they can’t say no?

, Is this your only unreliable friends or does this seem to be a pattern in your life? Is there a chance you are taking things too personally for this one friend for some reason?There are times when you run into a friend that all of the sudden just gets on your nerves for some unknown underlying issue. This may play manifest with you focusing undo attention on behavior that is normally fine within your social circle.

Protect yourself against discrimination.",How to Transition from Male to Female (Transgender)," Accepting that you are transgender, a person who does not identify with the sex and gender assigned to them at birth, is different than committing to a life as a transsexual, a person who has changed or seeks to change their sex through medical intervention and treatment.Transitioning is an irreversible, risky, time-consuming, and pricey process. Before committing to seeking treatment, spend time reflecting upon the decision. Keep a daily journal. Discuss the process with a close, trusted friend or members of a support group.If your town or city does not have a local trans support group, join an online support group.;
, Read and learn as much as you can about the transition process. Educate yourself on the benefits, risks, and cost of transitioning. Research the different procedures, prepare yourself to combat discrimination, and estimate the amount of money required to complete your transition. You can gather sources from a variety of places and through different means. Surf the web for information—use keyword searches like “LGBTQ,” “male-to-female,” or “transgender.” Find books and journals at your local library—search by subject in the library catalogue. Members of your support group may also have excellent suggestions. Use them as resources!Each transition is unique, specific to the individual. You may not require extensive hair removal therapy or you could choose to forego breast implants after receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Even though you may not wish to undergo all of the medical procedures, it is still essential that you educate yourself on the entire process. Your knowledge will help you make an informed decision., Deciding if, when, where, and how to come out to family and friends is stressful! Like transitioning, coming out is unique to the individual. Your method of coming out has to be right for you! If you feel more comfortable one-on-one, tell people individually; if you prefer to tell everyone at once, gather your close friends and family together. It is not essential that you inform each and every person you know. Be honest with those that are closest to you. Share your story. Ask for their support. Give them space and time to digest the news., Transitioning is extremely expensive. Some insurances cover parts of the process, but never all of the process. Ask your insurance company if they will cover therapy, HRT, hair removal, breast implants, or vaginoplasty? If you do not have insurance or your insurance does not cover the treatments and procedures, don’t panic! Work with a financially savvy friend to develop an estimate and prepare a savings plan. Once your have an estimate, start setting aside money for the out-of-pocket expenses.On average, a Vaginoplasty costs $20,000.00. Laser hair removal can cost anywhere from $25.00 to $150.00 per hour. Hormone Replacement Therapy costs between $5.00 and $85.00 per month—this treatment is continued for the remainder of your life.The length of the transition process is often determined by your financial situation., Prior to starting HRT, begin exercising. It is very difficult to lose weight while taking hormones! Start exercising your voice as well. Experiment with finding your feminine pitch, tone, and resonance.Practice transferring your chest voice to your head voice—in other words, speak in a falsetto, or “Minnie Mouse” voice. As you master that, move on to more advanced vocal exercises, such as consciously controlling the muscles surrounding your voice box and Adam’s Apple.Placing two fingers under your Adam’s Apple and lifting up will raise your pitch. Over time, your muscles will pull the Adam’s Apple up., According to the HBGDIA WPATH Standards of Care, you must see a Gender Therapist prior to receiving hormones or undergoing surgeries. Ask your friends in the trans community to recommend a therapist. Browse the internet in search of a therapist experienced working with members of the trans community. Commit to the therapist that makes you feel at ease.


Ask clients about your potential therapist’s rates, practices, schooling, and level of acceptance.
Ask your potential therapists lots of questions. Inquire about their interest in gender therapy and how many of their clients received recommendations for HRT and surgery.
If your therapist is not a great fit, don’t be afraid to switch to a new counselor!, Over the course of a series of sessions, your therapist will evaluate your individual situation issuing a diagnosis. After determining that you have consistently experienced symptoms such as disgust with your genitals, a desire to remove signs of your biological sex, and or a certainty that your biological sex does not align with your true gender, your therapist will likely diagnose you with Gender Dysphoria.


You must experience these symptoms for at least 6 months.
Be honest with your therapist and yourself.Gender dysphoria does not mean that you are diseased or broken; it simply means that you are not content with living as your assigned sex. Doctors write this down so they have justification to give you the pills, therapy, and/or surgery you want or need.
Gender dysphoria does not necessarily mean a sad mood. If you have been feeling depressed or anxious, tell the therapist. You may benefit from treatment for that as well.

, After diagnosing you with Gender Dysphoria, your therapist will provide you with treatment options. The goal of your treatment should not be to alter how you feel but to help you cope with your feelings and alleviate your distress. In addition to continued therapy, your therapist may recommend that you undergo HRT, which will be administered and supervised by a general practitioner or endocrinologist. If you have not yet gone through puberty, your therapist may prescribe puberty blockers., If you express a desire to have a Sexual Reassignment Surgery, SRS, you must complete you social gender role transition before your therapist will approve the medical procedure. During this period of transition, you will live in your gender identity for one to two years. This will allow you to experience life as a woman. You will dress, go to the office, attend family functions, exercise, and go grocery shopping as a woman. After living through a range of events, your therapist will help you determine if a SRS is the right option for you.


While undergoing this process, continue taking your hormones, removing any body or facial hair you don't want, and finding your feminine voice., HRT’s purpose is to make you more comfortable with your body. The hormones will alter your body to align with your gender identity. As a man transitioning into a woman, your endocrinologist or your general practitioner will prescribe you an estrogen hormone regimen. You must receive HRT consistently. Once started, HRT should be continued indefinitely, even after you have undergone a sex reassignment surgery (SRS). HRT can drastically alter your body and for some, HRT is an adequate treatment for their Gender Dysphoria.However, HRT does not change the size of your hands or the pitch of your voice. It shrinks your testes, but does not remove them. Therefore, others may seek additional forms of treatment to get their desired results.


Familiarize yourself with the risks of HRT. Expect shrinkage of muscle and redistribution of fat. Hormones can cause severe liver damage if not monitored by a physician. NEVER try to self-medicate.Always take the lowest effective dosage of hormones. Taking too high of a dosage will actually slow down the transition process.
Your general practitioner or endocrinologist should monitor your HRT. Schedule regular check-ups!, Laser hair removal is painful and expensive! It is also a very long treatment. Start the process of hair removal as early as possible. It can take between 100 to 400 hours to remove a facial beard permanently! You can also have hair removed from your arms, back, chest, and legs.If you are going to undergo a SRS, you must have the hair removed from your scrotum., HRT will not alter the pitch of your voice, but it is something you can change. Work with a Speech Language Pathologist to find the perfect pitch, resonance, and inclination for your female voice. Your voice coach will work with you on altering the pace of your speech, as well as the tone of your voice. They will also help you add more feminine words and phrases to your vocabulary, such as “Bless your heart,” “like,” “sweetie,” and “dear.”If you do not have the means to consult a specialist, you can find several helpful online resources! There are CDs and DVDs you can purchase that will guide you through a variety of exercises. There are even apps and free videos online!
Altering your voice takes patience and practice. The process can take between 6 months and 1 year to alter your voice., Reducing the size of your Adam’s Apple is a simple, outpatient surgery. This procedure, commonly called “Trach Shave” lessens the appearance of the masculine feature through the removal of cartilage., HRT will naturally increase the size of your breasts. Most trans women will become an A cup. If you wish to increase the size of your busts, consider breast implants. Implants will improve the size, shape, and look of your bust.Know that breast implants are a risky procedure, and they may leak toxins. Once you have them, it's unwise to have them permanently removed: your chest probably won't look good. Make sure that you are certain that you want them before you get them.

, This surgery combines several procedures to alter your masculine features into fine feminine features. You may choose to alter your strong chin or your broad nose. You can change your hairline or the lines of your lips. Altering your masculine features will make it easier for you to pass as a female. Your plastic surgeon will work with you to achieve the perfect, dainty, feminine look.


During this surgery, it is common to also reduce the size of your Adam’s Apple.

, During this surgical procedure, surgeons work to convert your penile and scrotal tissue into a vagina, clitoris, and labia. After this procedure, your genitals will appear feminine. You will be able to have sexual intercourse and reach orgasm. This surgery is irreversible., Select a name that reflects your personality as a woman. Changing your name takes time and requires patience. Start the process early. First, file a petition to change your name with the Chancery division of your Circuit Court. On your appointed date, you will appear in front of a judge with your complete paperwork. If all of your documents are in order, the judge will rule to officially change your name. Following your successful court appearance, purchase original copies of the court order. You will have to use these throughout the process of changing your name on legal documents.The process and forms vary from state to state.
Start the process early!

, Research your employer’s policy on employing transgender and transsexual men and women. Prior to completing your transition, inform your supervisor and a representative of your company’s Human Resources team about the changes you are making in your life. If you experience any issues, consult with an anti-discrimination lawyer or a member of the trans community on how to precede. Ultimately, you must decide if the battle is worth fighting!, Educate yourself on the resources available to members of the LGBTQ community, specifically trans women. Familiarize yourself with local help centers and support groups. If you experience any form of discrimination, seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or activist. Remain strong and allow your support system to carry you through the situation."

Sex: Its most basic meaning is our biology: male, female, intersex, etc. It is a term created for scientific purposes which is why we are asked to label ourselves on medical records. It is assigned at birth based off genitals. Many people who study gender and sexuality question the purpose of this as well.






Gender: It was created as a way to identify how society wants someone of a certain sex to behave. For example, the concept that ""pink is for girls/blue is for boys"" is nothing more than a social construct we have been told to believe very strongly in.;
, Frequently used gender terms have become so common that we forget their actual meanings: ""girl"" means a prepubescent female, whereas ""woman"" means an adult female, yet society frequently refers to anyone fitting the description of a female to be a ""girl"" no matter the age (infantilization).

, Ask yourself how your daily routine, and behavior would change if you were not given a gender or sex. If you are not transgender, ask yourself how you would feel if you were.


Beware of the belief that females are emotional and males are logical. It is a fallacy. Gender does not only impact one sex. Convincing one sex that they must act a certain way is damaging, yet the majority of people still follow gendered behavior to prevent punishment. We are so used to ""doing gender"" that we have forgotten that we are acting.

, When a male's masculinity is questioned they are often accused of being homosexual. This is believed even though in ancient times the love between two males was more meaningful than that of a heterosexual couple. At the same time, a female who can care for herself is frequently criticized for it, and sometimes labeled a lesbian because society cannot accept a female who does not need a male.


Ask yourself, on a daily basis, if what you are saying or thinking of someone is factual or if it is socially constructed gender. It helps to ask how you would feel if you were that person -- no matter your sex.

, Since pronouns like ""he"" and ""she"" are frequently used, try to use non-gendered pronouns such as ""they"", especially in situations when you don't know a person's pronoun. Also, stop assuming people's pronouns. As pronouns are closely connected to gender identity, there's no way to find out someone's pronoun except for asking. Make it a habit, it sometimes helps to rework your mind.

, Think about your own gender, and sexuality. No matter what they are you are being policed by society to act a certain way, and it is wrong -- society can make it right. It takes time to fully comprehend the line between sex and gender. While females often admit the countless times in a day that their performance is belittled by their gender, males experience it as well, but are taught to fight back to re-prove their masculinity.

, Tell others about the difference between sex and gender to see if they can start to change their outlook as well.

, While gender is often a tool of oppression, it can also be a helpful way for trans people to express themselves without their genitals costing them their lives. Since a transgender -- not ""transgendered"" -- person was assigned a sex that does not fit the gender they connect with, they can focus on the socially accepted appearance of gender; unfortunately, when they ""do gender"" it is not merely for their own comfort, but also as a survival tool.

Treat vitamin A toxicity aggressively.",How to Treat Reptiles for Vitamin A Deficiency," A healthy diet is critical to treating vitamin A deficiency in reptiles. Beta carotene is a substance found in food that is converted to vitamin A in the body. Foods rich in beta carotene will give your reptile the vitamin A he needs to be healthy. Examples of beta carotene-rich foods are dark, leafy greens (e.g., mustard greens, turnip greens) and brightly-colored fruits and vegetables (e.g., papayas, mangos, sweet potatoes, yellow peppers).Examples of beta carotene-poor foods are bananas, white potatoes, and lettuce.Do not feed these to your reptile.
Even if your reptile eats a lot of beta carotene-rich foods, there is little risk of vitamin A toxicity, since excess beta carotene does not get converted to vitamin A.Fresh vegetables can lose their vitamin content over time. Consider placing the vegetables in vegetable bags to keep them fresh for longer.;
, Your reptile will need to eat more than just beta carotene-rich foods to have a complete and balanced diet. For example, carnivorous (meat-eating) reptiles need a meat-based protein. If you have an aquatic or semi-aquatic turtle, which is a carnivore, feed him earthworms and gut-loaded insects (insects with nutrient-rich food in their guts).Lizards, such as bearded dragons and chameleons, also eat insects (e.g. grasshoppers, crickets) and different types of worms (e.g., earthworms, butter worms, silk worms).Consult with your vet to make sure you feed your reptile a healthy diet.

, A high quality commercial diet is also important for treating vitamin A deficiency. Talk with your veterinarian if you’re not sure what type of commercial diet to feed your reptile. They can give you recommendations based on what type of reptile you have (e.g., lizard, turtle) and whether it is a carnivore, herbivore (plant-eating), or omnivore (plant- and meat-eating).Trout food is a commercial diet for turtles., During treatment, keep a daily log of your reptile’s diet.Record the amount and types of food you feed him, and what he actually ends up eating. You may find that your reptile likes some foods more than others.


Keeping a food diary will help your vet monitor your reptile’s treatment progress.

, Loss of appetite and weight loss can occur with vitamin A deficiency in reptiles. As your reptile improves his diet and starts eating more, he will start gaining weight. You may notice the weight gain just by looking at him, but weighing him will help you know just how much weight he’s gained.On a weekly or monthly basis, weigh your reptile on a digital reptile scale, which you can find online or at a pet store.


Record your reptile’s weight each time you weigh him.

, Vitamin A supplements are effective in treating vitamin A deficiencies in reptiles. Supplements can either be injectable or given by mouth. Because injectable vitamin A supplementation can cause vitamin A toxicity, it is usually reserved for severe cases of vitamin A deficiency.Oral vitamin A supplements can be added to a reptile’s food.


If your reptile needs injectable vitamin A, ask your vet to administer an oil-based, not water-based, injection. Water-based vitamin A injections have a high risk of toxicity.Injections should be given only by your veterinarian.Your vet will recommend a supplement for your reptile, based on the severity of the vitamin A deficiency., Vitamin A eye drops are found at pet stores. Although they are marketed to treat vitamin A deficiencies and eye infections, these eye drops are usually not very effective. In addition, if you start giving them to your reptile before seeking veterinary treatment, you could prolong overall treatment., Vitamin A deficiency can weaken the immune system, making your reptile susceptible to infections. Mouth, eye, and skin infections occur with vitamin A deficiency. If your reptile has infections, your vet will prescribe medications (antibiotics, antifungals) to treat the infection. These medications can be given by injection, by mouth, or applied directly to the affected area.If you have an aquatic turtle that needs topical medications (applied directly to the affected area), you will need to apply the medications more frequently, since the medication will come off in the water., Sometimes, swollen eyes in reptiles can be due to low cage humidity or dry substrate (e.g., sand). Improving the cage environment could reduce the eye swelling without the need for extra medication. If you have a box turtle, which is semi-aquatic, give him deep, moist soil to dig in and a pool where he could soak.If your turtles needs a lot of humidity, increasing the cage humidity could relieve the eye swelling.Strategies for increasing humidity include misting the cage once or twice a day with room temperature water and placing a large water dish in a warm section of the cage.Cage requirements vary according to reptile species. Research what the ideal cage environment should be for your specific type of reptile.

, During treatment, your vet will want to monitor your reptile’s progress.During these visits, your vet will examine your reptile’s eyes, weigh him, and check for improvement of infection. Your vet will determine how often your reptile needs to come back for checkups.

, Over supplementation with injectable vitamin A can cause vitamin A toxicity, which is a serious condition in reptiles that can make them very sick.To prevent this toxicity, your vet will lower the injectable vitamin A dosage over time. Fortunately, as your reptile’s diet improves, he will need less supplementation., Signs of vitamin A toxicity (swollen eyes, sloughing skin, skin ulcerations) resemble those of vitamin A deficiency.Because of this similarity, it may be hard to tell if your reptile has vitamin A toxicity. However, if your reptile’s condition does not improve, or gets worse, with injectable vitamin A, he may have this toxicity.


A vet can also have a hard time telling the difference between vitamin A deficiency and toxicity. Consequently, they may mistakenly give a reptile injectable vitamin A when it is not deficient in this vitamin., If your reptile has vitamin A toxicity, treatment needs to be long term and aggressive. Treatment often includes antibiotics and/or antifungal medications, fluid therapy, and assisted feeding. Unfortunately, prognosis for vitamin A toxicity is usually not good because of infections and organ failure."

Check how big the crocodile is.,
Look at the shape of the crocodile’s head.,
Note the size of the crocodile’s teeth.,
Determine the difference in diet.,
Look for freshwater crocodiles in inland freshwater areas.,
Check for saltwater crocodiles in lagoons, rivers, and swamps.,
Avoid saltwater crocodiles.,
Use caution around freshwater crocodiles.,
Keep in mind freshwater crocodiles are a protected species.",How to Tell a Freshwater Crocodile from a Saltwater Crocodile," One of the major differences between a freshwater crocodile and a saltwater crocodile is size. Freshwater crocodiles are much smaller than saltwater crocodiles, growing to about two meters, with males reaching up to three meters, and a maximum weight of 90kg. In contrast, saltwater crocodiles can grow to be as long as six or seven meters and weigh over 1000kg.Saltwater crocodiles as so big they are considered the largest reptiles in the world in terms of mass. They often appear massive in the water and on land, a big size contrast to the smaller freshwater crocodile.;
, You should also try to get a closer look at the shape of the crocodile’s head to determine which species it is. Freshwater crocodiles will have longer, thinner snouts, while saltwater crocodiles will have broad, thicker looking snouts.Keep in mind if you believe the crocodile is a saltwater species based on it’s size, you may not want to get close enough to check the shape of it’s head. Getting too close to a saltwater crocodile can result in an attack.

, You can compare the size of the crocodile’s teeth to determine which species it is, as each species has a distinct jawline and teeth size. Freshwater crocodiles have a straight jawline, with teeth that are almost equal in size. In contrast, saltwater crocodiles will have an uneven jawline, with teeth that vary in size. Some of their teeth may be nearly twice the size of their other teeth.Due to their smaller size, freshwater crocodiles will also have smaller teeth than saltwater crocodiles.
Again, if you suspect the crocodile is a saltwater species, you should avoid getting close enough to examine its teeth. You do not want to risk an attack by a saltwater crocodile.

, Saltwater and freshwater crocodiles have different dietary needs, partially because of their size but also because of their different habitats.Saltwater crocodiles, or “salties,” will often eat small reptiles, fish, turtles, and wading birds. However, they are also prone to eating larger prey like wild pigs, buffaloes, and livestock like cattle and horses.
Freshwater crocodiles, or “freshies,"" will eat smaller animals that are found near rivers, such as insects, fish, frogs, turtles, waterbirds and snakes. Sometimes they will also eat small animals.
A big dietary difference is the consumption of people. Saltwater crocodiles have been known to attack and eat humans, while freshwater crocodiles do not usually attack people or eat people.

, Freshwater crocodiles are often only found in northern Australia, often in lakes, swamps, billabongs, and the upstream sections of rivers. Though these crocodiles can tolerate saltwater, they are often found in freshwater areas because saltwater crocodiles are not friendly toward freshwater crocodiles.Sometimes, freshwater crocodiles are also found in saltwater areas, but this is rare.

, You can find this species in estuaries, rivers, lagoons, and swamps. They are often found in the Australian tropics and along the coastline.You may see saltwater crocodiles on beaches as well as by saltwater rivers and creeks. Many Australian beaches have advisories on saltwater crocodiles, as they can be plentiful along the coast.

, Saltwater crocodiles are more territorial and aggressive than freshwater crocodiles. Male salties in particular will maintain large territories and react with aggression if you come into their area. In contrast, freshwater crocodiles are known to be less aggressive to people and are not as territorial, though they may attack if they are provoked.You should avoid going near crocodile nests, which are usually by the banks of a river, swamp, or estuary. Female saltwater crocodiles will be very aggressive around their nests.
You should avoid swimming in the same waters as saltwater crocodiles due to their territorial nature and keep your distance if you spot a saltwater crocodile on land.
The Australian government will usually let travellers know of areas that have a high saltwater crocodile population so it is clear which areas to avoid.

, Freshwater crocodiles are not as aggressive as saltwater crocodiles but you should still be careful around them. Do not provoke them by getting too close or getting in their way.Some people actually swim in the same waters as freshwater crocodiles and are not attacked. But you should still exercise caution around freshies.
You should avoid going near freshwater crocodiles during July and August, as this is when they breed. Female freshwater crocodiles may be more aggressive and territorial during this time period.

, Freshies are a protected species in Australia and there are about 100,000 in the country. Many freshies are in danger of dying out to reduced habitat in Australia.Saltwater crocodiles are not a protected species but they have also been the victim of poaching and aggressive trapping. This is partly why male saltwater crocodiles are more aggressive in recent years as they fight over territory in the country.

Choose a large, sturdy glass tank.Your turtle will need a glass fish tank that can provide roughly 10 to 15 gallons (38 to 57 L) (38 to 57 L) of water for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) of turtle.,
Provide a lamp.,
Consider using a water heater.Use a fully submersible water heater to help maintain a consistent temperature year-round.,
Invest in a good filter.,
Look at tank covers.,
Get the tools you'll need to monitor conditions.,
Spread substrate on the bottom of the tank only if needed.,
Create a land area.,
Provide a water-to-land ramp, if necessary.,
Choose the right decorations.,
Place decorations and equipment carefully.,
Fill the tank with clean water.",How to Set Up a Turtle Tank,"


If you do not have a mature turtle, base your measurements off the average size your turtle's species reaches upon maturity.
Do not use a reptile tank designed for terrestrial (land-living) reptiles. The glass is too thin and can break due to the pressure of the water. The glass used for turtle tanks should be at least 0.4 inches (10 mm) thick.
If you have more than one turtle, size the tank according to your first turtle and add half that size to your original measurement for each additional turtle. This should give you your final tank size.
Keep in mind that the tank should be deeper than it is wide. Otherwise, your turtle may not have enough room to flip itself upright if it accidentally turns upside-down.
For most turtles, the length of the tank should be three or four times the length of the turtle and the width should be twice the length of the turtle. The height of the tank should be one and a half to two times the length of the turtle, but you should also make sure that there is a full 1 foot (30.5 cm) above the highest point the turtle can reach when placed inside the tank to prevent the turtle from climbing out.;
, You can use a lamp that hooks onto the turtle tank, or you could opt for one that stands separately but can be directed down onto the tank.


The light itself needs to shine on the portion of the tank you intend to set aside as a basking area.
Semi-aquatic turtles need full spectrum light, so you should use a lamp with both UVA and UVB bulbs. UVB light stimulates the production of vitamin D3 and maintains the natural environment, while UVA light encourage more activity and a heartier appetite. UVB bulbs should provide the main lighting.
You should also consider running the light on a timer to simulate natural light cycles. Most turtles need a natural light cycle of 12 to 14 hours, followed by 10 to 12 hours of darkness.
On a related note, you'll also need to keep the tank in a good location. You can place the tank near indirect sunlight or in shade, but do not place it in direct sunlight. Bright, full sun could end up baking and killing the turtle.

, These heaters attach to the side of the aquarium with suction cups.


You may need to hide the heater behind a wall to prevent the turtle from breaking it as it swims around.
Before installing a water heater, make sure that your turtle needs one. The preferred temperature will depend on the turtle species. A species that prefers room temperature water usually doesn't need a water heater, but those that prefer warmer temperatures might.

, Filters are vital to the health of your tank, but choosing the right kind can be difficult. Turtles produce more waste than fish, though, and without a filter, you would need to change the water daily.


Large canister filters work best.They can be expensive, but the size ensures that filter will not get clogged up easily. As a result, the tank will stay more sanitary and the turtle will remain healthier. A canister filter also minimizes the amount of cleaning you have to do. Lastly, even though the initial cost of a canister filter is higher than it is with other filter types, the long-term costs associated with water and filter changes will actually be lower.
If you use an internal filter instead of a canister filter, use the largest you can find and opt for two filters instead of one.
Even with a good filter, you will need to change the water at least once every two weeks.

, Select a heat-proof metal screen cover for the top of your tank. While not strictly essential, covers will protect your turtle from potential threats like broken lamp bulbs.


Since lamp bulbs used for turtle habitats tend to get very hot, they can easily explode if they get splashed with water, making this a very real threat.
You may also want to clamp the cover onto the top of your tank to prevent larger turtles from climbing out.
Do not use glass or plexiglass tank covers since these materials filter out the UVB rays a turtle needs for survival. Moreover, these materials are more likely to shatter or melt.

, Conditions can change slightly over time when left alone, so you will need to monitor and maintain the right conditions regularly to keep your turtle healthy.


Use thermometers to monitor the temperature of the water and the temperature of the basking/land area. Most turtles prefer water temperatures around 78 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius). Land temperatures should be between 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (27 and 29 degrees Celsius).You should also keep an eye on the humidity in your tank, so you'll need a hygrometer to do this. The right humidity level will depend on the turtle species, and you can change humidity inside the tank by adding or removing substrate from the land/basking area.

, Generally, you don't need to cover the bottom of the tank with any substrate. The only time this is a necessity is if you decide to place live plants in the tank.


Substrate can actually make the tank more difficult to clean.
If you're going to use substrate, the best choices are fine sand, gravel, and fluorite.

Sand is difficult to clean, but some turtles do enjoy digging in it.
Gravel can create a nice appearance, but you need to make sure that the gravel pieces are more than 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) in diameter; otherwise, the turtle may try eating the gravel.
Fluorite is a porous clay gravel that provides plenty of nutrients for plants. Turtles generally don't eat it, but you should still opt for larger fluorite just to be safe.



, Aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles both need a land area inside the tank. Most semi-aquatic turtles need a land area that takes up at least 50 percent of the space in the tank. Most aquatic turtles should have a land mass that takes up no more than 25 percent of the space in the tank.


Turtles use this land area to bask and dry themselves.
The diameter of the land mass should also be at least one and a half times as long as the length of the turtle.
There are plenty of different options to consider. You can buy a special turtle dock from a pet supply store, or you could use a rock or log. Floating docks are often preferable since they adjust to the water level and do not take up valuable room inside the tank.
Avoid using rocks and logs from nature since they can pose a health threat to your turtle. If you do use something from nature, boil it in a separate pot of water to kill any algae, germs, or dangerous microorganisms.
If you want to use something for a land mass that does not have a weight to anchor it, glue the land in place along the side of the tank with silicone aquarium sealant.

, Turtles need a way to climb onto the land area. Ideally, the land area itself should gently slope down into the water. If it doesn't, you will need to install a separate ramp.


The ramp itself can be fairly simple. For instance, a curves or sloping log can be attached to the land area from one side, with the other side dipping down gently into the water. A piece of thick plastic can also be used in a similar way.

, Turtles do not need many decorations to survive, but adding a few can make the tank nicer to look at and may also help your turtle feel a little more secure.


Add logs, smooth rocks, and terrestrial (land) plants to provide hiding places on the basking area. You could also use a wooden enclosure. Just make sure that the turtle still has plenty of room to spread out on the empty portion of the basking area.
Real plants work great, but note that turtles will nibble on them, so you should only choose aquatic and terrestrial plants that are non-toxic to turtles.
Decorations with sharp edges pose a threat to your turtle and should be avoided.
Store bought decorations do not need to be sterilized, but decorations picked up from nature need to be boiled separately to kill off harmful germs.
Never use a decoration with a diameter less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) since the turtle may try to eat it.
Avoid enclosure-style decorations since your turtle may get stuck while swimming under it.

, All foreign objects in the tank should be placed along the edges so that the turtle can swim freely. You can also place equipment beneath the land area to hide it.


If you want to place something in the center of the tank, opt for clumps of plants since these will not interfere with the turtle's ability to swim. Place tall or stiff decorations only in the edges.
Make sure that you do not create any enclosures or tight spots that your turtle could get stuck in as you place equipment and decorations in the tank.

, Fill the tank with enough water for the turtle to swim comfortably. Most turtles need at least 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15.25 cm) of water.


You need to make sure that the water depth is at least three-quarters the length of the turtle. This depth allows the turtle to flip itself upright if it accidentally turns upside-down in the water.
The vast majority of pet turtles are freshwater creatures, so you should provide clean water from your sink or from jugs of distilled water.

Provide the right amount of food.,
Feed an aquatic turtle in the water.",How to Know What to Feed a Turtle," Turtles have a varied diet which includes fruit and vegetables as well as meat. As a general rule a younger turtle will eat more meat, and as he gets older he will shift to eat more fruits and vegetables. Of the fruit and vegetables you provide, around 80-90% of total should be made up from vegetables and flowers, with just the remaining 10-20% coming from fruit. Generally, green and leafy things should be the largest part of his diet, while you should avoid fibre-rich vegetables such as lettuce and celery.


Good vegetable choices include kale, parsley, green beans, bell peppers, and cabbage.
Small amounts of spinach and broccoli are also good choices.
Flowers including carnations, roses and hibiscus can be added for variety.
For the fruit content use apples, bananas, pears, grapes, kiwi and melon.;
, Unlike tortoises, turtles also eat meat. This is an important part of their diet so be sure to have a regular supply of animal-based food for your turtle, including live food. The type of things you should feed your turtle includes crickets, mealworms, waxworms and other small grubs and insects.If your turtle is aquatic it will need to eat small fish such as comet goldfish, mosquito fish, or even aquatic snails.You can buy live worms and crickets from your local pet store, as well as pre-packaged dead ones.
Feeding your turtle live crickets can seem a little tricky, but it helps to replicate how a turtle would eat in the wild., An easy way to provide food for your turtle is to use specially prepared turtle pellets which you can buy in your local pet store. These will be designed to provide the range of minerals and vitamins your turtle needs.If you are trying to replicate how a turtle would feed in the wild, however, the pellets are less authentic than fresh greens and insects. If you use pellets try to make them part of a balance with fresh food. Think of pellets as forming the only the foundation of the diet., For a creature with a diet as varied as a turtle, getting a good balance of all the different dietary elements is important to maintain your turtle's health and well-being. There is no absolute fixed ration of plant-based feed to animal-based feed, and each turtle will vary, but aim to provide equal amounts of each of these main food types.


Using supplements can help to ensure your turtle gets all the necessary vitamins and minerals. Consider dusting food with calcium and vitamin supplements before offering it to your turtle.Add the calcium supplement to his food twice a week.If you are unsure about the right balance for your turtle speak to your vet.

, As well as feeding your turtle you need to ensure that he has constant access to a water source for drinking. Ensure there is always fresh water in a bowl that the turtle can easily access and not easily knock over. Take care to make sure that the water stays clean and replace it if gets contaminated.

, Juvenile turtles need lots of food, and need to be fed more often than mature turtles. Feed juvenile turtles every day. Turtles are generally considered juvenile until they reach around seven years of age. You may find that his appetite will change before he reaches this age, and he eats less. In this case you can switch to feeding him less frequently, but be sure to check with your vet first to see if there is any other reason for his diminished appetite.

, Once your turtle becomes more mature his eating habits will change and you should not feed him every day. Appetite will vary from turtle to turtle but as a general rule you should feed an adult turtle every second day, or four to five times a week.You may find that your turtle is frequently begging for food. They will do this whether or not you feed them, so you should be sure to stick to a good feeding programme., No two turtles will eat exactly the same amount of food, so recommendations on the amount to provide have to be generalised. There are, however, some good guidelines to keep in mind. Smaller turtles will eat less than larger ones, and this is reflected in the idea that you should feed your turtle about as much food as would fit in his head and neck.This is quite imprecise, but can be a useful reference point.


Another way to judge the amount of food to provide, is to offer all he can eat in a set time. The recommended times vary from 5 to 15 minutes.
Try feeding him until there is a noticeable falling-off of appetite and then removing any non-live food.Removing excess food will help avoid over eating, and prevent decomposing leftovers which can impact on the water purity for an aquatic turtle., Aquatic turtles are a little different to ordinary land turtles, as they feed in the water. It is essential for an aquatic turtle to feed in the water. This can lead to problems if leftover food decays in the water. Because of this, some people recommend having a separate tank for feeding which can be cleaned more easily after mealtimes.If you don't do this be sure to pick out any leftovers and keep the water quality high.


Feeding an aquatic turtle small live fish can help stimulate him and give him some exercise.Using vegetables that float is preferable to those that sink for an aquatic turtle.
If you dust your food with a vitamin supplement, be aware that this can rub off in the water. Using pellets can be a way to tackle this."

Check the temperature.,
Provide more light.,
Check for signs of sickness.,
Determine if your turtle is hibernating.",How to Feed Your Turtle if It is Refusing to Eat1," Turtles are cold blooded reptiles and will not eat if the temperature is too cold.If you have an indoor box turtle, provide a warm area and a cool area. The cool area should be between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit and the warm area should be 85 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. At night, the temperature can drop to between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.For aquatic turtles, the water temperature should be about 78 degrees Fahrenheit. The basking area should be between 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
If your box turtle lives outside, the turtle will become too cold if the outside temperature drops below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. You may need to add a ceramic heater to your turtle's environment to get it to reach an adequate temperature.
Check the temperature of your turtle environment using a thermometer and make adjustments if necessary.;
, Your turtle also needs adequate light to have a healthy appetite. Aquatic turtles need both UVA and UVB light in their tank. Provide your turtle with 12 to 14 hours of light followed by 10 to 12 hours of darkness.Box turtles need light for at least 12 hours every day. This can be direct sunlight or a combination of a UVB bulb and an incandescent bulb.If your turtle is getting less than 12 hours of a light a day, it will probably stop eating.
If you have an outside box turtle, you will need to adjust the light source with the seasons. For example, you may use more artificial lighting in the fall and winter as the days are shorter and nay not need any artificial lighting in the summer.

, If your turtle is not eating and you have checked the environment, your turtle may be suffering from an illness such as vitamin A deficiency,,constipation, respiratory infection, eye problems, or pregnancy.If your turtle is not eating, look for other symptoms to decide if your turtle is sick and needs to see a veterinarian.


If your turtle has white, patchy discoloration on its shell and refuses to eat, your turtle may be suffering from vitamin A deficiency.Vitamin A deficiency is linked to respiratory infections in turtles as well.Other symptoms of a respiratory infection include wheezing, trouble breathing, sneezing, runny nose, swollen eyes, and a lack of energy.
If your turtle has stopped eating and stopped going to the bathroom, your turtle may be constipated.
If your turtle is having eye problems and cannot see, your turtle will not eat. Check your turtle's eyes to ensure that they are clear, free of debris, and shiny.

, Asian, European, and North American turtles may hibernate for the winter season. Even if your turtle has the proper environment and plenty of food, it still may choose to hibernate. If you have checked your turtle's habitat and physical health and it still won't eat, take your turtle to the veterinarian to see if your turtle may be trying to hibernate.Hibernation puts stress on the body. Only healthy turtles should be allowed to hibernate.
If your veterinarian says that it is okay for your turtle to hibernate, begin to reduce the temperature in its habitat by 2 or 3 degrees each day. This will help slow your turtle's metabolism down.
Do not let the temperature drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Begin to increase the temperature by a few degrees each day after 10 weeks.
Continue to feed your turtle until it stops eating completely.

Give your turtle live food.,
Combine pellets with other foods.,
Provide brightly colored food.,
Switch up the diet.,
Feed your turtle early in the morning.,
Take your turtle to the veterinarian.",How to Feed Your Turtle if It is Refusing to Eat2," Your turtle is attracted to movement and may prefer to eat live food such as crickets, mealworms, waxworms, earthworms, snails, slugs, or small pinky mice.Live food also has a strong odor that is attractive to your turtle.Be careful with digging up earthworms and giving them to your turtle. If the lawn has been treated with chemicals, do not give the earthworms to your turtle. It is best to buy earthworms from a bait store.
Your turtle may also enjoy eating grubs, beetles, pill bugs, crayfish, flies, grasshoppers, bloodworms, and spiders.

, Pellets or dry turtle food are a staple of many turtle's diet. Crush the pellets and mix them with some live food to get your turtle to eat. You can also soak the pellets in canned tuna water to give the pellets a stronger, more enticing smell.You can also soak the pellets in fruit juice or a non-caffeinated sport's drink to encourage your turtle to eat.
If you have a box turtle, try placing this food in water as your turtle may prefer to eat under water instead of on land., Your turtle is attracted to brightly colored food. Offer your turtle strawberries, tomatoes, papaya, mango, watermelon, rose petals, or other brightly colored vegetables and fruits. Fruit should not be a staple in the diet of your turtle, but can be used to get your turtle to begin eating.


You can combine brightly colored food with live food to get even better results. The bright color and strong odor may be doubly attractive.
Vegetables are more important for your turtle than fruit. Try soaking the vegetables in tuna water to get your turtle to eat them.

, Your turtle may not be eating simply because it does not like the food that you have been offering. For example, you may finely chop vegetables and pellets and dip them in bloodworm juice one day and then provide mangoes and pellets in tuna water the next day. Your turtle has preferences that you must learn.


It may be helpful to keep a diary of feedings and how your turtle responds. This will help you learn what your turtle likes.
You can also try giving your turtle food on land and in the water to see if that affects how your turtle eats.

, Turtles tend to be active early in the morning and prefer to eat then. Many turtles will refuse to eat if given food at other times of the day.Try giving your turtle food at 4:30 am or 5:30 am or as close to dawn as possible.


In addition to the time of day, you may have to adjust your feeding time based in the season. For example, if you have an outdoor turtle, it may be too cold to eat at dawn during the winter. You may want to give your turtle food a little later in the day in that season.
Box turtles also like to eat on rainy mornings because this is when earthworms and slugs are easily found., If your turtle is not responding to any of he food you offer and the environmental changes, see your veterinarian. Not only could your turtle be fighting an illness, but its health is also at risk when it refuses to eat. Receiving a professional analysis increases the chances of discovering the problem, and a quicker solution eliminates the possibility of your turtle's condition worsening.


A herp veterinarian is best equipped to treat your turtle. These veterinarians have received additional training about reptile medicine.If you cannot find a herp veterinarian, contact your local zoo, humane society, or universities (e.g. department of veterinary medicine, animal health science, etc.)."

Feed your turtle a balanced diet.,
Supplement diet with calcium.,
Know which foods to avoid.",How to Feed Your Turtle if It is Refusing to Eat3," Your turtle should eat a balanced diet comprised of fruits, vegetables, and meat. If your turtle is aquatic, its diet should be 65% to 90% meat (e.g. earthworms, snails, mollusks, frozen pinkie mice, dried turtle food/pellets) and 10% to 35% vegetable based (e.g. mustard or collard greens, grated carrots, grapes, mango, cantaloupe). If you have a box turtle, its diet should be 50% meat (crickets, mottled mealworms, slugs, snails) and 50% vegetable based (e.g. berries, green beans, winter squash, flower heads).


Young turtles need more meat than more mature turtles.These are general rules for turtles, but the diet will vary depending upon the species of your turtle.
Always feed your turtle fresh foods.

, Your turtle should get all the vitamins and nutrients it needs if you provide a well rounded diet. However, most turtles will benefit from calcium supplements. You can supplement calcium by giving your turtle calcium blocks, cuttle fish bone,or powder.Give your turtle supplements once a week.Place the calcium blocks or cuttle fish bone in your turtle's habitat for you turtles to gnaw on them.
You can also coat your turtle's food with calcium powder before you give it to them.
You can also give your turtle a reptile or turtle multivitamin twice a week.

, Your turtle will thrive if given a variety of foods in moderation. However, there are some foods that you should never give your turtle. Avoid the following foods:All milk products (e.g. cheese, yogurt)
Candy, chocolate, bread, refined sugar and flour
Canned and processed foods high in salt and preservatives
Anything in the onions and garlic family
Rhubarb
Avocado
All fruit seeds

Ask them!,
Observe them!,
Spend time with them!",How to Tell the Difference Between Twins," Odds are you are not the only one who can't tell the two apart. They have probably gotten a version of that question (how to tell them a part) hundreds if not thousands of times in their life.


As long as you maintain basic social standards like being considerate, genuine, and generally easy-going, they should be more than happy to help! If you can't think of how to ask try something like, ""How can I tell you two apart?"" ""Can you help me tell y'all apart?"" or, if you're just talking to one of them, ""What makes you different?"" If you want to get to something beyond looks ask, ""What really makes you different; as in personalities, likes, dislikes, etc?"" It will work every time; the key is to be direct!;
, No, not in a creepy stalker-like way. If you really want to tell them apart and will not or have not asked them yet pay extra attention to one or both of them. You have to think of them as individuals for this to work. This means knowing their unique names and how to pronounce them.


Ask someone around you who one of them is which and try to identify distinctive characteristics about that individual that you could try to pick out when you look at them together.
Luckily for you, even identical twins are not completely identical! Look for things like hair color, eye color/shape, skin complexion, glasses, freckles/birthmarks/scars, the shape of their faces/parts of their faces, facets of their personalities, their voices, hobbies/skills, or even mannerisms. It may be super subtle to where you have to practice getting it right before you can do it like a pro, but if you work at it and spend time with them, you will get it down. Just be subtle.

, Honestly this is the best way to get to know their differences. To get to know them on an individual basis is the singular most important thing you can do to make them feel valued. Then you'll learn to tell them apart. Even if it's a only few minutes of casual conversation, it will help you identify distinctive memories and characteristics with each one. Who knows, you could end up with two very close and very unique friends!

Pick a protein and vegetable based food.,
Feed adult turtles.,
Understand that a turtle's shell and bones get stronger when given calcium, just like a human's teeth and bones.,
Give turtles live fish and/or shrimp.,
Make sure to buy food in bulk.",How to Feed a Red Eared Slider Turtle," Check that the food has about 75% protein and 25% vegetables for hatchlings, and that it is 25% protein and 75% vegetable content for adults. Hatchlings (or baby turtles) are about 85% carnivorous. But as they get older, they are more herbivorous.
, They should get dark leafy greens or carrots every day. Hatchlings should only get vegetables 1 time a week., However, turtles cannot have milk.

So how do they get the calcium? A calcium turtle bone (which is easily found at a local pet store), or save the eggshells the next time you make eggs. Then dry the eggs in an oven for about 30 minutes or less at 360 degrees Fahrenheit, or 182 degrees Celsius. Then take them out, grind them in a blender, and feed them to your turtle in their feeding bowl.

, It is very important to give it to them. Go to your local pet store and get fish. Add 1 fish to your turtle's tank every day. Just 1 will be okay for an adult turtles. Remove any dead fish from the tank after your turtle has finished eating.

You may hear that goldfish are fine, but they can only survive in 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. However, turtles need 79-82 degrees to survive.

, And put the sticks in a dry area, such as a basking spot, to prevent and clouding of the water."

Create a food-friendly environment.,
Decide how much to feed your turtle.,
Give the turtle food.,
Deal with eating problems.,
Transition to new food types and portions.,
Monitor your turtle's health.,
Make food decisions for long-term health.,
Look into supplements.",How to Feed a Baby Turtle," Depending on the type of turtle, its eating habits will vary. Turtles are generally omnivorous, meaning their diet consists of both plants and animals, but some turtles' eating habits change over time.


Many types of turtles change their diet as they grow. A variety of breeds, such as red-eared sliders and green sea turtles, start off as mostly carnivores and transition to more plant-based diets as they mature.Other types of turtles remain strictly carnivores or strictly omnivores their whole life. Snapping turtles, for example, will always need a primarily carnivorous diet while loggerhead turtles will always need a combination of meat and plants.Figure out what kind of turtle you have. This may be quite obvious if, for example, you hatched the turtles yourself. If you bought it at a pet store, however, the species might not have been specified. Take your baby turtle to a vet with experience handling turtles to help with the identification process.;
, A high-quality turtle pebble can be the base of a healthy diet. But other foods might also be options, depending on your turtle's specific needs. If so, be sure to expose your turtle to these other food sources. A diverse diet is important for turtles and their varied nutritional needs.


Purina produces a type of turtle pellet through their Mazuri branch with different lines for specific types of turtle and their unique dietary needs. Rep-Cal also provides a range of pellet types catering to carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. Other pellet brands include ReptoMin, ZooMed, Pretty Pets, and Wardley's Reptile Pellets. You can find pellets at pet stores or order them online.If your turtle is a herbivore or omnivore, you should provide a variety of fruits and veggies in addition to pellets. Lettuce, kale, carrots, melon, and strawberries are all turtle friendly foods.Consider aquatic plants that would be part of a turtle's regular diet, including duckweed, water lettuce, and water hyacinth.If your turtle needs a meat-based diet, you can feed it mealworms, earthworms, crayfish, minnows, snails, slugs, and wax worms. These can be purchased at pet shops that sell turtles and other reptiles. Do not try to find worms yourself or go to a tackle shop for supplies. You want to verify that the worms are safe for turtle consumption., Turtles need to feel comfortable to eat. In order to make sure your turtle will eat in its tank, create a food-friendly environment. To keep a clean home for your turtle you will typically want to feed it in a separate cage. This is not as imperative for baby turtles. Although it is not ideal, you might want to consider feeding a baby turtle in its regular cage if it will not eat otherwise. In that case, however, you will need to clean its tank more frequently.Much like type of food, how you set food up in a cage is breed specific. Research how your turtle eats in their natural habitat and try to mimic this in the cage. For example, if your turtle is a carnivore it might prefer to catch prey itself, so releasing minnows in a small pool of water might be ideal.Is your turtle a freshwater turtle or a land turtle? Freshwater turtles prefer to be submerged in water when they eat, so have a small pool of water in the tank where you feed it.The depth of water should be very shallow for baby turtles to prevent drowning. Keep the depth under two inches.If you are feeding your turtle insects, place the insects on land. If the insects make it into the water, they can increase the level of ammonia in the water. This would be bad for your turtle's skin and shell.Fresh foods will spoil. Place all fresh food in a separate dish, so that it will not contaminate other food items. After fresh food has been out for several hours, throw it away., How much and how often to feed baby turtles is contested by turtle owners and experts. However, it is generally recommended that baby turtles be fed often -- typically once a day -- because they are growing and need the extra vitamins and minerals.Baby turtles should be fed every day. Afternoons and mornings are ideal feeding times; they are typically most active then and will be more likely to eat the food provided.While people generally agree that babies should be fed each day, how much food they need is debated. Some people advise feeding babies as much as they will eat while others recommend limiting feeding times to a 15 to 20 minute time period. Talk to your vet about your turtle and ask her for advice on feeding., Refrain from feeding your turtle by hand. If you do, it will associate food with your hands and might become inclined to bite.When dealing with baby turtles, special considerations need to be taken in terms of preparing food.


Turtle pellets should be broken into fourths as a baby turtle's mouth is smaller and you don't want it to choke.
Any fruits bigger than a blueberry should be mashed or cut up to prevent choking.
Vitamin and calcium supplements are sometimes recommended for young turtles to make sure they're getting adequate nutrition. If you opt to give your turtle supplements, you should do so about three times a week., Baby turtles are sometimes hesitant to eat, especially when first introduced to a tank. This is normal, but should be rectified. There are several approaches to deal with this sort of situation.


Check the water temperature. Turtles will sometimes refrain from eating if the water is too cold or warm. Correct water temperature depends on breed, but generally it is approximately 84 degrees Fahrenheit.Sometimes, movement can encourage eating. If your baby turtles are disinterested in pellets, live crickets or mealworms might stimulate their appetite.If the problem persists for more than a few days, seek veterinary care to rule out any health problems.

, Turtles can have a lengthy lifespan, meaning they are long-term pets. You need to be prepared to care for your turtle well past babyhood. Remember, food types and amounts change with age.


Turtles are not considered adults until they are at least 7 years old. However, after three years their appetite should taper off naturally. When you notice your turtle eating less, it may be a sign that it is ready to transition to a new diet. Talk to your vet first, however, when you begin changing feeding frequency. You want to rule out any health problems and also get professional advice about food types and portions.Adult turtles only need to be fed every other day, and some breeds only need food every third day. Adult turtles may have different dietary needs depending on breed. Determine whether you need to transition to a meat or plant based diet as your turtle ages., Changes in eating habits can signify health problems. If your turtle stops eating, keep an eye out for other common turtle problems.


Watch for shell problems. A turtle's shell is an indicator of health and wellness. Changes to the shell can indicate poor nutrition, especially, though not exclusively, too little calcium in its diet. If you notice deformities, such as cone-shaped lumps or a flaky, rotting shell your turtle might not be getting the appropriate nutrition. Talk to your vet immediately.Be on the watch for parasites. While rare, turtle food and pellets can be contaminated with certain parasites. Change in a turtle's appetite, energy, and weight might indicate a parasite.Respiratory infections can be caused by a vitamin A deficiency. A runny nose or drooping eyelids can indicate a deficiency. Serious infections are marked by mouth-breathing, mucus in the mouth, or wheezing., Your turtle could live for a very long time if cared for properly. Begin considering long-term health at an early age. Many health issues can be caused by an improper diet, so you should make decisions about feeding your turtle with an eye on its long-term well-being.


Buy pellets from reputable companies and avoid off-brand, cheap pellets. Look into pellet reviews online and discuss with your vet to keep up-to-date on any recalls on turtle food.
Make sure any produce you feed your turtle is fresh. Also, wash it before feeding your turtle. Remember, any pesticides or bacteria harmful to humans can also be harmful to your turtle. Prepare any produce that you feed your turtle as you would prepare it for yourself.

, Because vitamin deficiencies are responsible for many turtle health problems, talk to your veterinarian about health supplements to ensure that your turtle is getting the nutrients it needs. Calcium is a particularly important nutrient for turtles. Calcium supplements for turtles can be purchased at a pet store. Dust calcium over the food up two or three times per week."

If you think your friend won’t care either way, you can simply write your letter on some lined paper.


A lot of craft stores, department stores, and dollar stores carry different types of stationery. You can even find sets with matching envelopes.;
, What you use will depend on your friend’s tastes, and your own. A solid choice is a nice-quality blue- or black-ink pen that rolls smoothly across the page.


If your friend loves colors and designs, you might consider using a brightly colored pen. You might even consider using a few different colors — for example, you could switch the color every few lines so that your words flow in all the colors of the rainbow.
If you want to make the letter seem old-fashioned, you could use a fountain pen and write in a fancier way than you normally do., Make sure you have an envelope that will fit your letter and anything else you may be sending. If you’re sending anything other than paper, you might consider using a padded envelope.

, You can purchase rolls of stamps at most shops (grocery stores, drugstores, the post office). If you don’t send enough letters to buy a whole roll of stamps, you can purchase single stamps at the post office.


To find out how much it costs to send letters within your country, do a search online for “postage cost letter”.
If you are sending anything larger than a regular thin letter (a few pieces of paper), or you are sending something to an address outside of your country, go to the post office and have them weigh your letter to ensure that you have sufficient postage.

, A letter is often enough of a gift in itself, but if you’re travelling or living in another country, you might want to send something small home for your friend — for example, a chocolate bar, keychain, or some photographs.


If you do include a gift in your letter, be sure to check the customs and postage laws of the country to which you’re sending the letter to ensure that you're not breaking any rules. You can do this online or by asking at the post office.

, To make your letter look extra fancy, you can close it with some sealing wax and a stamp. You can purchase the metal stamps (called seals) and sealing wax in a variety of styles at craft stores and stationery shops.


Seals come in a variety of letters, shapes, and sizes. You could choose a seal with your initial on it, or a star or a heart, for example.
Even if you’re using a wax seal, still seal the envelope using the regular method (licking or adhesive) just to make extra sure that it won’t open up while it’s in transit.

, Are you writing just to update a friend about how life has been? Are you writing to apologize for a mistake you’ve made?


Knowing the purpose of your letter before you write it will help you choose your words and structure so that your letter is as effective as possible.

, Does your friend enjoy reading? Are you two quite talkative when you’re together, or is your friend more on the quiet side? Think about whether your friend would enjoy a long letter or a short one, and then measure your word length accordingly.


As an example, a friend who loves to hear details and doesn't mind wordiness might be excited to hear a detailed description of the party you went to on Saturday night.
A friend less keen on details, however, might be happy enough to hear about the general nature of the party, including who was there and any outstanding details that you know will pique his/her interests.

, It may be tempting to be more formal when writing a letter, and this might even be funny if you think your friend will join in on the game. In general, however, you should write in a conversational manner using your own voice.


You are engaging in a conversation with your friend — it’s just via a different medium than you may be used to (i.e. writing as opposed to speaking out loud). Try to maintain a conversational tone.
To know whether you’re using your conversational voice, try reading your letter out loud before finalizing it. If anything sounds weird as you say it out loud, change it.

, Most letters begin with “Dear ”, or some variation on that. If you want to be funny or old-fashioned, you might write “My dearest ”.


To be more casual, you could simply write, “Hello!” or your friend’s name followed by an exclamation point (“Chris!”). The latter will express your excitement in writing to your friend.

, After the greeting, don’t just jump right into talking about yourself. Briefly acknowledge your friend before moving into your main purpose of writing.


One way to acknowledge your friend is to say something like, “I hope this message finds you well,” or “How are you?”

, Exactly what you talk about will depend on the nature of the letter. Perhaps you’re writing from overseas to share details of your holiday; maybe you’re sharing details of your day-to-day life at home; or maybe you’ve had an argument and are seeking a resolution.


An example of how to start a letter from home: “Dear Chris, I hope this message finds you well. Things have been good here and although I haven’t anything very exciting to report, I figured I’d send you something anyway since it's been a while. I sure miss you. I was watching American Idol the other day (the auditions, our favourite part) and this guy sang ‘I will always love you’ and it was so terrible. You would have loved it. Maybe you even saw it!? …”
If the letter is regarding a dispute, you may not end up talking about yourself right away. The order of your thoughts might be something like, “Dear Chris, I hope this message finds you well. I’ve been thinking a lot since reading your last letter. Before I respond to your concerns, I want you to know how important you are to me, and how thankful I am that we are trying to work through this. …”

, This is particularly important if you’re trying to resolve a dispute with a friend. Remember that tone of voice, though obvious when spoken out loud, doesn’t clearly translate to written words.


Make sure that your tone is as clear as possible by carefully choosing the words you use and avoiding sarcasm.
Do: “I’m grateful that we’re communicating again. I’ve missed you.”
Don’t: “What a bummer that we’re talking again. I haven’t missed you at all!” (Unless you’re sure your friend will get your sarcasm, avoid it.)

, Once you’ve talked about yourself and/or your feelings for a while, switch your focus to your friend. Follow up on things that your friend has told you, and ask for new information.


Example: “Last time you wrote you said you’d gone to the doctor with stomach problems. Did you hear back from the doctor yet? Are you feeling any better? I hope you are.”
Example: “Well that was a lot about me. What’s new with you? Are you still enjoying work? Any new gossip?”

, If you and your friend are writing long letters to each other, it’s possible that you’ll forget some of the things you’ve talked about. If you’re responding to specific things that your friend wrote in his/her letter, consider quoting from it and responding underneath.


As an example, you might tell them, “I’m going to note parts of your letter and then respond to them. The stuff in quotation marks is you!” and then write something like “Re: ‘I hate the new character in XYZ TV show. So boring!’ I know!!!! He’s the worst. What’s up with that catch phrase? They couldn't come up with anything better??”

, Don’t end your letter abruptly once you've written everything you want to write. Wind it down with a sentence or two. How you close it will depend on the nature of the letter.


Example (if you’re on holiday): “It’s been a lot of fun but it’d be even more fun if you were here. I’m looking forward to seeing you once I get home!”
Example (if it’s a dispute): “I know we’re in a tough patch now but I want you to know that I care about you and am grateful that we’re working through this.”

, After your closing sentence(s), add a sign-off followed by a comma. There are myriad sign-offs with which you can close a letter: Sincerely, Yours truly, With love, Love and hugs, Miss you, Kisses, and All of my love are some examples.If you want to get more clever and funny, you might sign off with a prepositional phrase or by renaming yourself: “With respect and good wishes” (prepositional) or “Your insane but loving friend” (renaming yourself)., Beneath your sign-off, sign your name. You can print it out or use your signature, either is fine.


Example: Sincerely, Pat Smith.

, If you want to make your letter look a bit more formal, give it a traditional format. Various formats exist, but here’s a common one:


Place the date at the top right-hand corner of the page, then your friend’s name and address a few spaces down on the left side of the page before moving on to your greeting (e.g., “Dear Chris”) and the body of your letter.
Once the letter is finished, sign it with your closing words (e.g., Sincerely, Yours Truly, With Love) on the left-hand side of the page, followed by your handwritten name just below it, on the same side of the page.

, If you intend to write your letter on expensive stationery, write a draft of it on your computer or on some inexpensive lined paper beforehand. The goal is to have a final draft that is free of mistakes or any signs of mistakes (such as correction fluid or eraser marks).


Once you’re happy with your draft, then you can copy it on to the fancy stationery (or new lined paper, if that's what you're using).
Writing a practise letter will also help you judge how much stationery you’ll need and ensure that you don’t run out of pages or space mid-letter.
If you're only writing your letter on lined paper, this step isn’t totally necessary, although it’s still useful since it’ll help keep your final version looking clean and polished.

, Once you’ve finished writing your letter, take a break from it for at least a couple of hours. This is particularly important if you’re writing a letter to try to resolve a dispute with a friend, as it will give you time to cool off and avoid saying anything you regret.

, After taking a break, return to your letter with fresh eyes and check it for any grammatical or spelling errors. If you’re short on time, you might start by typing the letter out into a text document and then running a spellcheck on it.


You’ll also want to check your letter to ensure that everything you say makes sense. Remember that your tone of voice can be difficult to translate via writing, so be careful that what you say is clear and cannot be misread.
Spellcheck programs are notoriously inaccurate, but if you have no time to properly edit your letter, a spellcheck will at least draw your eyes to any obvious mistakes you may have missed.

, Once you’ve finalized what you want to say and are sure that there are no grammatical or spelling errors in it, write the final copy of your letter. Go slowly to ensure that you faithfully copy your draft without making any errors.


If you’re using fancy stationery, now’s the time to use it!

, If you’re feeling particularly creative and/or you think your friend might like it, add some drawings or stickers to your letter.

, Most envelopes have an adhesive strip along their flap. Some of these strips are self-adhesive (i.e. already sticky), while others may require you to lick them.


To seal the envelope, ensure that the adhesive stick is sticky (either by licking it, gluing it or pulling the cover off of it if it’s self-adhesive) and then close the flap.
Place the envelope on a hard surface and run your fingers along the flap to ensure that the envelope is fully sealed and that there are no bubbles or gaps between the flap and the rest of the envelope.

, It should include your friend’s first and last name, the house number and street, the suite number (if it’s an apartment), the city, the state, and the zip code (known as the postal code in some other countries).


Check in your address book or wherever you’ve written down your friend’s address to ensure that you’ve copied the address on to the envelope correctly.
If your friend is living in another country, be sure to include the name of the country in the address.
Example: Chris Smith, 5555 N Genesee Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046 (add USA here if you’re writing from a different country)

, Format your address the same as you formatted your friend’s: first and last name, house number and street name, city, state, and zip/postal code.


Just to be extra clear, you can write To: and From: in front of yours and your friend’s names. For example: To: Chris Smith, 5555 N Genesee Ave etc., From: Pat Smith, 555 Ocean Ave., Amityville, NY 11701.

, If you’re just sending a standard-sized letter within the same country, you’ll likely only need one stamp.If you’re including anything else in the letter or it’s extra thick, go to the post office and have it weighed before sending it.
If you don't have sufficient postage, your letter will either be returned to you or worse, your friend will have to pay your postage fees when they receive your letter., Once you know how much postage is required, stick the necessary stamp (or stamps) on to the top right-hand corner of the envelope.

, In the U.S. you can post a letter by placing it in your mail box and putting the red flag up to let your mail person know that you’d like to send a letter. You can also drop your letter off at the post office, drop it into a blue collection box, or schedule a pickup.Not all countries have at-home pickup services. In many countries you will need to drop your letter off at the post office or into a collection box. To find out what options are available to you, do an online search of your country’s name plus “send mail post office”.

, How long it takes for your friend to receive the letter will depend on where they live and the class of your letter. A first-class letter will arrive more quickly than a second-class one.


It costs more to send a first-class letter than it does to send a second-class one, but sometimes it’s only a small difference, so it’s definitely worth asking!
USPS (United States Postal Service) lists the average time to deliver a first-class standard letter as 1 to 3 business days. First-class is very affordable for a standard letter (starting at $0.49 in 2015), and it does not appear that USPS offers a second-class method for letters.Costs and delivery times will vary depending on where you live, where you’re sending the letter, and how much the letter weighs, but an average cost would be between $1.20 and $3.50 USD."

Apologize sooner rather than later.,
Start with ""I'm sorry."",
Admit your mistake.,
Be sincere.,
Show your remorse.",How to Tell Your Best Friend You Are Sorry1," If you wait too long, your opportunity to help mend things will pass. That is, your friend may get angrier the longer you wait to apologize. It's hard to swallow your pride, but it's important to put your relationship first. That means apologizing as soon as you can.The longer you wait to apologize, the guiltier you'll feel, and it's not good for your own mental health to wait that long.
Of course, you do want to wait until you can be sincere. If you can't offer a sincere apology, it's not going to mean much.;
, Saying ""I'm sorry"" is both the easiest and hardest part of apologizing. It's just one little sentence, but it can be hard to get out. It's the best way to start an apology, though, because it establishes upfront that you want to make amends.Of course, you don't need to use that exact phrasing. You could also say, ""I apologize,"" or, "" I am sincerely sorry.""

, You also need to admit to what you actually did wrong. It's not enough to just say ""I'm sorry."" You also have to say what you're sorry for, as that shows you are accepting responsibility for exactly what you did, not making some blanket statement to try to make things better.For example, you could say, ""I'm sorry that I wasn't at your graduation.""
Alternatively, you could say, ""I apologize for talking about you behind your back.""

, Your best friend knows you well and is going to be able to tell whether you are being sincere or not. You really need to own your apology for it to mean something. Plus, your friend is more likely to accept your apology if you are sincere.One part of owning your apology is making sure you don't try to explain away your behavior. If you try to offer excuses, that takes away from the sincerity of your apology. Saying ""I'm sorry, but..."" can negate the power of your apology.

Avoid being defensive. When you're making an apology, it can be easy to slip into defensiveness. After all, if you've fought with your best friend, it's likely you're both to blame in the situation; however, when you're apologizing, you're taking blame, so you can't be defensive at the same time.

, Showing remorse is acknowledging that you caused the other person harm, in your words and body language, such as ""I know you expected me to be at your graduation. I imagine you're feeling very hurt that I wasn't there for you at this big moment in your life."" Another option is, ""It was a horrible thing for me to do, to talk about your private life to other people, and I should know better. I know you must be very upset and hurt.""This is your best friend, so make sure he knows how much his friendship means to you. Try something like, ""You are my closest friend, and your friendship is incredibly important to me.""

Ask the caller to stop calling you so frequently.,
Tell the caller how you are being affected by their frequent calling.,
Set boundaries for calls.,
Stick to your boundaries.Only deviate from your set boundaries in cases of emergency, such as when the person’s car breaks down and they are stranded on the highway or if there is a medical emergency with them or someone they are close to.,
Set a schedule.",How to Tell Somebody to Not Call You Every Day1," It’s possible that the caller is unaware that they are bothering you by calling you every day or multiple times a day. Tell them honestly that you would prefer they don’t call you so often. If this is someone you would like to continue to talk to, just not so frequently, be prepared to reassure the person that you still like them and would like to talk to them regularly.


You could say, “Susie, I really value your friendship, but you’re calling me way too frequently. It’s not that I don’t enjoy talking to you. I just have a lot of other things going on and don’t have time to talk to you every day.”;
, Depending on the frequency and timing of the calls, you may be experiencing an increase in stress, a loss of focus, or even poor sleeping patterns. All of these things can have a negative impact on your life. Express this to the caller without judgement or blame. They may be unaware of the impact their constant calling is having on you and hearing your perspective can help clear things up.

, Establish healthy boundaries with clear communication.Tell the caller that you care about them and enjoy talking to them, but too many frequent calls cut into other demands on your schedule, such as time at work and with family and other friends. Be clear about how many calls per day or week you find acceptable and what times should be off-limit.


You may decide, for example, that you cannot answer calls during your work shift or after your bedtime. Tell the caller, “If you call me while I’m at work, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., I will not be able to answer the phone. I go to bed at 10 p.m., so please do not call me past that time unless it’s a life-or-death emergency.”
Stick to the boundaries that you set. If you constantly make exceptions to the rules you’ve set, the caller will quickly learn that the boundaries are meaningless and will not respect your rules., If the person continues to call for non-emergency situations, simply answer the phone and promptly say, “I’m at work right now and can’t talk on the phone. I will call you back once I get home around 6 p.m.” and then hang up.


Don’t tell someone you will call them back if you have no intention of calling them back. This will only create heightened anticipation and anxiety at not hearing from you. Such anxiety may actually increase the amount that the person calls.

, Schedule a regular time that works best for both of you to have a check-in call. This may be once a week or multiple times a week depending on what works best for your situation. Even though this may seem too formal, having a set schedule can relieve a lot of anxiety for someone who is clingy, insecure, or worried about you.Furthermore, it will let the person know that you are willing to make time for them because you value your relationship with them, while also making it clear that there is a limit to the amount of time you can give them.

Give your friend a chance to vent.,
Don't expect an apology.,
Ask for forgiveness.,
Don't be afraid to let it go.",How to Tell Your Best Friend You Are Sorry2," If your friend wants to stop your apology and vent her emotions, you should let her. Part of the apology is hearing why your friend is upset, if you haven't already, so that you can both work together to do better in the future. That means listening when your friend expresses her emotions to you, even if it's in the middle of your apology.To show you are listening, nod along with what the person is saying. Once your friend is finished, you can offer a summary to show you heard her, such as ""What I hear you saying is you're the most upset about the fact that I left you to fend for yourself in an unfamiliar place.""

, When you apologize to someone, it must come with no strings attached. That means you shouldn't expect an apology, even if you think you deserve one, and you certainly shouldn't ask for one. That turns your apology into something where you expect reciprocation. Of course, you'd like the other person to apologize if they've done something wrong, but that shouldn't affect how you apologize to them.That doesn't mean you should let your friend trample on you all the time, just that an apology should be given without expectations. If your friend routinely hurts you without apologizing, he is not a very good friend, and you may want to consider ending the relationship.

, Even if your friend doesn't offer an apology, it is acceptable to ask for forgiveness. Asking for forgiveness actually helps your friend, too, as it is a way to release anger and mend the friendship; therefore, it's an important step in an apology.For example, you could use a simple, ""Will you forgive me for my mistake?""
You could also give the person some time with, ""I know I made a big mistake, and it may take you some time to forgive me. I understand if you need space, but I hope you can forgive me eventually.""

, Once you've apologized for your mistake and been forgiven, it's time to let it go. Trying to make up for the mistake is also appropriate, but the point is, you don't need to hold on to your guilt forever. Doing so will only hurt you and your friend, as it can put a burden on your relationship."
"
Ask what you can do to make it up to your friend.,
Offer a solution.,
Make a plan for the future.",How to Tell Your Best Friend You Are Sorry3," One way to make amends is to simply ask how you can make it better. Of course, you can't fix a grievous mistake and completely reverse it; however, you may be able to do something to make it better, and the best way to figure out what is to defer to your friend.For instance, you could say, ""I know I can't take back what I did, but is there any way I can make it up to you?""

, If your friend doesn't have a suggestion, you can offer your own solution. That solution can be a grand gesture to show you care, or it can be you making sure you show up in the ways you need for your friend.


For example, maybe you could send your friend flowers or a graduation gift if you missed her graduation.

, One way you can make amends is to talk about how you can do things differently in the future. That way, your friend can feel reassured that the same situation won't occur again, and he will be more likely to accept your apology.For example, you could say, ""The next time we go out together, we can talk about what to do ahead of time. That way, I won't disappoint you by leaving you alone for too long.""

Send their calls to voicemail.,
Tell the person you will not answer their phone calls.,
Block the caller’s number from your phone.",How to Tell Somebody to Not Call You Every Day2," If after taking the above steps you don’t see improvements in the frequency of this person’s calls or if they ignore your request to respect your boundaries, then simply ignore the calls by not answering the phone. Ultimately, you have to do what is best for you to manage your life and minimize your stress. Return the phone calls on your own schedule or do not return them at all if you feel like this relationship is toxic and not worth saving., If the calls persist despite asking the caller to stop calling so frequently, tell them honestly that you will no longer answer their calls. Some people may not get the message that you are ignoring their calls, and some will call even more frequently if they are unsure why their calls are going unanswered.


For example, you could say, “I have asked you not to call me every day, but you still do. Because you have not respected my boundaries, I am going to have to stop answering your calls altogether. If I have time to speak with you, I will call you back when it’s convenient for me.”
If you never want to speak to the person again, tell them that. For example, “I have asked you repeatedly to stop calling me. I do not want to speak to you. I will not answer the phone when you call ever again.”

, If the person continues to call and the frequency becomes abusive, you may want to block the number from your phone to have the calls go straight to voicemail or screen your calls by using caller ID and refusing to answer.


If they persist in trying to contact you by other means, this person may be stalking you and you should notify the police."
"
Ask the caller if they are worried or stressed about something.,
Find a new crowd.,
Encourage the caller to explore new interests.",How to Tell Somebody to Not Call You Every Day3," People can often be clingy if they are insecure in their relationship with you or even if they are worried about something going on in their life.Take some time to have a heart-to-heart conversation with the caller to determine if there is a deeper problem that is causing them to reach out to you so often. If you live in the same city, it may be easier to have this conversation face-to-face rather than over the phone.


If the caller is feeling insecure about their relationship with you, assure them of your relationship’s stability by telling them how important they are to you.You might say, “You are one of my closest friends. I can’t imagine my life without you in it.”
It may be possible that the caller is experiencing some mental health problems and is reaching out to you for help. If you sense that they are exhibiting signs of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or other mental health issues, you may need to spend more time supporting them or assist them in seeking professional help., If you see the caller frequently in your everyday life, try finding new people to spend time with. Spending less time with a person who is clingy can help signal to them that you have a life outside of your relationship with them. Like the old adage, “Out of sight, out of mind,” the person may be less inclined to call you if they don’t see you so often and you are not on their mind so much.

, This person may be calling you too frequently because they are bored or have little going on in their lives besides their relationship with you. Suggest that they pursue activities related to their interests by joining a team or a hobby club, taking educational classes, or participating in volunteer opportunities.

Determine if your friends are ignoring you.,
Be aware of mean stuff they might be saying.,
Consider whether something obvious has happened recently.,
Listen up.,
Are they constantly making excuses to get away, such as ""I don't feel good"", all the time?,
Be realistic.,
Watch out for if they call you nasty names then pretend it was only a joke or if they talk about you behind your back then ignore it.,
Talk to your friends.,
Invite your friends over for some fun time together.,
Move on.",How to Tell if Your Friends Are Getting Tired of You," Some of the things in the following list may be signs that your friends are trying to distance themselves from you:


Do they avoid listening to what you say, or turn away from you and have conversations with each other?
Do they constantly hug each other when they meet but barely acknowledge your presence?
Do they exclude you from group outings?
Do they ask you to go away or quickly stop talking when you arrive and refuse to say what they were discussing?
Do they seem to know things about upcoming activities together that you haven't been involved in talking about?;
, Are they constantly putting you down? Do they make fun of what you're wearing, how you look, or the things you're doing? Friends do not mock or insult friends; this could be a serious sign that they're trying to exclude you.

, For example, if you have had a fight with one or more of your friends, being excluded may be a sign of an attempt to divide the group and exclude you from it. There could also be something happening that is beyond your control, such as when a member of your family is experiencing troubles that other people in the community are responding to in an exclusionary way. For example, if a sibling or parent is arrested or is disgraced in some way, you might find that the parents of your friends are suggesting to them to stay away from you too. Understanding the wider context can sometimes help you to see why your friends might be distancing themselves.

, Do you hear your friend spreading rumors about you or making comments behind your back? Gossiping is demoralizing and isn't something friends do.

, Excuses are a weak way of not saying openly what the person really thinks.

, Don't kid yourself that they still are great friends even if they don't invite you out and act as though they are done with you.

, As already noted, friends don't do this; bullies do. Either call them on it or begin to extricate yourself from this so-called group of friends, realizing that their friendship isn't worth the high price.

, Ask them why they are behaving in the way they are and how it is making you feel. It is possible that they haven't realized that their actions are rude or unfriendly (but don't get your hopes up too high). In some cases, a friend may be feeling sick or is having troubles of his or her own and is lashing out instead of thinking clearly. In such cases, trying to find out what is bothering your friend is useful. However, be prepared for an unwillingness to talk to you or even nasty comments if the friends have decided to move you out of their clique.

, You could have a movie night, a sleepover or simply play games together. However, be aware that this isn't a good solution if your friends are constantly being nasty; they may just use this occasion for what it is, then revert to being mean. If this does happen, you will definitely know it's time to cut loose from them. On the other hand, if you all get together and have a good time and talk things through, you might be able to resolve any festering issues and start over. Be open to the possibility but also be very aware of the need to take good care of yourself.


If you keep inviting them over and they keep rejecting the invitation, it's time to talk to them.

, If you've tried talking and tried getting together but neither has worked, and your so-called friends continue being snarky and difficult towards you, it's time to face the fact that your own well-being is more important than trying to keep the glue of friendship holding. In this case, these people are no longer your friends and it's their loss. It'll take time to heal and find new friends but you will find other people; be open to seeing who else is out there looking to connect. At the end of the day, it is important to be around people who actually want to be your friends, and who care about you.

Tell your friend not to be pushy.",How to Tell a Friend You Don't Want To Make Plans with Them," Just because someone asks you to do something does not mean you are obligated to do it. If they want to do something with you but you don't want to do something with them, they shouldn't get their way over you; what you want matters, too., Some friends can be pushy and will try to convince you to hang out even after you have said that you can't. Keep firm in your decision by re-iterating your reasons for why you cannot attend. To keep it friendly you can (if applicable) try joking around about the last time you asked your friend to do something and he said no. This will remind him that he has turned down your plans before, too, so he especially shouldn't be trying to guilt you into doing something.

, As long as you offer a sincere apology and do your part to maintain the friendship, you are not responsible for how your friend reacts to your turning down his plans.Ultimately, it is up to him how he decides to respond to your refusal to hang out. Keep that in mind if you are feeling down about your decision to turn him down.Try not to be afraid of how your friend will react. Again, as long as you are doing your part to be a good friend, you don't have to make plans with your friend every time he wants. If he reacts really negatively to your turning him down, perhaps he isn't the best friend to have around. Keeping that in mind should help alleviate your fear of his reaction., You can't do everything that everyone wants all the time, even for your friends. You have other commitments and responsibilities. Sometimes in life there are things that need to be done that are more important than socializing, such as working hard to become more financially stable, so you shouldn't feel too bad if you can't make plans., If you don't want to hang out with your friend because they suggested something that you do not want to do or that you don't have time to do (e.g., hanging out the entire weekend), try compromising. You could let your friend know that you want to make plans but can't do the particular plan he suggested.For example, if he wants to spend the whole weekend together but you're only free on Saturday, try suggesting something you both like to do that could be done on a Saturday.
Is there a new movie out that you both want to see? That's one idea for a compromise; going to the movies can be fun and only takes a few hours.

, Tell your friend that you are sorry that you can't make plans this time. Be sure to offer a sincere apology if maintaining the friendship is important to you.


To offer a sincere apology, don't breeze past it; take your time saying sorry and give your friend your full attention when you are speaking.
Here is an example of how to sincerely apologize to your friend: ""I'm really sorry, I'd love to make plans with you but I just really can't this time. Again, sorry about that but let's re-visit this soon so we can work something else out.""

, If the reason is something you feel comfortable sharing with your friend (i.e., it is not too personal), be sure to let him know why you can't make plans this time.


If you do not wish to share the reason, you can use something more vague such as ""I'm just really swamped this weekend"" or ""my life is a bit crazy right now so I can't this weekend"" or ""thanks for the invite, and sorry, but I just really need some alone time to recuperate this weekend"".
Whatever you do, if you are going to give a specific excuse, make sure it is legitimate to avoid looking like a liar or a flake.Examples of legitimate excuses include you already having other plans, you being busy with something else in your life, and you being very tired from the week and needing some down time or alone time.

, If you are letting your friend know why you can't make plans with him, keep it concise. Don't give a bunch of excuses; this will only make it seem like you are not being genuine. One sincere apology and genuine excuse should be enough. If you have tons of things going on you can just say that., Keep it cordial when saying no, even if you are busy and don't want to have a conversation about hanging out. No one likes to be rejected, even with something small like being turned down by a friend; it can sting a little sometimes. To be polite, follow-up by telling your friend to have a good time if he goes ahead with the plans without you. Ask him to let you know how it goes.
You can also try offering a suggestion for another mutual friend he could bring along instead; this will make it clear that you want him to have a good time and care about the friendship, and that you just can't make it this particular time.

, Say no firmly and definitely so that it is clear that you cannot do what your friend wants. If you give 'on the fence' answers like ""I'll try to be there"" or ""I'll see; remind me later"" when you know you don't want to do, you leave your friend on the hook.Leaving a friend on the hook when you know that you don't want to hang out is selfish; what if he wanted to make other plans but couldn't until you gave your final answer?

, While you shouldn't be wishy-washy if you know you can't or don't want to hang out, if you genuinely aren't sure yet, buy yourself sometime by asking whether you can get back to your friend soon.Be specific on when would be the latest that you would get back to him. Also, to be polite, since you are unsure whether you can hang out, tell your friend that you understand if he needs to make other plans if he doesn't hear back from you soon.

, If you don't want to make plans based on what he invited you to do, offer a follow-up plan. Get something penciled in for when you are less busy, otherwise your schedule may fill up again and you will have to say no again.


For example, if you are busy the weekend he wants to go hiking, ask if you can go hiking next weekend instead. If maintaining the friendship is important to you, be sure to make that clear to your friend.

, If your friend does not take your turning his plans down well, you can try to preempt this by placing two ""yeses"" between your saying no to his plans.For example, if he wants to go hiking with you on the weekend you might say ""thanks for inviting me; I'm glad we're friends, we do a lot of fun stuff together, but I can't make it hiking this weekend. I'm definitely into the idea though; let's go a different weekend when I'm less busy, instead?""

, Put yourself in your friend's shoes and think about your friendship and the conversation you are having from his perspective. Let him know that you understand that he wants to have a good time, but that you just can't hang out this time., Some friends can be aggressive or pushy about making plans. Perhaps your friend gets angry when you don't do exactly what he says, or tries repeatedly to get you to change your mind. In cases like this it can be best to create some distance between making a decision.For example, if your friend calls you to make plans and is pressuring you, try saying that you need to go but will get back to him later.

, If you find yourself caving more into doing things you don't want to in person, try giving your final answer through a text message or other similar form of communication where your pushy friend can't so effectively be so pushy.


If he tries calling right away, you do not need to answer his call; it is acceptable to tell him that you cannot talk on the phone at the moment.

, If you find yourself giving into peer pressure when your friend gets pushy or angry, try writing out what you will say in advance. Write out the reasons why you can't or don't want to make plans, and look them over so that you remember them. This way, if your friend gets pushy, you will be less likely to forget that you really don't want to make plans.When writing your script, think about past conversations with your friend where you gave in. Try to remember how he acted or what he said that made you make plans despite you not wanting to.
For example, if in the past he has said that you never say yes to his plans, you could write a script where you re-iterate the last few times that you did hang out together to show him that his claim is not true. By planning with a script, if he tries using the same tactics on you again, you will be ready to defend yourself.

, If your friend continues to pressure you, try saying that you can't make his plans with some firmness in your voice. After you say no firmly, change the topic of conversation so he gets the hint that you are done with the conversation.For example, if your friend has repeatedly asked you to go out to dinner on the weekend you could say ""I already said I really can't go, but thanks for the invite. By the way, did you see ? What did you think?""
Try reminding your friend that people have different personalities and time constraints and that some people like to hang out more than others or do certain things that others don't enjoy. Try letting your friend know that you will make plans whenever you feel that you can, but that when you say no, you mean it, and it isn't OK for him to try to pressure you or to get angry when you say no.

, If nothing else works, you can try telling your friend directly that you feel pressured to do things that you do not want to do and it is putting a strain on your friendship.


For example, you might say, ""look, I value our friendship but sometimes I feel like you try to force me into doing things I can't (or don't want to) do. This makes me feel like you don't value my perspective and my time constraints. I will absolutely make plans with you when I can, but sometimes I just can't, so it would be great for both of us, I think, if you didn't get angry when I say I can't hang out.""

"
"
Think about how the two of you got together as friends.,
Consider how intimate your friendship feels.,
Think about who makes the plans.,
Consider how they are when you need help.,
Consider the possibility that you're being used.,
Identify what this supposed friend could possibly want from you.,
Come up with a subtle way to pretend you cannot provide what you suspect they want.,
Observe their reaction.",How to Tell if Someone Is Your Friend,"


How did you meet each other? Did you fall into them by accident or did they come up to say ""Hi""? Were they friendly about it?
Do they say hi and wave to you, or do they walk up to you and start a conversation?
If they aren't that open to you and you didn't meet in a nice manner, they probably just think of you as a 'hi and bye friend', which means they are just an acquaintance and want no part in friendship at that time.;
,


Do they initiate conversations with you just to talk? Or is there always a need dangling on the end of any conversation?
Can you trust them? Do you feel close to them?

, Is it always you making all the plans? Does the other person always come to things you invite them too? If they really like you they will try to show up to see you. Don't make excuses for them like ""oh, they are probably busy"" because if things add up that they have rejected your requests to see them a whole bunch of times, where it just seems like you'll never see them again, maybe the other person is just trying to give you a hint. They just don't take the friendship as seriously as you do.

, When you have a problem are they supportive and caring? A true friend feels sad when you are and offers support. If you're having a problem, it is their problem too and they should be right there to help.

, Sometimes there are people that use you and don't really want to be your friend but they disguise it with pretend friendliness. For example:


Does this person only want to hang out when you have something they want? For example, if you are doing something special and all of a sudden they're free to come, when usually, they're too busy?
Do they only hang out when you go out shopping and pay for everything?

If you got a yes for both of these, the person is definitely using you and wants no part of a friendship.



, It could be your connections, skills, or knowledge, just something that doesn't come cheaply, commodity-wise or through friendship.

, For example, if what they want from you is a free ride in your really nice car, you can say you're considering trading it in for something cheaper and more manageable. Make it sound like you're in control, that it was your decision to stop doing whatever they could find useful.

, Real friends will respect your decision and still continue to be friends. False friends will either try to reverse the decision, or stop hanging out with you altogether. Either way they'll be unhappy and that will be one bad day for anyone who tried to take advantage of you.

Ask yourself why you want to end the friendship.,
Consider their feelings.,
Start positive.,
State that you want to end the friendship.,
Be clear.,
Bring up significant events.,
Apologize.,
Bring the letter to a conclusion.,
Reread the letter.",How to Write a Letter to End a Friendship," Terminating a friendship can be a painful, difficult process, especially if you are close with one another. Before cutting ties with your friend, set aside your emotions and consider your reasons for leaving them. Be sure that you have valid ones before continuing on. Writing a hurtful letter to your friend in a fit of anger or grief may cause you to regret it later, so it's best to evaluate the situation while you're calm.


If you have trouble deciding whether it's best to end the friendship, you may want to consult others since this is an important decision. Trusted family members are a good choice. If you decide to ask your friends for advice, make sure that they don't have a relationship with the friend you're thinking of breaking up with.;
, Reading the letter and coping with the loss may be hard for your friend. Even if they may not care about losing the friendship, they have feelings as well, so be sure not to write any hurtful or unnecessary remarks in your letter. Being mature about ending the friendship is important; otherwise, your friend may resent you because of your words and may attempt to get revenge in the future. If you have trouble keeping your feelings separate from your letter, it may help to write an emotional letter filled with everything you want to say before tearing it up.

, Even if your friendship has come to the point where you must end it, there probably are some happy memories that you have shared with your friend. Although you should avoid going too deep into them, list a few positive traits about your friend to let them know that you do care about them. For instance, you could say, ""Your kindness was the first thing that caught my attention"" or ""You have always been supportive of me."" This will soften the blow and help your friend understand that you don't mean to hurt them.

, After listing the positive, you should quickly bring the letter to the main focus, which is the termination of your relationship. Clearly state that you wish to cut off ties, and make sure to emphasize whether this is temporary or permanent. Although you don't have to be blunt, you should be sure that your intention is clear. If you're afraid of hurting your friend's feelings - especially if they're sensitive - you could write something along the lines of, ""We've had a wonderful friendship that has taught me many lessons. But lately, I've been thinking, and I've decided that it's best to end this friendship.""

, Once you have stated that you want to end the friendship, bring up your reasons to back up your argument. Consider the points you want to make. To avoid confusing your friend or not correctly conveying your message, clearly state your reasons for leaving and explain why without beating around the bush. Make sure that they are valid and straight to the point, but try not to be too hurtful. Using the words ""I feel that"" can help you communicate your thoughts without hurting your friend's feelings. For instance, if you think that your friend has been a bad influence on you, one of the reasons you could write is, ""I feel that you have been frequently pressuring me to drink alcohol, despite my firm protests."" Your purpose is to explain why you're ending the friendship and tell them about your feelings, not upset them.


Avoid using accusatory sentences - such as ""You have been a terrible influence"" - as this will hurt your friend and may enrage them.

, There may have been moments where your friendship was strained, leading you up to this point. To back up your reasons for leaving, you may want to briefly summarize those events where your friend made you uncomfortable and gave you a reason to end the friendship. This will prove that your points are valid and that you aren't simply accusing your friend without any proof to support your arguments. An example would be, ""There were several times at Nora's party that you pushed me to drink alcohol even though I told you stop."" While recalling events, it may be easy to lose control of your emotions, but make sure to stay on focus and keep your letter on topic.

, If you have made any negative contributions to your friendship, it may be wise to acknowledge any major faults or mistakes before apologizing for them. Make it clear that you accept responsibility for those incidents. That way, your friend won't feel as if you're attempting to push all of the blame onto them. You should also add that you're sorry that it has come to the point where you're cutting off ties. This may remind your friend that you care about them and that you don't want to do this.

, After you have communicated your message and reasons, it's time to end the letter. State your wish to end the friendship once again. Ask them not to contact you or attempt to rebuild your relationship; otherwise, this will hinder the process of cutting off ties and make it harder for the two of you. Let them know that you still care for them but that you feel it's best that you both go your separate ways.


If you wish to talk to your friend in person before separating, you should add that at the end of your letter. It may be wise to meet with them one last time to bring things to a close and give your friend a chance to respond. You may also want to bring a trusted relative or friend with you in case things go wrong. However, if your friend has anger issues or you fear that they may harm you, it's best to discourage any contact and refuse to see them.

, After you have written it out, carefully go through it to make sure that you haven't made any mistakes. Be sure that you have clearly stated your points and that you have said all the words that you want to tell your friend. Once you are satisfied with the letter, seal it in an envelope before mailing or handing it to your friend.

Remain calm.,
Be assertive.,
Stay true to your values and opinions.,
Act in your own best interest.",How to Stop Your Friend from Bossing You Around1," A bossy person seeks to throw you off balance so that you are easily controlled. Your first line of defense is to take a deep breath, which activates your body's natural calming response. This will keep you in control of your actions, and the situation as a whole., There is a difference between being assertive and being aggressive. You should express your opinions and feelings on an issue and hold your ground. This is not an invitation to attack or turn the tables on your friend.Use phrases like “I can make this decision for myself,” instead of things like “Shut up! I’ll do what I want.”

, Letting a friend pressure you into doing something that you disagree with can negatively affect your self esteem. Value yourself as a person enough to feel comfortable setting some boundaries to honor what makes your comfortable.


Say “No, I do not feel comfortable doing that.” Not only will this send a clear message to your friend that you do not wish to be bossed around, it will also give you a confidence boost for the next time you need to stand up to someone bossy., Even if what your friend is telling you to do isn’t something you disagree with, you should ask if it is in your best interest to do it. A friend might try to boss you into doing something that they feel will have negative consequences. This lets the friend get what they want, while avoiding the risk of consequences.For example, if your friend wants to get out of a class, they might try to boss you into pulling the fire alarm in the building. Getting caught would result in disciplinary actions against you, and it is a bad idea to be bossed into these types of activities.

"
"
Remove yourself from the situation.,
Spend time with other friends.,
Point out consequences for bossy behavior.",How to Stop Your Friend from Bossing You Around2," Sometimes, removing yourself from the situation just means tuning your friend out for minute. Other times, you may literally have to walk away and put distance between yourself and your friend. This will send a message to your friend that you will not tolerate the bossiness and, at the same time, remove you from the situation.If your friend is insisting that you talk to them during a lecture, you may have to get up and move a few seats down to end the conversation before you end up in trouble. If you cannot move immediately, you can choose to sit away from that friend next time you come to the class.

, You should never place your self-worth on the opinion of one person. Deriving your value from the opinion of one friend will give that friend the power to boss you around. As long as you keep a diverse group of friends you will get positive reinforcement with or without your bossier friends.

, This should be reserved for a last resort. Consequences can often cause a rift or conflict between friends that may or may not heal. If you have tried talking to your friend about the bossiness with no progress, explain to them that there will be consequences for continuing to boss you around.You should never threaten to hurt anyone as a consequence for bossing you around. Appropriate consequences might be something like ending the friendship or refusing to help the friend with things that they need your help on.

"
"
Be empathetic.,
Talk to your friend about their controlling tendencies.,
Help your friend realize when they are being bossy.,
Know the difference between logical persuasion and emotional manipulation.",How to Stop Your Friend from Bossing You Around3," Bossiness and the need to control other people often stems from a lack of control in one’s own life. Bossy people lash out to control others because they are insecure with themselves, and controlling their friends gives them a sense of power. Understand that the bossiness is not intended to be cruel or hurtful (in most cases), but is a complicated part of the person’s personality.Being empathetic means that you make an effort to understand the feelings of your bossy friend, but does not mean that you should allow them to boss you around.

, Many bossy and controlling people either do it without realizing that they are being bossy, or have no idea how to stop themselves. Discuss your frustrations with your friend and attempt to open their eyes to how their actions hurt those around them. You are likely to find that your friend is willing to work on their bossy bad habits.You might try having a private conversation with your friend and approaching it gently by saying something like “I know you just want to help me, but sometimes you can come on a little too strong with your opinion.”

, If your friend truly wants to change their bossy behaviors, it might be helpful if you politely point out to them when they are crossing a line. Be sure that you discuss this beforehand and come up with a subtle way to let your friend know that isn’t embarrassing in crowds. Belittling your friend when they are being bossy will only damage their self-esteem and fuel the need for controlling others.For example, your might point out when your friend is being bossy by saying something like, ""That thing we talked about is happening.""
Or, coming up with a code word to let your friend know when they are being bossy can work well. For example, you could tell your friend that you will say ""squirrel"" every time she starts to get bossy.

, Be careful to keep your defensiveness in check. If a friend is trying to give you advice that is based on facts and sound reasoning, this might not be a case of someone being bossy. It doesn’t mean that you have to do as your friend suggests, but you should recognize when a request is built on sound logic rather than guilt or emotional manipulation.A friend who is trying to give you sound advice might say something like “I’m not sure it’s a good idea to take that apartment across town. Rent is $1,000 per month and you only make $1,200 per month.”
A friend trying to be bossy might say something along the lines of “You can’t move across town and abandon me! What will I do if you bail on me? You have to stay on this side of town.”

Add the water.,
Install the fresh air screen lid and light(s).,
Allow the aquarium to run for 24 hours and introduce your turtle(s).,
Add lots of food options for the turtle to discover and eat.",How to Make a Turtle Environment," Turtles need an enclosure that is appropriate for their size. The enclosure should be big enough that they have lots of room to swim, soak up heat from their heat bulb, and move about the enclosure in general.Do some research to see how big your turtle can get.
A turtle whose carapace (the top shell) is eight inches in diameter or larger should have a 20-gallon enclosure to itself, with an additional 10 gallons for each additional turtle.
Use a fresh air screen cover to secure the top of your turtle's enclosure.;
, Turtles are reptiles that require a heat source to regulate their body temperature, so you need to provide a heat lamp for this purpose. Install a thermometer to ensure the temperature in the basking area beneath the heat lamp's bulb stays between 80 and 85 degrees fahrenheit.Heat lamps are UVA-spectrum lights, which should be used in the basking area, but your turtle also requires UVB light—install both types of light and put them on a timer to mimic patterns of the sun, adjusting for different seasons.
Follow all the instructions for the installation of the heat lamp for safety.

, How much water the enclosure needs depends on whether your turtle is aquatic, semi-aquatic, or land-dwelling (tortoise). Aquatic turtles should have a habitat that is 75% water, while semi-aquatic turtles should have an enclosure that is 50% water. Tortoises are land-dwelling, but they still need water for soaking—25% of the habitat can be water, provided it is very shallow, as tortoises can drown.Be sure to research the species of turtle or tortoise you have to find out the specific habitat requirements for water.
You'll need a water heater to regulate the temperature of the water to 78 degrees fahrenheit, though the temperature may vary slightly between species.You'll also need a filter to keep your turtle's water clean.
A dissolvable sulfa block will treat water and help keep your turtle healthy and disease-free.
Non-chlorinated water is best for your tank., Plants may be desirable to keep the habitat looking natural and give the turtle some security. Basking surfaces can be purchased at pet stores. These may include manufactured ramps that the turtle can climb onto from out of the water or driftwood or rocks gathered from outside.You may use artificial or real plants, but some turtles may attempt to eat fake plants. If this happens, the artificial plants should be swapped for real plants, provided the plants you choose are not poisonous to the species of turtle you have.
Be sure the rocks and/or driftwood are clean and dry before placing them into the enclosure.
Substrate—gravel or sand—is not necessary and may make cleaning the enclosure more difficult.

, Whether the enclosure you have decided to use is new or used, you should ensure it is clean. Use an aquarium-safe sponge (available at pet stores) to clean the cage using pure water only.Do not use any chemicals to wash the enclosure.
Avoid abrasive cleaning pads because they may scratch glass, allowing for and algae contamination.

, Like substrate, plants are not necessary for the enclosure. However, if you intend to use plants in the enclosure—whether real or artificial—set them up after substrate, if used. Live plants in the water may boost oxygen levels for the turtle while he or she is in the water.Be sure that any plants you choose are not poisonous to the species of turtle you have, and replace the artificial plants with real ones if the turtle tries to eat them.

, Install the turtle ramp or ""turtle dock"" to the basking area at this point. This may be a ramp purchased at a pet store or rocks or some driftwood positioned to allow a basking area outside the water.


Keep in mind that the basking area will be directly under the heat lamp, so position it according to where you want the heat lamp to be installed.

, Before adding the water, install the water heater according to the instructions. Next, assemble and install the water filtration system. Finally, add your dissolvable sulfa block, which will condition the water and help keep your turtle healthy.Be sure the water heater is fully submerged once you add the water.
Use a filtration system that is meant to handle double the capacity of your aquarium to help with the efficiency of the filter.

, Once you have completed the above steps, add the water to the enclosure and activate the water heater and filtration system. Avoid using chlorinated water or tap water. Allow the water to sit for 24 hours to allow water to dechlorinate. Dechlorination can also be achieved with a commercially available additive.Vitamin supplements that can be added to the water can also help keep your turtle healthy.

, Place the fresh air screen lid on the top of the enclosure after completing the above steps. Above the fresh air screen, install the UVA and UVB lights. Some lights are available that are both UVA- and UVB-spectrum. Make sure the lights are on a timer to mimic daylight hours and positioned above the basking area you have created.Remember to set up the lights safely to prevent accidents.

, Before introducing the turtle(s), allow the aquarium filtration system and heater to run for 24 hours.This also allows time for you to ensure the timer on your lights is working properly. After 24 hours, gently place your turtle(s) in the basking area and replace the fresh air lid and lights.


The turtle should be left alone to explore his or her new home.

, Turtles are omnivores, though some may be strictly vegan. Research your turtle's species to be sure what foods are appropriate. Greens, vegetables, fruits, flowers, worms, snails, insects, and cooked meats may be appropriate.Some prepared foods are available at pet stores that will meet much of the turtle's dietary needs.
Turtles may require a calcium supplement if their diet is not varied. Many are available at pet stores.

Decide whether you want an indoor or outdoor habitat.,
Create an indoor habitat.,
Try building a ""tortoise table"".,
Build an outdoor enclosure.,
Fill the enclosure with substrate.",How to Make A Habitat for Hermann’s Tortoises1," Hermann’s tortoises can be kept either indoors or outdoors, as long as the weather permits. Tortoises need to regularly bask in the heat of the sun or a lamp. Consider the positive and negative consequences of each option: it might be easier to find space for your tortoises outside the house, but an indoor environment may be easier to maintain. This particular kind of tortoise has a specific temperature range, so it may not be feasible to keep a tortoise outside if you live in a cold region.;
, To start, build a box out of plywood or a plastic container. Build the enclosure at least four by three feet or eight times longer than your tortoise; adults are usually 6-8 inches long.Bear in mind that these are absolute minimum values. If possible, your enclosure should be even larger on all sides.


If you build the enclosure out of wood, be careful not to use cedar or pine. The acids in the wood can harm your tortoises.
Make sure to build a floor into the enclosure. Coat the floor with sand and soil to give the tortoises a place to dig. If you use an indoor habitat, it should mimic the outdoors as much as possible.

, There are different kinds of indoor pens, but a “tortoise table” is a simple and cost-effective solution. Start with a bookcase (or a wardrobe with the doors removed) laid on its back. Sink a tray for water into the wood. The tray should be large enough for the tortoise to stand in, but not deep enough to submerge its head. Lay a substrate of mixed compost and sand to a depth of about 10cm.

, Choose a warm, dry area that gets a lot of sun. As always, the more roaming space the better. Put a fence around the area so that your tortoise(s) cannot escape. Other animals may hurt your tortoises if they wander too far and get lost.


It's much easier to house a tortoise outside if where you live gets to around 65-80 degrees Fahrenheit or 18-26 degrees Celsius, but if you don't live in a tropical or subtropical region, you must build an indoor enclosure.
Hermann’s tortoises love to dig, so be sure to put your fence deep into the ground. Try building your enclosure atop something solid that the tortoises cannot dig through. This might be concrete, brick, or wood. For a cheap and effective barrier, try laying down chicken wire beneath a few inches of soil.
Consider which direction your garden faces – the direction from which it gets most of its sun. If you have a north-facing garden, prepare the tortoise for hibernation by late September. Otherwise, your tortoises may stay out until late October, if it stays warm and dry enough.

, Make sure to use a filling with a fine grain. It is very important that the surface of the soil is dry: damp environments can cause tortoises to develop ""shell-rot"" or dermatitis before developing into respiratory disease if the tortoise is unable to completely dry off daily.Do not use bedding that can be a habitat for mold or fungus such as bark chips.
Newspaper, pellets, and sand couldn't hold enough moisture, they're not appropriate burrowing material either.
Avoid clay-type soil, as this type of earth tend to hold much more moisture than regular soil.
You can mix different types of substrates to create a suitable bedding, one of the most common combination is topsoil with play sand.

"
"
Keep the habitat warm.,
Set up a basking spot by using a heat lamp and a UV lamp.,
Light up the enclosure during the day.,
Keep the humidity around 50 – 65%.",How to Make A Habitat for Hermann’s Tortoises2," The temperature should be 80-90°F/26-32°C during daytime and 65-70°F/18-21°C at night.If you are keeping your tortoises indoors, you must also provide plenty of light and a place to bask.


Consider keeping a small thermostat in the enclosure so that you can monitor the temperature and keep it steady. This is most important at first, as you establish the tortoises in their new environment.
The tortoise should be okay if it is cool at night, as long as it is also dry. Make sure that your tortoise can raise its temperature during the day.

, Tortoises bask in the sunlight in order to digest and absorb nutrients from their food. You don't need to build anything special – just ensure that one part of the enclosure will always be warm enough to meet the needs of a post-meal tortoise.Look for ceramic heating bulbs that do not emit light. You can leave these bulbs on at night as well.
If you build your enclosure outdoors in a hot region, then you don't need to worry about making an artificial basking spot. Your tortoises will bask in the heat of the sun.

, If you are keeping your tortoises indoors, out of direct sunlight, keep the space lit with a UVB light bulb of at least 5W (five watts). Set the light up in a central location – it should illuminate the entire space. Leave the light on for 8-12 hours a day.


Tortoises like it hot, but they won't be able to safely handle temperatures much higher than 80 degrees F. If the habitat gets too hot, move the bulb. Hang it higher above the enclosure., Consider using a humidifier to regulate moisture levels. Place the humidifier directly into the enclosure, or just humidify the entire room. This is especially important if you live in a cold climate and use heating in the house – central heating tends to dry up the air."
"
Build hiding places.,
Provide ample food and water.,
Keep the space clean.,
Be cautious about keeping multiple tortoises in the same enclosure.,
Be gentle and give them space.",How to Make A Habitat for Hermann’s Tortoises3," Hermann’s tortoises like to dig and hide, so it is important to provide a place where they can feel safe. Try building a small ""tortoise house"", or simply giving the tortoises a plastic food container with a hole to enter and exit.. Tortoises tend to sleep in their ""hiding area"".


This is especially important if you are keeping your tortoises in a very hot place. Make sure that your animals have a shady place to retreat if they get too hot.
If you have an outdoor enclosure, make sure that it is safe from predators – including birds. Tortoises are hardy creatures, but they cannot defend themselves against all animals.

, Hermann’s tortoises do not eat meat or grains. They eat a variety of vegetables (endive, radicchio, dandelion) – ideally, weeds and some flowers. Give them fresh food every day and every other day when they're older, wash it carefully with water before serving. Replenish a supply of clean water in a shallow bowl or container daily.Tortoises also need calcium in their diet. Let them nibble small pieces of grit from your garden. They are also fond of clover.If Hermann leaves something, it means they do not like it. It usually easy to tell a tortoise's preferences by watching its behavior.
Hermann's tortoises kept outdoors will often make a point of coming out during a rainstorm and drinking from puddles.
Never feed a tortoise with cat or dog food. Dog and cat food usually contain meat, grains, and other bits that tortoises can't easily digest or over consume.

, Replenish the water and food trays daily. Change the substrate once a month, or whenever it seems especially filthy - If you can't afford to completely refill the substrate, try churning the soil and/or plant live greenery that absorbs Ammonia and Nitrates.

, Be aware that putting many tortoises together can cause problems, that includes enclosure space issues. Two males, put together, will tend to fight over territorial disputes.However, tension may also arise if the female to male ratio is too small: the male often won't leave the female alone, and she can become too stressed. If you notice that the tortoises are bothering one another, you need to move them into separate enclosures.

, Hermann's tortoises do not usually enjoy behind handled.Make sure to treat your animals gently when moving them into their new enclosure. Hold a tortoise with two clean hands, and do not drop it. Avoid handling the tortoises for at least a few days after you bring them home. They can be slow to adjust, and they need time to settle into their new enclosure.

",How to Breed Ball Pythons," It is important that the animals you intend to breed are old enough and large enough. A male typically needs to weigh over 700 grams and be at least one year old. Evidence of maturity can be determined by expressing a sperm plug. Gentle pressure on the cloaca (the vent at the back of the snake) will produce a little white, cheesy matter that will tell the male is ready. While females as small as 1200 grams have been successfully bred, most breeders recommend that females be at least 3 years old and 1700 grams in order to breed. The process is too demanding on smaller animals and represents a health risk.;
, It is best to be sure of the sex of the animals you intend to breed. This can be determined by probing. There are video tutorials available that teach the process. This can be dangerous to the animal, so do not probe a snake without first having received proper instruction; or call in an expert. Female snakes will probe to a depth of only 3 or 4 scales. Males will generally probe to 7-9 scales. It is possible to get a false positive for a female if the snake is constricting itself sufficiently to prevent the probe from achieving full penetration.

, In order to become fertile, a cooling-off period is required. The ambient air temperature at night needs to be in the mid 70's (F) low 20s (C) for a period of about a three months. The warm spot in the cage AT NIGHT should be reduced to low to mid 80's(F) low 30s (C), during the day temperatures should return to normal temperature in the high 80's(F). The idea is to replicate the weather conditions of winter in Central Africa. This short cool spell whispers sweet nothings into the brains of these beautiful creatures and tells them that Spring is coming and new life needs to be created.


During the cooling off period, periodically introduce the male and the female. Have them together for a few days, then apart for a few days. They may try to breed at that time but it won't take. Still, it is a good sign.

, After the cool spell, the temperatures can be returned to normal. Good temperatures for ball pythons produces perspiration on most humans.

, Many male ball pythons also require some extra stimulus stimulation to put them in the mood. The simplest way to do this is to put a number of males together. They will start to notice each other, and raise themselves up in to a nearly vertical stance. Somewhere there is a photograph of six or eight male ball pythons that look like they are dancing. This process really gets them interested in connecting with the opposite sex. Ten to twenty minutes of this activity greatly increases the males' interest in females.

, After introducing them, the best thing is to leave them alone and let nature take its course. Occasionally they may scrap a little, but actual injuries seem to be very rare. Normally they will settle down in a few minutes and the two animals will connect.

, Ball pythons can stay connected for up to two days. It's all right to peek at them, but try not to disturb them. They are in no hurry. They can take a long time to complete this important step. Anything short of a three or four hour coupling is likely to prove ineffective.

, A male ball python needs about a week to recover his potency. If you have more than one female to breed him to, give him a week or so to recover.

, The sperm that the male deposits in the female can remain viable for up to 2 years.

, Once you see that, no need to keep introducing them to each other.

, Get the female a lay box, for example, a Rubbermaid box with damp moss. She will lay eggs and coil around them.

, Remove the female from the eggs, gently, and place them in incubation substrate inside a container (Rubbermaid box with a lid).

, Set the incubator to 90 °F (32 °C), 32 C. Check the eggs once a week to make sure they good. At this time when you lift the lid to check eggs, they will get air so you don't have to put air holes in the incubation container.

, If the female does not eat, try washing her to remove the scent of the eggs. It is important she starts to eat again since laying takes a lot out of her.

,, Babies after hatching should be put in their own separate cages lined with damp paper towel until their first shed. Then you can use newspaper or other substrate.

, Babies start eating pinkie mice within the first week or two and should be fed every five to seven days.

Set up your Ball Python's new home.,
Put down the substrate.,
Control the temperature.,
Know the snake's temperament.,
Control the humidity.,
Feed your snake a pre-killed rodent.,
Shedding.,
Do your research.",How to Care for Ball Pythons," Adults will need a 30 gallon (113.6 L) tank. Younger snakes can be kept in 10–20 gallons (37.9–75.7 L). Make sure you have a securely fitted top to the tank. All snakes are notorious escape artists, and you don't want to have to visit the 'how to find your lost snake' article.;
, As far as substrate goes, (the stuff you put at the bottom of the tank for your snake to do his business on) you have a lot of options; Paper towels, newsprint, aspen chips, and coconut fibers. The only thing you really can't use is cedar, as the phenol oils in the cedar are toxic to snakes.


Other essential things that need to be in your snake's cage include a heavy water bowl (to avoid it being tipped over.) heating elements, hides, and humidity and heat gauges.

, One of the most important factors to keeping your Ball Python healthy is temperature. Since snakes are cold-blooded, they have to regulate their temperatures manually by going to one side of the tank when they're cold, and the other side when they're hot.


The ideal temperatures for a Ball Python is around 80- 85 F during the day, with a basking spot of around 90 F. Nighttime temperatures can fall to around 75 F on the cool side, but the warm side needs to stay 80 F.
There are several options here. An under the tank heating pad combined with an incandescent bulb or ceramic heating element seems to work well. The heating element should be screened off to prevent burns. Use thermometers specially designed for reptiles to monitor the temperature inside the tank.

, Because Ball Pythons are naturally so docile, they can also be nervous, finicky snakes, especially while young. It's essential to have at least 2 hides (one at the hot end of the tank, and one at the cool end) for your ball python's mental well-being. These can be bought or made out of things like cereal boxes, a turned over plant pot, etc. Make sure nothing you use as a hide could be toxic.

, A ball Python's humidity level should be in the upper 50-65%, 60% is ideal. Monitor this with a humidity gauge. You may need to lightly spray your Ball Pythons tank with water before he sheds to keep the humidity up.

, Heat up the frozen mouse in a plastic bag submerged in warm water. The mouse should be around the same size as the fattest part of your Ball Python's body. Do this once a week. Increase food size as your snake grows.

, A healthy baby ball python will shed more frequently than adults. The shedding process: a week or so prior to shedding the colors of your snake will begin to fade. Its skin will take on a dull gray sheen and its eyes may become bluish. After that, the snake's colors will begin to seem back to normal however in anywhere between 2 and 36 hours the snake will shed its skin. If the snake has difficulty shedding, place it in some room temp water with a few drops of baby or mineral oil and help the snake by softly peeling the skin. Also make sure the eye caps and tail are properly shed.

, Perhaps the most important thing to remember when taking care of a Ball Python is to do your research, and stay updated on new information. Reading about it here is a good start. Consider joining forums, and read as much online about Ball Python Care as you can.

Keep a temperature gradient.,
Consider additional lighting.,
Maintain the right humidity.,
Provide the right substrate.,
Provide hide boxes.",How to Care for Your Ball Python3," In a natural environment, your snake will move between areas that have different temperatures. Snakes are cold blooded and the temperature will change their level of activity. To replicate this, you will need to maintain your ball python's enclosure with a temperature gradient.The basking area should be 88 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit.
The overall temperature of the cage should be 78 to 80 Fahrenheit.
Use two thermometers to monitor both the cool and warm areas of the cage.
You can heat the cage with under-cage warming pads or heating lights.

, Supplemental lighting can be used in your ball python's enclosure. However, it is not a requirement. If you want to use additional lighting, try using a full-spectrum UV light. Consider adding supplemental lighting to help make your enclosure feel even more natural and comfortable.Use 12 hour cycles of lighting. Keep the light on for 12 hours during the day and off for 12 hours at night.
Do not leave the light on at night. Leaving the light on too long will stress your snake out.

, Creating and maintaining the right level of humidity is very important for your snakes health. Humidity will help keep your snake healthy and allow them to easily shed their skin. Always keep a close eye on the humidity levels in the cage to best care for your ball python.Humidity needs to be between 50% to 60%

, Your ball python will need to have the right substrate in order to be comfortable and safe in its home. Certain substrates will work better than others, keeping your ball python happy and making the enclosure easier to clean. Take a look at some of the following examples of substrates to learn what's okay to use:Aspen shavings will work well.
Cypress mulch is okay to use.

Find the right size prey.,
Don't touch the snake after feeding.,
Always remove uneaten food.,
Feed on a schedule.,
Provide water.",How to Care for Your Ball Python4," It's important that you provide the right size prey to your ball python. Prey that is either too small or too large will present problems for your snake. Always make sure that whenever you introduce prey into the cage that it's the correct size.Prey should be no bigger than the widest part of the snake.
Prey that is too large can cause injury to your snake.
Prey that is too small may not provide enough nutrition.

, Snakes need time to be alone and digest their meal after they've eaten. Disturbing or handling your snake after a meal can cause them to regurgitate that meal. Always wait at least one full day before handling your ball python after they've eaten., If your snake doesn't eat a prey item, you will need to remove it. Leaving dead or living prey items in the cage can pose health hazards to your snake.

Invite your friend over for a private conversation.,
Find a quiet location.,
Minimize the people involved.,
Stay safe.,
Know what you want to say.,
Acknowledge their reasons.,
Deliver your message with “I” statements.,
Back up your position.,
Suggest your friend turn to someone they trust.,
Reach out to a family member.,
Consult someone in a position of authority.",How to Talk a Friend out of Doing Something," Before you talk with your friend, you should invite them to talk with you. Make sure the conversation will be private.

Try saying something like, ""I want to meet up with you to discuss something important. Can you meet up with me?""
It is important to ensure that the conversation will be between you and your friend only. Do not invite additional people to the conversation.;
, It is important that your conversation not be interrupted. Think of somewhere that your friend will feel comfortable, and plan to meet there when you both have plenty of time to talk. Cutting the conversation short will not be an effective way to change your friend’s mind.For example, if your friend enjoys coffee, you could meet at a coffee shop on a Saturday morning when you are both free.

, Even if several of your friends are worried about his particular decision, it is best that you each talk to the friend in question separately. If you organize several friends to show up together, this might come across as threatening and overwhelming. Your friend will likely shut down and not listen to any of you in this situation, so plan a one on one conversation., If for any reason you think that the conversation could escalate to a conflict, you should choose an environment that is not too secluded. You should take every precaution to keep yourself and your friend safe during the conversation. Public places like coffee shops or restaurants are ideal locations.For example, if you think that your friend will react in a hostile way, meeting at their home alone might be would be a bad idea.

, Before you meet your friend, plan out exactly what you want to talk to them about. If you are uncertain or jump from thing to thing, they will feel like the conversation is a critic of them rather than a concern about what they are doing. Having your talking points planned ahead of time lets you keep the conversation moving in an organized and productive way. You can start by asking yourself some simple questions like:What is your friend doing?
Why do they want to do this?
Do you think you can talk them out of it?
Is it necessary to discuss it?

, No matter what your friend is doing, they have a reason for their actions. They may not be good reasons, or make sense to you, but nonetheless they are guiding how your friend behaves. You must pay attention to those reasons, and avoid the urge to dismiss them when your friend presents them to you. Instead, acknowledge that you can see why your friend wants to do something, but that you still disagree with the action.For example, if your friend wants to quit school because they don’t like a teacher, you can acknowledge their position without agreeing that they should quit school. Try saying something like “I know what it feels like to have a teacher that you don’t like. It happened to me last year.”

, When delivering a message, you should be careful not to accidentally place blame on the other person. The technique for avoiding accidental blame is called “I” statements. When using an “I” statement, you will tell your friend what you feel, instead of telling them what they are doing wrong.For example, instead of saying “You are making a big mistake by dropping out of school,” you should rephrase that message by saying something like “I feel that dropping out of school is not usually a wise decision in any circumstance.”

, If you don’t have any backup for your opinion, your friend is likely to just see it as your opinion against theirs. To strengthen your argument, refer your friend to information, studies, or experts that support what you are telling them. This will show your friend that you have done your research, and that they should too.For example, you might show your friend a studies that have found that students who finish school make considerably more money than those who don’t.

, If your friend does not feel comfortable confiding their reasons or actions in you, you can help them by urging them to find someone that they are comfortable with. This person may be a parent, a teacher, or another friend. Some people also feel more comfortable talking to a counselor than someone they know personally.You could say something to your friend like “I am worried about what you’re doing. You don’t have to talk to me about it, but you should talk to someone.”

, If you are trying to prevent your friend from doing something, it might help to reach out their family. Parents and siblings might be able to influence your friend’s decisions even more than you can. However, you should only do this if you are concerned for your friend’s well-being and not as a way to manipulate a friend.For example, it would be appropriate to involve your friend’s parents in a discussion about them quitting school. It would not be okay to involve your friend’s parents if you are trying to convince your friend to hang out with you more.

, In the case that your friend is doing (or planning to do) something harmful to themselves or someone else, you need to get help immediately. Reach out to a parent, teacher, counselor, or even the police. Your friend may be mad at first, but you will have saved them from being seriously hurt or spending time in prison.For example, if your friend is talking about committing suicide, you should get help immediately.

Paint a mental picture of what you want.,
Follow a script.,
Offer an alternative.,
Consider their needs.,
Avoid lying.",How to Tell a Friend You Need Some Space1," You are always less likely to hurt someone’s feelings if you can communicate how you feel and what you need without making them defensive. Try to describe in detail how you feel, and help them picture what you need.For example, you could say, “I have had such a hard work week. In an ideal world, I would be able to lie in my bed all day. Can I ask you a favor? Would you mind if we didn’t hang out tonight?”
If you need more time than that, you could say, ""I am going through a lot in my world right now, and I really need some time to reevaluate things. Can I ask you a favor? It's a big one. Would you mind if we didn’t hang or talk for a few weeks?”;
, If you want to politely decline social invitations, but you are feeling shy, just follow a script. This will help you not to overly-apologize. It is perfectly okay to say “no” without saying “I’m sorry.” Here are a few samples:


When you just want to say no: “My week has been really busy. I think I need to take it easy tonight. Thanks though!”
When you don’t want to hang out with a whole group: “Thanks for thinking of me, but I have to pass. Would you want to make some plans just for the two of us? I need a breather from group situations.
When you aren’t up for it tonight, but still want to meet up another time: “This sounds like so much fun! Would it be possible to get a rain check?”
When you really don't want their friendship anymore: ""I don't know how to say this, but I just don't think we really mesh with each other. I'm going to put this friendship on the back burner for a while.""

, Any time you ask a friend for space, you run the risk of making them feel unwanted. If this is a friendship you want to hold on to, you can minimize these feelings by offering an alternative.If you are not up for going someplace really public, maybe you would be okay with just handing out together at home?
If you really just need to be alone right now, maybe you could make plans for next week?
If you need space for quite a while, maybe you would be okay with just texting once or twice a week?

, All relationships involve give and take. If this is a friendship you'd like to preserve, think about your friend’s needs as you assert your own need for space. If they need reassurance or attention to feel happy, perhaps you could agree to check in with them.
Perhaps if they realize they have a need for reassurance and attention, they could get that need met in some other way while you recharge.
There is almost always some way for you to both have your needs satisfied.

, Whatever you do, don’t fabricate a lie to get out of hanging out. It is perfectly normal to want space. It is nothing to be ashamed of or to be sorry about, so there is no reason to lie. It won’t make you feel good and you won’t enjoy the space you receive. It is likely your friend will find out anyway!

Wait until you’re not angry.,
Practice what you are going to say.,
Just say it.,
Establish boundaries.,
Be persistent.",How to Tell a Friend You Need Some Space2," Sometimes your need for space can be more serious than simply “needing to recharge.” If the actions of someone upset you and that is why you want space from them, wait until you’ve cooled off to let them know.You will be more level-headed and better able to articulate why you need space.

, Especially if the conversation may grow heated, it is a good idea to rehearse the conversation ahead of time.Start by making an outline of your most important points. What do you need your friend to know?
Once you have your outline, practice speaking in the mirror.
You can always bring the outline with you if you think you may forget an important point.

, No matter how you go about it, the important thing is just to say what you need to say. Preparation is only effective up to a point. After that, you have to take the leap. Don’t over think it and don’t put it off. Just pick up the phone and call., If you feel that your friend is frequently overwhelming your space or if you don’t feel like your requests for space are being heard, you may need to set some boundaries.Healthy boundaries are the foundation of a healthy friendship.


Explain which behaviors are okay, and which others are not.
For example, maybe it is okay for them to email or call, but not okay from them to drop by unannounced.
If you want to sever the friendship permanently, it is important to voice it.

, Your need for space will not evaporate. When you need space, make sure you get it. Subtle approaches may work sometimes, and at others you may need to be more direct, but chances are, you will need to assert your need for space more than once. Keep at it! Claiming the space you need is a powerful act of self-love!"

Ask for space because your friend is notoriously flaky and you are frustrated with it.,
Decide what kind of space you need.",How to Tell a Friend You Need Some Space3," Maybe you’ve had a stressful week. Maybe you just feel stretched too thin.Give yourself the private time you need to recuperate by taking some space from your friend.

, Everybody lies at a different locations on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Do you find that you are more rejuvenating by time alone? If so, you may be more introverted. This means that taking some space for yourself is essential for you to feel good. Let yourself have it!, Many times we need space from friends because they bring stress into our lives. If you have a friend who is stirring up drama, give yourself permission to take some space. It is almost always a good idea to let things cool down., Are you tired of making plans with a friend just for them to break plans or reschedule? You can choose to stop making plans with that friend., Before you know how to ask for this space, you must determine what kind of space you are looking for.If you just need a night off, you may want to take a subtle approach. If you need to overhaul the nature of your friendship, your approach should be more direct.


Do you just need a night off?
Do you no longer want to hang out with this friend one-on-one, but would be okay in groups (or vice versa)?
Do you want to change the relationship itself (or even end it)?

Watch your snake’s health.",How to Look After a Reticulated Python," Reticulated pythons are some of the largest snakes in the world, usually between 10 and 20 feet long and weighing over 250 pounds, with larger ones recorded at 32 feet long and weighing 350 pounds. They need floor space amounting to 4 foot by 8 feet, and if you are not prepared to provide that, your python will not be as happy and healthy as possible., When you buy a new python, make sure it comes from a reputable breeder. A well-bred python will be healthy, well-tended to, and bee more temperamentally inclined to captive life. A good breeder will be able to provide detailed information on the python’s size, health, and history, so if you can’t get this, look elsewhere for your snake.You can buy wild snakes, but these animals tend to have more parasites and find it more difficult to adjust to a captive environment. Unless you have a specific reason for acquiring a wild python, you are better off getting one from a breeder.

, Pythons are large snakes, so you cage will need to be at least 2 feet tall by 3 feet wide by 6 to 8 feet long, and should likely be larger. Your snake should have enough room to roam around, but not so large that you can’t effectively control the temperature. It should be made of a strong, waterproof material, which will be easier to clean.If you have a baby python, they can survive in smaller areas until they begin to grow. A 10-gallon aquarium is roughly the right size. You may want something other than a glass aquarium, though, as they lack insulation and the ability to hold humidity.
This cage or environment needs a lock. Pythons are curious and inventive creatures, and they will explore any potential exits from their cage. You do not want your snake getting out on its own, so make sure you have some way to secure those areas.

, Your python will need something comfortable to slither on when it is in the cage. Newspaper and newsprint are good enough, though you can always use soft materials like aspen, cypress mulch, or pre-cut corrugated cardboard. Whatever you put down, make sure you check it daily for waste, and replace it when necessary.Make sure there aren’t any corners or sharp objects in the cage. Reticulated pythons can be curious explorers, and will hurt themselves on protruding items., Pythons aren’t very active, but will want some place they can hide away. It should be cozy and dark, and have an entrance large enough for your snake to enter and exit easily. A small box that the snake can curl up in comfortably should be enough, Do your best to provide different temperatures in different parts of the environment. Pythons are cold-blooded, so they need different temperatures depending on how they feel. The temperature can range from 76 to 92 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 33 degrees Celsius), depending on what part of the cage the snake is in.To create heat in certain areas, you can install a heat pad or heater under the enclosure floor, or even use heat tape or even a heat lamp. If you use a fixture in the enclosure, make sure it is secure so the snake cannot pull it off.

, Pythons are predators, and need to eat meat. This does not need to be alive, but at least warm. Frozen mice or chicks are available, though you should thaw them in warm water before providing them to your snake.Most reticulated pythons will eventually accept frozen or dead food, but occasionally some will not. If that is the case, you need to be prepared to supply live food as long as you have the snake.

, You want your python to have one prey item, about the size of the thickest part of the snake’s body, once every 7 to 10 days. You can space that out to up to 2 weeks between feeding if you are worried about overeating, or gave your python a particularly large meal. Keep a regular feeding schedule, which will help your snake adjust to your presence, and help you keep track of its growth and habits.Your snake’s size will be tied to its feeding, meaning the more it eats the bigger it will get. Be careful, as overfeeding can lead to health problems, just like in other animals.
Reticulated pythons are usually more active in the evening or at night, so this is a good time to offer food., If you are changing your python’s diet, or want to keep a distance when providing food, you can use tongs. When using them, be sure to move the prey in small, slow movements near the python’s head to get its attention. Do not force the feeder into their face, or bump them on the head with it., Your snake will need water, so there should be clean drinking water always available. Put it in a large, easy-to-clean dish, one that can’t be tipped over easily. While your snake may enjoy sitting and soaking in the water, the dish does not need to be big enough for that. Replace the water and clean the dish as necessary., Handling your snake can be important for making your python comfortable around you, and gives you the opportunity to show him off to other people. This can also be helpful when you need to interact with your snake, such as during feeding or when you need to check on its health.When you pick up the snake, gently get a hold on the upper part of its body, avoiding the head. Make sure you provide support to this part of the body as you pick it up, which will keep your snake calm. Don’t grab the tail or lower part of the body.
Make sure your snake is awake before you handle it. Pythons are quick to react, and if you startle it while sleeping, it may attack on the presumption you are food. Before going into the cage, tap the glass to get a response so you can know it’s awake.
Always have at least one other experienced person within earshot when you are handling the python. Pythons are quite strong, and you’ll need the extra hands in case something goes wrong.
If your snake bites you, one way to get it off quickly is to dump some mouthwash into its mouth. This will tell the snake you aren’t food, and cause it to let go. Reticulated pythons are not poisonous, but if you are bitten you should treat it like any other bite, cleaning and disinfecting the wound.

, Elevated hormone levels during the season can make pythons, especially males, moody and difficult to handle. You may notice male pythons with a reduced appetite, attempting to wrestle with you, or pacing more often around the cage. These are signs that he wants to breed, and he will be a bit high-strung for a while.Be careful when handling multiple males during the season. The next snake you interact with may smell the previous male, and react by trying to push you out thinking it is him.

, Reticulated pythons are quite intelligent, and can be taught to trust and respect you once they establish that you are not a threat. The key to establishing this trust is consistent and routine interaction, which allows the python to know you are not a threat. Regular feeding and interaction helps the snake learn to recognize you. This will help make your python easier to work with, and lessen the chance of injury or confrontation., This is a common behavioral problem among reticulated pythons, and one that can lead to further health problems if you don’t watch it. Your snake will regularly push its face against the cage or other object, causing it to swell. In worse cases, it can cause damage to the head, or lead to mouth rot or an abscess. Snakes push because they are uncomfortable, so check out the temperature or humidity in your cage, make sure its hiding spot is secure, or check for other health problems., Like any other pet, pythons are susceptible to diseases and other health problems. If you do notice trouble, you can perform some first aid yourself, but you should also consider talking to a vet as well. Reticulated pythons can be the victim of several common health problems, which you should be keeping an eye out for.Parasites. Captive snakes, like yours, are susceptible to mites and other external parasites. You can see them crawling on the snake’s skin, either red, black, or white. If you do notice mites, soak the snake in a warm bath for a few hours to let them fall off, then completely clean and disinfect the enclosure.
Respiratory infections. Pneumonia in particular is common with reticulated pythons, and can be prevented by making sure there is proper heat gradient in the enclosure. If your python is suffering from an infection, you may hear it wheeze when breathing, and it will tend to keep its head elevated. In more advanced stages, you will see a foamy secretion from the snake’s mouth and lower throat. If you see this, contact your vet immediately.
Inclusion Body Disease (IBD). This is a serious and deadly disease that affects pythons and boa constrictors. Snakes carry the virus, similarly to HIV in humans, and it can cause painful death. A snake with IBD may show signs of neurological problems, like “stargazing” (where the snake twists its head and neck upward to look toward the sky), as well as regurgitating meals or even refusing to eat."

They have a variety of color possibilities, including a mix of greens and sometimes reds, browns, blacks, oranges, greys and yellows. Garter snakes are often referred to as garden or gardener snakes; they tend to be the most commonly encountered garden snake and if you do have them, they're a useful insect eater.

Know the snakes.,
Cottonmouths.,
Rattlesnakes.,
Copperheads.,
Coral snakes.,
Look at the color patterns.,
Check out their head shape.,
Look for a rattle.,
Look for the heat sensor.,
Watch out for mimics.,
A water moccasin will have elliptical pupils and the harmless water snake will have round pupils.",How to Identify a Venomous Snake1," There are four different types of venomous snakes in the United States: cottonmouths, rattlesnakes, copperheads and coral snakes.;
, The cottonmouths have elliptical pupils and range in color from black to green. They have a white stripe along the side of their heads. They are often found in or around water, but have also adapted to live well on land. Young snakes have a bright yellow tail. They are often loners, so if you see multiple snakes coexisting peacefully, it is probably not a cottonmouth.

, Look for the rattle on the tail. Some harmless snakes imitate the rattle by brushing their tails through leaves, but only rattle snakes have the button-like rattle at the end of the tail. If you can't see the rattle, they also have a heavy triangular head and elliptical eyes like a cat's.

, These beauties have a similar body shape to cottonmouths but are much brighter, ranging from coppery brown to bright orange, silver-pink and peach. The young have yellow tails as well.

, Another beautiful but deadly snake is the Coral snake—so beautiful that other snakes—not-venomous ones such as the Milk snake—look just like them. They have distinctive coloring, though, with a black, yellow and red bands, a yellow head, and a black band over their nose. One rhyme to help distinguish coral snakes from king snakes is 'Red to yellow, kill a fellow. Red to black, friend of Jack.' Another variation is 'Red on black, venom lack; red on yellow, deadly fellow'. However, most of the time coral snakes will not bite - they are very shy. There are no known deaths from the Arizona coral snake and only a few from the Eastern Coral snake.

, Venomous Snakes in the U.S. tend to have varying colors. Most snakes that are one solid color are completely harmless. However, cottonmouths are also venomous so this is not a foolproof way to tell them apart. Also, beware of venomous escaped pets.

, Non-venomous snakes have a spoon-shaped rounded head and venomous snakes will have a more triangular head. this is because of the venom glands (this is less noticeable on the coral snake).

, If the snake has a rattle on its tail it is a rattlesnake, and therefore venomous. However, some non-venomous snakes do mimic the rattle by rattling their tails, but lack the rattle ""buttons"" that sound like little salt shakers.

, Some venomous snakes in the U.S. will have a small depression between the eye and the nostril. This is called a pit (hence ""pit viper""), which is used by the snake to sense heat in their prey. Coral snakes are not pit vipers, and lack this feature.

, Some non-venomous snakes mimic the patterns and behaviors of venomous snakes. Rat snakes can look like Rattlers, and harmless Milk and King snakes can look like Coral snakes.


Always treat any snake as a venomous snake if you are uncertain whether it is venomous or non-venomous. And though you should remain cautious, do not kill any snake—it could be illegal to do so, and killing non-venomous snakes allows venomous snake and vermin populations to grow.

, Either way, leave it alone and allow it to leave the area.

Check for stripes versus blotches.,
Look at whether black rings separate red and yellow rings.,
See if the red bands touch the yellow bands.,
Examine the size of the snake.,
Think about your own location.,
Look at the snake's face.,
Be aware of the symptoms of snake bite.,
Seek medical attention immediately for a snake bite.,
Do not attempt to treat the wound alone.,
Avoid attempting to trap the snake.",How to Tell the Difference Between a Milk Snake and a Coral Snake," The differences in stripe patterns are typically used to tell the difference between milk and coral snakes. However, some milk snakes do not have stripes. If you notice a snake with blotches instead of stripes, it's more likely to be a milk snake.However, do not assume a snake is not venomous simply because it has blotches. You should still stay away from a wild snake to avoid getting bitten.;
, Both corral snakes and milk snakes contain black, yellow, and red splotches. With milk snakes, there will be a black ring between red and yellow rings. The red and yellow rings will not touch on a milk snake., If red and yellow bands are touching, this is a bad sign, you are probably looking at a coral snake, which is venomous. You should stay away from snakes that have red and yellow stripes that touch.Be careful in areas with leaf piles or burrows. Coral snakes tend to hide in such areas.

, Milk snakes generally tend to be smaller than coral snakes. Most milk snakes are less than three feet long. However, if you live in Honduras, some milk snakes can grow as long as 5 feet in length., Coral snakes are typically only found in three regions in the United States. Therefore, you're unlikely to find a coral snake if you don't live in those areas.Coral snakes can live in Arizona and certain parts of Texas.
Coral snakes can also live around Florida and its bordering states. Coral snakes may live in Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Alabama, South Carolina, and North Carolina.

, Coral snakes have a solid black face. There will be a yellow band directly below the solid black marking on the face. It may be difficult to see a coral snake's eyes due to the coloring on the face., While you will usually be aware if a snake bites you, a young child or animal may not be able to tell you they were bitten. Make sure you know the symptom of a snake bite, especially if you live in an area that has poisonous snakes. Symptoms include:A puncture wound with redness and swelling surrounding it
Labored breathing
Nausea or vomiting

, Even if you're not experiencing symptoms like pain or swelling, you should always seek medical help in the event of a snake bite. You should call 9-1-1 or the emergency services in your area. A worker should instruct you whether to come into the emergency room or make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible., You should never attempt to make a tourniquet, slash the wound with a knife, or do any other treatments on your own. You should always seek out professional medical help in the event of a snake bite., Most snakes will not attack you unprovoked and are not dangerous, even if they are venomous. If your'e concerned about poisonous snakes in your area, contact animal control. Do not attempt to trap or kill a snake on your own. Not only can this be dangerous, it may be illegal in your area."

Look out for the Adder!",How to Identify a Venomous Snake2," The adder—common viper, or vipera Berus—features a distinctive V- or X-shaped marking on its head. It also features a vertically-slit pupils, dark zigzag stripes on its back, and dark ovals along its flank. The dark patches range from gray to blue to black (most commonly). The background color is usually a pale gray, though can be brown or brick red.


The adder is common throughout the UK, mostly in the southern regions. While painful and requiring prompt medical attention, adder bites are generally not fatal.
Adders are not particularly aggressive unless disturbed. Given a choice, they'd rather be anywhere than near you.

Watch out for the Big Four.,
The Common Cobra.,
Common krait.,
Russel's Viper.,
Saw-scaled viper.",How to Identify a Venomous Snake3," India is host to a number of snakes, many of them venomous, but the Big Four are widely distributed and quite venomous.

, When you think of snake charmers and snakes in a basket (vs. snakes on a plane), the snake you're thinking of is the Cobra.


They range in length from about 3 feet (0.9 m) to about 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, and have a broad head. They can spread a hood behind their head, which gives them their famous, very scary appearance.
Their body color varies based on their geographical location. Generally, cobras in southern India range in color from yellow to brown. Northern India cobras are usually dark brown or black.
Cobras are shy—they'll threaten when provoked, but would prefer to back away. If they attack, they will strike quickly—and sometimes repeatedly. Larger cobras may latch on and dig in, releasing maximum venom!
In the event of a cobra bite, seek medical attention immediately—the common cobra is responsible for a large number of human deaths across India.

, The krait ranges in length from about 4 feet (1.2 m) to about 6 feet (2 m). Their head is depressed, slightly broader than the neck, with a rounded snout. Its eyes are small and entirely black.


The krait's body is black, with single or double milky-white bands. Its scales are hexagonal in shape, and the subcaudal scales (those beneath the tail) are undivided.
The krait is nocturnal, and during the day can be found in dark, dry places. They're docile and shy during the day, but at night will attack if provoked.

, The Russel's viper is a stout snake, with a brown body mixed with reds and yellows. The body features three longitudinal rows of eye-like spots of dark brown or black, that start from the head and fade out towards the tail. The spots on either side are smaller and more rounded than the top spots.


The head is triangular, pointed at the snout, and much broader at the neck, and features two triangular-shaped spots. Its eyes have vertical pupils, and it's tongue is purplish black.
Russel's viper is venomous enough that you should seek treatment immediately. If you provoke one (and not just step on it accidentally), it will warn with a high-pitched whistle like a pressure cooker.

, These are the second most common vipers in India, after Russel's viper. They range in size from about 15 inches (40cm) to about 30 inches (80cm). Their body ranges from dark brown to red, gray, or a mix of those colors. Light colored spots of light yellow or very light brown, with dark-colored lines woven through.


The saw-scaled viper is very aggressive when provoked, and makes a saw-like sound by rubbing its side dorsal scales together. Don't stick around if you hear that sound—the saw-scaled viper is one of the fastest-striking species in the world!
If bit, get treatment. It may dry-bite on occasion, but only a medical expert can say for sure.

Fierce Snake.,
Eastern Brown Snake.",How to Identify a Venomous Snake4," AKA the Inland Taipan, the Fierce Snake has the reputation of being the most deadly snake on the planet. Its venom is more potent than any other species by far, and yet—there's no record of a human fatality caused by the Fierce Snake.


This bad boy can reach a length of over 6 feet (1.8 m), and varies in color from dark brown to a light straw. It's darker in the winter than it is in the summer. It's head can appear almost black.
It lives in the black soil plains where Queensland, South Australia, and the Northern Territory borders meet.

, Unlike the most venomous snake, the Inland Taipan, the Eastern Brown Snake is responsible for the most snakebite deaths in Australia. Like all snakes, they would much rather slither away than attack, but if they are threatened, or grabbed, or stepped on, all bets are off.


They can exceed 6 feet (2m) in length, and are very fast—especially on hot days. They're slender, with a variable color ranging from tan to gray or dark brown. Their belly is lighter, and has darker orange spots.
They inhabit eastern Australia, from the desert to the coast, and prefer open grasslands, pastures, and woodland.
Needless to say, if you're bitten by one of these snakes, get help immediately!

Look at the head.,
Observe the colors.,
Many people will try to judge if a snake is venomous by looking into its eyes.,
Look for a pit between the snake's eyes and nostrils.,
See if there is a rattle.,
Notice the underside scales on the tip of the tail.,
Check the bottom of the tail if you can.,
Watch water snakes swim.,
Examine the bite marks in case of a snake attack.,
Look out for the exceptions to the rules above:

The coral snake is venomous but has a round-shaped head while some non-venomous snakes may flatten their heads to resemble triangles when they are threatened.",How to Differentiate Between Poisonous Snakes and Non Poisonous Snakes," Most venomous snakes usually have triangular shaped heads.;
, Some venomous snakes such as the coral snake have bright colors.

, This is ineffective, because the information you gain from this observation only tells you what time of day the snake is active. Snakes that are nocturnal (hunt during the night) generally have slitted pupils, while snakes that are diurnal (hunt during the day) generally have round pupils. Some of the most venomous snakes in the world have round pupils, but many infamous snakes such as rattlesnakes have the classic slitted pupil.

, A venomous snake normally has a heat-sensitive pit there to locate warm-blooded prey. Non-venomous snakes lack such pits.

, A snake with a rattle on its tail must be a rattlesnake, which is venomous. The Florida Pygmy Rattlesnake often only has one segment of rattle and thus cannot make a warning noise.

, Most venomous snakes have one row of scales there while non-venomous snakes usually have two rows.

, The bottom of the tail (behind the anus) of venomous snakes looks the same as the rest of the belly. If the snake has a cross pattern (like a diamond shape) it is non-venomous. However, this may not be easy to find out, unless the snake is dead.

, Only venomous water snakes swim with their entire bodies visible on the water.

, Two close-set puncture marks would indicate that the snake has fangs and is venomous. By contrast, a ragged bite mark means the snake lacks fangs, which only non-venomous snakes have.

,






Some colorful snakes, such as the scarlet snakes, the scarlet kingsnake, and the red milk snake, are non-venomous.
The black mamba, the coral snake, the cobra, and the inland taipan snake are venomous but have round pupils. Pupil shape has nothing to do with whether a snake is venomous or not - but it does tell you when the snake likes to be awake!

Examine the snake's ring pattern.,
See if the snake has a black and yellow tail.,
Look at the color and shape of the snake's head.,
Learn rhymes to tell the difference between the two snakes.,
Remember that these rule apply only to snakes in the US.",How to Tell the Difference Between a King Snake and a Coral Snake1," Determine if red and yellow rings are touching; if so, this is a venomous coral snake.This simple color check is the easiest way to tell the difference between a coral snake and a scarlet king snake in the US.


On a coral snake, the ring pattern is red, yellow, black, yellow, red.
In the case of a scarlet king snake, the ring pattern is red, black, yellow, black, red, or maybe blue.;
, The venomous coral snake's tail has only black and yellow bands with no red. The non-venomous scarlet king snake's band pattern remains the same throughout the length of his body.

, Determine if its head is yellow and black or red and black. The coral snake's head is black, with a short snout. The scarlet king snake's head is mostly red with an elongated snout.

, People who live in regions where coral and scarlet king snakes are common have made up these easy-to-remember rhymes to help figure out which is which:


Red touches yellow, kills a fellow. Red touches black, friend of Jack.
Red touches yellow, kills a fellow. Red touches black, venom lack.
Red touches yellow, death says hello. Black touches red, keep your head.
Yellow touches red, you'll be dead. Red touches black, eat Cracker Jacks.
Red touches yellow, you're a dead fellow. Red touches black you're all right Jack.

, The suggestions in this article only reliably apply to coral snakes native to North America: Micrurus fulvius (Eastern or common coral snake), Micrurus tener (Texas coral snake), and Micruroides euryxanthus (Arizona coral snake), found in the southern and western United States.


Unfortunately, elsewhere in the world, the patterning can be quite different and no assumptions can be made about venomous or non-venomous natures of the snake without knowing the actual snake's species.
This means that they rhymes don't apply to coral snakes elsewhere, nor to the snakes that mimic them.

Be wary of logs and leafy areas.,
Look for king snakes climbing trees.,
Check for defensive behavior.,
Watch out for a coral snake's distinctive bite.",How to Tell the Difference Between a King Snake and a Coral Snake2," Both coral snakes and scarlet king snakes like to spend their daytime hours under logs and leaf piles on the ground. They may also be found in caves and crevices in rocks. Be very careful when lifting a rock or log, or entering an underground space., If you see a colorful snake with a ring pattern climbing a tree, it's probably a nonvenomous king snake. Coral snakes very rarely climb trees. You should still look carefully to make sure it's not a coral snake, and play it safe by not getting too close.

, When coral snakes feel threatened, they move their tails and heads back and forth in order to try to confuse their predators. King snakes don't display this behavior. If you see a snake wagging its head and tail strangely, it's probably a coral, so stay back.Coral snakes are very reclusive, and it's extremely rare to see them in the wild. They only strike when they feel extremely threatened, so if you see one displaying this behavior, you'll probably have time to get away.
King snakes received their name because they eat other types of snakes, including venomous ones. They don't tend to display this sort of defensive behavior, although they have been known to hiss and shake their tails like rattlesnakes.

, In order to inject its venom, a coral snake must clamp down and chew its prey. Since it's usually possible to fling the snake off before it has time to fully inject venom, people rarely die from coral snake bites. However, left untreated, a coral snake bite can lead to cardiac arrest and death.A coral snake bite is not extraordinarily painful at first. However, if venom has been injected, the victim will experience slurred speech, double vision, and paralysis so even if you don't feel anything after a coral snake bite still call emergency services.If you ever get bitten by a coral snake, stay calm, remove constrictive clothing and jewelry and get medical help immediately."

Feed your snake well.,
Keep your python in an appropriate enclosure.,
Line your snake's enclosure with the proper substrate lining.,
Provide adequate shelter.,
Provide adequate heating and lighting.,
Clean up after your snake regularly.,
Be careful when handling your snake.,
Consider breeding your snake.,
Care for hatchlings.",How to Care for a Blood Python," Like most snakes, the blood python will eat small mammals. As hatchlings, they will eat small mice. Food items should make a noticeable bulge in your snake, but it should not be uncomfortably large. A good rule is that the prey should be 125% the size of your snake’s widest point. Adult pythons will consume rats, guinea pigs, and even smaller rabbits.;
, Hatchling and juvenile blood pythons can start out in a 10–20 gallon (37.9–75.7 L) enclosure. Full sized pythons, however, need at least 10 square feet of floor space. The height of the enclosure does not matter because they are not arboreal.Since the only factor in enclosure size is floor space, keepers generally use an aquarium with a mesh lid, build their own enclosure, or use large plastic storage boxes with drilled holes for ventilation. All three options work well, but it is important to include plenty of ventilation. The number one problem with pythons is the lack or room for them to move around, so as adults, more room is better.


Never house two males together because they will fight and stress each other out, and only house a male and a female together if you plan on breeding. Blood pythons are very solitary animals and live best on their own.

, Newspaper is an inexpensive and clean substrate to use. If you are looking for a substrate that is more natural or decorative, use eco earth or coconut bark. All of these options hold moisture well. Do not use pine or cedar wood chips because their fumes are very toxic to reptiles.

, Give your snake an option of at least two different hides on opposite sides of the enclosure. These hides should be dark and snug for your snake so it feels safe and protected. Improper shelter conditions will cause stress for the snake.

, Blood pythons require a basking spot of 85-90F on one end of the cage because they need heat to function. The rest of the cage can stay at room temperature. It is important that the snake has a choice of temperatures. The heat required for the basking spot can be maintained with an overhead light bulb. Do not use heat pads because blood pythons are known for burrowing and they may burn themselves. No extra UVA/UVB lighting is required for this species.

, Replace newspaper substrates when soiled, and replace loose substrates every 2 months. Spot clean daily and keep the water bowl full and clean.

, Blood pythons can be unpredictable on an individual basis. Some will be very tame and understanding while others will bite and fight anything that enters their cage. This aggression mainly occurs with wild caught pythons, while as more are becoming captive bred, their temperaments are improving. Never touch or get near a python that is not looking at you or does not know of your presence because when startled they may bite you.

, Before you think about breeding two blood pythons, check to make sure the male and the female are fully grown, about two years of age, and are completely healthy. Once you are ready to breed you can introduce the two. There is no need to alter their environment during the breeding season such as lowering the heat or changing humidity percentages. Mating will likely occur within a week, and the female will lay her eggs in approximately 45 days. During this time feeding will stop and the male and the female can be separated again.As the female gets ready to lay her eggs provide her with a lay box filled with sphagnum moss or vermiculite, and keep it moist.


A blood python’s clutch of eggs is around 10-15. Once egg laying is completed, the eggs should be moved to an incubator because the female will not protect them. The eggs need to be kept at 88F for two months before they hatch

, Hatchling blood pythons will not make their first shed for up to three months after they are born. They can start to be fed after a week since birth. A ten-gallon enclosure is suitable for the first four months of life. Feed babies small mice and keep them on newspaper so they can be carefully monitored.

Purchase mice or rats.,
Choose between live or frozen.,
Get the right size for your snake.,
Provide water as well.",How to Feed a Snake1," In the wild, most snakes eat mice, rats, or other small rodents. These animals meet all of snakes' nutritional needs, so an all-mice or all-rat diet is completely sufficient to keep your snake healthy and happy. If you have just one snake to feed, you can purchase mice or rats from a local pet store. If you have a large number of snakes, you might consider breeding mice or rats for feeding purposes.


Be sure to purchase mice from a company you trust. Make sure the mice were fed properly and not treated with chemicals.
If you don't want to feed your snake mice or rats, you can feed certain species a combination of grubs, insects, fish and other prey that together meet the snake's full range of nutritional needs. However, as snakes tend to be picky about what they eat, and giving them a variety of different foods increases risk of exposure to parasites, it's advisable to feed your snake an all-rodent diet.Don't feed a snake live crickets, since crickets can eat its scales and harm the snake.;
, As snakes' popularity as pets has risen, more food product options have become available in pet stores. Many pet owners choose to buy live mice or rats to feed their snakes, but getting frozen rats that you serve thawed and warmed is a viable, convenient, and safer option. Do some research and decide which method is right for you and the needs of your snake.


If you choose to offer live mice, you'll be able to more accurately replicate the snake's feeding habits in the wild. However, using live mice creates the need for a lot of extra effort on your part. You'll need to either breed mice or run to the store to get more every few days. And if you put a live mouse in the cage when the snake isn't in the mood to eat, you'll have to take it back out and store it until you can try again.
Many find that using frozen and thawed mice or rats is more convenient and safer for the snake to eat. The drawback is that since this isn't how snakes acquire food in the wild, it can take some time before the snake is comfortable eating a dead carcass instead of catching its food live; however, keep in mind feeding pre-killed rodent will prevent your snake from being harmed or even in some cases killed by their prey if they were to fight back.
Many snakes start on live mice as babies and then can be worked toward frozen mice as they get older.

, Mice and rats are sold according to their size. Baby snakes and small snakes need smaller prey than larger snakes, which prefer large mice or rats. As your snake grows, you'll need to provide bigger prey, but prey that's too large can be hard on a snake's digestive system. A good rule of thumb is to choose food that's the same circumference as the largest part of your snake's body. The different sizes of food available are as follows:Pinkies: these are baby mice, called ""pinkies"" because they have yet to grow fur. Pinkies are good for baby snakes and small adults. For the smallest baby snakes, pinky parts are available.
Fuzzies: these are baby mice that have just acquired their first signs of fur. They're a little larger, so they're best for either large baby snakes, like boas, rat snakes, milk snakes, or medium adult snakes.
Hoppers: these are adult mice, sufficient for baby ball pythons (which are quite large) and most adult snakes.
Rat pups and full-sized rats: this is the biggest prey available, and should be reserved for large adult snakes.

, A bowl of water large and deep enough for the snake to completely submerge itself is good. Snakes don't drink often, but they need to submerge their bodies in water from time to time to stay healthy, and promote clean shedding.


Make sure the bowl stays clean. It should be disinfected every few weeks to kill bacterial growth.

Black morph -- background of gray with a rich black pattern.
Yellow morph -- background of tan with a sulfur yellow pattern.
Combination morph - Western and southern populations can have a mixture of a black and yellow morphs.;
, In general, a timber rattlesnake can be identified as having a wide head and narrow necks.


Their eyes are yellow, with elliptical pupils.
They have V or W-shaped crossbar markings, which create a distinct pattern across its back.They have a distinctive rattler on its tail made up of a special scales.

, The record length of a timber rattlesnake is 75.6 inches (189.2 cm)! These are large snakes, generally ranging from 36-60 inches (90-152 cm) in length and between 1.5-3lbs (.68-1.3 kilos).


They are the third largest venomous snake in the United States.
Baby rattlers are generally 1 foot (30cm) at birth. Unlike a lot of other snakes, timber rattlesnakes are born alive and not hatched from eggs., Timber rattlesnakes are a member of the pit viper family and have noticeable facial pits located on the side of its head between the eye and the nostril. Sensitive to radiant heat, these pits help the snake detect prey.

, Timber rattlesnakes have specially adapted scales on their tails, which they shake to make a distinctive rattle sound. This is a warning to predators to stay away!

, They are typically nocturnal and actively hunt at night. You may find them during the day because of thermoregulation, or the warming of its core temperature.Snakes that thermoregulate can often be found sunning themselves on rocks or in direct sunlight. While they are not as active during the day, they can still be found under these conditions.

, A few snakes share similar markings or coloration as the timber rattlesnake. Learn about local snakes that can be easily confused with the timber rattler.


Eastern milk snake -- Harmless to humans, the eastern milkshake shares a similar V or W pattern as the timber rattler. It, however, has a checkerboard pattern on its belly. It lacks the distinct pits on the side of the head. This snake is most often confused with the timber rattlesnake as it, despite not having rattle scales, shakes its tail to warn off predators.Common garter snake -- These common backyard snakes may share similar coloring of the timber rattlesnake, but lacks its size and distinctive rattle. Garter snakes sometimes have color stripes of scales (rather than the distinctive V or W pattern). This is a harmless snake; however, just like other wild animals, should be left alone if encountered.Eastern hog-nosed snake -- This non-venomous snake shares similar color variations as a timber rattlesnake, but is distinctive for its upturned nose and its square blocks of color (usually black) along its back. They reach about 46inches (115cm) and share the same habitat as the timber rattler., Timber rattlesnakes will hibernate in rocky ledges. Rocky outcrops with crevices and near forest openings are considered prime locations. You may find dozens of timber rattlesnakes hibernating in a single area.In general, hibernation occurs between the first frost and April.

, In more southern and western locations, like Texas, timber rattlesnakes can be found in swampy areas and thickets.Cut timber, tree stumps, and branches are great hiding spots for these rattlers.

, In the more eastern habitat, timber rattlers can be found in more rocky outcroppings near forests. For example, the forest and trails of the Appalachian mountain chain make a prime habitat for the timber rattler.

, Across all habitats, timber rattlesnakes can be found in two primary biomes: mountains and forests.These biomes share a general climate including temperate weather and terrestrial land.

Prepare the food.,
Offer thawed prey to the snake.,
If you're using live prey, remove it promptly if the snake does not feed within approximately ten minutes.,
Create an age- and size-based feeding schedule based on your snake's species.",How to Feed a Snake2," If you're using live food, no preparation is necessary as long as the food was raised in sanitary conditions. Frozen food, however, needs to be thawed properly and heated to a temperature that makes it more appealing for a snake. If you're using frozen pinkies, fuzzies, hoppers or rats, follow this method for thawing and preparing the food:


Lay the frozen food on a paper towel and set it near a fan. The small body will quickly thaw. Optionally you can put the food in a plastic bag and then submerge it in warm water. Thawing can take anywhere from 10 minutes to a few hours depending on method and size of food. Check every so often to make sure the food is thoroughly thawed. Thaw only as much as you need for one feeding.
Heat the food. Many snakes won't eat if they can't sense the correct temperature that mimics a live food. You can heat the food in a bag with hot water or use a blow dryer for about ten minutes. Never use a microwave or oven as this can cause the food to explode.

, You'll have to get to know your snake before landing on the best way to offer food. Some snakes prefer to have the food set into the cage so they can find it for themselves, while others prefer to have it dangled in the cage, attracted by the movement this creates. Try both methods to figure out what works best for your snake.


When you offer food by placing it in the cage, you may put it on a small plate or in a shallow bowl that will keep it separate from the snake's bedding. A snake may rarely swallow its bedding.
When you offer food by dangling it in the cage, use a pair of tweezers or forceps. Some use their hands, but this is not recommended. Snakes with a strong feeding response may accidentally bite you confusing your hand's heat or mixed smell with the food's.
Whichever method you choose, give the snake time to decide to eat. Research your snake's species. Some may feed within a few minutes, but others (like ball pythons) may require leaving the thawed food in overnight. For most cases, if the snake does not eat the food over a short period, it may be re-frozen for later use if it is still fresh and not spoiled.

, Never leave your snake unattended with a live feeder. If the snake isn't hungry and the prey stays in the cage, it might try to bite or scratch the snake in an attempt to save itself. Place the prey back in a holding container and try again next scheduled feeding.

, In general, baby snakes generally only need food about once a week. As they get larger and older, snakes need to be fed less often (keeping in mind the feeder will be larger). Be sure to check out some care sheets and do your research to see how often and at what sizes you should be feeding your snake.


As you change the feeding schedule, keep in mind that you shouldn't try to force a snake to eat. Offer the food, then take it away if it isn't wanted.

Make sure the food is warm enough.,
Consider the braining technique.,
Try rubbing it with a lizard.",How to Feed a Snake3," If you're serving frozen and thawed mice, it's important to heat them enough so that they seem as though they're still alive or were just recently killed. This is especially important for boas and pythons, which have receptors in their faces that can sense heat coming from their prey, triggering a feeding response.Try holding the prey against a warm light bulb for a few moments before offering it.
Don't heat mice in the microwave unless you have one reserved for that specific purpose. If you use a microwave, use very low power setting.

, Puncturing the prey's brain releases a scent that can help it seem more attractive to a snake. This technique can be used on either live or dead mice, though it's not easy to do if you're squeamish. If you wish to try this method, use the following steps:Insert a sharp knife or scalpel into the mouse's frontal lobe, at the top of the head.
Insert a toothpick into the would and draw out brain matter.
Smear the brain matter on the mouse's nose.

, It sounds strange, but you can make a dead mouse more appetizing to a snake if you rub it with the body of a lizard. Purchase a dead anole, swift, or fence lizard from the pet store and apply its scent to the body of the mouse. While this method isn't really feasible to use every time you need to feed the snake, it's a good way to get the snake used to eating the food you're offering.


This is a particularly good method to use when you're introducing a snake used to eating live mice to frozen food. It can take a few tries to get the snake used to eating food that has already been killed.Other methods of helping a picky eater include changing feeder size or color. Also try changing types of feeder (ie. if you tried a rat, try something else like a mouse, gerbil, etc.). Try turning off the lights. Some snakes, like ball pythons, are nocturnal are more active during the evening or at night. You can also try dipping the feeder in chicken broth. Try rubbing the scent of another animal on your feeder (ie. used bedding from gerbils/hamsters/etc.).

Choose between frozen and live rodents.,
Choose the right sized rodent.,
Feed your snake about once per week.,
Make sure you get your feed from a good source.,
Handle your snake’s prey with forceps, tweezers, or tongs.,
Put a frozen mouse into a plastic baggie.,
Decide whether to feed your snake in its vivarium or in a feeding tub.,
Dangle the mouse into your snake’s vivarium or feeding tub.,
Give your snake some privacy.,
Don’t handle your snake after feeding it.,
Maintain warm and cool temperature zones.,
Consider if your snake is shedding if it doesn’t eat.",How to Feed a Corn Snake," While some people think that using live prey seems more natural, most captive bred snakes have never had live or wild-caught prey. Live prey is more expensive and less convenient to purchase and store. More importantly, live rodents can injure your pet by biting or scratching, and can spread diseases or parasites.If you caught your pet snake in the wild, it might reject thawed rodents and only want to eat live prey.
Check with your pet store to make sure your store-bought corn snake was raised on thawed rodents. Whether a snake has been raised on live prey is typically listed on its description, or a store employee can let you know.
If you need to feed your corn snake live prey, don’t leave the room. You’ll need to make sure the live rodent doesn’t injure your snake.If an hour or two has passed and the snake has not eaten, remove the prey, place it in another cage with a food and water source, and try again the next day.;
, In general, do not feed your corn snake anything larger than 1.5 times the size of its midsection.If your corn snake is a hatchling, feed it thawed pinkies, or mice that have not yet grown fur. Feed your hatchling one to two pinkies per week. As it grows, switch to fuzzies, which are mice that have just started to grow fur. Start with one per week, and eventually progress to two as your snake matures.Check the size of your baby snake’s midsection to determine the size of their prey. If it’s a very small hatchling, pinky parts are also available.
Casually observe your snake on a regular basis so you can get to know its behavior. Look for when it moves around its cage as if it were hunting, and begin to structure your feeding time by gauging when your snake looks hungry.

, When your corn snake is a baby, you will need to feed it once every five to seven days. When it’s an adult, you will need to feed it every seven to 10 days., Big name pet stores tend to carry frozen rodents from good sources. Buying in bulk from a pet chain or an only reptile or snake society can save you money. You can see if your area has a local herpetologist, or reptile expert, or herpetology society. Consider consulting with them, or alternatively a local veterinarian, about local bulk frozen rodent buying options., Forceps and similar tools reduce the risk of snakebites by keeping your hands a safe distance from they prey and your snake's mouth. If you do touch your snake’s prey, or if you have a pet rodent, wash your hands before feeding your snake or putting your hands in its habitat. Otherwise, you’ll smell like prey and run the risk of getting bit.

, If it’s not already individually bagged, put a frozen mouse into a bag. Heat up about 2 cups of water on the stove or in the microwave. Place the mouse in the bag into the water and let it sit for ten to fifteen minutes, or until thawed..


Ensure that the water is not boiling, or you might melt the plastic baggie.
Don’t thaw a mouse using a microwave or stove. If it cooks, your snake might reject it or get sick from eating it.
To check if it's ready, poke the mouse's abdomen in a few places. If there are no hard spots, the mouse is ready for feeding.
The time it takes for the mouse to thaw depends on its size. Smaller mice will thaw sooner than large mice.

, Some snake owners prefer to feed their snakes in a special feeding tub. This will condition your snake not to expect food when you put your hands into its habitat, thus reducing the risk of bites. The feeding tub should be a container that can comfortably enclose your snake and fit into the vivarium.If you use a feeding tub, place your snake into the tub before feeding, feed it, then once it has swallowed the mouse place the snake and feeding tub into the vivarium.
Let it slither out of the tub back into the vivarium on its own time instead of lifting the snake out of the feeding tub to put it back into its habitat.

, Whether you opt to feed your snake when it’s in its vivarium or using a feeding tub, the process is basically the same. Use your forceps or tongs to dangle the mouse by the tail about 5 inches (12.7 cm) from your snake's head. Give it a few shakes, as snakes prefer moving targets.The snake should strike within a minute or so. Once the snake grabs the mouse, let it go immediately.

, Corn snakes prefer to eat in the dark and, especially with new owners, are most comfortable eating alone. Once your snake has grabbed the mouse, close the vivarium or cover the feeding tub (making sure there’s still air flow) and leave the room, closing the door behind you. After a few feeds, the snake may be comfortable eating in front of you, but make sure to leave him/her alone for the first few feeds or if it is a hatchling.Think about when a snake is eating in the wild: it can’t really defend itself or quickly escape danger while it’s swallowing prey.
Because eating is such a vulnerable time, some snakes, especially hatchlings, need to get used to you and decide that you’re not a threat before they’ll eat in front of you.

, Give your snake time to digest its food. Handling it while it’s digesting can cause regurgitation and other problems. Make sure to wait two days after feeding time before handling your snake.In addition, avoid handling your snake the day that you feed it. Handling it too much just before feeding time can also stress your snake out, which will reduce its appetite.

, Snake habitats need to have a temperature gradient, which means one end needs to be warm and the other cool. This helps them maintain their body temperature, and is particularly important during digestion. Temperature imbalance can result in your snake refusing to eat or regurgitating.Use heat lamps and an accurate thermometer to maintain temperatures of 80 to 86 degrees on the warm side and no less than 65 degrees on the cool side.
Make sure there are plenty of hiding places in both temperature zones. Your snake might harm itself if there’s only one hiding place and it doesn’t leave that zone to regulate its temperature.

, If your snake doesn’t want to eat, but doesn’t appear to be stressed and the temperature is right, it might be because it’s about to shed. Check to see if its skin is dull, eyeballs are bluish. If so, your snake is preparing to shed and will not eat during the shedding process. It will resume eating normally as soon as it’s completely shed its skin.If your snake refuses food but is not shedding, stressed, and the temperature is correct, consult a veterinarian.

Keep the weather in mind.,
Balance size with functionality.,
Choose a semi-shaded area.",How to Build an Outdoor Turtle Enclosure1," You should only build an outdoor enclosure for your turtle if you live in an area that is relatively warm year round. A good rule of thumb is to see whether your turtle breed is native to similar climates. For instance, if you have a box turtle it’s a good idea to make sure that box turtles are native to your area before you plan an outdoor enclosure., When it comes to outdoor enclosures, bigger is usually better though a larger size will generally require more maintenance.The size of your yard, and the portion of your yard you’re willing to devote to the enclosure, will determine the size of your enclosure. Turtles do not grow to the size of their enclosure; their adult sizes are independent from the habitat they live in. You need to build a large enough enclosure for an adult turtle when you have a baby turtle.You will need to build a larger enclosure if you intend to house multiple turtles there. A suitable size enclosure for three or four relatively small turtles, like box turtles, should be five feet by five feet in size., Turtles need direct sunlight both for their health and well-being. They also need a shaded area that they can retreat to whenever they feel the need to be out of the sun. Many people choose to build the enclosure next to their home or a shed, since this creates a shaded area for a portion of the day and acts as a fourth wall for the enclosure.If you do choose to build along the side of your home, east and south facing walls are ideal locations since they receive sunlight early in the morning. This way, turtles can warm up after the night and it will mimic the daylight they’d receive in the wild.

Thaw the rodent in a bowl of warm water.,
Take the mouse out of the bowl when the timer goes off.,
Put the snake in its feeding area.,
Place the rodent in the area with the snake.,
If your snake is a picky eater, or has not eaten dead food before, you may have to work a little harder at it at first.,
Put the snake back in its enclosure and let it digest its meal in a warm dark area.",How to Feed a Snake Frozen Food," Do NOT thaw it in the microwave! As tempting as that may seem, it will cook the meat and make your snake ill. Take a frozen rodent from the freezer, and place into a separate plastic bag. Place the bag in a bowl filled 3/4 of the way full with warm water. Put a cup or mug on top of the bag to keep the rodent completely submerged. Leave the mouse there for two hours, and don't forget to set a timer to remind yourself!;
, Prepare feeding tongs if you have them to pick up the mouse and keep your hand a safe distance from your snake's hungry mouth.

, It is highly recommended that you do not feed a snake in its enclosure, as this causes to the snake to associate anything coming into the cage as food (your hand, perhaps, could be mistaken). You can use a bin with high sides, another tank, or a bathtub even. Just make sure to close the drain!


Remember some snakes don't like being handled before or after feeding. In this case, you can feed your snake in it's tank as long as you use feeding tongs or place the mouse on a rock or branch within the cage. This will reduce the risk of you being bitten.

, Some snakes have no trouble eating a thawed rodent, and will begin eating in around 15 minutes or so. If so, you are done and you can return the snake to its usual enclosure.

, You can try wiggling the rodent by the tail in front of the snake. Use a pair tongs if you do, to prevent an accidental bite. If the snake seems afraid of the rodent, wiggle only a little and further away. If the snake is in strike pose but not attacking, try bopping the snake gently on the nose. However, don't do this if your snake is a Ball Python, as this may actually frighten the snake and have the opposite effect than you intended! With patience, you should find that the snake will strike and strangle the already dead rodent, and eat as normal. You may have to let the snake ""kill"" the dead rodent more than once the first few times. Don't be discouraged! Pre-killed food is a much safer and more humane way to feed your snake.

, Use caution when removing the snake, as it may still be in eating mode. Letting the snake crawl out of the bin and then picking it up usually fixes this.

Have a large enclosure.,
Add substrate.,
Add one or more shelters.,
Provide a heat lamp.,
Provide a UV source.,
Add climbing obstacles such as rocks and logs


Use around an inch thick flat and quite wide rocks to make a climbing material for your turtle.,
Add a swimming area.",How to Create an Indoor Box Turtle Habitat," Box turtles need lots of room. A small storage tub or aquarium really isn't enough.


The best enclosure is a ""turtle table"": a wooden, shallow, rectangular box at least 3' wide, 6' long, and 1.5' tall. Basically as big as you can make it (no such thing as too much room)!
A bookcase laid on its back may also work, if it has a solid-wood back (remove the shelves).
If you choose to build the enclosure from wood, you’ll need to waterproof the inside bottom and sides. Epoxy paint or polyurethane works well. So does lining the inside with pond liner. If you do this, make sure you avoid creating folds where water can get trapped.;
, Cover half the enclosure with plain dirt (has to be fertilizer/chemical free) and the other half with sphagnum moss. Sphagnum moss is a great substrate because it retains moisture very well, just mist it daily with lukewarm water.


Check with your vet before trying a different type of substrate, as some substrate (wood chips for example) can be a hazard to your turtle.

, Your turtles need a place to hide. A tipped-over flowerpot works well.

, Place it on a far end of the enclosure so that your turtle can easily move away to the cooler side if it gets too warm.


If your enclosure is made of wood or other flammable material, make sure the light is positioned so that the bulb and any hot metal parts don't touch the enclosure, or make any part of the habitat too hot to touch. If you can't touch it, you don't want your turtle touching it.

, UV light comes from the sun. If you can expose your turtle to UV light (via a patio or open window) for at least an hour daily then great! Otherwise, purchase a UV lamp. Pet stores sell lights that are a heat lamp and UV source in one, so that's pretty convenient.

, Also, use something lightweight but durable.
If your turtle is still young and tiny, it helps to use something that isn't too thick, to ensure it is easy for climbing.

, You can use a sturdy paint tray since it has a shallow area and a deep area. Put it in a corner and fill it with lukewarm water. This is also its drinking source. Or you can have a separate swimming area: get a large storage tub and fill it with lukewarm water that is deep enough to swim in, and with rocks to stand on. Let your turtle go swimming about 3 times a week; leave him in as long as he looks like he is having fun.

Gather materials.,
Clear and mark the area.,
Dig a trench at least one foot deep around the perimeter.,
Lay out the base timbers and attach corner supports.,
Add height to the walls.,
Use wire mesh to cover the enclosure.",How to Build an Outdoor Turtle Enclosure2," This enclosure will be 8 feet by 8 feet in size. You can choose to enlarge this pen, or change the specifications to fit your needs. This will be an enclosure that will comfortably house three or four small to medium size turtles. Use pressure treated wood since it will last longer. You should not use wood that has been treated with arsenic. Timber that is treated with ACQ (Ammoniacal Copper Quat) is good, while CCA (Chromated Copper Arsenate) should be avoided. You can find what the wood has been treated with on a tag that should be stapled to each piece of timber.For this portion of the project, you will need:


8-foot-long landscaping timbers
8-foot-long two-by-fours
3-foot-tall stakes.
2-foot-long two-by-two lumber
A box of nails for wood
Hammer
Measuring tape
Shovel
8 foot by 8 foot section of wire mesh

, Clear any debris out of the area so you have a clean space to work. Use a measuring tape and some wooden stakes to mark out the area. This will be a square shaped pen.

, You need to dig a trench so you can put the walls down into the ground. Turtles are skilled diggers and can easily escape the enclosure if the walls are not deep enough., With your trench dug, you will place one 8-foot-long landscaping timber into the each eight-foot long ditch. This will create a square shape, and the first part of your support wall. You will use the 2-foot-long two-by-two pieces of lumber to attach the walls at the corners.


Use the hammer to nail each corner together. The four corners should meet and be secure.

, Now that you have the corner supports attached, they will be significantly taller than the 8-foot-long landscaping timbers which are only a few inches tall when they are laid in the trenches. Using the 8-foot-long two-by-fours you will add height to the walls by nailing a two-by-four along each side to the two-by-two stakes. This will stack the timbers on top of each other and give height to the wall.


You can make the wall as tall as you’d like. The minimum height should be twice as high as the adult length of a turtle. So if you have turtles that reach 10” once they are mature, your wall should be at least 20” high. This ensures that your turtles can’t crawl over the walls and escape.
Turtles don’t fully grasp the concept of walls and when they are able to see out of the enclosure, like through wire mesh, they may spend their time pushing against the barrier, hoping to escape. A wooden barrier, at least as tall as the turtle’s height, prevents this problem., An outdoor enclosure needs to let sunlight in but not any predators hoping to grab your turtle. Wire mesh is a good barrier since it allows sunlight and rain to fall through while still offering protection.nail the wire mesh directly to the top of the enclosure, but be sure to leave a corner accessible so you can put food and water into the enclosure.


You can also build a removable top to the enclosure, but this will take more time and additional materials.

"
"
Plan a habitat.,
Plant turtle friendly plants.,
Add rocks and logs.",How to Build an Outdoor Turtle Enclosure3," The ideal enclosure replicates their natural environment as closely as possible. However, the goal of the enclosure is to keep your turtles in and predators out so it won’t be able to completely mimic their natural habitat. Keep in mind that both aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles need a water and a land area., Plants are a great way to add hiding and sleeping areas for your turtles. It will also help to mimic their natural habitat, and make the enclosure more aesthetically pleasing. The types of plants you decide to add will depend on your climate, but make sure every plant is safe and non-toxic for turtles.You can keep the ground covered in grass, or you can add a substrate like mulch.


Some edible plants for your turtles include hibiscus, roses, geraniums, dandelions, mulberry trees, and pansies.Do not use pesticides in your turtle enclosure., Turtles are cold blooded, so they need a place where they can bask in the sun and soak up its rays. They enjoy having logs, sticks, and rocks to climb over and then flatter stones or logs to rest and bask on. You can collect a variety of logs and stones to help your turtles feel at home.

Determine the size of your water feature.,
Choose a semi-shaded area.,
Dig a shallow pool.,
Lay down a pool liner.,
Fill the pond with water.,
Place logs around the pond.",How to Build an Outdoor Turtle Enclosure4," All land and semi-aquatic turtles need a supply of clean, fresh water in their habitat. By creating a small pond, you provide your turtles with the water they need to swim, bathe, and drink. The size of your pond will depend on the number of turtles you want to have in the enclosure, and the space available. Pools should be large enough for turtles to exercise and move about freely. Take their adult length and multiple that number by 2.5; this is the minimum depth you’ll want the water to be. The length of the pool should be at least five times as large as their adult length. This gives them room to swim around and bask.For ponds with multiple turtles, you need a larger pond. Smaller ponds accumulate waste and cannot be properly cleaned.For land turtles, you want to create a shallow pond that is no deeper than a foot in the middle. The pond should have gently sloping sides so turtles can enter and exit the water easily.

, Direct sunlight can cause a small pond to heat to an unsafe temperature, and causes unwanted algae growth.Ideally, you want an area that is has both shade and sun coverage during all times of day. Putting the pond alongside your house or a shed will provide sun coverage for several hours a day as well.

, When you’ve decided where you’d like the water feature to go, you can start to dig. It can be whatever shape you’d like, and the depth will depend on the sort of turtle you have. Red-eared sliders do better in deeper ponds, while others prefer shallower water. Research the type of water your turtle species inhabits in the wild to get a good idea of how deep your pond should be.If you intend to have your aquatic turtles hibernate outdoors during the winter, the pool will need at least a foot of water below the ice to hibernate. Check your local area’s weather to see how thick the ice is in local ponds.

, You can purchase a pool liner online, from a large retailer, or from an outdoor good store. The liner will keep the water from seeping into the ground, which would become a big muddy mess. You will need to follow the manufacturer’s directions for the pool liner.


A concrete pool will last longer, but is a more complicated process to undergo. If you prefer to use a waterproof tarp, choose tan or canvas colored tarps instead of black. Black tarps absorb the sunlight and can overheat small pools., Using a hose, you can now fill the pond with water.

, Logs should be placed around the pond so that some can extend into the water. These help the turtles get in and out of the water, and it also provides them with a place to bask. Logs help to mimic the turtle’s natural habitats, and it also serves a decorative function."

Transplant the turtle.,
Remove filters and heaters.,
Take out large objects.,
Move the tank to a cleaning area.,
Empty all the water.",How to Clean a Turtle Tank1," Pick it up gently from the tank, and set it in a bucket, bowl, or the carrying case you brought it home in from the pet store.In this other container, put both enough water for swimming, and enough material--such as peat or rocks--to allow the turtle something to climb on. And for sanitary reasons, don’t use this secondary container for anything else but a temporary home for your turtle.Use a transplant container large enough to allow the turtle to be able to turn around while swimming. A transparent container is preferable.;
, Unplug and then remove the tank’s electric devices, and place them in a sink or bucket for cleaning. Remember where the devices were located for when you need to put them back. Keeping the same setup as before will avoid disorienting your turtle.

, One by one, remove any plastic or live plants, large rocks, or pieces of wood. Place them in a separate bucket that you will use only for this purpose, for sanitary reasons. Or if you decide to clean the tank in a bathtub, you can place them aside in the tub.

, Depending on how far you can carry the tank, either outside in a grassy area, or in a bathtub are good cleaning areas. Never try to carry a tank by yourself: be sure to ask someone, preferably an adult, to help you carry the tank. Position yourselves on opposite ends of the short sides of the tank, slide it slowly to the edge of its table, and pick it up from below with both hands.

, Lift one end of the tank until the water pours out completely. Ask someone to help you lift it if the tank is too heavy for you. Lift the tank from a squatting position, extending your legs, instead of standing over it and trying to lift it with just your arms and back.


If you have a substrate of small, gravelly rocks, you can leave those in the tank. If your substrate is some kind of organic matter such as peat or nut shells, discard and replace these during each cleaning.

Find an appropriate location in your home.,
Determine the size of the pond.,
Find a surface mount pond.,
Purchase a liner.,
Cut two-by-fours.,
Build the frame.,
Measure the pond.,
Place pond in the frame.,
Add a barrier around the basking area.,
Fill the pond with substrate.,
Build a ramp.,
Install a basking lamp.,
Add plants and other decorations.",How to Build an Indoor Aquatic Turtle Pond," You will need to find a large space in the house to fit the tank. Measure it out to determine how much space you have available.


Try to find a place that will suffer less damage if there is any sort of leak, that is easy to clean, and where the turtle can reside for a long time. If possible, you should also pick a site that will allow your turtle to get some natural light.;
, Keep in mind the amount of space for the location chosen in the house and that there will be a frame built for the pond to sit in, which will also serve as a basking/land area.

, Surface mount ponds cost $30-$90 and are available for purchase online. You will want to purchase one slightly smaller than the space you have allotted for the pond, because you will also want to build a frame and basking area so that your turtle can leave the water occasionally.., If you prefer not to get a pond, you can also purchase a large, water resistant liner. There is, however, a slightly greater possibility that a turtle could use its claws to puncture a liner., Purchase several two-by-fours verifying that they are all of the same dimensions. Use a miter gauge to cut the wood into the dimensions that you measured out. Set up a gauge block to the appropriate length so that all of your boards will be cut to the same length.You will need a large work space with proper tools for this work. A large garage is appropriate.

, Nail together beams to form two rectangles, one for the bottom and one for the top of the frame. Connect the two rectangles with support beams. Install one support beam for every foot of the perimeter of the rectangular frame.To bind the planks together, put wood glue on the edge and press together. Hold them together with bar clamps. Then nail several nails into the corner to hold them into place., You will want to see how much wood is necessary to hold the lip and the bottom of the pond in place. Cut wood appropriately and nail into place along the rectangular frame.

, Fill with water to check for leaks and see how the pond fits in the frame. The pond may fit differently with water in it and adjustments may need to be made. Do not wait to fill pond with water until it is in the home. You can empty this water out before moving the pond into position. It is just to check for leaks.

, The basking area can be of any size or shape. You will want to ensure that the turtle does not fall off the landing. Nail in a wooden enclosure around the perimeter of the basking area. Hardware stores sell small fences that could be nailed into the edge of the landing. Be sure that the barrier is significantly taller than your turtle.


Providing an area for your turtles to bask is important. Turtles regulate their temperatures, elevate their metabolism and increase the efficiency for their immune and digestive systems by basking., Sand and fine gravel are generally considered the best substrates. Standard gravel can be dangerous because turtles are known to eat it.A deeper coral sand substrate can be substituted for soft-shell turtles., You should provide some way for your turtle to walk up onto the basking area. Consider cutting a couple of two-by-fours and nailing them in to serve as a ramp.Alternatively hardware cloth or poultry netting can be attached to the pond, providing a ladder.Nailing shingles to the ramp can make it easier for your turtle to climb up., In the outdoors, turtles leave the water to get into the warm sun. The lighting you provide serves as a substitute. You will want to make sure that the lighting is positioned correctly above the basking site.


A UVB 2.5 lamp is usually 12 inches (30.5 cm) above the basking site and a UVB 5 lamp is usually about 18 inches (46 cm) above the basking site.The basking area should only be 10 °F (−12 °C) warmer than the water temperature to encourage basking. Areas that are too hot may discourage the turtle from basking or risk exposing the turtle to hyperthermia.Use a thermometer to check the temperature of the basking area and adjust the placement of the lamp accordingly., To make the aquatic pond more homey, you can add artificial or live plants such as water lettuce, water hyacinth or duckweed. Decorations such as wooden logs or artificial rocks also provide a personal touch.Be mindful not to include any plants that turtles are allergic to. Some common plants that are toxic to turtles are: azalea, christmas rose, daffodil, iris, ivy, jimson weed, mistletoe, morning glory, nightshade, and tobacco."

Rinse the substrate.,
Prepare a cleaning solution.,
Scrub the tank.,
Clean the devices and decorations.,
Rinse out the tank.",How to Clean a Turtle Tank2," Using either a garden hose or the bathtub faucet, fill the tank to about ¼ full with water, then empty it fully. Repeat this about five times, until the water in the tank is considerably clearer than when you started.


To empty the tank, lift it slowly at one end from a squatting position, extending your legs to lift the tank instead of lifting with your arms and back muscles. The tank should be almost in a vertical position before all the water drains out.
Ask someone, preferably an adult, to help you lift the tank if it is too heavy for you.

, Make a mixture of 0.5 cups (0.1 L) of chlorine bleach for every 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.Or combine 1⁄4 cup (0.1 L) of plain distilled white vinegar with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.


If you'll be doing the cleaning on a lawn or in an area near other vegetation, don’t use bleach or vinegar cleaning solutions, since these will kill plants. Instead, find a biodegradable, plant-friendly tank cleaner at the pet store.
Never use household cleaner, detergent, or disinfecting agent like dish or hand soap (Lysol, Comet, etc.) since the chemical residue is difficult to fully remove.
If the odor of chlorine or vinegar bothers you, check the pet store for a turtle-safe tank cleaner. Make sure to choose a plant-friendly, biodegradable one if you’ll be cleaning outdoors near plants.

, Dip a sponge or coarse rag in the cleaning solution. Scrub all sides of the tank, including the bottom, making sure to pay special attention to the corners and spaces where two panels come together. Debris tends to build up and get caught easier in these areas.


To keep the substrate out of the way, tilt the tank to one side so the rocks fall to that side. Scrub everything except the rocks, then tilt the tank to the other side and repeat the process. Finally, scrub the substrate as well.

, Take apart the filter according to its instruction manual, and scrub the individual pieces with the cleaning solution. Pay special attention to the filter by rinsing it under the hose or faucet. Scrub the outside of the heater, and clean any decorations, rocks, wood, and plastic plants as well. Rinse everything together in the bucket or tub, and leave them to dry.


Have someone clean your filter for you if you have cuts or scrapes on your hands, since they could become infected.Replace the filter bag once a month., Splash water over the tank with the hose or bathtub, being sure to remove all residue from the cleaning agent and leftover debris. Rinse all sides of the tank until there is no scent of either the vinegar or bleach remaining. Dry the outside with a clean towel.

"
"
Return the tank.,
Dechlorinate the new water.,
Check water temperature.,
Use testing kits to measure chemical levels.,
Add some salt.,
Return the turtle to the tank.",How to Clean a Turtle Tank3," Next, slowly carry the tank back to to its display area, being sure to have someone help you. Then replace all objects in the tank, being careful to reinstall the electric devices securely. Try to redo the tank arrangement as closely as possible to the way it was before the cleaning. This will prevent disorienting and causing stress for your turtle when it is returned to the tank.


Make sure to dry the tank with a clean towel before carrying it. This will prevent it from slipping out of your hands when trying to grip it.

, Your tap water may contain a level of chlorine that could be harmful to your turtle. But this can be controlled by adding an animal-safe water dechlorinator, available at the pet store.This is especially important if you have used bleach to clean the tank, as this will neutralize any remaining chlorine residue that could harm your pet.


Refill the tank using a clean bucket that you fill from the bathtub faucet.

, The temperature of the tank water should be about 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21-26.6 degrees Celsius). This is about average room temperature, so if the water is too warm or too cold, wait a half an hour and check the temperature again.If the water is too cold, use a water heater to raise the temperature.

, It is important to make sure that pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are in a safe range for your turtle. You can get a testing kit for each of these components at the pet store.Testing typically involves combining a small amount of tank water with a solution in a test tube, which produces a water color that indicates the chemical level.


The pH level should generally be between 7 and 8 for most turtles.But certain turtles have specific pH requirements. Be sure to ask an expert at the pet store about the precise pH level your turtle requires.If any chemical level is not in the acceptable range, you can buy additives that will raise or lower the levels of each component., Mix in one teaspoon of non-iodized salt per gallon of tank water. This can help to cut down the amount of harmful bacteria in the tank. It can also aid in protecting your turtle from skin and shell diseases., Gently put your patient turtle back on its favorite resting spot. Reward it with a treat like a nice worm, some lettuce, or another favorite food.


After everything is returned to the tank, clean your hands well with a strong antibacterial soap."
"
Remove the head.,
Wait at least 30 minutes.,
Cut off the claws and feet.,
Bring a big pot of water to a boil.,
Dip the turtle in the boiling water.,
Scrub the turtle with a hard brush.,
Remove the hind quarters.,
Remove the front end.,
Chop your meat.,
Retain the bones.",How to Clean a Soft Shell Turtle," Pull the neck out as far as you can, and remove the neck in one chop. A hand ax is the best tool for this. Leave as much of the neck attached as possible. Discard the head., Once the head has been removed, you need to wait for the turtle to ""bleed out."" For more effective bleeding, you can insert a bit of heavy wire into the very bottom of the turtle's shell (at it's rear), and hang the turtle up. This way, gravity can help the process along. This wire will also come in handy later when it is time to boil the turtle., Be aware that turtles can have violent reflexes even after they are dead, and that their claws are quite sharp. Using clippers (or your hand ax if you don't have clippers) remove all four feet and claws. Discard these., Turtles spend their lives wallowing in mud, muck, and rotting plant matter so it is important to get them thoroughly clean before eating. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil., Holding your turtle by the wire you inserted earlier, carefully lower it into the boiling water. Hold the turtle in the boiling water for 1 minute., In order to make sure your turtle is clean, you are going to need to scrub. Using a hard brush, scrub the turtle all over its body. A thin layer of skin may (or may not) come off during this process., With the turtle on its back, you should be able to see a Y-shaped crease near it's tail. Use your sharpest knife to cut here. Then cut along the underside of the shell in order to remove the hind legs and hind quarter in one piece., Using your sharp knife, cut around the front edge of the shell. Remove the neck and front legs in one piece. Continue cutting along the outer ridge of the shell, and remove this part as well., Once your front end, hind quarter, and shell edge have been removed, you are left with a pile of turtle meat. Use the cleaver or sharp fillet knife to carefully cut this into small pieces. As you do so, remove bits of fats and pieces of bone.You can cook this meat with gravy and serve it over rice.

, Large bones (like the shoulder bones and neck) can be retained and used to make turtle soup. If you plan to do this, leave a bit of meat on these bones."
"
Pick up the tortoise.,
Look at the lower shell.,
Touch the shell to confirm its shape.,
Look at the tail end of the plastron.,
Put the tortoise back down.,
Look for sex based on coloration if possible.,
Examine the carapace.",How to Sex Tortoises1," Hold the tortoise in both hands, being careful not to drop it. Hold the tortoise up high enough to be able to see underneath it. Do not flip the tortoise on its back. This is very stressful for the animal.If the tortoise is too big to lift above your head, try lifting it just slightly off the ground. Then, get down low enough to see underneath it.;
, The shell underneath the tortoise is called the plastron. Taking a look at this part of the shell is often the easiest way to tell a tortoise's sex.If the plastron is indented, or concave, it is most likely male. The concave plastron helps the male to more easily mount the female.
If the plastron is flat or convex, it is most likely female. A flat or bulging plastron helps the female carry more eggs.

, Determining the shape of the plastron might not be easy with only your eyes. You can feel the underside of the tortoise to determine if the shape is convex, flat, or concave.

, This is called the anal scute. The scute will have an indent that is shaped like a ""V"" or a ""U."" This indent is just underneath where the tail comes out.A male's anal scute usually forms a wider, more open angle, with the points farther from the marginals to allow the tail to move freely.
A female's anal scute will form a tighter angle, with points close to the marginals. This offers her more protection.

, Don’t hold the tortoise in the air for longer than necessary. This can be stressful for them. Return the tortoise to its usual environment as quickly as possible.

, Not all species of tortoise can be sexed based on the color of their shell. However, in general, males will have somewhat brighter coloration than females. This can be especially true when they are mating.Males are usually smaller than females, too. Red-footed tortoises are an exception. In this species, the males are generally the same size as the females.

, The carapace is the upper shell. In a few species, the shape of the carapace can reveal the sex of the tortoise. If you know your tortoise is one of these species, examine the shape of the shell for clues. For example:Male hinge-back tortoises have more elongated bodies, while the females are rounder.
Male Hermann's tortoises will be a little bit wider at the rear than the females of the same species.

"
"
Look at the tortoise’s tail.,
Assess the tail’s length.,
Compare the tortoise’s tail to photographs.",How to Sex Tortoises2," You may be able to do this without picking up the tortoise. If the tortoise is afraid, or in a new place, it might not appreciate being picked up. You can get down to the tortoise’s level to try to see the tail.Determining sex by the tail length is great for tortoises that you cannot pick up for whatever reason.

, There is no set length of a tortoise’s tail. However, males of most species have much longer tails than the females. You may notices the male's tail moving from side to side.A female’s tail is usually shorter than the end of a cotton swab.
A male’s tale will be longer than that, but still not huge.

, If you’ve never looked at a tortoise’s tail before, you might not have a sense of what is a long tail or a short tail. You can look up pictures of male and female tortoise tails for comparison.If you know the species of the tortoise, look up pictures of that specific species for accuracy.

"
"
Call your veterinarian.,
Bring the tortoise in to be sexed.,
Ask a zoologist.",How to Sex Tortoises3," Make sure they work with reptiles and are familiar with tortoises. If your veterinarian does not feel comfortable working with a tortoise, you can ask if they can recommend someone else you can call., You’ll need to make sure that the tortoise is fully mature. If the tortoise is not mature, the vet won’t be able to accurately determine the sex of the tortoise. Some species can take 15-20 years to become fully mature, so you may be waiting a while., If your vet is unable to see your tortoise, you can call your local zoo or aquarium. A professional there may be willing to look at the tortoise and determine its sex. You can also take a picture of the tortoise to bring in if bringing in the tortoise isn't viable.If you choose to bring in a photo, make sure to photograph the tail and the lower shell of the tortoise, as those are the most obvious indicators of a tortoise's sex.

"
Provide an enclosure with adequate space.,
Provide proper filtration for aquatic turtles.,
Clean your tank regularly.,
Provide a balanced diet for your turtle.,
Make sure your turtle has proper lighting.,
Maintain proper water temperatures.,
Look for signs of sickness in your turtle.",How to Keep a Turtle Healthy1," Ten gallons per inch of your turtle is a general rule. 50 gallon (189.3 L) minimum for a baby turtle (younger than a year old) and 120+ for an adult. Make sure that you have a general idea of the size your turtle will reach when full grown so you are not blindsided with keeping a turtle you cannot maintain. Decide on a land or aquatic turtle. Common turtles like box turtles will require a desert like landscape. If you want an aquatic turtle make sure there is dry land and adequate room to swim, and that your enclosure is sealed enough to hold water.;
, A turtle needs a canister filter. A Rena Filstar XP3 or XP4 is highly recommended in keeping a turtle healthy. Without good filtration your turtle can get extremely sick as old food and feces can build up.Even with proper filtration, you'll need to regularly change your turtle's water. When you change the water, make sure that the filter is not clogged. If you see waste or old food lingering in the filter, it may cause a clog that prevents it from filtering the water properly. You can buy a dechlorinator or water conditioner at any pet store.

, Remove everything from the tank including all of its basking spots and empty the water. Wash everything with warm water and anti-bacterial soap. Let rocks sit in warm water and soap. Wash the soap out thoroughly. Let the tank sit until it is dry. Put everything back in and fill the tank with clean, non-chlorinated water. If it is a land turtle, make sure to replace with clean substrate on the bottom of the tank each time, such as sand, wood chips, or newspaper. How often a clean is necessary will depend on how messy your turtle is. It is generally a good idea to do this at least twice a month. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after cleaning the tank.

, A proper diet for Red Eared Sliders and similar species should have the following proportions: Vegetables and water plants 50%; Commercial foods 25%; Live protein 25%. A turtle under a year old should be fed every day. A turtle over a year old should be fed every other day as to prevent them from getting overweight. An example of vegetation for your turtle are aquatic plants like duckweed, azolla, and water lettuce. They also enjoy fruits and vegetables like papaya, carrots, apples, and leafy greens like romaine lettuce.
For protein, your turtle can eat cooked chicken, turkey, or raw beef. If you want to feed your animal live protein, mealworms, snails, wax worms, beetle larvae, or even small goldfish are great.
There are also commercially available diets, such as pellets, that can provide complete nutrition for turtles. Make sure that you read the ingredients carefully and that proportions of protein and vegetable based matter are at proper ratios.

, If your turtle does not have regular access to sunlight, you will need to provide UV light bulbs for basking. Turtles in the wild are exposed to sunlight every day and the nutrients they provide are essentially for healthy growth and development. The amount of light it needs will be based on the species with land turtles usually requiring more. Keep in mind that that UV cannot penetrate glass and will need to above or in the enclosure.

, You will need a water heater. Turtles are cold-blooded animals and thus rely on external heat to warm up their bodies. If the temps get too high or too low it can turn fatal. The water should be 80 - 82 degrees Fahrenheit ( 26.5 - 27.5 Celsius) for a hatchling or a sick turtle, and 77 - 80 degrees F (25.5 - 26.5 C) for a healthy turtle over a year old.The basking (dry land) area should be 10 degrees Fahrenheit (6 degrees Celsius) warmer than the water to entice the turtle to warm up by basking.

, Even if you do your best to keep your turtle healthy, there are many diseases that can commonly affect the health of your pet. However, most are treatable if you look for certain telltale signs, you can start quickly getting your pet better.


Vitamin A deficiency. This occurs when your turtle is not getting a proper diet and manifests as lack of appetite, swelling of eyelids, swelling of ears, and persistent respiratory difficulties. This can also affect the buoyancy of your turtle when it's swimming. You can correct this by making sure your turtle has a balanced diet.
Respiratory infections. The most common signs of this are wheezing, difficulty breathing, bubbles and mucus in their nose, and frequent coughing. If you see these symptoms, take your turtle to the vet who will give them an x-ray and determine the proper antibiotic course. The most common cause of these issues are improper basking and water temperatures or an exposure to drafty conditions.
Shell rot. This is a fungal condition to the shell. The symptoms include: white, slimy, smelly appearance of the shell and sometimes puss. The symptoms may also include small abrasions on the turtle's shell. If you see any of these signs, take your turtle to the vet who will prescribe antibiotics.
Parasites. These are the most common cause of illness. The most common parasites for turtles are: pinworms, roundworms, and hookworms. The signs include lack of appetite, undigested food in stool, weight loss and sometimes spit up of food. Your vet will ask you obtain a stool sample to test for parasites and give a medication targeted to rid the turtle of the specific parasite.
Find a good vet that specializes in herpetology. Not all vets will deal with exotic animals. Make sure that whatever vet you choose has a specialty in herpetology and can help your turtle. Look online for a good local herp vet with strong reviews and demonstrated speciality background. Call local vet offices to see if they can treat turtles, or if they know a good colleague that can.

Species that commonly hibernate are listed below: Box turtles
Russian or Horsfield's tortoises
Spur-thighed tortoises
Marginated tortoises
Hermann's tortoises
Desert tortoises
Gopher tortoises
Texas tortoises
Wood turtle
Spotted turtles
Red-eared sliders
Snapping turtles;
, Only healthy animals should hibernate. During hibernation, the immune system slows down considerably, and a turtle that was even mildly ill going into hibernation is likely to die during or shortly after the process. Examine your turtle carefully for signs of illness. Even if you see nothing, still have the turtle examined by a veterinarian.Signs of illness include:


Swollen eyes.
Discharge from the nostrils
Swollen ears
Low body weight
Difficulty breathing, exhibited by opening the mouth frequently
Aquatic turtles remaining out the water at night
Abscesses or other signs of parasite infestation
Wounds or shell rot
Strong smell,inflammation, or leaking liquid from underneath the tail
Inside the mouth, any of these: the appearance of small blood-spots; deep red-purple tinge; a yellow cheesy substance

, Most experts recommend that you keep your indoor turtles and tortoises indoors and active during the winter, and that you bring outdoor turtles and tortoises inside for the winter if their natural habitat will not be safe.Aquatic turtles can hibernate outdoors as long as it is safe and the water doesn’t freeze. Terrestrial and semi-aquatic turtles and tortoises can hibernate indoors and outdoors. If the animal lives outdoors, it will respond to changes in the temperature and length of sunlight, and instinctively know when and how to get ready to hibernate. If your animal lives indoors, you will need to simulate these changes.


Check your local pet club information listings or ask your vet if you are unsure how to care for your pet.
Most box turtles and tortoises hibernate between October or November until the late February through early April in the United States.Most turtles and tortoises hibernate for 2-4 months. Some species in some regions can hibernate up to 6 months, though that length of time is not required. Ask your veterinarian for specific recommendations for your turtle.

, You should track your pet’s weight throughout hibernation to know if your pet is healthily losing weight or dangerously starving. Weigh your turtle or tortoise now to get a baseline weight, and keep weighing your pet every 2-3 weeks.Use the same scale you will use leading up to and during hibernation.
Use a digital scale for animals under 6 lbs (2.5kg) to ensure accuracy.

, Before you fast your turtle or tortoise, you should feed your pet higher levels of vitamin A since hibernation depletes stores of vitamin A. At the beginning of summer (12-16 weeks before hibernation), begin adding vitamin A-rich foods to the turtle's diet. You can simply swap out some of these foods for other things your turtle normally eats.Some good sources of vitamin A include:


For tortoises: carrots and squash
For turtles (non-meat): Leafy green vegetables like kale, broccoli, mustard and collard greens, and dandelions; orange vegetables, like alfalfa, squash, carrots, sweet potatoes; orange fruit, like cantaloupe and peaches
For turtles (meat): fish and baby mice
If your pet already gets a lot of vitamin A, just keep feeding it as normal.

, Towards the end of summer (late July, or 6-8 weeks before hibernation), swap out some of your turtle's normal food for higher-fiber options. Good sources of fiber for both turtles and tortoises include alfalfa and timothy hay, both which are high-fiber weeds and grasses.
If your pet normally eats a high-fiber diet, just keep feeding him as usual.

, Many turtles and tortoises die because owners hibernate them with undigested food still in their digestive tract. Do not try to hibernate a turtle or tortoise who has eaten within the last month; instead, delay hibernation.Ask your vet for a specific fasting time for your species.


Undigested food kills hibernating pets in 2 ways. Either the food decays and causes fatal bacterial infections inside your pet; or the food decays and creates large clouds of gas, which press internally on your pet’s lungs to suffocate it. When in doubt, contact your vet.Your pet’s digestive system is controlled to a large extent by temperature.
Tortoises can need 3-6 weeks. Small tortoises (<1kg) need 3 weeks; medium sized (1-1.5 kg) need 3-4 weeks; large tortoises (2-3kg) need 4-6 weeks.
Turtles need roughly 2-3 weeks. A small turtle like a Box turtle might need only 10-14 days., While fasting, soak your tortoise or turtle every other day 20-30 minutes in chin-deep water. Ensure your turtle or tortoise has access to drinking water constantly, from now until the end of the entire hibernation. This helps encourage the tortoise to expel waste from its digestive tract and stay hydrated., Temperature determines your pet’s metabolism, which is why hibernation happens when it is cold. Ensure that all food is out of your pet’s body before you go onto the next step. Do not go below 50°F (10°C).


Turtles: start 1 week before hibernation. 65°F (18°C) for 2-3 days, gradually reduced to 60°F (15°C) over 2-3 days, then gradually reduced to 50°F (10°C) or a little below.Tortoises: start 4 weeks before hibernation. Gradually reduce temperature to 60°F (15°C) over 1 week, then keep temperature 55-60°F (13-15°C) for 3 weeks so your tortoise can fully digest its last meal.
50°F (10°C) is the maximum (warmest) temperature for hibernation to occur. If your turtle or tortoise is at 50°F (10°C), they will begin to hibernate.

, Most pet owners use fridges for indoor hibernation, but only with a lot of care and caution. Make sure your turtle or tortoise is completely safe from predators such as rats, which like chewing on hibernating tortoises.


If staying in water outdoors, make sure the water does not freeze and has a depth of at least 18 inches.
If your pet is staying indoors, scope out a cool location in your house for your turtle or tortoise. Many people use refrigerators. Others use garages, basements, or any room at room temperature.
Pick a location that stays above 50°F (10°C) as its default. If your power goes out, your pet escapes, or another accident occurs, you want your turtle or tortoise to live despite the temperature change.

, If you are choosing to place your pet in a fridge for hibernation, you must watch your fridge and pet carefully to avoid death.


Ventilate properly. A fridge is air-sealed, so you must provide air to your turtle or tortoise. Open the fridge door at least 3 times a week, for 1-2 minutes.Test the fridge temperature. Place a thermometer in the fridge and monitor its fluctuations and accuracy. If there is a lot of temperature fluctuation, fill your fridge with other masses, like water bottles, that will hold the temperature steadier than just air will.Pick a fridge that you will not be using often throughout the day. Opening and closing the door often can deregulate the temperature, as well as flicker the fridge lights on and off.

, Your tortoise or turtle might become less active, but it should still seem alert and reactive. If your pet is sick, listless, or otherwise abnormal, check with your vet. Do not go onto the next step: hibernation can kill a sick turtle or tortoise.

, A hibernaculum is a small container for your turtle or tortoise to hibernate, and it protects your animal from hazards. Take two boxes: one about twice or thrice the size of your animal, and one only a few inches larger than your animal. The smaller box should fit into your large box with an inch or two on each side.


Your outer box should be made of sturdy material able to withstand chewing by rats. Use plywood, plastic, or wood. Do not use cardboard.
Your turtle or tortoise should be able to turn around in the smaller box, but not wander a lot.

, This is a critical step. You need material to fill the gaps between the large and small box, when the small box is placed inside the larger one. This will help regulate your pet’s temperature, and keep your pet from dying or leaving hibernation too early.


The best insulation is polystyrene or packing foam. Alternatives include insulation from housing or packing projects. If you need, tightly packed shredded paper can work too.

, A thermometer is absolutely necessary for checking the temperature in your pet’s environment. You will be checking your thermometer often, so get one you understand and can use well.Many pet owners like using a classic maximum-minimum reading thermometer from any garden or hardware store.
Some pet owners like using thermometers with alarms that sound when the temperature gets above or below a certain reading., Place a bottom layer of insulation in the large box. Place your small box in the middle of the large box, on top of the layer of insulation. Add the rest of the insulation around the sides of the smaller box. Put insulation on the top lid of your boxes. Drill small ventilation holes in the lid. Cover the bottom of your smallest box with some substrate. Some examples of substrate include:


coir (crushed coconut husk)
straw
shredded newspaper
peat
moss
commercial substrates for reptiles, such as Carefresh or Bed-A-Beast
Do not use substrate with fertilizers, plant food, or any chemical additives
Check the appropriate moistness of your substrate for your species of pet. For example, box turtles need very moist substrate that is almost wet.
Turtles and tortoises use up very little oxygen when hibernating, but still require a small amount of oxygen. Make ventilation holes that are small (less than an inch or centimeter in diameter).

, Make sure that your turtle or tortoise has no illnesses or injuries, no food in their digestive system, constant access to water, and is at a temperature hovering around or above 50°F (10°C). If any one of these things is not true, do not force your pet into hibernation. Otherwise, place your pet in the hibernaculum. Place your hibernaculum in a cool location where it will stay throughout hibernation, except for when you are inspecting it.


If your pet is hibernating outdoors in nature and not in a hibernaculum, make sure your pet will neither drown or freeze in its hibernation spot. Your pet should still have constant access to drinking water.
If your pet is hibernating outdoors, it will naturally bury itself in or around a pond. The pond should have a good bed of dirt or muck to dig into, and be at least 18 inches deep to provide some temperature insulation. If needed, keep the pond from freezing by using a floating pond heater through the winter.If your outdoor turtle will not hibernate, even though the weather has cooled, or you see it swimming or basking a lot after other turtles have disappeared, bring it inside. Some turtles just don't know how to hibernate and will not survive the winter outside., You cannot hurt a hibernating tortoise or turtle by handling it, but can kill your pet by neglecting it. Do this regardless of where or how it is hibernating, indoors or outdoors. Inspect your pet for any signs of infection, illness, or poor hibernation; and inspect your hibernaculum for urine, feces, or signs of predation (rats).


If your 1) tortoise or turtle has urinated or defecated while hibernating, 2) your pet's skin is dry, or 3) hibernaculum is just much wetter than usual, soak your pet for 2 hours in room-temperature water. The water level should happen just below your pet’s bridge. Dry your pet thoroughly, and return your pet to the hibernaculum placed in a slightly cooler location: you had been keeping your pet in a location that was too warm and dehydrated your pet.Signs of infection include discharge, breathing difficulties, and changes in the skin or shell. If you notice anything concerning, call your vet.
If your pet’s skin is dry or the hibernaculum is wetter than usual, soak your pet in room-temperature water for two hours.

, An ideal temperature for hibernation is around 40°F (4.5°C), though your pet can hibernate 35-45°F (1.5-7°C).Any lower and your pet might suffer permanent damage or death; any higher and your pet will burn too much fat to stay in hibernation, and will start waking up.


Check your thermometer at least once a day, if not a few times a day. Check hourly during very cold or hot times.
If the temperature is consistently warm or cold for a few hours, change the location of your hibernaculum to a place with a more optimal temperature.

, Every few days, weigh your turtle or tortoise on the same scale you used before hibernation. Keep track of your pet’s weight throughout hibernation. A healthy turtle and tortoise will lose 0-1% of its body weight for each month of hibernation. Some examples of normal weight loss:


A 1 kg tortoise losing 10 g per month
A 1.5 kg tortoise losing 15 g per month
A 2 kg tortoise losing 20 g per monthIf your turtle or tortoise is losing weight faster than this, rehydrate your pet by sticking them in shallow room temperature water for 2 hours. The water level should fall just below the bridge on your pet. If your pet loses weight faster than this for more than a week, contact your vet.
For instance, a turtle or tortoise that weighs 600 grams should lose 6 grams a month.
Keep these records for the next time you want your pet to hibernate.

, Before you do anything, double-check the duration of time your turtle or tortoise is supposed to hibernate for; most species fall within 2-4 months. Remove the hibernaculum, if using, and warm your pet to 60°F (15°C). Soak your tortoise or turtle, as you have been, every other day.

, Keep your pet at 60°F (15°C) for 2 days. Increase to and maintain at 65-68°F (18-20° C) for 2-3 days. Finally, return your pet to non-hibernation temperatures (70°F-80°F, or 21°C-27°C).


Waking up is a mirror image of going into hibernation. “Waking up” is characterized by more movement and activity. Drinking water is important throughout this process. However, your pet might avoid food.
Keep the temperature warm. Temperature for critical in your pet’s metabolism, and cold temperatures can make your pet vulnerable to illness. Use a heat lamp or focal light to warm up your turtle or tortoise if it is not active or eating properly., Soak your pet in water 20-30 minutes every other day, as you have been doing so far. Still provide your pet with constant water to access. Your pet must drink to flush out the toxins in its kidneys accumulated from hibernation. If your tortoise or turtle does not drink and hydrate itself, see your doctor immediately. Use a sink, bathtub, large deep food tray, or other ""bath"" container suitable to the size of your pet.
Tortoises ""drink"" through their anus, so this soak in water is the same as drinking it.

, Begin offering food 2 days after the tortoise is returned to room temperature. Provide the same food as before, and let your pet take its time beginning to feed again.


Some turtles take weeks to feed again, and males might feed only until after breeding.However, if you see signs of vomit, upset stomachs, or any other illness or infection, see your doctor immediately.
All tortoises should feed within 1 week of hibernation. If not, your tortoise is sick or getting sick. See your vet immediately.

Decide the type of turtle you want.,
Find a reputable turtle breeder or seller.,
Make sure you choose a healthy turtle.,
Make sure you are prepared for the turtle at home.,
Always practice safe handling.",How to Keep a Turtle Healthy2," There are different types of turtles available for purchase. These can present different difficulties in care, cost differences, and differences in how tame or docile the animal is. Painted turtles are a great aquatic species for beginners. This is a colorful variety of turtle, readily available, easy to care for and great for a new turtle owner. They stay small, only 4 to 5 inches, and are active. They're also commonly bred in captivity and years of breeding has created a docile and tame animal. They are recognizable for their colorful markings that make them appear ""painted,"" hence the name.
Common Musk Turtles. These are a small, relatively hearty, aquatic turtle. They can rest comfortably in a small tank (as small as 30 gallons) but do not generally like to be handled.
Slider turtles. There are many varieties of sliders with two being the most common — the red eared and yellow bellied slider. They stay under 11 inches and are easy to care for. They also have tame and docile personalities.
Diamondback Terrapin. This is another type of turtle commonly available in pet stores and amongst breeders. While these turtles stay small (9 inches at the most) and are friendly, they require a little more expertise than either painted turtles or sliders. They prefer brackish water (a slightly salted water) and thus will require more work.

, Many pet stores will sell a variety of turtles. However, you will want to know the provenance of your turtle before bringing it home. This can include whether it was captive bred or caught from the wild. In addition to this you will want to make sure that the turtle is being kept in a proper habitat and appears alert and healthy. Ask for proof that the turtle was captive bred. If the breeder cannot provide this, chances are the turtle was born in the wild. This can have detrimental effects on wild turtle populations and also make your turtle more prone to stress, which is potentially detrimental to the animal's health.

, Since many turtles can be bred in poor conditions or undergo the stresses of being captured from the wild, it is important to choose a healthy looking turtle. The turtle should be alert, free of any parasites, and relatively active. You will want to see that the turtle has an appetite and looks properly fed. Their eyes should be clear, no bubbles from the nose while breathing or wheezing sounds. The limbs should be strong and moving when picked up; listlessness is a sign of illness. There should also be no cracks or pits in the shell or sign of wounds. Check the enclosure. The water should be clean, food should be available and adequate light provided. If any of these are missing, it can increase the likelihood you bring home a sick turtle.

, Besides all of the commitment requirements, make sure that your turtle's habitat is ready to go before you pick the turtle up. This way they can start acclimating to their new life right away.

, Whether you are the primary caregiver, or a child is regularly handling the turtle, be cognizant of potential diseases they may carry. Turtles can carry salmonella or other infectious diseases. This can also be contracted by contact with their enclosure. Make sure to practice safe handling measures and wash your hands thoroughly after each contact with the enclosure or turtle. Elderly people, children and infants are particularly susceptible to salmonella. Even if they are not directly interacting with the turtle or its environment, you will want to wash your hands thoroughly before coming in contact with at risk individuals.

Minimize your turtle’s level of environment stress.",How to Treat a Turtle's Ear Abscess," Treating a turtle ear abscess is a surgical procedure that requires sedation or local anesthesia. Because of this, veterinary care will be required for proper treatment — do not attempt to treat the abscess on your own.Although treating an ear abscess is not necessarily an emergency, you should get it treated as soon possible to prevent further pain and discomfort to your turtle.;
, This is something your veterinarian will do. Your veterinarian will either sedate your turtle or apply a local anesthetic to the abscessed area.Since treatment is a surgical procedure, your veterinarian will give your turtle some pre-operative pain medication to reduce post-operative pain.Don’t be afraid to ask what kinds of medications your veterinarian is administering to your turtle.

, Once your turtle is prepped for the procedure, your veterinarian will open up the abscess with a sterile scalpel.He or she will then flush out the abscess to remove its contents (hard and dry pus).Your veterinarian will cut through the membrane of your turtle’s ear to open the abscess.The pus inside an abscess typically has a cottage cheese-like consistency.Your veterinarian may flush the abscess with a medicated cleansing solution (e.g., antiseptic solution) to kill bacteria within the abscess., If your veterinarian suspects that a bacterial infection has caused the abscess, he or she may want to swab a small section of infected skin to have it analyzed for the presence of bacteria. This analysis is called a skin culture.It will ultimately be your decision whether you want to have a skin sample analyzed in more detail.


If you choose to move forward with the skin culture, keep in mind that the analysis will take at least a few days. Your veterinarian would report the results back to you and recommend treatment based on those results.

, After your veterinarian has flushed out the abscess and cleansed the infected area, he or she will probably recommend further treatment to ensure optimal healing. If your veterinarian strongly suspects a bacterial infection, he or she may decide to coat the infected area with triple antibiotic ointment until the area is fully healed.Ear abscesses are usually left open to heal (closing it up could seal in the infection). Leaving the abscess open will allow it to continue to drain., After your veterinarian has flushed out the abscess, it will now be up to you to care for your turtle at home. Examples of at-home treatment include antibiotics (oral, injectable, or topical), pain medication and cleansing solutions.Follow your veterinarian’s treatment recommendations carefully to ensure your turtle’s full recovery.


The type of antibiotic treatment needed will probably depend on the results of the skin culture.
Oral antibiotics are commonly prescribed along with injectable antibiotics.While the surgical site is healing, you should try to keep your turtle docked in the dry part of his cage as much as you can. Your turtle will enter the water at some point, of course, so you will also need to maintain good water quality. Good water quality will prevent delayed healing., What causes turtle ear abscesses is not fully understood.Commonly, though, the abscesses are related to a vitamin A deficiency.Vitamin A plays an important role in the proper development of cells lining a turtle’s ears and respiratory tract.Without enough vitamin A, these cells will develop abnormally and eventually allow for the accumulation of debris. This debris then causes an inflammatory reaction, during which inflammatory cells accumulate in the ears and lead to pus production and abscess formation.Your veterinarian can prescribe oral or injectable vitamin A for your turtle. Injectable vitamin A is usually reserved for more serious cases of vitamin A deficiency.It is important that you follow your veterinarian’s instruction for supplementation to prevent a condition called hypervitaminosis A (too much vitamin A).You can also add more vitamin A to your turtle’s diet by feeding him such vitamin A-rich foods as carrots and squash.Sweet potatoes, greens (collard, mustard, turnip), and papaya are also high in vitamin A., Poor water quality is another common culprit of turtle ear abscesses. For example, a weak or malfunctioning water filter can cause an accumulation of urine, feces, leftover food, and microorganisms that can irritate your turtle’s skin. This skin irritation can eventually lead to infection and abscess development.Replace the tank’s filtration system if you suspect that it is too weak or no longer functions properly. There are several available filtration types (biological, chemical, mechanical). The website http://redearslider.com/index_water_quality.html has a comprehensive overview of each filtration type.
Water that is not at the proper temperature can also contribute to ear abscess development by weakening your turtle’s immune system.For adult red ear slider turtles, the optimal water temperature is 75 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 26 degrees Celsius).Use a thermometer to monitor the water temperature.

, Inadequate lighting can also affect your turtle’s health and leave him more susceptible to ear abscess development. To provide him with more lighting, place several fluorescent light bulbs about 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) above his tank.These bulbs are a good source of ultraviolet light (UVA and UVB) that will allow your turtle to produce vitamin D3.Replace the bulbs every six months., Aspects of your turtle’s environment can be stressful to him. This stress can lead to a weakened immune system and subsequent illness. For example, your turtle may be stressed if his tank is too small.In general, your turtle’s tank size should be 10 gallons (37.9 L) per inch of shell length.Other stressors include overcrowding, not enough dry docking areas, and excessive handling.Talk with your veterinarian if you are unsure how to identify and/or address environmental stressors.

Learn why he hibernates.",How to Wake a Tortoise from Hibernation," There are certain conditions that indicate you need to wake up your tortoise. If you use the natural seasonal progression to determine when to let your tortoise hibernate, you should wake him up when the temperature increases above 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) in the area of his hibernaculum, which is his home during hibernation. This temperature stimulates his metabolism, which is when it is best for him to wake up.


If you notice urine in his hibernaculum, you should also go ahead and fully wake him up. This is an indication that he is partially awake, which means he should fully wake up to avoid sickness.
If it has been four months since your tortoise went into hibernation, he should also be woken up. ;
, The first thing you need to do to start waking him up is move his hibernaculum from where you've kept it protected and stored while he was hibernating. This is typically outside, so you can bring it indoors.


Once indoors, sit his hibernaculum next to a heater or radiator for a few hours. Remove it once it reaches room temperature., While the hibernaculum is warming up, you need to prepare your tortoise an area to recover from hibernation. This area needs a heat lamp or a tortoise table in order for it to maintain the right temperature. The constant temperature in the tortoise enclosure needs to be at least 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius).


The heat lamp should be around 150 Watts and mounted about 40 cm (15 to 16 inches) above where you lay your tortoise, which is perfect distance for him to bask in the heat.
Do not rely on the natural heating in your house because it will not be hot enough for your tortoise. which has a heat lamp., You need to put your tortoise in an area where he will receive a lot of natural light. This is important to stimulate certain hormones in his body, which will encourage him to eat. To help stimulate your tortoise when he is coming out of hibernation, you can try an artificial UVB light. This will help him develop his appetite and immunities faster and help him regain the energy he lost during hibernation.


The exact UVB bulb and set up will depend on your particular tortoise habitat, so you may want to ask your a qualified veterinarian that specializes in reptiles for advice. You can also ask a qualified pet store associate.
The use of an extra UVB light is controversial among tortoise owners. Many people do not think that tortoises need more UVB light than that provided by the sun., When your tortoise is just waking up, he needs plenty of water. This will help him flush any toxins out of his system that he accumulated while in hibernation. This is even more important than food since he needs to drink before he can eat.


Your tortoise will not just drink the water from a bowl. You need to instead put him in a bath of lukewarm water no higher than his chin. Also splash it on his shell and head. When he first wakes up, he may dip his head under the water and drink directly from it. This is normal. Leave him for five minutes at a time and do it daily for about a week or so, which should be about the time he eats properly again.
He then needs to sit with his tail region in a small bowl of water for about 20 minutes once to twice a day. Since tortoises can absorb water through their anuses, this will help him get hydrated while he wakes up.
Make sure the water bowl is not so deep that he could drown. To keep just his tail end in the water, prop his upper body on a smooth rock or book and leave his tail end in the bowl of water.
You can place him in a tub of water, but you have to ensure his head is not covered so he won't drown., One way to help boost your tortoise while he is waking up is to put a little glucose (sugar) in some water to help get his energy levels back up. While he hibernates, this is stored in his body, but he will regain energy faster with a little extra glucose on his system.


Make a mixture of 2 teaspoons of sugar in 250 milliliters (8.5  fl oz) of water. Give your tortoise 10 to 20 milliliters (0.34 to 0.68  fl oz) of this solution a day as he is waking from hibernation.
You can also use Pedialyte or Reptoboost, an electrolyte boosting substance specifically for reptiles.
Only do this around the time he is waking up from hibernation. Doing it all the time can lead to high blood sugar levels., After you get your tortoise to drink water, he will also need to eat. Give him fresh fruits and vegetables that will entice him to eat. Tomatoes and strawberries are especially good when he is first waking up because tortoises find these foods extremely tasty, which will encourage him to eat them.


The amount of food he eats will vary depending on what stage of the waking up period he is in, so just put in what you would normally feed him per day and gauge how much he eats.
Since he will be under a heat lamp, you will need to put small portions out a few times a day. Leaving the fruit and veggies too long will cause them to dry out and your tortoise won't eat them. , Once you've set to waking up your tortoise, he should start eating within seven days. If he doesn't, he may be sick. If you notice that your tortoise refuses to eat, you should take him to a vet that specializes in reptiles immediately. If you let it go, he could get worse. You also need to check his overall appearance and demeanor to see if he is healthy. When he wakes up, check his:


Body for lumps, swelling, scraps, or cuts, as well as pinkness under his shell
Eyes for inflammation or discharge
Tail for unusual odor, discharge, or swelling
Nose for blockage or discharge
Mouth for signs of rot, which include yellow or white cheese-like residue
Ears for abscesses
The longer you leave him alone without treatment, the greater the risk of complications for him will be. This can lead to infection or overwhelming, which can cause organ failure., The best temperature to keep a tortoise under while he is in hibernation is between four and six degrees Celsius (39 to 43 degrees Fahrenheit). This is not hot enough to wake up your tortoise and not cold enough to cause any cold based damage, such as frostbite.If you think the weather is too hot for your tortoise, you need to use refrigerator hibernation, which uses special refrigeration equipment.
During this time, he will use his body fat reserves for nutrition to maintain his organ functions.

, Most places do not have the right natural weather patterns to match a tortoise's hibernation needs. This means you must manipulate his environment for him to mimic his natural hibernation habits. The maximum amount of time you should let your tortoise hibernate is four months, though he can hibernate for shorter periods of time., It is important to maintain your tortoise's environment while he is hibernating to avoid partially waking him up. If the temperature changes in his environment, his metabolism will be kick started and he could start to wake up. When this happens, he uses part of his reserves, which can weaken him if he goes back into hibernation.


The most obvious sign that your tortoise has been partially woken up from hibernation is the presence of urine in his hibernaculum., If you wake your tortoise improperly or allow him to hibernate too long, his health may go into an downward spiral. Your tortoise can wake up weak and have a suppressed immune system, which makes him more susceptible to infections and other sicknesses. If he uses too much energy during hibernation, he also may not have enough energy to ever wake up.


If he also doesn't receive the right temperature conditions as he wakes up, he may not eat adequately, which will cause weakness and lead to a lack of energy reserves to keep him healthy and happy.If he is partially woken up and then goes back into hibernation, he runs the risk of getting sick from lack of energy when he wakes up in the spring. It is better to wake him up then leave him so he will be weak when he does come out of full hibernation., Only certain species of tortoises are meant to hibernate. This relies on your tortoise's native environment and if his history called from hibernation in order to survive.


Common species that need to hibernate are the Hermann's tortoise, spur-thighed tortoise, Horsfield's or Russian tortoise, and Marginated tortoise.Never hibernate tropical species of tortoises, such as the Leopard tortoise. You should also not hibernate your tortoise if he is smaller than 700g in weight, or if he is sick or has health problems. If your tortoise has these problems, keep him awake and regulate his temperature during the cold months instead.

, Tortoises hibernate to conserve their energy. During the winter, your tortoise will likely go into hibernation if the conditions are right. This is because the colder conditions are not as suitable for him, so he goes into hibernation to conserve his energy and survive longer."

Veterinary tests will likely give your veterinarian some clues as to the underlying issues and how to treat them.Stomatitis is usually a bacterial infection but in some cases it is caused by a herpes infection.
There may be other factors aside from the central infection that contribute to the seriousness of the problem. For instance, trauma to the mouth or even just stress the animal is undergoing can add to the problem.;
, Your tortoise's illness could be caused by a variety of factors, so your veterinarian could suggest a various treatments. The simplest of these possible treatments is cleaning the area well. This cleaning includes removing damaged tissue.Allowing your veterinarian to clean and remove dead tissue from your tortoise's mouth is important because they have the tools and the know how to do it without causing further damage to the delicate tissues of the mouth.

, Your veterinarian my suggest giving the tortoise antibiotic or anti-fungal medications. These can vary depending on what medication your veterinarian feels would work best for your particular pet and its particular infection., If your tortoise's infection is severe, you may need to do more to help it heal. For example, invasive surgery may be required if the infection is very, very serious and has traveled into the animal's skull.If your tortoise is severely malnourished from its inability to eat, it may also need to be force fed or be given food through an IV at the veterinary office.

, Part of the treatment for stomatitis will require at home care. The most important part of this home care is to keep your tortoise's mouth clean. In cases of a mild infection to begin with, this be the only treatment the tortoise gets.If your veterinarian suggests it, clean the tortoise's infection regularly with an antiseptic wipe, especially after the animal has eaten.To keep your tortoise's mouth clean, make sure it has access to clean water at all times.
Also, make sure that the tortoise's food is fresh and not spoiled. Keeping everything that goes into your pet's mouth clean will help its infection heal.

, To clear up your tortoise's infection, give it the medication that was prescribed by your veterinarian.This medication will usually be applied to the infection site, such as an antibiotic cream that you will need to apply.


Be sure to follow your veterinarian's directions for giving the medication, including giving as many doses as are recommended, even if you can no longer see signs of the infection.

, Part of treating the tortoise at home will be keeping its home clean. Many times small infections can clear up on their own if you keep the pet's home clean and sanitary. However, if the tortoise is returned to a dirty home, the infection may not get better, and may even worsen.Clean your tortoise's home by replacing any food and water daily, replacing any bedding or floor covering, and disinfecting all surfaces.
You should only use cleaning products that are safe for your tortoise. You can pick up cleaning products safe for reptiles at any major pet store, or consult with your veterinarian about what products he or she would suggest., Begin by assessing your tortoise's appetite. If your tortoise is eating less than usual and is not motivated by food as much as usual, it may be a sign of illness. This does not definitively signal stomatitis in particular, but it does signal that something is off with your pet.Bring your pet in for evaluation by a veterinarian if it is not eating and not acting as it usually does.

, Pay attention to signs of discomfort when your tortoise is eating, although these may be hard to identify if you are not very familiar with the pet. It may also drool or rest with its mouth open, which are also signs that there is something wrong.Look in your tortoise's mouth if you can. If it has stomatitis there will be inflammation and ulcers, and possibly white mucus.

, When you bring your tortoise in, your veterinarian should begin by doing a veterinary history. This should include him or her asking you what symptoms your tortoise has and when you first noticed them. They should also ask questions about your tortoise's general health and how you care for it.Your veterinarian will then assess your tortoise's health, looking in its mouth and taking swabs of the affected area for analysis.
In addition, he or she may take some of your tortoise's blood to screen for impacts on the pet's general health.

This way, you’ll have everything you need and won’t need to scramble once you’ve got your turtle out of its aquarium. Consider:


Picking a spot on the floor, so that turtle-dropping danger is minimized.
Lay out a clean towel to absorb any medicine or turtle droppings.
Place your turtle eye medicine on the towel.
Place some turtle treats or food on the towel to distract your reptilian friend.;
, Before you apply medicine to your turtle’s eye, you need to remove it from the aquarium. When removing your turtle, move slowly and do not frighten it. This is important and you’ll want to do everything you can to avoid scaring your little friend. When you go to remove your turtle:


Sit quietly next to the enclosure for a couple minutes before going to take it out.
Pick the turtle up with both hands placing one on each side between the front and back legs.
Hold your friend firmly but don’t hurt it.
Place the turtle down gently., One of the biggest challenges of applying medicine to your turtle is getting it to cooperate. Since turtles can just retract their heads into their shell, this could be a problem.


Try to tease your turtle out of its shell with food.
Wait until your turtle’s head is completely out of the shell and he or she is eating.
If your turtle is not cooperating at all, put it down and try again in half an hour.
Be very gentle and do not hurt your little friend. Remember, that he or she does not really know that you’re trying to help. Be very considerate., Next, you’ll have to take some steps to position your turtle and make sure that he or she does not retract its head back into its shell. This way, you’ll be able apply medicine to the turtle’s eyes easily. Make sure to:


Take your other hand and with your palm under the turtle's plastron, place your index finger and thumb on either side and behind the turtle's head.
Do not grab its neck vertebrae, but do keep your fingers firmly planted as the turtle will be violently pulling its neck in.
Hold the turtle like this until it stops struggling, and only tries to pull its neck in.
Again, be very gentle with your turtle. If you are not comfortable doing this, find someone who is or contact a vet., Since you’ll be busy holding your friend in position and making sure he or she doesn’t retract its head, you’ll need to have someone else apply the ointment or drops to your little friend.


If you don't have a helper, slowly place your turtle firmly on the ground and remove the hand that was touching the plastron. Use this hand to apply medicine.
Remove pus or other discharge with a q-tip.
Apply ointment onto eyes or fill your eye dropper with eye drops.
If you’re using eye drops, drop the appropriate amount of drops (as prescribed) into the turtle’s infected eye or eyes., Now that you’ve applied drops or ointment to your turtle, you’ve got to repeat application of the ointment or drops. This should get easier for both you and your turtle. You’ll both get used to it, and your turtle will probably cooperate more-and-more. Make sure to:


Follow your doctor’s directions.
Often times, antibiotic ointment or drops need to be applied 3 times a day and for 7-10 days or as directed.
If your turtle does not begin to recover after a few days, contact your vet., Now that you’ve applied medicated cream or drops to your turtle, you have to place it back into the enclosure. Make sure to:


Gently place the turtle back in its enclosure
Avoid creating any disturbances in the room.
Check back on your turtle in an hour or two.

, Healthy turtle eyes should be clear, open, and shiny. If you have a turtle whose eyes are not healthy, you should contact your vet immediately. This is extremely important as eye infections can be indicative of larger health problems. In addition, since turtles depend on their sight to find food, if they can’t see, they’ll have problems eating. Watch for eyes that are:


Swollen.
Half shut.
Reddened.
Sunken.
Produce pus or discharge., A very important part of treating your turtle is making sure its aquarium is clean. Making sure you have a clean aquarium will aid in the healing process and help avoid further infections. Ultimately, the cleaner the environment, the less chance there is for bacteria to accumulate.


Remove your turtle and put it in a temporary home.
Remove all water, rocks, plants, and everything else.
Clean the aquarium (if glass) with very hot water.
Scrub the sides with a brush or something slightly abrasive. Be careful not to scratch the glass.
If you use a cleaner, make sure that your tank is rinsed thoroughly so that no chemicals are left.
Properly clean all fake plants, rocks, and anything else that goes in the tank., A major cause of eye infections in turtle is vitamin A deficiency. As a result, make sure that your turtle has proper nutrition and has proper levels of vitamin A. In addition, proper vitamins and nutrition will help keep your turtle healthy overall and minimize infections, including eye infections.


Feed your turtle specially formulated food pellets. These will have all of the vitamins your turtle needs.
Avoid feeding your turtle a diet made up mostly of either iceberg lettuce, all meat, or cheap commercial food.
Make sure you don’t give your turtle too much vitamin A. An overdose might kill your turtle.
Contact your vet if you have questions about proper nutrition and health."

Look at your turtle’s shell.,
Examine the turtle’s plastron.,
Check the turtle for a tail notch.,
Look for species-specific clues.",How to Tell If a Turtle Is Male or Female1," The turtle’s shell, or carapace, differs slightly between male and female. An adult female turtle has a slightly longer shell than an adult male has.As a means of sexing the turtle, this method is limited because you need to make sure that the turtle is fully grown. You may assume that a turtle is male due to a smaller size when it actually has more growing to do.
There can be an overlap in size between a large male and a small female, so it’s not possible to predict the gender based on size alone.;
, The underside of the shell, which covers the turtle equivalent of a belly, is called the plastron. To check the plastron, pick the turtle up with care. They do not like be handled and may try to bite, so grasp the turtle from the tail end so it can't reach around and snap at you. Gently turn the turtle over so you can see the underside. In male turtles, the plastron is slightly concave (curving inwards), whereas a female's is flat.A concave plastron allows for a male turtle to fit over a female’s shell during mating without rolling off.
The female’s flatter plastron gives her more room internally in which to grow eggs.

, Male turtles often have a small 'V,' or notch, at the rear end of the carapace. This is to accommodate the tail when the turtles mate. Otherwise the tail might be crushed against the underside of his shell., Some species of turtles have gender-specific external features. Some species that may reveal gender through coloring are:


The American box turtle: 90 percent of the time, male box turtles have red or orange irises while the female has brown or yellow ones. Also, the female has a tendency to have a higher-domed, more rounded shell, whereas the male has a lower shell with more of an oval or oblong appearance.
Sun turtle: If the turtle's underbelly has blue coloring, it's a male. If the underbelly does not have blue coloring, it's a female.

"
"
Examine the turtle’s claws.,
Look at the turtle’s cloaca.,
Determine the turtle’s tail size.,
Combine multiple signs to reach a conclusion.",How to Tell If a Turtle Is Male or Female2," Male turtles use their claws during mating rituals with female turtles. They also use their claws to fight and to claim and defend their territory. Therefore, the claws on the males' front legs tend to be longer than the claws of female turtles. Again, this is more obvious when you have two turtles of different sexes to compare with each other.The Red-eared Slider species particularly shows a pronounced difference between the male and female front claws.

, Both male and females have an opening or vent located on the underside on the tail. This is called the cloaca, and it is located slightly differently depending on the gender.The female's cloaca is rounder and more star shaped than the male's. It is found much closer to her body, at the base of her tail where it joins her body, almost disappearing into the shell.
The male's cloaca is longer and more slit-like. It is located in the last third of the tail, towards the tip.

, The male's genitalia are located within the tail, and to accommodate them, the tail is longer and thicker than a female’s. The female's tail is shorter and thinner.Be aware that there is an overlap in normal sizes between male and female, so this can give you a hint, but it is not a foolproof way of sexing a turtle.

, The best approach to sexing a turtle is using a combination of the suggested steps to come up with the most likely gender for the turtle. Bear in mind that some methods are less reliable than others in determining the gender of your turtle.

If all the signs point in one direction, then it's more likely than not that you've determined the gender accurately. However, if the signs are mixed, you may wish to take your turtle to a vet to be certain.If you're not sure what conclusion to draw, wait until the turtle is older and try again. It is extremely difficult to sex a baby turtle.
Be aware that you might have to wait years until your turtle is fully grown and you can determine the gender effectively.

Ask what has brought on the feelings.
Ask if there is anything in particular that you have said or done to make him or her feel this way.;
, Let your friend express what he or she is feeling completely before giving your side of the story. Reiterate what you've think you've understood in your own words, to make sure that you're properly grasping what the concerns are.

, Make it clear that you're willing to work through things and that you are not judging your friend. If your friend is panicking, having a meltdown or going all dramatic on you, intervene quickly and suggest some quiet time. Suggest that your friend relax, taking deep breaths and sitting still for a bit, with you. You can clear the air better when your friend has calmed down.

, This can help your friend to realize that you're with him or her, not against.

, Make it clear that you want to get to the bottom of this, not let things grow worse.

, If you have said anything mean or lacking in support lately, be quick to say sorry. However, this does not mean apologizing for her or his feelings or suppositions about you. Focus only on things you've actually said or done that have directly hurt your friend.


With respect to the things you've achieved, the people you've befriended or the things you're doing now, do not apologize when your friend targets these as part of her or his jealousy. You have a right to be an independent person doing the best you can with your life.

, Are there realistic changes that can be made to help your friend feel included, a part of things or able to keep up with you?

, If you need to change what you're doing, who you're seeing or who you are just to accommodate your friend's jealousy, then it's not a friendship but a toxic burden. Any changes made should only be small ones, targeted at allowing your friend to feel more included.


If your friend has a history of jealousy, be wary. He or she may have gotten into the habit of crying ""victim"" when things don't go their way, and forcing others to change to fit their pace and wants. Keep an eye out for this possibility.

, It is a good idea to try to find a compromise if you are not in a position to make changes. For example, if you're seeing a boyfriend all the time and she feels left out, suggest some set times when the two of you meet up and do things just together. Or, if your friend feels that your job has the better of you, tell him that you will set aside time in the evenings or weekends to catch up with him specifically.


Perhaps it's an achievement of yours that has your friend's nose out of joint. Offer to pass on some of your knowledge, contacts or know-how to help your friend learn something more and have a similar opportunity if they apply effort. Don't hand anything to your friend on a platter though; this will simply feed the jealousy.

, Give time most of all. If you are best friends, you must spend time together to share secrets, ideas, stories, news and more.

, If you feel that your friend is happier, that's great. If not, ask again but there may come a point at which you have to accept that jealousy has taken root in your friend and it may be very hard to solve.

Pay attention to your tortoise's appetite.,
Look for signs of discomfort or stress.,
Inspect your tortoise's mouth.,
Take your tortoise to a veterinarian.,
Get a diagnosis.,
Discuss treatment options.,
Keep your tortoise's home clean.,
Check your tortoise's diet.,
Inspect your tortoise's health regularly.,
Keep infected tortoises away from healthy ones.,
Have your tortoise checked out before hibernation.",How to Diagnose Stomatitis in Tortoises," When a tortoise is having issues inside of their mouth, changes to their food consumption may be the first signal. If your tortoise is eating less than they usually do, then they may have a problem developing.


If you have had your tortoise for awhile, it should be easier for you to tell that something is off.;
, It can be hard to gauge the mood or stress level of a tortoise; however, if you have had your pet for awhile, then you may be able to judge a change in mood or activity level.Changes to regular routine or disposition can be signs of illness.


Does your tortoise usually let you get close to them but is currently acting shy or aggressive? That may be a sign of distress.

, If you can get close enough to your pet, look inside their mouth for signs of infection. Look for unusual redness; ulcers; a white, mucus-like substance; a yellowy, cheese-like discharge inside the mouth; or broken blood vessels — all signs of stomatitis.The discomfort of stomatitis is many times accompanied by drooling, so stay on the lookout for that as well.
Additionally, a tortoise with stomatitis may rest with their mouth open, as this may be more comfortable.

, Your veterinarian will do a veterinary history, asking you what symptoms your tortoise has and when you first noticed them, in addition to questions about your general care practices for the tortoise. Then the vet will take a look at the tortoise and will usually take swabs of the affected area to analyze.Your vet may also want to take a sample of your tortoise's blood so they can assess your pet's general health in light of the infection.

, Because stomatitis is a general term for infection of the mouth, it can be caused by a variety of factors. Your veterinarian's tests will likely give them a general understanding of the underlying issues and will hopefully give them a clue as to how the infection should be treated.


In most cases, stomatitis is caused by a bacterial infection; however, there can be additional factors that contribute, and exacerbate, the infection. This can include trauma to the mouth or even just stress the animal is undergoing., Because your tortoise's problem may be caused by a wide variety of things, your veterinarian may suggest any number of treatments. This can range from a thorough cleaning and debridement of the area (meaning removal of damaged tissue), to antibiotic or anti-fungal medications, or even surgery.Part of the treatment for stomatitis will rely on you at home. You will need to keep your tortoise's mouth clean, as well as keeping their home clean as well, while they are recovering.

, Many times small infections clear up on their own if a pet is living in clean, well-kept home; however, if your pet is living in a dirty home, an infection is likely to have a hard time healing and it can become really infected. This can be the case with stomatitis.In the case of stomatitis, a small trauma, such as a cut, can develop into a serious infection like if exposed to bacteria in a dirty cage.
Check to make sure your tortoise's home is the correct temperature and humidity.

, Stomatitis (also known as ""mouth rot"") develops if the tortoise's immune system is weak. This can be due to poor diet, specifically low Vitamin C intake. Discuss your tortoise's diet with their vet to determine if your tortoise needs to take supplements or change their diet in some way.

, It is a good idea to assess your tortoise's health and behavior on a regular basis so that it is easier to spot when something is wrong. Look over their whole body, including inspecting their shell for damage and their ability to move their body.Also look at your tortoise's beak.If your tortoise has a broken or damaged beak this can cause trauma, which can lead to stomatitis.
A good time to do this is when you are cleaning your tortoise's cage. Pull the tortoise out and look them over while you also freshen up their home.

, Some forms of stomatitis are infectious, meaning they can transfer from one pet tortoise to another.If only one of your tortoises has an infection, it's a good idea to isolate that tortoise so they don't accidentally infect the others.


For example, some cases of stomatitis are caused by a herpesvirus that can be transferred, although usually transfer happens most often in mixed-sex groups of tortoises., Stomatitis is a common post-hibernation complication. Ensure your tortoise is in good health prior to hibernation by getting a check up with a reptile vet.

Acknowledge the emotion.,
Determine if your friend is actually jealous.,
Talk with others in the group.",How to Stop Jealousy Within Your Friend Group1," One of the most important things to do when dealing with jealousy within your group of friends is to acknowledge the emotion. Jealousy may appear as many different emotions: anger, betrayal, insecurities, humiliation, fear, and loss. If you name these feelings are jealousy, you can deal with it. If someone else feels jealousy, you can understand better their responses to things that happen.When you know that a friend is jealous of you or someone else, you can understand that their negative reaction may not be because of the friend, but directed at themselves because they are comparing themselves to others in the group. Jealous emotions usually stem from a sense of inadequacy and a perceived threat to one's self.For example, your friend may get mad sometimes when something good happens to you. Maybe they get upset or feel left out if you do something with someone in the friend group without them. This may all be due to jealousy.;
, You don’t want to accuse your friend of being jealous if they are not. You may be suspicious, but your friend may be going through something difficult. Ask them if they are okay and if there is anything they need to talk about.Your friend may be going through a bad breakup or maybe they have just gotten snubbed by someone they cared about. This can cause them to be negative towards other people in the group's relationships. If they are having family troubles, they may feel more insecure or be more easily upset than usual.
If they say they are fine, you may want to look for signs of jealousy. For example, they may be passive aggressive, overly competitive, unsupportive, or clingy. Other signs of jealousy may include being critical and negative, gossiping, and not congratulating other people on their successes.

, Saying how you feel out loud can help you to become more aware of your feelings and sort them out. If you feel jealous of your friend, you may want to talk with others in the group. Make sure to frame this not as if you are talking behind your friend’s back, but that you are concerned about your own feelings. You want to save the friendship, but you need to talk to someone you can trust.Tell your friend, “I need to talk to you about something. I am feeling jealous of our friend. I know that it is irrational and unfair, but I want to talk through it so I can deal with the emotions and move on.”

Evaluate your circumstances.,
Give them the benefit of the doubt.,
Take into consideration the person’s limitations.,
Decide whether to call out or call in, if anything.",How to Respond when Your Friend Says Something Offensive1," Depending on the situation, it may or may not be a good idea to speak up. Instead of immediately pointing the finger to call your friend a racist, sexist or any other name appropriate to the comment, take several factors into consideration.


Who is present? Are you around children, bosses, or polite company? Pull the friend aside and remind him/her about the situation and the surroundings. Remind your friend that the comment could have a serious negative impact and that damage control may be necessary.
How well do you know the person who made the comment? It's often best to...

Pull aside a close or semi-close friend to explain.
Talk privately with your friend if it was a friend-of-your-friend who made the comment.
Casually point out the comment if the person is an acquaintance.

;
, Sometimes people slip up and say things that don't reflect their true feelings. Start with the assumption that their words were a well-meaning mistake. Your friend may have...


Misread the situation. For example, your friend might have forgotten that it's okay to drop ""f"" bombs among other friends, but not in front of your mom.
Been too nervous or stressed out to think clearly. Sometimes people speak without thinking when they are uncomfortable.
Worded things poorly. For example, perhaps they were trying to mock racism but accidentally sounded like they supported it.
Been clueless. Maybe your friend had no idea that ""r*tard"" was a slur, and will be horrified once they find out.

, Limitations don't excuse hurting others, but they can explain why they didn't know better.


Immature individuals or children may comment on an issue without having proper education or knowledge, which may end up sounding offensive.
Alcohol and other substances can impair judgment, leading people to say things that they would never say when clear-minded.
Disabled people may find it challenging to keep up with social norms and/or understanding abstract topics. They might need you to explain.
People raised within certain environments may not actually realize a comment may be offensive. For example, a boy or man raised without a guidance regarding misogyny may think that talking down to women is normal and acceptable.

, This can depend on the situation, such as how well you know the other person, how others respond to the hurtful remark, your comfort level, and what the desired result is. Whether you challenge them in public or take them aside in public is ultimately up to you.Calling out someone can describe a harmful dynamic as it happens; for example, publicly challenging a mansplainer in a room full of men who like to talk over women can address the problems in the environment.
The private nature of calling in can help them listen without worrying about protecting their reputation.
Public criticism may frighten people with anxiety disorders, abuse survivors, autistic people, and naturally sensitive people. When in doubt, call in.Never decide to call someone out simply to make yourself look better. Your goal is to educate the person, not publicly humiliate them. Act in good faith."
"
Make sure you respond with a cool head.,
Avoid playing the blame game.,
Take some time to cool down.,
Never screenshot the fight and send it to any of your other friends.",How to Resolve a Fight over Social Media with a Friend1," If your friend becomes angry, do not get angry back. Keep your answers levelheaded, respectful and mature; refrain from swearing, name calling or using other abusive language. You should also avoid using all caps and multiple exclamation points, as that is seen as the Internet version of shouting.;
, Even if your friend started the fight, you will want to avoid assigning the blame to him or her by saying ""Well, you started it!"" or ""This never would have happened if you hadn't (done what your friend did)..."" It doesn't matter who started the fight, it's just best if the fight comes to an end. Instead of using these phrases, apologize for anything you did wrong and ask for the fight to come to a halt.

, If you are feeling furiously angry at your friend, or if he or she just wants to continue the fight, this is the best option. Tell your friend you have to go. Excuse yourself with a phrase such as ""I have to go, so bye now"" or even just ""got to go, bye"" and take some time away from the social media website (and the computer) to recharge and cool down.

, They might gossip to their friends and family, or if you're fighting with a school friend, they might start a rumor around the school that you and your friend are fighting over the Internet. It's better to be safe than sorry that way.

Calm down.,
Understand why friends fight.,
Think about the argument – from both sides.,
Remember all the reasons why you were friends in the first place.,
Ask a mutual friend or acquaintance to mediate.,
Set up a time to have a one-on-one conversation.,
Express your feelings using “I” statements.,
Be an active listener.,
Focus on the issue at hand, not past events.,
Negotiate a plan to fix your relationship.,
Apologize.",How to Resolve a Fight With a Friend," In a heated situation it’s easy to lash out at the person we feel has offended us, causing us to say or do things we later regret. Prevent further damage to the relationship by taking a moment to regain your composure. Get some alone time. Tell your friend that you need a moment to clear your head. Do any of the following to calm down after an argument: Go for a walk
Meditate
Practice deep breathing
Run, box, or engage in an activity that provides an outlet for you to vent your frustrations
Listen to relaxing music or guided imagery videos on YouTube
Take a warm bath and use essential oils or light candles;
, If this is your first fight with a friend, you might feel very confused. Why did this happen? Truth is, conflict is an inevitable stumbling block in most relationships. Different people have different values and opinions and sometimes those differences cause you to bump heads. Common reasons friends may disagree include either of you:having problems comprehending what the other is trying to say
having difficulty empathizing with the other’s feelings or current circumstances
exhibiting different beliefs, values, and opinions than the other
demonstrating different needs than the other
feeling stressed out or upset, and accidentally (or, on purpose) taking it out on the other

, Most of the reasons for conflict revolve around not seeing things from another’s perspective. Once you have calmed down, try to think objectively about why the argument may have happened, and how both of you acted during the fight. Grab a pen and notepad and write down a few points from each of your perspectives.Writing from your own perspective will probably be easy. However, you may find it difficult to write from your friend’s point-of-view. If you have no idea what your friend was thinking or feeling, that may be a sign that you need to listen and be more aware of his/her emotions in the future.
If you have trouble recognizing your friend’s perspective, then his or her feelings probably fall into the category of not feeling heard or understood, among other things.

, In the midst of an argument, it can be dreadfully hard to remember the positives about another. As you prepare to talk to your friend about the misunderstanding, recount the good traits this person holds. Analyzing these good traits can help you to not see the situation as all bad and provide clarity as you work towards resolving the conflict.


Why is he/she a part of your life? What do you value about this friendship? How has this person been there for you in the past?

, If you or your friend’s emotions are still running high, it may be hard to reach a solution on your own. Reach out to someone who is unbiased and not affected by the fight. Ask this person sit in on the discussion in order to ensure that both you and your friend are able to voice your concerns.

, Tell him/her she upset you, and that you would like to resolve the problem. If emotions are still running high, you might send a text message, email, or call the person to schedule the meeting. Don’t get into details during this exchange. Simply call your friend and tell him/her that you want to talk about the fight. Decide on a time that is convenient for both of you.An example of how you might broach the subject with your friend may be: ""Hi, I can't stop thinking about our fight, and I miss you. Can we talk this over?"" Try not to get into the details or your feelings over the phone or via email/text.

, When it is your turn to talk, clearly state your point-of-view without blaming or accusing your friend of any wrongdoing. Stick to the facts. A good rule of thumb is to use “I” statements that remove accusatory tones and prevent your friend from getting defensive.


Start by stating your feelings: “I feel ____...” Then connect the feeling to the issue at hand. For example, “I feel ignored when you spend time with your other friends and don’t return my calls.”
Finally, add some sort of solution to your statement. “I wish that you could at least text me and let me know you’re busy rather than just missing all of my calls”.

, Active listening is a method of listening that allows the speaker to get his or her message across and the listener to fully receive the message without distractions or inattention. Active listeners restate the speaker’s message with less words to verify that they understood the intended message. They also reflect empathy by demonstrating that the speaker’s unique feelings are heard. A good acronym for active listening is SOLER. S- squarely face the speaker
O-open your posture (arms uncrossed and at your sides)
L-lean towards the speaker
E-eye contact is maintained
R-relax while attending

, Remain on the current matter. It may feel as if it helps you to more thoroughly explain your concerns if you bring in related examples of the person’s behavior. Avoid this at all costs.


More issues up for discussion makes it harder to resolve any of them. Also, you are more likely to offend your friend if you seem to be building a case against him or her. This is actually counterproductive to conflict resolution. Talk about the issue at hand only.

, Sometimes, but not always, the best thing to do is to forget about the fight completely. Other times, coming out of the fight can make your friendship stronger. Negotiation involves accepting some of your friend’s suggested changes for the relationship and that person reciprocating.An example of a compromise might be: “I understand that you lose track of time when you’re with your other friends. I'll try not to get offended when I don't hear back from you. It would be great if you could just shoot a quick text telling me you’ll call back later. Does that sound reasonable to you?”

, Even if you still feel that you were in the right about the initial argument, it will minimize guilt and defensiveness if you both apologize for your role in the fight.


”I’m sorry for getting angry about you not returning my calls. I will try to be more understanding in the future.”
Give your friend a hug, make plans to hang out later, or change the subject to make it clear that the fight is over.

Determine how the person is masking their jealousy.,
Assess your friendships.,
Figure out why the jealousy occurred.",How to Stop Jealousy Within Your Friend Group2," Jealousy makes people act out negatively when they might not otherwise do so. Sometimes, they may put the jealousy behind them and work towards moving forward to preserve the friendships. The way a person acts affects the entire friend group, whether it is negative or positive. Figure out how they are responding to the jealousy to figure out how to deal with them.For example, the jealous friend may push the jealousy aside and be supportive. However, the jealous friend may let the emotion make them bitter and angry and become a bad friend who talks behind the group’s back or backstabs them.

, If there is a lot of jealousy in your friend group, you should take a look at the friendships within the group. Why are you friends? What are the friendships built on? Have you build your friendships on trust, respect, and a deep connection, or is it based on superficiality and convenience? Understanding the nature of the friendships within the group can help you figure out what to do.True friends who truly care about one another and respect each other won’t feel bitter jealousy that leads to deception or harm. They may feel jealous, but it will be benign jealousy that is easy dealt with.
Insecure or superficial friendships may not have the deep respect and connection needed to move beyond bitter jealousy.
If you find that your group of friends is superficial or materially competitive, then it might be wise to find new friends.

, If you feel the jealousy, you should take a long look at yourself and why you feel these emotions. If the jealousy is with someone else, you should have a conversation with them about why they feel jealous.You may want to ask them why they feel jealous. Then, help them realize that the feelings are not really about their friend. They may be about themselves. If this is the case, be there for them and help them deal with the underlying feelings.
For example, you may say, “Do you know why you are jealous of our friend? Is it because you have feelings of low self-esteem or feel like you have failed? You are my friend and I care about you. You are not a failure and I like you. I want to help.”
Try to figure out what the jealousy is about because this will help you determine how you can support the person and resolve the situation. For example, is there any jealousy regarding a romantic relationship, another person's success, or someone's abilities?

Be supportive to your friend.,
Confront the friend.,
Avoid accusations.,
Keep more information to yourself.,
Take a break from the person.",How to Stop Jealousy Within Your Friend Group3," Jealousy is a sign that someone feels inadequate and that they may lack self-esteem. Some things you can do to be supportive include:

Helping them to cultivate positive feelings based on their own qualities.
Helping them take responsibility for their perceived lack.
Finding common ground with them.

, If your friend is jealous and is treating you or someone else in the friend group negatively, talk to them about it. They might not know they are being mean or underhanded. If they know it, you can take the chance to discuss the problem the two of you are having.For example, you may say, “I have noticed some issues in our group recently. I'm worried something is bothering you. We need to talk about this before it affects our friendship.”

, When you talk to your friend, they may get extremely defensive. If they are jealous, they may feel embarrassed, guilty, or angry. To avoid losing a friend, don’t accuse your friend of anything. Make them realize you don’t blame them or think they were out to hurt you.Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. For example, you may say, “I feel hurt by how unsupportive and passive aggressive you have been. I think we should talk about this because I value your friendship.”

, You may need to distance yourself emotionally from the friend if they are jealous of you. If you are working towards a goal, a jealous friend may try to discourage you or undermine you. This may end up hurting you in the long run. To help with this, keep certain things to yourself.For example, if you make progress on your goal or hit a milestone, you may not share it with that person.
Keeping your distance can help you not feel discouraged or upset.

, If your friend continues to be jealous no matter what, you may want to physically distance yourself from that person. You may not be able to get them out of the friend group, but you can control how much you interact with the person.For example, you can limit what you tell the person and how much time you spend with the person.
If they ask you why you are acting the way you are, be honest. Say, “I do not appreciate your jealousy towards me. It is hurtful and destructive. I think we should take a friendship break because of this.”

"
"
Bond with your friends.,
Offer to listen to your friend.,
Use the jealousy to move forward.,
Emphasize positive traits.",How to Stop Jealousy Within Your Friend Group4," Jealousy may arise when friendship bonds start to weaken. This may be caused by distance, busy lives, or growing apart. To help try to fix the jealousy in the group, try spending some quality time together. Use this time to get to know one another again and remember why you were friends in the first place.


For example, you may start going to dinner more frequently, like a weekly pizza night or someone different hosting dinner every week. Do something fun together after dinner, like watching movies, playing video or board games, or sitting around eating dessert while talking.
Go on a group outing to somewhere fun, like a concert, a local park, a museum, or a community event. Try to use the experience to bond and have fun together.
Spend a weekend together. Rent a cabin or lake house and spend the weekend enjoying each other's friendship.

, If your friend is the jealous one, offer to listen to them with an unbiased ear. Tell them that you are there for them and will listen if they are having problems. However, make it clear that you still care about the other friend, but you care about them, too. Tell your friend you want to be there for them.For example, you can say, “I know you feel jealous of our friend. Jealousy is a natural emotion. I am here to listen to you and help you through this if you want. I will not judge. I care for you both, and I don’t want the friendship to be ruined.”

, Sometimes, people feel jealous because their friend is doing something they wish they could do. If this is the case in your friend group, use this moment as a learning moment. Get inspired to do something to better yourself or achieve a goal you’ve always wanted.For example, you may be jealous because your friend got into shape, learned to play an instrument, or made a career change. You may want something similar for your life. Instead of being jealous, use your friend’s success as inspiration to make a change in your own life.

, Often, jealousy arises when someone feels compared to someone else and lacking. To help yourself or your friend if this is the cause of the jealousy, focus on the positive traits. This helps people not feel left out or less important or liked than others.This should be for all the people in the friend group. Make sure everyone feels equally valued and each person’s strengths and accomplishments are treated with the same enthusiasm.

Give a nonverbal no.,
Roll your eyes over a comment made by someone you don't particularly care for or don't trust.",How to Respond when Your Friend Says Something Offensive2," Silently shake your head while mouthing the word no. Watch for them to notice and get the message.

, If you consider the person to be rude or mean-spirited, communicate your disappointment by scoffing, rolling your eyes, or muttering ""ugh."" This makes your unhappiness clear while keeping their remark beneath you, making them less likely to escalate.

"
"
Only speak up if you feel comfortable doing so.,
Take a moment to calm yourself.,
Separate yourself and your friend from the group if you choose to call in.,
Lead with a compliment.,
Criticize the remark, not the person.,
Investigate faulty reasoning.,
Reassure your friend that you still like and respect them.",How to Respond when Your Friend Says Something Offensive3," You are not responsible for making the world a perfect place, nor should you risk your safety if you're worried that the other person might turn aggressive. If you don't feel that you can handle speaking up, don't blame yourself.


If the conversation turns bad and you don't want to continue, stop. Say ""I need some air"" or ""I don't want to talk about this anymore"" and leave. Your mental health comes first.

, Take a deep breath, and remind yourself that your goal is to teach (not to attack). Keeping your cool will help you think clearly to address the hurtful remark.


You can let loose your anger in private later, by screaming into a pillow, punching the couch, playing sports, et cetera.
It's best to address the remark soon. (Don't wait for days or weeks.) If you take too long, your friend might not even remember what they said, and your bad feelings may fester and drive a divide between the two of you.

, Invite them to go somewhere with you. If at first they don't mention why, say you'd like to talk to them in private for a minute.


""I'm going to the restroom. Jessa, would you come too?""
""Adriel, let's go to the snack stand for a minute.""

, By pre-emptively complimenting the person, you make it clear that you still think highly of them, and that you aren't attacking them as a person. This way, they are more likely to listen to you. If you can't think of a compliment, make one up.


For example, ""I'm surprised to hear a compassionate, thoughtful person like you say something like that.""
""I'm startled to hear that coming from a fair-minded person like you.""

, If you criticize the person, they may feel attacked and stop listening to what you say. Make it clear that you like the person; it's their current behavior that you disagree with.

, Instead of blowing up when your friend says Muslims are naturally violent, take a deep breath and ask why they think that. Asking questions can engage their critical thinking skills and help them re-evaluate their remark. Your friend may even lead themselves to the conclusion that they were wrong. Useful questions include:


Why?
How do you know?
Why would you say/do that?
Do you agree with that?
How do you think ______ feel about that?

, Emphasize that the fact that they messed up is less important than how they respond to it. No one enjoys being told that they did something bad, so it's good to reinforce their self-esteem afterwards and remind them that this mistake does not define them.


If they directly hurt someone, offer to help them apologize and/or make up for it.

"
Set up a time to discuss the fight in person.,
Tell your friend that you need to talk about a serious issue.,
Bring up the fight on social media and state that you want to discuss the issue.,
Anticipate your friend to share his or her story as well.,
Admit your wrongdoings and apologize for them.,
Keep a distance from your friend for awhile.",How to Resolve a Fight over Social Media with a Friend2," Fights can get very heated on the Internet, so it is best to discuss it in person rather than on the Internet. Ask your friend what an appropriate time for a talk would be.


You can also go ""impromptu"" but this only works if your friend is available enough; if he or she is usually busy, it is best to set up a time in advance.

, If he or she becomes angry or lashes out, listen, but do not lash out in return. Stay levelheaded and respectful, and avoid shouting, yelling, name calling, or screaming out vulgarities and swear words.

, If you had upset or angry feelings about something that your friend did that caused the fight (or caused you to say something that you didn't mean or shouldn't have said), now is the time to calmly and respectfully take up your concerns with your friend.


For example, you could say, ""Mary, I didn't appreciate it when you called me a nuisance and a loser the other day (just for mispronouncing your last name) when we were chatting on Facebook. It made me feel insulted and unappreciated. Please understand that just because you know how to pronounce a word or a name, doesn't mean that everyone in the world does. I would truly appreciate it if you avoided insulting me the way you did from here on forth"".

, There are two sides to the story of a fight. As your friend shares his or her story, listen and don't interrupt (and don't finish your friend's sentences for him or her; wait patiently for him or her to finish the sentence).

, Perhaps you did something wrong that caused the fight, or escalated the amount of conflict between you and your friend, so now is the time to apologize.


When you are apologizing, be sure to use ""I"" statements. Address the apology to yourself and what you did wrong, not what your friend did wrong.

Example of a proper apology: ""John, I'm sorry that I told you to back off when we were chatting on Instagram on Thursday. I was stressed and tired from a long day at work, plus thinking about the paperwork I had to file. I will take care to think before I respond to you in the future"".
Example of a non-apology apology: ""I'm sorry that I called you an insulting name, but you were annoying me so much that I got mad at you and decided to retaliate"".



, Try to avoid contacting him or her on social media for a while until you both have had some chance to recover from the fight.

Pay attention when your friend puts you down.,
Be wary of a friend who gossips about you.,
Consider mockery carefully.,
Consider your feelings about your friend and the time spent together.,
Recognize what constitutes a healthy friendship.,
Act on your feelings and analysis of the situation.",How to Recognize a Toxic Friend," Friends are friends because they support us. They don't necessarily have to agree with us, or even share our tastes, but they do tend to be relationships of mutual respect, joy in one another's company, and acceptance of difference of both attitude and actions. If your friend is constantly saying things that demean you, that make you feel small or unhappy, or if your friend makes you feel unworthy and pitied, then you have lost a friend and gained a critic. If this happens on a regular basis, you're with a toxic friend.;
, Any friend who tells tales on a friend is not a friend. Instead, being with you simply offers this person an opportunity to glean details for spreading around to others. If you find out that this is happening, you're with a toxic friend. Be careful about jumping to assumptions, however. If your friend slips up once, this may just be a situation of not handling things properly and they might seek your forgiveness. If it happens regularly, however, the pattern should serve to warn you.

, Mockery can commence in a friendship as mere, gentle ribbing of one's faults by way of endearment or genuine affection. If it becomes the normal way of relating, however, especially in front of other people, then you have a recipe for a toxic friendship. After a time, it can be too easy for such a friend to use this a defense mechanism to ward off criticism of themselves and to offload that onto you. In this case, you become the target that your friend uses to outplay the potential for attack from others against them.

, Ask yourself these questions:


Is this something that your friend has just started to do, or has it been going on for a long time?
Do you feel unhappy after spending time with this friend? Does spending time with your friend make you feel defensive or upset?
Do you spend time justifying your own behavior around your friend instead of it feeling ""natural"" to be together?
Are you happy with this friend?
Do you feel belittled, attacked or used?
Does the friendship feel unbalanced and like plain hard work?
Do you feel at fault for things that happen to your friend?
Has your friend betrayed your confidences?
Does it feel like competition rather than a balanced and caring friendship?

, It is important to look at things in the positive light as well as the negative situation, to help you balance your feelings and the interpretation of the situation. A good, healthy friendship involves feeling like you are supporting one another, acting as a sounding board for each other. Good friends don't compete negatively; if there is competition, it is openly acknowledged and each other's achievements are lauded and appreciated equally.

Good friends care for one another, and keep secrets between each other. Good friends spend time helping each other overcome adversity rather than creating it and maintaining it. Good friendships are relationships that make both people feel good about themselves and feel natural.

Even though a friendship needs to be worked on as much as any relationship, a good friendship doesn't feel like work; it feels like building foundations, and growing a garden; pleasant, worthwhile, rewarding, and filled with give-and-take in equal measure.









, If you recognize the signs of a toxic friendship, get yourself out of it and move on. It is not worth continuing at the expense of your health, self-esteem, and happiness.

"
"
Think about why you drifted apart.,
Make contact with a brief note or call.,
Talk on the phone or exchange emails to restart conversation.,
Open up about your life first.,
Set up a time to meet in person.,
Start slowly.,
Continue making time for your old friends.",How to Rekindle a Friendship1," There are a lot of reasons why people lose friendships, from distance and time to conflicting schedules or changing interests. You need to spend some time examining what caused you to drift apart so that you can find ways to remedy the issue. If, for example, one of you moved across the country, you may not be able to become best friends again easily. But you can still have a meaningful friendship using email, Skype, and phone calls.;
, Don't feel like you need to catch up with each other instantly. Take the time to send a quick message to your friend with your contact info and tell them you would love to talk sometime.


Don't feel like you need to fill them in on your life now — save this conversation for when you meet later.

, If you live far away and cannot meet anytime soon, spend some time with each other online or on the phone. The best way to build or rebuild a friendship is to talk.

, You don't have to get into all of your secrets, but giving a quick update on your life makes your friend more likely to share things about him or herself. Friendships rely on trust, and you need to let them know that they can still trust you with information and details about their life. The best way to do this is to show that you still trust them with your own stories.


Move beyond surface conversation to talk about things that matter to you, like your life and work. Friends usually talk about much more than the weather.

, Think of an activity you both enjoy doing together, and arrange to meet up. A light, casual, one-on-one meeting is the best chance to get to know each other again and rekindle the friendship without pressure to be ""besties"" immediately.


Try to limit this first meeting to 1-2 hours — the goal is simply to reconnect with each other.

, Don't try to rush right back into ""best-friends"" territory. Have realistic expectations for this first conversation, especially if the last time you talked was 8 months ago or if you ended on bad terms. Have a friendly, open tone as you ask what they've been doing and how they've been. If things go well, you can begin to get into deeper, more involved conversations.

, Relationships—romantic or otherwise—take time and energy to maintain. If you reach out and reconnect, then quickly disappear off the face of the earth again, chances are you won't be able to rekindle your friendship. Schedule times to meet or talk, ask how they are doing, and find ways to include them in your life to truly reconnect.


Meet for drinks once a week.
Invite them to parties or events with ""new"" friends.
Send letters or emails with details from your life from time to time.

"
Remember what caused your falling out.,
Start with small, non-confrontational meetings.,
Start the conversation by catching up casually.,
Apologize for your faults in the fight.,
Avoid pointing fingers at the other person.,
Work through your conflicts, even if they are difficult.,
Make it known that you would like to resume the friendship.,
Take things slow at first.",How to Rekindle a Friendship2," Why did you stop being friends? Did you get into a fight about money, business, or relationships, or did constant bickering drive you apart? Think not only about the fight, but about your place in it. What have you learned since then, and how have you changed? If you don't take the time to at least think about the problems in your friendship, you will not be able to get over them.

, Ask to meet your friend in a public place so that there is no pressure to get personal right off the bat. A cup of coffee, a walk in the park, or drinks after work are all nice, low-key ways to meet someone and test the waters for rekindling a friendship.


Your first meeting should be a chance to talk and catch up, so give yourself time and space to chat.
At this stage you are trying to feel out their emotions and see if you can still be friends. Don't come into the meeting with expectations or an agenda.

, Don't feel like you need to dive into the bad blood between you right off the bat. If they've agreed to meet you, then they want to move on just like you do. Take some time to remember why you were friends in the first place by catching up about work, life, spouses, or hobbies.

, This is often the best way to approach the subject, but it doesn't have to be a bent-knee confession. You can begin with something as simple as ""I'm sorry for how I acted last time we hung out."" This starts the process of moving past your conflicts and rebuilding your friendship.

, Even if you think your fight was their fault, blaming your friend will only make reconciliation more difficult. Many things may have changed since you last saw each other, and it is unfair to meet with someone just to accuse them. Have a conversation, not an inquisition.

, If there are still hard feelings, don't be afraid to address them. You were friends for a reason, and given the right amount of maturity, there should be no reason why you can't be friends again. Use ""I"" statements, like: ""I felt (this) when (this happened)"" or ""Looking back, I feel like (this) because of (this)."" When you use this method, you're able to express your feelings without accusation, and you let your friend know your true feelings.

, Make a point towards the end of the meeting to set up another time to hang out. While you don't have to have a set date in mind, saying, ""it's been great to catch up, I'd love to meet again soon,"" tells someone that you are serious about rekindling your friendship.

, You do not have to become best friends again the minute you see one another. Work on your issues together, and keep meeting once every few weeks until you feel that your concerns have been addressed. If you feel that you've been wronged, and that your friend is ignoring the conflict or refusing to change, then you may be headed toward another falling-out.


That said: if you feel like you've both moved on and feel comfortable, then don't avoid each other. Congratulate yourself on successfully mending your relationship, and enjoy your rediscovered bond.

Talk to each other once or twice a month.,
Remember big occasions, like birthdays or anniversaries.,
Build trust with each other.,
Help your friend out when they are in need.",How to Rekindle a Friendship3," Talking is the best way to keep a friendship alive and stay in someone's mind. Make time in your day to catch up with old friends so that you have things to talk about when you meet up again.


Don't feel like you need to share everything or talk once a week. Simply taking an hour every now and then to chat is often all you need to do to keep a friendship alive.

, Sending a card or message to someone on their birthday shows them that you still value their friendship. Even a quick note to celebrate an old anniversary, like the day you graduated together or started your first road-trip, can bring up shared memories that keep your friendship alive.

, Best friends remain friends because they have a bond of trust that can sustain time and distance. This means sharing secrets, fears, and worries, and knowing that you will get good, honest advice in return. It also means keeping the secrets and stories of your friend to yourself. No matter how far away you are, you should feel like your friend has your back, and you should have theirs.

, Even a kind, considerate note can be enough to help someone in a tough spot. Good friends are there when the going gets tough, even if they haven't talked in several months. Offer to help with problems, support them in hard times, and show that you are a friend in the bad times as well as the good.

Tune into your feelings about the situation.,
Watch for someone who threatens withdrawal.,
Look for someone who makes you feel guilty.,
Be wary of people who make their problems seem more urgent than yours.,
Pay attention to an excessive use of facts and figures.,
Note when someone refuses to speak.,
Listen to the volume of the person’s voice.,
Think about times when the person has tried to catch you off-guard.,
Pay attention to criticism.",How to Prevent Yourself from Being Manipulated1," Manipulation can be subtle, so it can be difficult to recognize when it is happening to you. However, there are some common things that manipulators tend to do, such as casting doubt, projecting insecurities, and making you doubt yourself.By learning to tune into how you are feeling, you may be able to spot manipulation more easily.


The next time you think you might be being manipulated, stop and ask yourself, ""Am I doing this because I want to or because I feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, afraid, obligated, responsible etc.?"" If you are doing something for one of the latter reasons, then it is possible that you are being manipulated.;
, People who make you feel like they will take something away from you if you don’t act the way they want are manipulating you. These threats may involve the withdrawal of many things – their company, their love, their money, their support, or any other thing they might threaten to withhold from you.Many people are motivated by this kind of manipulation at work (working late because they fear they won’t get their next promotion if they don’t), but it can be more damaging in personal relationships between people because these interactions involve more intimate emotions.
An example of a love withdrawal statement is, “Sure, you can do whatever you like, but don’t expect me to be here when you get home. I’m done with you.”

, A manipulative person will try to make you feel guilty for not doing what they want you to do. They might achieve this goal by acting like you are letting them down or by talking about how much of an inconvenience/hardship something is for them.


Typically, we experience guilt when we feel like we have gone back on our end of a bargain. But in situations where you suspect you are being manipulated, try to consider whether you consciously agreed to the thing you feel guilty about or if the person is just making you feel guilty for no reason.
A guilt statement might sound like, “I really thought you cared about me, but I guess this is more important to you. I see how little our relationship means to you, and I wonder if you even love me.”

, Manipulative people often manipulate others by making their own problems seem more important or more pressing than the problems of other people. If you feel obligated to help someone with something (and this seems to happen quite regularly), you are probably being manipulated.When we decide what tasks are most important to complete in our own lives, urgency is one way we organize our tasks and decide which to complete first. But when other people get to determine a thing’s urgency, this is problematic and manipulative.

, People who spout out lots of facts and figures may also be trying to manipulate you. The idea behind this tactic is to make you feel as though you do not know as much as the other person. Someone who does this is trying to convince you that he or she is intellectually superior to you., Some people manipulate others by refusing to speak first or giving you the silent treatment. When someone does this, he or she may be probing for information that he or she can use against you. The person may wait for you to speak to find out what you think is happening and what your goals are., Some people will shout or speak loudly to subdue other people. This person may drown out your voice with his or her own to get you to stop trying to defend yourself and give in to the other person’s demands.If someone is yelling at you or speaking over you, then this is likely manipulation. He or she may also use other tactics to subdue you, such as blocking your path or standing over you.

, Someone can also manipulate you by springing things on you and taking advantage of your lack of preparation. By catching you off-guard, the person is hoping that you will be more likely to give in to his or her request.For example, someone who is trying to manipulate you might ask you an important question right when you walk through the door. Or, someone might try to get you to perform an important task with little to no notice.

, Someone who is being manipulative may also use criticism to gain an advantage over you. He or she may even mask the criticism as humor or as coming from a place of love.However, if someone is criticizing you to get something that he or she wants, then this is manipulation.


For example, someone who is trying to sell you a new phone might mask criticism with humor by saying something like, “Geez, is your phone from the stone age?” However, this person is clearly trying to make you feel insecure about your phone so that you will buy a new one.
Someone may also mask criticism with expressions of love, such as by saying, “Even though you don’t put much effort into your appearance, I still love you.” This statement is mean to make the person feel insecure about his or her looks, but the speaker attempts to mask it with a tacked-on statement of love.

Talk it out.,
Think positively.,
Accept your partner for who they are.,
Do something new together.,
See a couple’s therapist.",How to Overcome Problems1," Communication is the most important tool in your relationship. Talk about things that you are bothering by, your likes and dislikes, and discuss solutions to your problems. Be as honest as your possibly can, and dig deep to get at your feelings.As you communicate with your partner, listen and be open minded. Frame your statements in a positive way, using I statements. For example, instead of saying, “you make me sad.”, say something like, “I feel sad when you don’t remember our anniversaries”.;
, Your relationship may feel like an endless cycle of negativity; complaining about work and friends or constantly nagging each other. Break from the cycle by focusing on the good, and orientating towards what is positive in your relationship. For example, focus on the great attributes of your partner, such as their humor, or the wonderful things you have accomplished together, such as buying a home or going on great vacations.Think positively by expressing gratitude. Say thank you to each other to remind yourself of the good qualities of your partner.
Making light of certain situations will help you feel and think more positively. Be playful and embrace humor!, You chose your partner, flaws and all. Accept every part of your partner, both the good and the bad. If you partner chronically runs late for events, accept it, and don’t try to change them. Accept that is their decision to be late, and be on time yourself.To help you accept your partner, focus on their best attributes to outshine the negative ones.

, Plan an exciting date like kayaking, go on a spontaneous vacation, or go on a treasure hunt! Have fun doing new things together. This will get you back to your roots of when you first met. Everything you did together was new back then, so consciously doing new things will help you remember where the sparks came from.As you are doing new things together, pretend you are on a first date. On your first date, you tried to impress by dressing nicely and being on your best behavior., Some relationship problems are difficult to solve without outside help. You might want to consider seeking professional couple’s counselling to help overcome your issues. A counselor is professionally trained to give you both equal time to share your feelings and will provide guidance on how to overcome your issues.Be as honest as possible and ask each other and the counselor questions. Make the most of your couple’s therapy by being actively involved."

Think about the individual(s) manipulating you.,
Ask the manipulator questions.,
Refuse the request.,
Don’t give in to continued attempts.,
Confront the person.,
Don’t give in to flattery.",How to Prevent Yourself from Being Manipulated2," Is it a group of people, or just one person? If you are dealing with a group of people, it is best to confront either the leader of the group or the weakest person in the group.


Tell them that you feel like they are pressuring you into doing something you don’t want to do.

, When you feel you are being manipulated, try asking the person a series of probing questions. This may catch them off guard and allow you the time you need to analyze the situation and make a decision about how you want to handle it.Some questions you could ask include:


Do I have a say in this?
Does this seem reasonable to you?
Are you asking me or telling me?
What do I get out of this?
Does what you want from me sound fair?

, When this person(s) asks you to do something you do not want to do, simply refuse. This can be difficult at first, but you have to understand that no good will come out of it for either of you. Once you say no, the person will most likely be surprised.Learning to firmly say no is an important part of not allowing yourself to be manipulated.

, If you are continually pressured to do something unpleasant, say no and walk away. Do not allow the person(s) to coerce you by pressuring you over and over. If they don’t accept your refusal, simply exit the situation.

, It is best to do this in a private place. Explain that you do not want to let yourself be controlled. However, you should also mention that you still want to continue the friendship, as long as this person is willing to change their behavior.Most of the time, this person will not want to continue the relationship. Do not be depressed about this. Recognize the fact that your life was not improved at all by this person.

, One of the main methods of manipulation that people use is giving undue flattery. When someone praises you, especially when you really haven’t done anything to deserve it, this feels good and it’s easy to give in to it. But that is just a form of trickery by a manipulative person who knows exactly what they’re doing.Try telling them that you appreciate the compliment, but you don’t feel like you’ve done enough to deserve such comments.

Look inward for potential causes.,
Avoid manipulative people when possible.,
Use your experiences to aid you in the future.",How to Prevent Yourself from Being Manipulated3," Ask yourself about the underlying causes of your own personal manipulation. Perhaps you have a tough time saying no, period. Or you feel sorry for a certain person. Either way, it is important to recognize the root of the issue (and the role you may play in your own manipulation) so that you can work on preventing it in the future.


Recognizing the reasons you feel compelled to help, or are easily manipulated, will help you avoid similar situations in the future.

, You don’t owe a manipulative person anything, despite how they may try to make you feel. You are free to choose how you spend your time and with whom. If you feel like you are being constantly manipulated by a particular person, choose to avoid them.This doesn’t mean that you have to end the friendship or relationship. Just be more in control of how often you see the person and under what circumstances.

, Learn how to detect early signs of manipulative behavior. For example, a person like this will want to influence your appearance. They will constantly give you ""suggestions"" as to how you should change your looks and personality. Some examples of this are:


""Are you really gonna wear that dress to the party?""
""You should stop laughing that loud.""
""You shouldn't wear loose jeans. No one likes a girl that wears loose jeans.""

Ask a trusted friend for advice.,
Go to counseling.,
Take a break.",How to Prevent Yourself from Being Manipulated4," Speak to family or friends who are present when you get taken advantage of. What are some behaviors that often occur between you are the other person(s)? You can try to observe the situation yourself, but getting opinions from others is usually more helpful because they can give you an objective viewpoint.


An outside party will notice things that you miss because you are too involved in the situation.

, Sometimes it’s helpful to get insight into our own behavior by discussing it with a trained professional in a counseling or therapy setting. Going to counseling can help you identify the reasons you allow yourself to be manipulated, the motivations other people might have for manipulating you, and what you can do to proactively change the situation.

, If you’re feeling overwhelmed by a particularly manipulative person, take a break from them. Don’t feel obligated to continue relationships that stress you out. If you need a break from a person, take one. You are in charge of your own life.You could even go on vacation for a while to get some peace and quiet away from everyone.

Attack your problem head-on.,
Reframe your problem.,
Set attainable goals.,
Imagine your professional life in ten years.,
Talk to someone.",How to Overcome Problems2," Don’t avoid your problem by shoving it under the rug. Tackle your work problem head-on and be aggressive in your strategies to prevail! If you are deciding between important job offers that each would lead you on a different course in your professional life, don’t wait until the last minute to decide. Instead, gather all the information you can about each job and talk with others to make a well informed decision you will be happy about.


Make pros/cons lists and to help you tackle your work problem.

, Think of your problem as an opportunity to improve yourself and take on new responsibilities. It can be a chance to show your boss a side of you they have never seen, which might lead to some sort of promotion.Take away all of your assumptions about your problem to help you overcome them. For example, make a list of the assumptions about a product in your industry. Then, think about what would happen if they weren’t there or you did the opposite. For example, Cirque du Soleil challenged our common assumptions of what a ‘circus’ was, and made something innovative and profitable., Do you want to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or run your own restaurant? Write down your ultimate goal, and then break it down into smaller goals. Each one of these smaller goals will help in the pursuit of your larger goal.Ensure that your goals are attainable and measurable, so you can monitor your progress. Celebrate in some way after reaching each goal.

, Visualize what you want your life to look like in five or ten years. Assess how this problem will help or hinder your imagined future. How can you tackle this problem to ensure your future is bright, and the way you thought it would be?


Visualizing a solution to your problem can also be helpful. Think about all the possible solutions and how you would achieve each. Decide which solution helps you the most and has the least amount of backlash with your colleagues.

, Ask for guidance from a mentor, family member, or other support group in your life. Overcoming problems can be very challenging when done alone. Asking for outside opinions might help put things in perspective and give you options you never though about.If you are uncomfortable talking to people you know such as family or friends, talk to a religious leader, counsellor, call an anonymous help line, or find a community support group. You can express your feelings and seek help without the fear of judgment or other repercussions.

Identify the source of your financial problems.,
Open a savings account.,
Create a budget.,
Reduce spending in small steps.,
Keep track of your spending.",How to Overcome Problems3," Are you unemployed or did you have an unexpected accident that cost you thousands of dollars you weren’t intending on spending? Sit down and figure out your largest financial burden by looking through all your bills and considering personal experiences or expenses that might be related to your financial woes.Sometimes, identifying the source of your financial troubles can be challenging. For example, if you are emotionally attached to something, such as an expensive car, or you are addicted to shopping. The best way to really decipher the root cause of your problems is to strictly look at the numbers.
Make a spreadsheet of your expenses based on your monthly bills. Order your costs from high to low to establish where the majority of your money is going.

, A savings account is critical to helping you get out of financial troubles. It can often prevent financial issues from ever occurring. It is recommended that you have enough savings to cover six months of living expenses, should financial troubles emerge. The best way to start a savings account is to divert some of your monthly spending into your savings account. Take the $100 you might spend on a concert ticket, and put it in your savings account instead.If you are already in financial troubles without a savings account, start one immediately and prioritize investing in it. It will help you in the long run, so you don’t have to worry too much the next time you run into financial issues., Once you have figured out where your money is going, establish a strict monthly budget for yourself. Your budget will help guide your spending decisions and help you to spend your money in the most efficient way possible.Start by knowing how much money you make on a monthly basis. Then, prioritize your budget by first setting aside money for car, house, student loans, and other necessary monthly payments. Then include other things such as groceries, gas, and entertainment.
Adjust your budget according to inflation rates. For example, gas prices fluctuate and seasonal differences in your groceries should all be taken into account on a monthly basis.

, You probably don’t have the luxury of cutting $500 from one expense. So instead, try reducing 3 or 4 expenditures by $75 or $100. The easiest place to cut spending in small steps are your superfluous expenditures. For example, if you tend to eat out more than cook at home, start buying more groceries and learn to cook! You can save lots of money each month by making small, but meaningful, changes.Cutting your spending in small steps will allow you to gradually become used to a different lifestyle.

, Keep copious records of your spending. Save receipts and make folders in your email for bills and online receipts. Keep a budget worksheet of your expected expenses, and follow up with it each month to see if you are actually keeping to your budget.There are many advantageous smartphone apps to help you keep track of you spending. You can even connect some apps to your credit cards to help you keep track of your spending."

Find out how to contact your friend.,
Send an email or private message.,
Give your friend time to respond.",How to Rekindle a Lost Friendship1," Before you can rekindle the friendship, you need to first make contact with your old friend. Talk to mutual friends, use the internet, or other resources to find how to contact your friend.For example, you could ask a mutual friend, “Have you heard from Sandy lately? I’d love to get in contact with her?”
Try doing a Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Whitepages.com search for your friend’s first and last name. Use their middle initial or name if you know it.
If you went to school together, try getting your friend’s contact information from your school’s alumni association.;
, Once you know how to contact your friend, send them a message.Instead of putting your old friend on the spot with a phone call which could be awkward, email them or send them a direct message letting them know you want to rekindle the friendship.


Keep your message brief, genuine, and upbeat. You will have time to catch up on everything later.
For example, you might say, “Hi Carole! It’s Syun-Hi. It’s been a while, but I’d love to get together and catch up. Do you think you might have time soon?”
Or you could try, “Hi, Natalie. This is Tsan from tennis class a few years back. I know it’s been ages, but if you’re up to it, I’d love to catch up.”

, You are probably excited to get back in touch with them, but don’t get offended if your friend doesn’t respond to your message immediately. It could be that your friend is trying to figure out what to say in response or is just extremely busy.Keep in mind that not everyone checks or responds to email or other messages immediately.
Consider the possibility that you may not have the correct contact information.
If you haven’t received a response after a couple of weeks, try your search again to try to find a new way to contact your friend.
If your friend responds, but doesn’t want to rekindle the friendship, then respect that and don’t contact them again.

Traveling by Air: Airlines transport pets everyday and this can be a good resource/option for you to investigate.,
Post Move:  As soon as you arrive at the new residence, settle your reptile into his/her new home/habitat to alleviate moving stress as quickly as possible.","How to Safely and Properly Pack, Transport and Move Your Reptile"," This routine checkup is a great time to obtain an extra copy of your pet’s medical history ( this can save you up to $50.00 dollars at the next office). Ask your vet if they know of any special state laws or requirements that pertain to your reptile. Some states have very strict guidelines on specific reptiles and require registration and or special licenses. Although you may be swamped during your pack and move, don’t forget to keep your reptiles daily routine and feeding schedules the same until the actual move day. This regular schedule will help keep your reptile calm and secure. Reptiles are creatures of habit (no pun intended)! Also, it’s really important to have your pet accustomed to the crate, box or carrier he or she will be transported in during the move. Remember that your carrier must be large enough for the reptile to turn around in but not large enough for it to get hurt. Also, refrain from placing too many objects inside of the crate for comfort as these objects can hurt or injure your pet in transit. Having a copy of all of your pets recent medical history attached to the front of the carrier can also prevent your pet from entering any quarantined area during routine transportation inspections ( especially at border crossings between countries (USA to Canada and USA to Mexico in addition to all domestic airports). Check with the state of relocation to make sure that you’re able to have your particular species as a domesticated pet.;
, Always remember that venomous reptiles should be packed in two boxes whereas non-venomous reptiles can be placed inside one sturdy box. Be sure the containers are well ventilated with proper size holes and the box is marked ""Fragile” and “Live Cargo"".  Some reptiles need a wet environment, so keep moist towels in the box as well to prevent dehydration if applicable. Make sure that you write your first and last name and cell number on the moving carrier.

, Check with your vet, as many will loan you a professional carrier to move your reptile (just ask them for a one day loaner).  Make sure the carrier is in a safe place inside of the car and will not be crushed by other boxes. It must be properly ventilated at all times during transport. Even if it’s a short trip, bring extra food and water just in case of an emergency or traffic delay in arriving to your new place.

,  Airlines will take reptiles as “cargo only” and will be an expensive mode of transportation. The other issue is that they are not going to care for your pet like you care for your pet. Make sure all of your current medical records are easily accessible and attached to the front of the cage. Clearly write the type of reptile (not the crazily long and usually scary scientific name but the consumer name for your pet), required temperature, feeding times and any additional special medical needs. Include your first and last name, cell number and an alternate number in case you’re delayed in route, in addition to your home address and address of your new residence. Cover all of your basis and it’s a very good idea to have a small and cute picture of your pet taped to the front of the cage, to minimize additional interest during the course of transport.

,  Place the cage in a quiet room away from all the unloading and unpacking that may also add stress to your reptile.  Verify the right temperature in the cage and refresh the food and water before your pet enters. Try not to change his habitat for at least 3 weeks, until your reptile begins to act normal.

Plan for the initial reunion to be short but sweet.,
Do something you both used to enjoy.,
Invite your friend to a group event.,
Acknowledge that it’s been a while.,
Talk about who you are now.",How to Rekindle a Lost Friendship2," Remember that you both may have changed a lot. The friend you used to adore could be super annoying now. So plan a meeting that’s long enough to get an overview of each other now, but not so long that you feel stuck if they aren’t the person you remember. This can also help to keep things positive and make room for another meeting in the future.


Meet your friend for coffee or happy hour during the week. If things don’t go well, you can easily say you’re busy the next day and can’t stay long.
If things do go well, you can stay longer or plan to meet up for a longer time on the weekend.
You might tell your friend, “Why don’t we get together Wednesday afternoon for smoothies?”

, A great way to reunite after a separation from a friend is to plan to do something that bonded the two of you in the past.For example, if you two used to love visiting all the frozen yogurt spots in the area, then invite your friend for frozen yogurt at an old hangout.
Or, if you all used to meet up at sporting events, then ask your friend to get together to catch an upcoming game.

, It may be awkward meeting with your friend if you haven’t seen each other in a while. Doing something as part of a group can make rekindling your lost friendship a lot easier on both of you.Invite your friend to a dinner party or picnic that you are attending. It will be even better if there are other people you both know.
Try asking your friend to join you and some others in a game of basketball or flag football.
You might also want to ask you friend what they would like to do. Giving them a say in what you do together may help to increase the chance that they will want to join in.

, You can rekindle your lost friendship if you talk about the fact that it’s been some time since you all were friends.Talk about how and why the relationship fizzled and what you’ve been doing since then.


For instance, you might say, “Even though we promised to keep in touch, it was hard after I switched schools. And then time just passed.” By taking the lead in accepting responsibility for not staying in touch, they may reciprocate.
Or, you could try, “After you moved, we just lost touch. The next couple of years I played soccer and learned to play the harmonica.”
If the friendship ended on a bad note you should be prepared to discuss that.

, You will likely spend time talking about the past, but don’t spend the whole time remembering the good old days. Rekindle your lost friendship by taking the time to learn who your friend has become and telling them about who you’ve become.


Ask your friend questions about their life and listen to their answers. It will help you learn about who they are now.
For example, you could say, “So, tell me about you! What’s your career like? Are you in a relationship or do you have kids?”
Tell your friend about your life. Talk about what’s the same with you as well as the changes you have made.
Opening up about yourself can help them to feel more comfortable opening up, but make sure not to talk too much about yourself. Give them a chance to talk too.

"
"
Resolve any lingering issues.,
Make your friend a part of your life again.,
Don’t rush it.",How to Rekindle a Lost Friendship3," Sometimes a friendship falls apart because people simply grow apart. Other times something happens that causes the friendship to end. In order to rekindle the lost friendship, you may need to talk about what caused the friendship to end in the first place.


Apologize if you need to. If you did something that caused the friendship to end, then sincerely apologize for what you did.For example, you might need to say, “I know our friendship ended because of the rumor I helped spread. I am truly sorry for that.”
Forgive if that’s what you need to do. If it was your friend that caused the rift between you two, then forgive them.
They may also need to express their lingering anger towards you or regarding your actions. Listen to them with humility if this is what they need to do.
Keep in mind that if the friendship ended badly, then rekindling your friendship may not be the best idea. You might only remember the good parts, but rekindling the friendship could lead to disappointment.

, Share your successes and failures with your friend, as well as funny and interesting things that happen.You don’t have to tell them every detail of your lunch or message them every five minutes. But, you can make an effort to communicate and spend time together.


For example, if you know your friend has a poodle now, you could ask how the dog is doing every now and then. Or you could send them a birthday card on their birthday. Kind, thoughtful gestures like this may help to restore your friendship.
Or, you might call your friend to tell them you finished a major project or received a promotion at work.

, You may want your friendship to instantly be like it was before. But depending on how much time has passed, it may be like starting the friendship brand new. To rekindle the friendship you need to take the time to get to know one another again.


Start by calling, texting, or messaging each other more often and on a regular basis. Slowly move to communicating on a frequent basis.
Make occasional plans to spend time together. Gradually move to hanging out on a regular basis.
Recognize that each of you have different lives now and that you may not be able to get together as often as you would like.
Be sure to occasionally assess whether you are doing all of the work to stay in touch or if it is equal. If you are doing all or most of the work, then they may not be interested in maintaining a relationship.

Obtain an enclosure large enough for the skink.,
Provide a gradient of heat.Measure the amount of heat at different points in the tank from one end to the other in five centimeter intervals.,
Provide ultraviolet light.,
Decorate the tank.,
Quarantine new skinks.,
Provide a shed box.,
Be gentle.,
Wash your hands before and after handling.Many reptiles and amphibians carry Salmonella germs on them even if they appear healthy and clean.,
Do not let children handle the skink.This is a good rule for both the children and the skink.,
Pick the skink up with one hand.,
Obtain food the skink likes.,
Do not leave live prey in the tank for a long period.,
Provide an adequate amount of water.,
Only use high-quality food.,
Keep the skink’s environment clean and well-maintained.Do not, for example, leave dead bugs lying about your skink’s tank.,
Ensure your skink is eating enough.,
Look out for star-gazing.,
Observe your skink’s breathing.,
Look for eye or ear problems.,
Get a vet.",How to Take Care of a Five Lined Skink," A good lizard tank will provide enough space for the skink to roam about relatively freely. To keep it safe from cats and other house pets, place a mesh screen over the skink’s tank. Ensure it is as large as possible.


You can buy a terrarium fit for a five-lined skink at most local pet stores.
Weather permitting, your skink can be housed safely outside.Ensure you have a mesh screen on the top of the cage to prevent potential predators from attacking your skink.;
, In other words, take a temperature reading at one end, then move down the length of the cage five centimeters, and take another temperature reading.


Heat can easily be applied to one end of the cage by dangling an incandescent light over one end of the tank.
The temperature for the hottest part of the tank, just below the light, should be 97 degrees Fahrenheit.
Temperatures should never drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
You could place a heat mat below or on one side of the tank for added heat.

, Lizards need two kinds of ultraviolet light (UV-A and UV-B) to see properly and produce vitamin D3, which strengthens bones.Obtain an ultraviolet light from your local pet store to ensure your skink is getting the proper amount of UV light.


Do not install UV-B lights not designed for use in pet enclosures. Other sources of ultraviolet light -- such as tanning salon lights, tubes made for human phototherapy, and mercury vapor lights -- produce it at levels unsafe for pets as well as humans. These lights might also produce dangerous UV-C light which causes cancer and immune suppression.
There is little data available delimiting how much ultraviolet light a skink needs.Consult your veterinarian as to what an appropriate level of ultraviolet light for your five-lined skink might be.

, The natural habitat of the five-lined skink is a moist wooded or partially wooded area. They enjoy habitats consisting of or including bark, rocky outcrops, logs, and stumps.To recreate this habitat, you will need to obtain a woodland terrarium. This type of enclosure consists of a substrate composed of sphagnum moss, potting soil, loam, small gravel, or reptile carpet. Pepper the tank with plants, rocks, and bits of tree bark.


Plants can be set in small pots or planted directly into the earth if using potting soil.
Terrariums for lizards are easily obtained at most local pet stores.

, If introducing a new skink into a tank already populated by other lizards, place them in a quarantine tank.A quarantine tank is a tank separate from., but identical to, the tank which already contains other lizards. This will prevent the spread of infectious diseases (if there are any) from the new lizard into your primary lizard population.


Male skinks should not be housed with other males; they will fight and possibly harm each other. You can identify males in a number of ways:

Males do not lay eggs. Females lay eggs in soil or rotten wood and tend to them until they hatch about two months later.Male adult five-lined skinks may have bright orange jaws during the period in which it breeds.Males are generally a bit larger than the females.
Females retain a blue-gray tail into adulthood; males acquire brown tails as they age.



, A shed box will allow the skink to shed its skin as it grows and ages. Shedding is a natural behavior for lizards. A shed box is a small “house” for the skink (known as a hide box) containing sphagnum moss. Taking refuge in the shed box will ease the shedding process for the skink.Hide boxes are available at most pet stores.


Once a skink starts shedding, it should take no more than three weeks for the skin to come off completely.If your skink sheds infrequently (once or twice each year), consult a veterinarian.

, Always handle your lizard gently. Do not squeeze or drop him. Ensure you place him down as soon as possible after lifting him, as prolonged or over-handling is the most common cause of lizard death.Do not pull your skink’s tail. Young five-lined skinks have blue tails, used in the wild to attract predators away from its body. If pulled, the tail will detach, allowing the skink to escape.The tail will later regrow, but should not be pulled off, as this will cause the skink undue stress.

, Salmonella germs can be spread through contact with other skinks or through their droppings. Before handling the skink


Wet your hands with clean water, then turn off the tap. Apply soap and lather your hands by rubbing them together for about twenty seconds. Be sure to scrub the areas between your fingers, under your nails, and on the backs of your hands. Turn the tap back on and rinse the soap away.Do not bathe your skink or wash its tank in the same tub or sink you use to bathe or wash dishes in, respectively., Children have weaker immune systems than adults and are more prone to contract Salmonella from the skink than adults, even when they’ve taken the necessary sanitary precautions. Furthermore, they might not understand how to hold the skink gently enough not to hurt him, or may become surprised by the skink and drop him.


Do not let children play or run near the skink’s cage; they may run into it, knock it over, or otherwise get into mischief with your pet skink.

, Form your hand into a “C” shape. Lower your hand slowly into the skink’s tank. Tuck your thumb under the left side of his flank and your other four fingers beneath the right side of his flank. Close your hand slowly until the skink’s flesh is pressed against your along the entire length of the “C.” Do not squeeze too tightly or apply pressure.


Avoid holding the skink for prolonged periods; it will become ornery and try to wriggle free, creating the potential you will drop him.

, Skinks are active foragers that feed on insects such as crickets, flies, grasshoppers, grubs, beetles, and ants. They can also eat spiders.They might also be able to consume larger prey such as smaller lizards, frogs, and newborn mice.Only provide food for your skink sourced from pet stores.
Vary your skink’s diet. Never feed it just one item for a long period., Predatory lizards like skinks are sight feeders. If they become accustomed to seeing live prey in the cage, they may become desensitized to the presence of movement and lose their predatory instinct.Live bugs left overnight are fine, but do not keep them in the cage for longer than that.
The amount of food your skink needs will vary depending on age and size, but a general rule is that it should be allowed to consume as many crickets (or whatever bug it prefers) as it wants for a period of three to five minutes., Clean, filtered water must be provided for the skink on a daily basis. Use a heavy water bowl made of porcelain so as to eliminate the possibility of the skink spilling the water. Water bowls for lizards are available at local pet stores. In addition to drinking water, ambient water should be applied to the entire cage. Fill a spray bottle with water and mist the cage every 4-5 days. The substrate should be damp to the touch, but free of puddles.

, Never feed skinks wild insects. They may carry diseases. Ensure the bugs you feed your skink are healthy and themselves well-fed before moving up the food chain. Further, when feeding your skink larger bugs, ensure that they have recently molted. Insects with hard exoskeletons may be difficult for your skink to digest.Do not feed lightning bugs to your skink; they are poisonous to skinks.

, Change your skink’s water regularly. Failing to keep the environment clean can lead to multiple ailments.


Captive skinks have a higher level of stress than those in the wild, leaving them at greater risk for parasites. Parasites which target skinks include:

Hookworms, which may cause mineral deposits in the skink’s gut
Stomach worms, which cause stomach ulcers
Ascarids, which also cause mineral deposits in the intestines and may cause vomiting


Give your skink regular veterinary checkups to ensure it is free of parasites.

, If you observe a loss of appetite, vomiting, or marked weight loss in your skink, it may be suffering from cryptosporidiosis. This infectious condition is caused by a certain species of protozoa. Veterinarians are specially trained to detect it by feeling for a mass in the skink’s stomach, and can take X-rays to check for internal changes which may indicate cryptosporidiosis.Ensure also your skink gets enough to drink. Dehydration can lower the skink’s immune system and can even cause death directly.

, Star-gazing is a neurologic disorder caused by a retrovirus, and leads to an inability to move normally. It is also easily identified by the behavior from which it derives its name: a star-gazing skink will have its head craned straight up and become insensitive to stimuli. Star-gazing is a result of any number of problems -- infections, heat damage, or trauma are all potential causes. Get your skink to a vet if you observe this condition.

, If your skink breathes with its mouth open, has discharge running from its nose or dried pus around its mouth, or is visibly heaving with each breath, consult a veterinarian immediately.Possible causes of such behavior include pneumonia or paramyxovirus.


Curing lung ailments depends on the specific condition. A vitamin A deficiency may be one cause. This can be remedied by providing skinks a healthy diet with bugs dusted with nutritional powder.
Another solution could be to adjust environmental conditions. Turning the temperature down and scraping off the top layer of the terrarium’s soil with a small shovel can help keep it clean and comfortable for your skink.

, If the tissue around your skink’s eyes appears irritated, discolored, or inflamed, it may have contracted conjunctivitis or have abscesses. Excessive exposure to UV light can cause conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis in skinks manifests as a white layer over the eye. Removing or toning down the UV light will correct the problem, though more severe cases might requires topical antibiotics.


Ear infections are rare in skinks, but are easily prevented with an adequate amount of vitamin A.
Ensure your skink receives an adequate amount of vitamin A and other nutrients by investing in a commercially available supplement powder. Dusting the insects you feed the skink with this powder before feeding will give the skink necessary nutrients.

, A vet knowledgeable about five-lined skinks can be difficult to locate. Contact your local herpetology societies for referrals to a vet who can help you.You might also try to locate a vet through the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians. Check their vet database at http://arav.site-ym.com/search/custom.asp?id=3661.


If you are ever worried about your skink’s health, schedule an appointment with your vet to address your concerns immediately. The longer you wait, the worse the condition might become.

Watch for time spent in water.,
Determine if the reptile spends its time on land.,
Observe if the reptile inhabits marshy regions.,
Pay attention to where and how the reptile basks.","How to Tell the Difference Between a Tortoise, Terrapin and Turtle1"," Turtles spend most of their lives in water. Depending on its species, a turtle may inhabit fresh water (ponds and lakes) or the sea., Tortoises are land dwellers. Some tortoises live far from major sources of water, such as in deserts.

, Terrapins spend time both on land and in water. However, they inhabit brackish waters such as marshes. Often the term “terrapin” is only used to refer to certain species living in marshes of the Eastern and Southern United States, such as the Diamondback Terrapin, or the Red-eared Terrapin (also called the Red-eared slider; this is a common pond and pet turtle)., Turtles and terrapins will leave the water to bask in the sun on logs, sand, rocks, and other surfaces.Sea turtles typically spend more time in water, but will leave to bask in the sun on beaches, reefs, and similar areas."

Answer phone calls, texts, and emails.,
Contact your friends.,
Introduce yourself to new people.,
Ask questions.,
Decide if your current friends are worth pursuing.,
Seek healthy friendships.,
You have to be very careful about developing friendships with people you met in treatment.",How to Pursue Friendship if You Suffer from an Eating Disorder1," One way you can pursue friendships when you have an eating disorder is not to let the eating disorder control you and isolate you from others. This means connecting with the people when the opportunity arises. If someone calls you or sends you a text or email, answer the phone or respond to the text/email.If you need time to prepare to talk on the phone or answer your text/email, you don’t have to pick up the phone or answer your text/email immediately. Give yourself a few minutes to get used to the idea of talking on the phone, then return the call. Visualize the call from start to finish and envision it going well.
Think about what you want to say in the text/email reply before you respond.;
, Keeping in touch with people doesn’t mean you have to socialize or leave the house. Even if you don’t feel up to going out, you can reach out to your friends. Call them to talk. Just ask them how they are doing, tell them about how you are, or talk about your days or movies you’ve seen. Even if you only talk for a few minutes, you will stay connected with the person and maintain the friendship.Technology offers a lot of ways you can stay connected with your friends. You can email, text, or talk to them through social media.
Make it a goal to call/text/email one person per day. This is a small goal that should not cause you to feel overwhelmed and shut down. Slowly, but surely, you will get to everybody.

, Because of your eating disorder, you may feel isolated and uncomfortable with meeting new people. However, introducing yourself to someone is the first step in pursuing a friendship with someone. Try inviting an acquaintance to do something to get a friendship going. Maintain eye contact with the person, even if you feel self-conscious and nervous about being around the person.Asking someone to coffee or to a movie are low-stress ways to hang out with someone. You may want to say, “I thought about seeing a movie this weekend. Would you like to join me?”
If you are uncomfortable asking someone to do something, you can stick to conversation for now. Talk to the person or text them and ask about their day. For example, you can text, “How are you doing today?”
You can even try just striking up small talk when you are out in public to get back in the practice of socializing. While waiting in line at the coffee shop you might compliment the person behind you on their shirt, for instance.

, One good way to make conversation is to ask questions. Asking questions lets the person know you are interested in them, helps you get to know the other person, and helps bring up subjects that can keep the conversation going. Remember not to let your self-esteem get in the way of asking questions. Keep making eye contact, smiling, and staying confident.Ask one question and then let the other person answer. When you are first getting to know someone, only ask them a few questions, especially if they don’t ask any follow up questions.
For example, you may ask, “What do you think about the music here?” or “Have you seen any good movies lately?”
Making new friends takes time. You won’t make a close friend overnight. When you first introduce yourself and ask a few questions, that is only the beginning. You will have to work at continuing the interaction as the relationship develops into friendship.

, One important part of recovering from an ED is to build and maintain healthy relationships. Because of your eating disorder, you may have lost contact with friends, and now you may want to reconnect and pursue those friendships. As you decide, figure out if there are any unhealthy relationships you should cut from your life.Are there friends you had who encouraged your unhealthy behavior? Did they put you down or make comments that triggered unhealthy eating habits?
Are there people who discouraged your goals or recovery efforts?
Before abandoning any prior friendships, consider talking to the friend if you want to pursue a friendship with them. Honestly talk about their enabling, unhealthy, or triggering behavior and see if the two of you can come to a compromise so the friendship can grow and develop.

, Since many people with eating disorders also have low self-esteem, those with an eating disorder (or ""ED"") often feel undeserving of friendship. You may feel like you have nothing to offer, so you may end up being friends with people who are unhealthy, toxic, or even harmful to you. As you pursue friendships, make sure to look for people who will be a healthy presence in your life instead of an unhealthy one.People who are healthy influences on you treat you with kindness and understanding. They enjoy being friends with you and spending time together.
Unhealthy influences are those who have addiction problems or are abusive to you physically, mentally, or emotionally. A toxic person may be mean to you or treat you like you are not worth their time. They may also encourage unhealthy behaviors, like restricting food or purging. Avoid people who place emphasis on your physical looks or who make negative comments about your weight.

, Because of the intimate nature of their disorder, people can bond very quickly in treatment and want to continue these friendships after discharge; however, it is common for this to lead to a regression in both parties because the disorder is so behavior-based. Stay in communication with your outpatient provider about the progression of any new friendships."

Examine the feet.,
Determine the shell type.,
Look for any distinguishing marks.","How to Tell the Difference Between a Tortoise, Terrapin and Turtle2"," Turtles and terrapins tend to have flattened, webbed feet for swimming.Sea turtles are especially adapted for life in the water, with streamlined bodies and long, flipper-like feet.Tortoises, however, have blunt, stumpy feet for walking on land.Their rear legs are elephantine, while their front legs are shovel-like for digging.

, Tortoises, terrapins, and turtles have scaly skin and protective shells. With a few exceptions (like leatherback sea turtles), the shells of turtles are hard and bony.Tortoise shells tend to be rounded and domed, while turtle and terrapin shells are flatter., If you suspect that you are observing a particular species of turtle, terrapin, or tortoise, look for markings on its shell or body that can help you determine this. For instance:


The Diamondback Terrapin may be identified by the diamond-shape pattern on its shell.
The Red-eared Terrapin may be identified by the distinctive red stripe on each side of its head.
The Alligator Snapping Turtle may be identified by the pointed, peaked ridges on its shell.

"
"
Watch for periods of reduced activity.,
Observe what the reptile eats.,
Determine nesting behavior.","How to Tell the Difference Between a Tortoise, Terrapin and Turtle3"," Turtles will burrow into mud during cold seasons and go into a state called torpor (similar to hibernation).During this time, the turtles’ activity is minimal. They will remain in this state until warmer weather returns.


Limited evidence shows that terrapins may also spend some time hibernating in mud, or in periods of reduced activity.

, Eating habits of turtles will vary greatly by species and environment, but can include plants, insects, and other small animals. Since they are land dwellers, tortoises tend to eat low-lying plants such as grasses, shrubs, and even cacti.The diet of terrapins has not been thoroughly studied.

, Land-dwelling tortoises will build nesting burrows and lay eggs. Species of turtles and terrapins that spend time both on land and in water, as well as sea-dwelling turtles, will all leave the water to lay their eggs.

"
Decide if you want to open up about your eating disorder.,
Avoid changing yourself for others.,
Keep friendships at a light, friendly level.,
Determine if your new friend is worth pursuing.",How to Pursue Friendship if You Suffer from an Eating Disorder2," If you are making new friends, you have the choice about whether or not to tell them about your eating disorder. You have to decide what you are most comfortable with. You may choose to be honest and candid about your experience, or you can choose to keep it private. If you are recovering from the ED, you may also choose to leave that in the past and move forward with the friendship.If you are pursuing friendships you had before the ED, you can also choose how much to share with the friend. They will more than likely know you have the eating disorder, but that doesn’t mean you have to tell them details about it or discuss your ED. You control what information people know about your disorder.

, When you suffer from an eating disorder, you may not feel comfortable with the way you look. Because of this, you may feel like you need to change yourself or the way you look to be accepted or liked by others. Remember, you do not have to change anything about yourself, especially your appearance, for people to be friends with you.An outpatient treatment provider (counselor) can give you feedback and help you determine if you are being your authentic self as you develop these new relationships.
Notice if meeting new people and trying to form friendships trigger any unhealthy weight changes or eating habits, or thoughts like, “If I was thinner/more attractive, this person would like me.” If this happens, you'll want to talk with your counselor about these thoughts or impulses and how to counter them. A mantra like ""I'm worthy of friendship just as I am,"" might help.

, The self-esteem problems associated with ED may lead to unhealthy connections to new friends. You may swing from avoiding everyone to needing to be around your friends all the time. You may be needy or clingy, and get too close to the person too quickly. Try to approach the friendship in a light, casual way. Let it develop naturally.Remember that just because your friend has other friends, doesn’t see you every week, or may not be able to hang, that doesn’t mean they don’t like you. That has nothing to do with you.
Making multiple friends can help you from getting too attached to one person.

, After you make the initial connection with a person and start a friendship, you start to get to know the person. During this time, you can decide if the person is someone you want to continue being friends with or if they are a person you don’t want in your life. This is why it’s important to develop friendships slowly and naturally.For example, you may want to give your new friend small bits about your life and see how they react. Are they positive and supportive, or do they get angry or offended? Do they tell other people your business?
Does your new friend listen when you talk? Do they ask questions and seem interested in you?
Does your friend seem self-centered and not care about you? Do they engage in unhealthy behaviors?
You may be able to address some of these behaviors if you want to pursue a friendship with the person. For example, if the person tells people your business, you may want to say, “When I tell you things about myself, I am trusting you. But when you tell others what I tell you, it makes me not want to trust you. Can we do something to work on this?”

"
"
Set boundaries with your friends.,
Let your friend know what you need.,
Make your food and drink wishes known.,
Encourage your friends to treat you like normal around food.",How to Pursue Friendship if You Suffer from an Eating Disorder3," There are certain triggers, topics, or activities that may be triggering to you. You should let your friends know what your boundaries are so they can respect your limits and you can have a healthy, good friendship. Approach the topic calmly. If your friends have accidentally talked about a triggering topic, they probably don’t know it bothers you.You should ask your friend not to pay you compliments about your weight. You may need to tell your friends not to mention their weight problems or talk about diets around you.
You may need to let your friend know that you cannot be their emotional support right now if they are depressed or also suffering from an eating disorder.
If you have a friend who also has an eating disorder, you should set boundaries on what kind of talk you two are comfortable with. For example, you shouldn’t exchange your weight, calories eaten, or minutes of exercise. You shouldn’t discuss your eating disorders because it may trigger either of you or lead to romanticizing the eating disorder or reminiscing about the “good” times.

, Your recovery is the most important thing. You want to make sure you put yourself first. Sometimes your friends will help you push out of your comfort zone and do things that make you feel uncomfortable, which can be a good thing. Other times, you may not feel emotionally, mentally, or physically well enough to hang out. This is okay, too. Let your friends know what you can and can’t do, while also taking chances.If you are too tired to go out, let your friends know. Don’t let them guilt trip you into feeling bad for not feeling physically well enough to go out. The recovery process is a difficult one, and your well-being is most important.
You may also need to set boundaries of what you can do. You may say, “I’d love to go out tonight, but I have to leave by 11 so I can stay on a regular sleep schedule.”

, Your eating disorder recovery may mean that you have to stay away from certain types of food. You may avoid alcohol. You should let your friends know your food and drink boundaries, and make sure that they respect that. If your friends make fun of you for not eating something or try to pressure you into eating something, address it calmly. Say, “I choose not to eat this because of my health and recovery. Can you support my choices? We can still have fun, and it doesn’t bother me if you eat it.”

, One thing friends may do when they learn you have an eating disorder is treat you differently when food is involved. They may not ask you to dinner, stop eating when you’re around, or stress and stare when you eat. Let your friends know that it is okay for you to go out to eat with them or for them to eat in front of you.You may want to tell your friends that it makes you feel more stressed out and guilty if they obsess about your relationship with food. Tell them, “I appreciate your understanding about my eating disorder. However, we can do normal things. I will let you know if we do something that is triggering for me.”

Focus on yourself.,
Improve your self-esteem.,
Be stronger than your insecurities.",How to Pursue Friendship if You Suffer from an Eating Disorder4," One way to look for friendships that are healthy and will aid your recovery is to first focus on yourself. Eating disorders are tied closely with negative issues of the self, which makes it hard to have and maintain healthy friendships. If you are dealing with or recovering from an eating disorder, you should spend time first building a sense of self.For example, you should work on thinking positive thoughts about yourself instead of negative thoughts. Think about what your good traits are outside of your weight. Try to develop reasons why you matter that aren't connected to your physical body, but instead are based on who you are, not how you look.
If you have not built self-esteem or started on the road to liking yourself, you may find yourself engaging in unhealthy behaviors when you start socializing. You may also be triggered and turn to destructive behavior.
Another complication that might arise is a dependence on new people and relationships for the same fulfillment you got from the eating disorder. Before you start building friendships you need to build a friendship with yourself.
Ensure that you are continuing good self-care and being compliant with treatment recommendations! Don't lose sight of your progress plan because you become more socially active.

, Your self-esteem may be low if you suffer from or are recovering from an eating disorder. This can make pursuing and maintaining friendships difficult. You need to like yourself and understand that you are worthy of having friends. As part of your recovery, work with your therapist to improve your self-esteem.Remind yourself how great you are when you start feeling self-conscious. Write down a list of your good features and keep it with you to read when you need to. Repeat to yourself, “I am a wonderful person with many good qualities. I am beautiful inside and out.”
Find solo hobbies or activities to help foster your self-esteem. Identify something you're passionate about and get involved. This could be volunteering at an animal shelter, painting, ceramics, writing, gardening, making music, etc.
Try to work on basing your self-esteem and self-worth on your physical self. You are worth more than what is on the outside.

, One thing that may hold you back from pursuing friendships when you have an eating disorder is your self-esteem. You may feel like you are inferior, not good enough, or not worthy of friendship. This is not true. One major step in making friends and maintaining friendships with an eating disorder is overcoming insecurities so you can interact with people.You will not be able to erase or forget your insecurities; however, you do not have to let them control you, just as you don’t let your eating disorder control you. Instead, acknowledge them, and then tell yourself, “I am a good, fun, interesting person worthy of friendship.”
Try identifying any possible sources of your insecurities. It could be an experience from your past or perhaps an insecurity placed on you by your parents. Do the therapeutic work needed to move forward.

Russian tortoises should not be housed in a vivarium or a fish tank as these do not provide correct ventilation.,
Place a layer of substrate down.,
Provide hiding places.,
Keep the basking area should be 30–35 °C (86–95 °F).,
Provide a water dish that is deep enough for a tortoise to safely drink from.,
Humidity is not vital for Russian species, despite common belief.,
Try and choose a tortoise from a reputable breeder and not from a reptile center or pet shop.,
Change the water in the table every day.

,
Feed the tortoise safe, edible weeds and flowers only.,
Tortoises should be kept outside in the summer months, if the weather permits.",How to Take Care of a Russian Tortoise," They also do not allow the tortoise to have a hot end, nor thermoregulate. The glass on the front of the cage/tank can stress your tortoise out as it cannot pass through. A wardrobe on its back and then supported is much better as it provides good ventilation and the sides are opaque, therefore the tortoise will not get stressed. The indoor enclosure should be at least 6 by 6 feet (1.8 m × 1.8 m). A UVB bulb (12%) can be used, as well as a 100/160 watt bulb. A combi bulb (heat bulb and UVB in one) can be used, which is perfect.;
, A layer of sterilised topsoil is best, nothing else. Make sure the soil is deep enough to allow the tortoise to burrow and correctly thermoregulate. No other substrate is needed. No bedding such as hay, straw, aspen, etc.

, 1 large plant pot is adequate for the whole enclosure. Make sure that this is placed in the cooler end of your table, as if placed in the warm end it will take up basking space and a tortoise would naturally find cooler places to hide and shelter.

, The cool side should be around 20–22 °C (68–72 °F). The temperature everywhere in between doesn't matter as long as you have established the cool and warm sides. You should have a good thermometer on both sides to accurately monitor the temperature.

, It needs to be a good size so that your tortoise can easily get inside of it and drink.

, People use humid hides for hatchlings. However, this isn't needed whatsoever as if the humidity is too high and it's too damp,it can cause RNS (Runny Nose Syndrome) which can be fatal and kill your new tortoise.

, Store owners, the majority of the time, are only after one thing - your money. They do not care about the tortoise they are selling you, or its well-being. Tortoises who are active, have a smooth shell (no pyramiding) and are not lethargic are usually healthy tortoises and the ones which should be chosen to take home.

,, NO fruit or vegetables should be offered at all. Russian tortoises do not eat fruit or vegetables in the wild and are therefore adapted to purely eat weeds and flowers. Fruits and vegetables can upset gut flora and damage your tortoise in the long run, if the problems do not occur right away. Weeds should be sprinkled with limestone flour and nutrobal. Chalk or cuttlefish bone should be kept in the cage to provide calcium (from quarries etc).

, If the temperatures are above 15°C, it's warm enough for the tortoise to be outside. Tortoises should be brought inside if temperatures drop below 11°C. A safe, secure outside enclosure should be built. 6ft x 4ft would be adequate for one tortoise. Make sure no rats, foxes, dogs, cats, birds, etc. can enter, which could potentially kill your tortoise.

Get a fish tank.,
Create a habitat.,
Get your turtle.,
Introduce your turtle to his habitat.,
Feed your turtle.,
Play with it!",How to Take Care of Mini Pet Turtles," 10 to 15 gallon (37.9 to 56.8 L) is a good size fish tank for your pet turtle. If you want to have more than one turtle, add 10 gallons (37.9 L) for every extra turtle. The tank should be long and wide. Do not get a fish tank that is tall and skinny.;
, Wild turtles live in lakes, ponds, and swamps. In order to keep your turtle happy you need to mimic this habitat. Fill the tank up about halfway full of water. Then add a decoration log or rock that comes out of the water for your turtle to rest on. At the bottom of the tank place a few live or fake plants.

, You can either buy a turtle from the pet store or you can catch one.

, Place your turtle on the log or rock. When he wants to swim, he will. Do not place your turtle directly in the water. The sudden water temperature change can shock your turtle and will increase the chance of him drowning on his first day home.

, Turtles are omnivores, so you can feed them frozen fish on some days and lettuce on others. Or, you can feed them turtle pellets which have a perfect omnivore diet. Either way you feed them, you should supplement them with frozen brine shrimp or red worms.

, If you don't play with your turtle at a young age, it will not be friendly. So play with it by holding it, petting it, or even letting it crawl around your room (with your supervision of course).

Begin again.",How to Grow a Wax Worm Farm," You will need a container made of hard plastic, metal, or glass. (Wax worms can chew through cardboard, wood, flimsy plastic, or paper.) Your container will need to be approximately 5-gallons in size., It is very important for your container to be free of any bacteria, chemicals, or other contaminants. Wash your container with warm water and a mild detergent, and then allow it to air dry., Cover the opening of your container with a mesh screen. You will need to find something 20-gauge or smaller, so that your worms cannot escape through the openings. (You can find mesh like this at most hardware stores.) Eventually, you will secure this screen with duct tape.

, You are going to need one box of mixed-grain baby cereal, 1/3 cup honey, and 1/3 cup glycerin. Mix these ingredients together (adding a bit of water, if mixture is too thick to stir). Then, place about half of this mixture at the bottom of your container. The other half can be refrigerated until needed., Take a few pieces of food-grade wax paper and crumple them up. Then place your crumpled wax paper in the bottom of your container, along with the food. This will provide a place for your worms to lay their eggs.

, Look for a wax worm starter kit, containing 24-36 worms. These kits can be purchased from pet stores or bait shops. They usually come in starter packs by the dozens., Open your container of worms and transfer them, one by one, into their new home. Discard any sawdust, they may be packed in. Your worm food (the cereal and honey mixture) and some crumpled wax paper should already be in place., Take your mesh screen lid and place it on top of your container. Then secure your lid by placing a bit of duct tape on each side. (You are going to remove this lid at times, so using 3-4 pieces of tape, evenly spaced, should work.) Once again, it is important to select a small enough mesh to prevent your worms from getting out.

, If you are at all worried about your worms escaping their habitat and getting loose inside your home, you can set your container in a tray with about 1 inch of water. This will ensure that your worms cannot get loose. (This step is optional.)

, Wax worms are a good choice for home breeding because they are not terribly particular about temperature. They will survive in any temperature comfortable to you in your home. However, your wax worms will thrive most effectively in a dark place that runs about 80 degrees F., Any time you see the worm food in your container getting low, you should add a bit more. As a general rule, you will want to add food to your container every two weeks, returning the food level to what you started with.

, Before long, you worms will pupate, transform into moths, breed, lay eggs, and die. This process will take anywhere from two to three weeks., Wait until all of the moths have died, then carefully remove them from your container. It is important to wait until all of them have died before you begin the removal process, because this prevents any moths from getting loose inside your home.

, After about 8 weeks (from the time they hatch), your worms should be large enough to harvest. Carefully remove them from your farm container, and move them to smaller plastic containers (10-12 worms per container) with a small bit of wood chips or saw dust. You can store these smaller containers in your refrigerator for 2-3, or freezer for up to 4 months.If you'd like to grab a worm or two to feed your animal prior to your official harvest, go right ahead! Your worms may be small, but they will still be tasty!
Reserve approximately 20 of your worms to breed for your next batch.

, After you have harvested your worms, clean out your container. Then use 20 or so of the harvested worms to begin the process all over again. Be sure to follow each step carefully."

Give them a bath in tepid to mildly warm water.,
Make sure there is a rough object available to them to aid in removing the old skin.,
Provide them the proper care and nutrient needs.",How to Help a Shedding Pet Reptile," The water helps to loosen up their old skin and makes it easier for them to shed. Make sure the water level is not too high, as this could lead to a drowned animal. You can also use a spray nozzle to gently spray warm water over their bodies. Remember to make sure to dry them off properly by covering them up with a towel and placing them underneath their heat lamps. Never use any type of heating rock, as these can cause serious and sometimes fatal burns. Heating pads are preferred as an exterior heat source under their substrate or water dish. Once again, the heat pads need to be placed or secured OUTSIDE of their enclosure to avoid burns.;
, This can range from either a rock to a branch, a stick or rough surfaced enclosure decorations. When reptiles shed their skins, not only does it get very tight, but it also gets very itchy. Giving them a rough object to relieve their itchy bodies on helps them tremendously. This is also very helpful for when they want to break the skin to shed from their bodies.

, If a reptile isn't getting the proper care and nutrients it needs, it makes shedding a very difficult process for them. Make sure they are getting the right kinds of food and the proper supplements. You can buy powdered reptile multivitamins, calcium, & mineral supplements at any pet store or order them online and just sprinkle the recommended quantities (based upon your particular species) onto your reptile's food (This does not apply to snakes, as they get all the nutrition they need from their prey). Make sure your reptile has a daily access to a clean water source. The premier water type should be Ro or distilled. Practice excellent hygiene and always clean out old food, change stale water, and clean up their waste. Provide them a good heat source, like a heating lamp or a heating pad; as is appropriate for each species. Be sure to allow for thermal regulation by placing the heat source at one end of the enclosure. This allows for the animal to move from the cool end to the warm end of the enclosure.

Do not change your pet’s environment as he or she grows.",How to Take Care of a Land Turtle," Are you ready to be the owner of a land turtle? They live a long time, can grow quite large, are not great pets for young children, and their care and feeding can be quite expensive (special lights, enclosures, vet visits). Because of their longevity, you also need to realize that your tortoise, if well cared for, can easily outlive you. , Turtles are omnivores and require some time in the water. Tortoises are herbivores and are land-based. Both require appropriate outdoor and indoor environments and need good and attentive care if they are to thrive. Land turtles may have the reputation as an “easy” pet, but they actually require quite a bit of work. , Observe the pets, and look at photos of some possibilities. Which ones do you like? Which ones do long-time turtle keepers recommend? If it’s your first turtle, you also should ask which ones are easiest to care for and best for first-time owners.

, Land turtles, when cared for properly, need to be outside at least part of the time. Choose a turtle that can thrive where you live. This means if you live in a humid place, choose a turtle that likes those conditions. Get a turtle that thrives in arid places if you live in the desert. This will make it much easier to care for your turtle because you won’t have to create a new outdoor environment for the turtle and keep it regulated.

, This is essential if you might move, changing the environment to which the turtle is exposed. Trying to create a new outdoor-like environment for a humidity-loving turtle in a snowy climate can get very difficult and expensive. , Just as choosing a turtle that thrives in your outdoor environment makes caring for it much easier, so too does choosing a turtle native to your country and region. Not all areas have native land turtles, but ask around for the turtles most likely to thrive in your area.

, Turtles from elsewhere are often taken from the wild, leading to the depletion of native turtle and tortoise populations around the world. For the health of the environment and native turtles, domestically-bred turtles or rescued turtles are the best choice., It needs to be watertight. There are many possible ways to make an enclosure, but it needs to be quite large, even for small turtles -- many sources say that you can start in a large and deep plastic tub, but will need to make much larger enclosures as your turtle grows. You can make a dedicated turtle table out of wood, repurpose an old bookshelf with the shelves removed, or use a plastic kiddie pool. Your ultimate choice will depend on the species of land turtle. , Turtles have specific needs, and the exact specifications will vary depending on the turtle you choose. Make sure you have everything in place before you get your turtle. You can’t just get the different parts together as you go -- the turtles will need everything immediately.

, Turtles will need substrate, which allows them to dig, and can also help in waste disposal. It’s vital that you choose a good-quality and appropriate substrate, because they will have so much contact with it. , Turtles need lights that provide UV-B so that they get Vitamin B. Keep in mind you’ll need to purchase new light bulbs every 6 months to a year because they lose their ability to produce UV-B.. , Different turtles need different levels of humidity, so check the needs of your species. It could be low, middle, or high, depending on the native environment of your turtle. Most will need some kind of misting on their substrate. , You might have to buy a heat lamp for the proper environment for your turtle or tortoise. Particularly if you have a turtle that is not native to your area, heat might prove to be the most essential element for your land turtle. , Box turtles and tortoises should have some kind of water in their structures. Again, it will depend on the species, but all will need a shallow water dish or bowl to soak in (and possibly defecate into). , This is an essential part of the way turtles interact with their environment. It could be as simple as a small plastic box or bowl with a hole cut in the side. , This will be just as important for many land turtle species as the indoor enclosure. Make sure yours is large and safe. Turtles need to be protected from predators and from escape. Your enclosure should be tall enough they cannot escape over it, and have barriers under the dirt so they can’t burrow under. A roof for the enclosure is also typically a necessity. , Do not just use the dirt you have in your backyard -- it’s not appropriate for land turtles. Be advised that grass, particularly wet grass, is also bad for land turtles. It can cause painful abrasions. , Since your turtle will be spending a lot of time outdoors, planting food for them makes a lot of sense. You won’t have to look for food for them, and they can choose to eat when they want to. , Don’t just have a flat and boring outdoor enclosure. Create little hills they can climb, different areas to explore, and a variety of environments within the enclosure. , Too much of some nutrients like calcium or protein can severely stunt or even kill your land turtle. Keep in mind that tortoises are herbivores, while box turtles are omnivores. You should give box turtles slugs, snails, crickets and other animal matter twice a week. The rest of the time they will eat fruits like melon, berries, and tomatoes. Greens are also a great addition to a turtle’s diet. Tortoises do not eat any animal matter, but their diets are quite varied. Please do the research to determine what diet is best for your particular species of tortoise. , Hibernation is a contested issue among turtle owners. Talk to your veterinarian to see if your land turtle should be hibernating. Keep in mind that turtles who do not have enough fat reserves can easily die if they are in hibernation. Hibernation is also not recommended for turtles who might be at all medically compromised. Some turtle experts caution against hibernation at all. If you do choose to hibernate your land turtle, prepare your turtle habitat carefully. You might even need to build a special hibernation box, depending on the species. It needs to be in a place that is temperature-regulated and will not flood. Stop feeding your land turtle two weeks before planned hibernation, and start lowering the temperature in the habitat slightly. Hibernation can last from 3-5 months. Be sure to check the temperature requirements for your particular type of land turtle. , Land turtles should not be in homes that have dogs (possible predators of turtles). Keep in mind that infants and children are also not ideal companions for turtles. Many experts recommend that only children over 12 years old have contact with land turtles. Most small turtles are carriers of salmonella, an infection that can possibly be fatal to infants, the elderly, and the medically fragile. Even if your turtle is not in the “small turtle” category, there is still a risk of the turtle passing on infections to children. , The majority of turtles carry parasites and possibly other infections, some of which can be dangerous to humans. Depending on where you got your turtle from, it might be at risk for malnourishment and dehydration. With turtles, it can be difficult for you to tell if they are having problems, so choose a good exotic animal veterinarian. , Most land turtles will grow a lot as they grow older. This doesn't means you need to be attuned to the ways you will need to change their living environments, both inside and outside, and their feeding and possible hibernation. Turtles need 3 square feet of floor space for each 8 inches of turtle length. For tortoises, it’s even more -- a minimum of 3 square yards of floor space for each 12 inches of length. "

The very first thing you should do is ask yourself if a reptile is the right pet for you.,
Before you buy any animal, you need to do research on the animal you're thinking of buying.,
Once you have decided what type of reptile you want, research as much as possible!,
Now that you have all the equipment you'll need, go ahead and purchase your reptile!,
After a while of keeping your new arrival and after you feel very comfortable husbanding this animal, start expanding!,
Remember that each animal must be well researched before purchasing.,
A good theory 'plink' sound money makes when being dropped on the counter.

,
Do things correctly from the beginning and you (as well as your animal) will have a much easier time.

",How to Make a Reptile Zoo at Home," Most people who buy reptiles are inexperienced and don't realize that owning a reptile takes a lot of time and effort. Reptiles are sometimes very cautious and don't feel comfortable with loud noises (sans snakes, which are deaf) or sudden movements. If you're looking for an animal to play with, you should probably buy a dog or a cat. Reptiles aren't the type of animals who will want to play fetch with you or any games, although some reptiles such as bearded dragons and blue-tongue skinks can be quite friendly and affectionate. You also need a lot of patience owning a reptile; especially when you buy one for the first time; they might not trust you at first and back further into the cage when you approach it. It takes some time to get a reptile to trust you. You also need to set aside time to clean their enclosures, feed and water them, take them to the vets, etc. Realize that owning a reptile takes a lot of time and effort & think very hard about it before you decide to buy one.;
, Each species of reptile is different from one another; just like each dog breed is different. Think about what type of reptile you want. You'll want to start with one reptile before you start expanding. Baby reptiles are recommended because they can grow up getting used to you and trusting you, whereas adults might be more cautious and could potentially bite or attack you. If you're a beginner reptile owner, these are some reptile breeds that are perfect for first-timers;



Leopard geckos.

Bearded dragons. If you're a first-timer, do not buy a green iguana. These reptiles need a whole lot of care and they grow big and fast. Most beginners buy an iguana and realize this too late and either abandon the animal or end up giving it improper care and making the iguana ill.

Corn snakes.
Ball pythons.

, You can't learn enough or too much. There is always learning potential with every animal. Even an expert will admit to learning new things each day. Save up money and buy everything you'll need right from the beginning. You can't buy an animal and not have the proper care and place to put it! At the minimum, you'll need a nice big enclosure, a water & food source,proper lighting fixtures, some powdered vitamins and calcium you can sprinkle on their food, and a good place for your reptile to hide to feel safe (A hollow log or rock it can climb in, etc). You might need to buy other things depending on your choice of reptile. You'll need to set this up in a place where there isn't a lot of noise, where other animals can't get to it, and where it's environment can be easily controlled.

, Bring it home right away and place it in it's enclosure. Leave it alone for a couple of hours and let it get used to it's new home.

, You can buy another separate enclosure or use a giant one to keep the same species of reptile in (based on the species. Some species are best kept separately and not in a communal situation). Remember to buy everything you'll need before purchasing each new animal.

, Some animals come with not only high price tags but also high needs. Some are venomous, some are just plain dangerous, some are protected, and some are highly illegal to keep.

Prevent respiratory disease.",How to Take Care of a Baby Tortoise," Your baby tortoise needs a habitat, but not just anything will do. Glass aquariums, which many people use, are actually not very good habitats for tortoises because the sides are too high and there is often not enough floor space. Tortoises also do not understand glass and can run into the glass. A wider, shallower container will work much better.A large plastic storage container works well for an indoor habitat. (No top is needed.)
When you need a larger container, you can build or purchase a tortoise table, which is a large wooden enclosure on tall legs.;
, In the wild, tortoises bask in the sun to regulate their body temperatures and absorb vitamin D. To keep your tortoise healthy, it's important to simulate this exposure in captivity.Letting your tortoise out to bask in the natural sunlight for a few hours a week is a good idea. Do not put a glass tank in direct sunlight, however, as this can cause the enclosed area to become too hot.
When your tortoise does not have access to natural sunlight, use a UV lamp to provide artificial sunlight.
The exact amount of UV exposure your tortoise will require depends on the species, but it varies between 8 and 12 hours per day.

, All tortoises need to live in warm habitats. It's a good idea to use heating lamps to create a gradient temperature within the enclosure. One side should be 22°C (70°F), and the other should be 29°C (84°F). The proper humidity level will depend on the species you have, so make sure you properly identify it.Desert tortoises should be kept in dry habitats, while tropical tortoises should be kept in moist habitats.
Some tortoises may need even warmer habitats, so find out what the requirements are for your species.
You can increase the humidity by moistening the substrate, especially in the area under the basking lamp. You can tilt the pen slightly to keep all of the moisture on one side. This will provide your tortoise with different micro-climates to choose from., There are lots of different bedding materials available at pet stores, but not all of them are good for tortoises. A combination of soft earth and sand is the ideal base layer for tortoises.Many would add some water in the soil and then thoroughly mix it while discarding any unwanted objects in the process, this will prolong the substrate's freshness which reduces the frequency of substrate changes.
Adding critters such as Earthworms, Springtails, and Pillbugs can help the substrate last much longer through aeration and eating leftover food.

, Be sure to include various different items that your tortoise can hide under if it wants. This will provide it with both shade and security., Be sure provide your tortoise with a shallow bowl of water for drinking. Change the water regularly to keep it fresh.Don't be too alarmed if your tortoise doesn't seem to drink much. Some species, especially those that are native to arid climates, drink very little water, but it's still a good idea to have it available for them.

, Every one to two weeks, you should soak your tortoise in a bowl of room temperature water for approximately 10-15 minutes. This will help keep the tortoise hydrated.


Make sure the water doesn't go any higher than the tortoise's chin.
The tortoise may start drinking while it is soaking, so make sure the water stays clean.

, Tortoises all need to be fed a varied diet in order to ensure that they get all of the nutrients they need. Each species of tortoise, however, has its own specific dietary needs. Be sure to identify the species of tortoise that you have and feed it a diet that is recommended for that species.Desert tortoises should be fed a combination of grasses, leafy greens, and cactus flowers, with a small amount of fruit.Grassland grazers like leopard tortoises should be fed a variety of grasses and leafy green vegetables. You should not feed them other vegetables, fruits, or meat., It's extremely important to supplement a baby tortoise's diet with vitamin D3 and calcium. Tortoises can die without these nutrients, so don't skip this step! A multivitamin is also good for balancing out nutritional needs.You can buy supplements in powder form at any store that sells supplies for tortoises. You can also crush supplements that come in pill form.

, Baby tortoises are extremely vulnerable to predators because they are so small. Take extra care to protect them from animals like dogs, cats, raccoons, and birds.If you are keeping your tortoise indoors, make sure your other pets do not have access to the enclosure.
If you bring your tortoise outside, be sure to cover the pen with a sturdy metal mesh top to keep predators out.

, Baby tortoises become stressed easily, so it's important to avoid over-handling them. Gentle petting and hand-feeding are fine, but you should wait until the tortoise is bigger to begin handling it more.If you do handle the tortoise, be careful not to distress it by flipping it over or dropping it.
Do not allow children to handle the tortoise without supervision or for long periods of time.

, Pyramiding is a condition that is very common among tortoises that are raised in captivity. It occurs when the shell grows in an abnormal way, causing it to become ridged instead of smooth. This condition typically starts developing in the first year or two of life.Pyramiding may be due to calcium deficiency and/or humidity levels. Try increasing your tortoise's calcium intake by dusting his food with a balanced calcium supplement. You can also try increasing the humidity level in the pen.

, Respiratory disease is fairly common in captive tortoises. The term ""Runny nose syndrome"" (RNS) is used to describe upper respiratory infections in tortoises. You can prevent your tortoise from developing this condition by ensuring that the habitat is well-maintained.Never feed your tortoise junk food, even if it seems to enjoy it. Always stick to the recommended diet for your species.
Be careful not to keep the habitat too moist. There should always be some dry land available.
Let your tortoise have as much exposure to natural sunlight as possible.
Use a substrate material that will not create dust or get lodged in your tortoise's nose.
It's also important to reduce the tortoise's stress and not overcrowd the habitat with too many tortoises.

Start with two 2 ten gallon tanks (20""x12""x10"").,
Take the front off both tanks.,
Next take a sharp knife and strip the aquarium sealant that was holding the front in place.,
Purchase a piece of acrylic 1/8"" thick in a 19.5""x 4.5"" rectangle.,
Get 4 hinges 1.5"" (two per side for stability), 2 handles (purchased or improvised; try a shell, a marble.,
Ventilate the area well or move outdoors before proceeding with the sealant in the next step.

,
Unite the two tanks and adhere them temporarily with tape on the outside.,
Place the 19.5""x 4.5"" acrylic at the bottom, leaving about a 1"" margin from the edge.,
After another 24 hours have passed, and the bottom is securely in place, glue one of the two acrylic sheets (18""x9.5"") to each side (two hinges per sheet).,
Place the handles on the doors and let everything stand for another 10-12 hours.,
After it is dry, clean it up with water and paper towels and decorate.",How to Make a Cheap Terrarium," These are inexpensive and should cost around $10 at discount stores.;
, To do this, use a knife to work the top and bottom rims off. Then, cut off the front panel (the 20"" side}. Now you are left with only three sides of the glass rectangle.

, Place the knife at an angle away from you and push away from you with the blade to the glass. This will take the sealant off. You will need a tube of aquarium sealant

, Most places that sell acrylic can cut it for you at a moderate cost. This is to hold a bit of water at the bottom for humidity. Also you will need 2 18""x9.5"" sheets of acrylic.

, etc.), and any lock or latch you like.

,, Use the aquarium sealant to glue the inside and let dry for 24 hours. After it is dry, use the knife to remove excess sealant and create a smooth surface.

, Glue with aquarium sealant and let dry. Place a hinge 5"" from the top and one 5"" from the bottom at each side.

, These are the doors.

, (This is because since water is going on the bottom the sealant must dry for a full 24 hours.)

, Depending on your animals, you might use clay pellets and orchid bark as a substrate. Add plants, rocks, and perches as desired.

Make sure you've really got a turtle.,
Keep the turtle in an aquarium.,
Use a UV heat lamp and thermometer to control the temperature.,
Provide a mixture of dry and wet surfaces.,
Provide plenty of untreated natural spring water.,
Get a water filter.,
Feed turtles 2-3 times a week.,
Feed turtles and tortoises dry supplements.,
Prepare a feeding area for the turtle.,
Provide a cuttle bone.,
Change the water and remove old food bits every 2-3 days.,
Clean the turtle's tank once a month.,
Groom the turtle a few times a year.,
Only take the turtle out of the habitat in similar temperatures.,
Always wash your hands before and after handling your turtle.,
Leave the turtle alone most of the time.",How to Look After a Turtle," Turtles have webbed feet and are primarily water-dwelling reptiles, while tortoises have more rounded ""elephant-like"" feet and spend most of their time on the land. They need similar habitats, but there are some key differences that you'll need to know so you make sure you treat your animal right.Popular turtles to keep as pets include Sideneck turtles, wood turtles, painted turtles, pond turtles, and slider turtles.
Popular tortoises include red foots, Greek tortoises, and Russian tortoises.;
, Turtles are aquatic animals, so they need to live in an aquarium. If the turtle is fairly small, a 5 gallon tank will do. If it's a slightly bigger breed, then it will need a 10 or 20 gallon tank at least. All aquariums should have mesh lids to allow proper air circulation and keep the turtle inside.You need more than a bowl and a rock to ensure proper health and longevity of a turtle. Those little ""Turtle Ponds"" you can still find in pet stores are insufficient, and sometimes called ""Death Bowls"" by experienced turtle keepers.
Turtles do grow, so make sure you talk to a turtle or pet retailer about your specific turtle breed, and find out more about the species and how much bigger its likely to get. Get a tank big enough for its ultimate size, not the size it is now.

, Turtles need about 12-14 hours of sunlight a day for the proper amount of Vitamin D. Purchase a high-quality UV lamp for your tank. Set it up with an automatic timer to make sure the turtle gets the light it needs.


For most turtles, you'll need to keep the aquarium around 78 F (25 C), but some turtles might be able to abide slightly lower or higher temperatures.
Heat lamps can generally just be clipped to the edge of the tank and angled down. Install an easily visible thermometer stuck to the side of the tank to make sure the temperature stays consistent.

, There are a variety of ways to decorate and fill your habitat, depending on the specific species. Aquatic turtles need a mostly wet environment, while tortoises and other land-dwellers will need a lot dry area. Both turtles need variety, however.Create a rock incline for aquatic turtles, to give them some dry area on which to sun and warm. Get a large container and a rock about 4 inches (10.2 cm) long. Clean the rock with untreated water.
Wooden boards or bricks make great land areas as they can be cleaned easily. Just make sure they stay dry and are sloped gently towards the water for easy access. Wood chips and bark can get moldy or grow fungus. Turtles will also eat them sometimes, causing problems. It's best to avoid these materials.
Some clay or plastic shelter is a good idea. Find an appropriately-sized one at your local pet store or make one with some stones.
If you put plants inside the tank, do a quick check to make sure they are compatible and that your turtle will not get sick if he decides to eat a few of the leaves. Real plants are nice but get eaten within days. Unless you have a pond where you grow plants, think about using artificial plants for decoration.

, Distilled water contains no minerals, and isn't sufficient for keeping turtles healthy. Tap water contains chlorine and possibly fluoride which can upset the pH balance of the turtle's habitat. De-chlorinated spring water needs to be used for the swimming area and filtered water for your turtle to drink.


Adding a teaspoon of salt per gallon of water will reduce the level of bad bacteria and protect the turtles better from shell and skin diseases.
Spritz the dry areas regularly with a spray bottle, to maintain the moisture in the area. Again, this will vary, depending on the particular species.

, Aquatic turtles will need a lot of water in the aquarium, and it would make your job a lot easier to get a water filter and pump assembly, to cycle the water out regularly and clean it. Because turtles eat, drink, and defecate in the tank, it's very important to keep the water as clean as possible for the health of your turtle.Water filters are generally quite quiet and affordable, and they feature a small sump that sucks the water up and filters it through a filter and back into the tank.
You'll still need to change out the water and clean the tank about every month, but you'll need to change out the water much more regularly (every 2-3 days) without one.

, Dietary requirements vary widely and will differ depending on the type of animal you have, so it's important to do your research and talk to a turtle retailer in your area. Most turtles need to be fed no more than once every three days or so.


Turtles are primarily carnivores, while tortoises are primarily herbivores.Turtles enjoy eating mealworms, super worms, snails, grubs, and a variety of other insects. Tortoises enjoy fruits and vegetables, including dark leafy greens like kale and turnip, as well as corn and watermelon.
Feeding turtles too frequently or feeding the wrong kinds of food can have serious health consequences. Turtles usually live a long time, so it's important to provide for your pet and make sure that you're providing the right amount of nutrition on a regular enough basis.

, Different species have specific feeding needs, so the exact dietary requirement of your turtle will need to be researched. Care Sheets, commonly provided at pet stores, will help you learn more.


Commercial turtle food is usually fine. Available in pellet form, it's a mixture of dried shrimp, cricket, and a variety of vitamins and minerals necessary to keep the turtle happy. Any turtle food you can buy at the pet store will do. Amounts will vary depending on the size of the turtle.
It's not recommended to feed your turtle table scraps. However, green, leafy vegetables are sometimes recommended for tortoises and turtles, and can provide a healthy snack, and if you're not opposed, turtles are generally huge fans of the occasional worm or grub, tossed into the tank.

, In most tanks, it's a good idea to use a small plastic dish from which to feed the turtles. These are commonly sold at pet stores, but you can also use any small plastic or glass dish that you've got.


Many turtles will defecate shortly after eating. If you leave them in their feeding tub for a while after feeding, they will defecate in the dish. You get less waste in the tank this way. Not overfeeding will also keep the waste down.

, Like birds, some turtles appreciate having a cuttlebone to gnaw on, helping to provide the turtle with calcium and dental (beak) health.These are commonly sold at most pet stores for birds, crabs, and turtles.

, Remove any tattered food bits and clean the waste from the tank using a small net or cloth. It's important to keep the turtle's eating and living area clean of waste to make the turtle happy.


Change out the drinking water regularly and supply new water when you do this. If you use a water filter, you only need to change out the water every couple of weeks.

, Every couple of months, remove the turtle from the tank and place it into a temperature controlled area for a while while you wash out the tank thoroughly with spring water. You don't usually need to use soap to wash down the turtle's tank. Just use a thorough scrub brush to scrape off any algae or other growth from the sides of the tank.


Replace the water, the light, other supplies, and the thermometer, and return the turtle to the freshly cleaned habitat.

, When you do full tank cleanings, it's a good idea to wash down your turtle and inspect for any signs of injury or disease. There is shell conditioner that you can buy at the pet store, which can be applied with a toothbrush to the back of the shell.


Gently brush off any algae and other growth using the toothbrush. Many turtles like the sensation of being brushed, so this should be a good experience for your pet.

, Turtles are cold-blooded, which means they take a long time to adjust to temperature changes. If you take your pet out of the tank to play, be sure the room is at relatively the same temperature as the tank. Sudden changes will cause stress and possibly harm the turtle's immune system.

, Turtles often carry Salmonella, so it's very important to wash your hands after handling them. Keeping the water in the tanks fresh and removing waste promptly should also help keep bacteria under control in the habitat. Installation of a water filtration system should also help.


Keep your fingers away from the turtle's mouth any time you handle your pet. A bite can hurt even if accidental.

, Turtles are not like dogs and cats. They do not enjoy going for walks and being handled. Some keepers allow their turtles to walk around on their floors, or take them outside for walks, or carry them around. This is not something your turtle will enjoy, nor is it good for them. This causes unnecessary stress and could will eventually lead to health problems.


How do you keep turtles happy? Leave them in their habitat and watch them swim, eat, bask and move about in their home which you have provided. They will be much happier and so will you.
Most people find that tortoises enjoy going outdoors and roaming around under supervision, while turtles prefer remaining in their habitats and not being handled. Still, it's good to limit your direct handling of the tortoise as much, in general.

Watch the fish carefully after introduction.,
Acclimatize the fish to the water.,
Include hiding spots in the tank.",How to Put a Sucker Fish in a Tank With a Turtle," Yes, turtles will eat or try to eat just about anything you put near them. In captivity, some species eat turtle pellets, which often include shrimp or fish meal, flour, and vitamin supplements.Dietary preference vary a bit by species, however.;
, These are a popular pet species. They are usually pretty carnivorous, but they can eat aquatic plants and vegetables, ideally floating ones. Preferable vegetables include dark romaine leaves, mustard or collard greens, endive, Swiss chard, kale, parsley, and carrot tops.In captivity, they eat turtle pellets. As they grow older, they tend to eat more plant matter, but bear in mind that younger turtles eat more animals.

, They eat aquatic plants, crickets, earthworms, insect larvae, and commercial pet food.They can also eat chopped fish, but this is not recommended since you don’t want your turtle to develop a taste for fish if you plan on introducing live fish to their habitat.

, Wood turtles eat earthworms, mealworms, crickets, and aquatic plants. They can also eat crayfish, though.So, be careful keeping crustaceans around.

, There are other turtles that might be good pets, but bear in mind that they might not be able to cohabitate with fish. Map turtles are primarily carnivorous. So, they’re not suitable tank mates for fish. Box turtles are also popular, but since they’re not aquatic per se, you obviously wouldn’t be pairing fish with them., On a fish diet, your turtle may be more inclined to try to eat any other fish that might be in the tank. So, you do not want your turtles to get in the habit of eating fish, particularly live fish.

, Since turtles are rather omnivorous and apt to consider other animals as potential food, the heartier fish species you can find, the better. Just make sure it’s not so hearty as to be aggressive.


Plecostamus is a hearty category of fish. Plecos (the common name for plecostamus), aka a sucker fish, is a fish in the catfish group that are popular pets. Plecos are algae eaters of varying colors. Some can grow to be two feet long in a large tank.Many of them also have armor. So, most turtles, even adults, don’t seriously injure them.
Certain large fish can be turtle companions. In addition to sucker fish, certain large koi can cohabitate with turtles such as red ear sliders. Bear in mind, however, that the turtles may nip at their fins., Remember that most semi-aquatic turtles can grow very large very quickly. So, take future turtle size into account when choosing a fish. Unless a fish is particularly fast and agile, it’s better to have any fish be larger than the turtle or as large as possible.


Giant gourami and cichlids might also be suitable fish in a turtle tank. Giant gourami are large enough that they might not be considered turtle food. Non-aggressive types of cichlids are also potentially good mates.Small and fast fish can survive in turtle tanks. Tiny and agile fish such as guppies may be able to cohabitate with turtles. Beware of them overpopulating the tank, though., It’s not always easy finding a suitable tank mate for a turtle, and your pet store’s options might also limit your own. So, some aquarists use small and common fish, which might be suitable companions for a time.


Some turtle owners place goldfish and minnows in turtle tanks. They may survive, and tend to have a short lifespan anyway. If the turtle does eat them, however, they are inexpensive and easily replaceable.
Ghost shrimp are also a potential short-term option. If they have enough hiding spaces and cover in the tank, ghost shrimp can have a respectable survivability rate. Some may be eaten, however, and ghost shrimp don’t have a long natural lifespan as it is.
Consider apple snails as an alternative. If you are getting fish to eat algae, consider buying apple snails instead. Get the largest ones possible and they should be safe in the tank, unless you have a 2 foot (0.6 m) long turtle.

, Since pet turtles can grow large, you’ll want to accommodate them—and any fish companions—with a large tank. A five-foot-long tank at a volume of 80 gallons is recommended., This is important for obvious reasons. If the turtle isn’t hungry when the fish is introduced, it is less likely to go after the fish immediately as a source of food. It is also likely to have a better temperament and be less shocked by the introduction of a new tank mate.

, Lots of adult semi-aquatic turtles (like red ear sliders) eat more vegetables as adults. So, they are less likely to consider the fish as a potential meal. When the turtle is mature, you’ll also know its adult size. This way, you can see what size companion might be suitable for the turtle, if you’re considering a large fish .

, See if the turtle reacts to the fish's presence. If there is no reaction, you may be okay having the sucker fish in the tank with the turtle. If the turtle swims up to the fish and nips at it or keeps bothering it, you should remove the fish and find it a new home (or return it to the store).

, Water chemistry can differ considerably between fish tanks. So, slowly introduce the fish to the tank by first floating it in its bag in the tank for 5 minutes, then adding a little bit of the tank water to the bag every 5-10 minutes until the water in the bag is twice the volume it was before.


Carefully, take out half the water in the fish bag and again add a little tank water at a time every 5 minutes until the water in the bag is again doubled.
Wait five minutes, then carefully net the fish (or pour the contents of the bag over a sink into a clean colander that has no soaps or chemical residue) and put the fish gently into the tank. Using this transition method, the fish will adapt more gradually to the change in temperature, pH, GH, etc., and will be more likely to survive the transition.

, These will allow the fish to have space to themselves, to feel less stressed, and to be less vulnerable to the turtles. Hiding spots can also add decoration to the tank, while providing segmentation that gives different species their own different regions of the tank.


Terracotta flowerpots and PVC piping are usually ideal.These have a less natural look but can be easily accessible to fish, while impenetrable to turtles. Also, many are made especially for aquariums, including related ornaments like miniature sunken ships.
Bushy plants can provide good hiding spots. Synthetic plants made especially for fish tanks are best. You don’t want the turtle to eat any plants meant to hide or protect your fish.
Rocks and driftwood can work when chosen carefully. Rocks are good hiding spots for fish, but make sure they’re not too heavy for the aquarium or too light for the turtle to move. The same applies to driftwood, but also make sure the wood has been treated for use in aquariums so that it doesn’t release any toxins."

Set up a tank for your terrapin.,
Purchase a heat lamp for the tank.,
Clean the tank regularly.,
Feed your terrapin a healthy diet.,
Avoid handling your terrapin.,
Keep the tank free of feces and food debris.,
Understand what a healthy terrapin looks like.,
Take your terrapin for an annual wellness exam.,
Recognize signs of poor health.",How to Look After Terrapins," Terrapins grow to be quite large. Even if your terrapin is small now, he can easily grow up to 9 inches. Terrapins need large tanks that meet certain requirements.


Terrapins, in addition to being large, are fairly active and crave a lot of space to roam. Aim to get a 100-gallon aquarium for your terrapin and try to find a tank with multiple sections.Your tank should have both water and land. Terrapins do not thrive in cold temperatures, so make sure to add a water heater. Water should be around 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, add a water filter as terrapins are messy. A good filtration system will keep their water clean and bacteria free.Aim for flat, stone surfaces, some of which poke out like islands within the water. Terrapins like to bask in the sun and will want space to do so.;
, Terrapins are unable to regulate body temperature in the wild and rely on heat from the sun. You need to supply a heat lamp for your terrapin.


Get a heat lamp that can hold a 40-watt bulb that contains UVA and UVB waves. The lamp should be roughly 10 inches from your terrapins basking area.The overall tank temperature should be between 77 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit, but the area by the bulb may be warmer. Therefore, make sure the bulb shines down on a specific area and does not extend the heat it produces into the entire tank., You need to clean your tank on a regular basis to keep your terrapin healthy.


Drinking water should be changed out every day to prevent bacteria from building up.A good water filtration system should prevent you from having to change out swimming water on a daily basis. However, use a net scoop to regularly remove debris and, once every two or three weeks, completely swap out existing swimming water for fresh water.To clean basking areas, buy products specifically designed to clean turtle tanks. These can be purchased at most pet stores. Never use soap and water, as this can be harmful to your terrapin.Always move your terrapin to a separate container when cleaning. Wash your hands after handling your terrapin., Terrapins are omnivores. This means their diet is comprised of both plants and animals.


Most pet stores sell turtle pellets that are safe for terrapins. Ask a pet store employee for a recommendation if you are unsure.
For meat, terrapins eat snails and earth worms and might eat meats like chicken and pork as well. Tuna and other oily fish are a favorite. Meat should be given raw and in small chunks.For plants, let your terrapin snack on berries and leafy vegetables like lettuce and spinach.Some stores sell vitamin and mineral supplements to promote healthy shells and skin. If your terrapin is having any health issues, you might want to look into adding supplements to his diet., Terrapins have a reputation for being somewhat aggressive. A terrapin is more of a hands-off pet and should not be handled frequently.


You need to earn a terrapin's trust before he will let you touch him. Never touch a terrapin if he seems timid or shy. Terrapins do bite and their bites are hard and sometimes warrant medical attention. Hand feeding is a great way to bond with your terrapin and get him comfortable with your presence.If your terrapin seems calm in your presence and allows you to touch and pet him, it's okay to occasionally pick him up gently. In fact, you need to regularly pick up your terrapin in order to clean his tank. However, limit the contact you do have. Terrapins tend to thrive in solitude and too much handling can cause them stress., Terrapins are messy. When they eat, they tend to scatter food and do not usually defecate in a specific area of the tank. You need to remove fecal matter and scattered food on a daily basis, especially if it gets into the water. You can do this using a cat litter scoop or a net scoop as you won't have to remove your terrapin from the tank on a daily basis. This can be stressful for him and you., In order to gauge when something's wrong, you first need to have a sense of what a terrapin looks like when healthy.


Terrapins eyes should be bright and clear. Shells should be shiny and free of any noticeable cracks. His beak should close symmetrically.Healthy terrapins are active. Your terrapin should be able to move easily without straining his limbs., An annual wellness exam is important to any pet's well being. A veterinarian can check for any signs of health problems and recommended treatment options if needed.


Call the veterinarian's office beforehand to make sure they treat reptiles. Many veterinarians focus mainly on dogs and cats and might not have experience with turtles or terrapins. You might have to call several different offices before you find a good vet.
Your vet will take your terrapin's height and weight and perform a brief physical examination. He will likely listen to the heart and lungs and might ask for a stool sample to test for parasites.You should discuss any behavioral changes you notice with your vet. Also, tell your vet about your pet's diet, tank size, heat lamp, and your cleaning rituals. The vet might have some helpful suggestions in regards to your terrapin's care., Bacterial infections, upper respiratory problems, and parasites are common in turtles. Know the signs your turtle might need medical care.


Any problems to the shell, such as a flaky, waxy, or misshapen shell, might be a sign of vitamin deficiencies or the existence of parasites. If you notice any changes to your terrapin's shell, seek medical care.A turtle's mouth should be free of lesions and sores. If you notice any, talk to a vet.Upper respiratory infections are common in turtles, so watch for wheezing, coughing, and discharge from the mouth.Parasites can usually be spotted by unusual weight loss, changes in appetite, and bloody stools."

Provide lots of space.,
Build a beach.,
Keep clean.,
Handle with love.",How to Keep Your Turtle Happy1," Turtles enjoy swimming, basking in the sun, and being active. Turtles also grow. Therefore, providing lots of space for your turtle to enjoy these activities and giving room to grow is important in making your turtle happy. Research the potential mature size of your turtle and buy a tank that will reflect his growth. Turtles cannot be crammed into a small space or they will be unhappy.
Glass aquariums that provide about three to four times the length of the turtle are most desirable. Turtles need to be able to totally submerge themselves and they need an area to get out of the water and get completely dry.
Keep in mind that the bigger the tank is, the happier the turtle will be. Turtles are reptiles that, surprisingly, have a large territory in the wild. Try to reflect that with a large tank.;
, Turtles take pleasure from spending time on land and water, so creating an environment that allows them to do both will make them happy. Although turtle aquariums do not need much landscaping creating an appropriate habitat will maximize your turtle’s health and longevity. Designing the habitat can be a fun and creative project, but always remember to your turtle’s needs in mind. Try to keep the water portion deeper than the shell is wide so your turtle can completely submerge and swim freely.
Slope the land portion into the water so your turtle does not have trouble entering or exiting the water portion.
Turtles love to bask in the sun. Create a basking platform so your turtle can enjoy the UVA and UVB heat lamps you set up in the tank. Turtles can relax under the light for up to ten to twelve hours a day.

, Turtles are messy – they excrete, eat, and leave behind scraps of food in their water. If you do no clean their aquarium, both the turtle and its habitat will stink. Moreover, all this waste could potentially cause high ammonia and nitrate levels. Clean your turtle’s aquarium weekly or create a separate area outside the tank to feed and allow your turtle to excrete waste before reentering the aquarium.
An unclean tank or turtle could result in several different types of diseases that are difficult to treat.
Algae will build on your turtle’s shell and will need to be cleaned off with a soft toothbrush.
Turtles, like most reptiles, shed. The scutes on your turtle’s shell will become itchy and irritable if you do not keep the shell cleaned off.
Always wash your hands before and after handling your turtle so that you do not transfer germs or contaminates to your turtle and to prevent the transfer of salmonella.

, Turtles, like people, have very different personalities. If you have a social turtle, you might be able to pet or play with them, but a general rule would be to keep handling at a minimum. In general, turtles do not enjoy being lifted off of the ground, but sometimes it is necessary to remove them from their aquarium for cleaning, playing, or exercise. If so, handle your turtle gently and securely so they do not bite you or try to escape.
Remember never to put your turtle on its back, grab its tail, or force it out of its shell. Your turtle will not think that is funny and it will stress them out.
If your turtle enjoys affection, you can pet their head, chin, and shell as long as they allow you to do it.

, Turtles will be the most receptive to human interaction when they feel safe and secure, so place them on the floor (preferably tile rather than carpet) when petting them.

, Gently run your finger on the middle-top of the turtle's head, carefully avoiding the nose/eyes.If the turtle repeatedly throws its head up in the air with its mouth open, it is trying to let you know that it does not like you touching its head.

, Use your finger to gently rub the turtle under the chin and along the cheeks. , Once a turtle trusts you, you may be able to massage its neck with causing it to withdraw into its shell., Turtles can feel touch through their shells. As such, stroke your turtle's shell in slow circles or run your fingers in straight lines along the length of its shell.As an alternative to petting a turtle’s shell with your fingers, you can also gently rub a toothbrush or other soft-bristled brush along the top of its shell.

, As an alternative to petting the turtle, you can enjoy bonding with it by allowing it crawl on you or sit in your lap. Just make sure it doesn’t fall off.Turtles will urinate when you pick them up, so use caution when putting them on your body.

, Your turtle will not be receptive to being pet all the time, but the more you handle it, the more accustomed it will grow to human interaction.Turtles associate their human keepers with food, so try rewarding your turtle with a treat when it allows you to pet it., Turtles are not commonly thought of as dangerous animals capable of inflicting harm on human beings. However, a few breeds of turtles, particularly snapping turtles, are capable of inflicting a painful and potentially damaging bite. Also, turtles carry a number of diseases that can be harmful to humans. Turtle skin often has salmonella bacteria on it, which can make humans very sick.Salmonella can't be washed or rinsed off the turtle.
Never leave a child to handle a turtle unattended.

, Just because you acquired a pet turtle does not make that turtle a domesticated animal. Unlike some cats and dogs, who will naturally seek affection from humans, turtles tend to view humans with hesitancy and fear. Because of this, you need to be patient with your turtle. It may take a very long time before the turtle learns to recognize and trust you as its caregiver., Turtles seem inherently rugged and tough because of their shells. However, the exposed legs and head can be easily damaged if the turtle is mishandled. Some tips for handling turtles with caution are:


Try to avoid picking up or handling the turtle unless necessary. When you do need to pick a smaller turtle up, place your open palm under its plastron (or bottom shell/ belly) and make sure its legs can touch your hand. In the wild, turtles don’t spend much, if any, of their time off of the ground. Having your hand underneath the turtle should make it more comfortable.Always lift turtles up from the back and not the front. Turtles are unpredictable and lifting the turtle from the front will give it an opportunity to bite you. Turtles may urinate when being picked up, which is yet another reason why you should wear gloves when handling them.Don’t place turtles on the edges of high surfaces. They are not always aware of their environment and may walk right off the edge, injuring themselves.As a general rule, it is not wise to touch a turtle’s legs or claws.
Remember, turtle shells are not invincible. Some turtles have soft shells that can be easily scratched or damaged, leading to fungal infections. Even hard shelled turtles can sustain damage to or break their shells- so be careful., Turtles are more energetic, aware and receptive when they are warm. Cold turtles are much more likely to shy away from external stimuli because they are not entirely sure what is going on around them. The best time to pet or handle a turtle is after it has been sunning itself or lying under a heat lamp.


Turtles need real sunlight, not just heat lamps or artificial sunlight. A lack of sunlight can lead to metabolic bone disease, which essentially disintegrates a turtle’s bones., Turtles are not the most communicative animals around. However, there are a few physical signs that your turtle is not in the mood for human contact. They include:


Hissing
Sitting motionless with the mouth open
Withdrawing into the shell
Snapping or biting gestures

, Always wash your hands after handling a turtle, as there are diseases on their skin that are harmful to people. Most experts suggest handling turtles with gloves, although this would defeat the purpose of petting a turtle. Also, remember that turtles spend most of their time in dirt and dirty water, so it may be wise to rinse the turtle off before handling it.

Keep the turtles in a proper enclosure.,
Make sure your enclosure has enough substrate or soil bedding.,
Give the turtles a pond or pool to swim in.,
Make sure the enclosure has controlled temperature and light.,
Feed the turtle a variety of foods.",How to Make a Turtle Trap," You will need the following: Plywood
Chicken wire or hardware cloth
Metal dowel rods
D 20 nails
A fence post or garden stake to anchor the trap
Rope or wire;
, Secure it together with nails.While this method is not the only way to make a turtle trap, it is recommended by fish and wildlife authorities.
Make sure the box is large enough to house several turtles at a time.
A good rule is to make the box at least 2 ft x 2 ft.
Ensure that the box is sturdy and well constructed. It will sit in water so you want to make sure it won't come apart.

, This will prevent turtles from escaping. The chicken wire will allow water to enter the trap to keep the turtles wet and comfortable.
Nail the chicken wire onto the frame, making sure there aren't any gaps where the wire is loose.
Make sure the chicken wire or hardware clot is a fine mesh. You don't want the turtles' feet to get stuck in the wire.

, This will serve as a ramp. This ramp will allow turtles to crawl up into the trap.
Make sure the ramp is long enough and at a small angle so it is not too steep.
Make sure the ramp is tightly nailed to the frame. If it falls off, you won't get any turtles into your trap.

, You will want to pass it through the center of a board of plywood that is smaller than your trap. This will serve as a teeter board.
When you trap a turtle, the turtle will crawl up the ramp onto the teeter board.
The weight of the turtle will cause the teeter board to tilt and drop the turtle gently into the trap.
Attach the teeter board and rod to the top of the frame of the trap. Screw this in just adjacent to the ramp.

, Angle these upwards. Space these every 4 inches (10.2 cm), 2 inches above where the surface of the water in the trap will be.
Before you do this you will need to put the trap in the water where you will set it up to see where the water line lies.
These nails will prevent the turtles from escaping the trap.

, This will serve as bait.


The turtles will smell this food and be attracted to the trap.
After you set up the trap, check this often to see if you need to replace it.
Make sure the bait is secure enough that it is not swept away by moving water.

, This should be an area where you see turtles resting or feeding along the water's edge. Anchor a fence post or garden stake into the bottom of the pond or creek where you want to set up your trap.
Tie the trap to the stake with rope or use strong wire to attach it.
Place your trap in the water carefully.
Check to make sure it sits in the water with part of it above water.
Check your trap everyday to see if you have trapped any turtles.

, You will want to release them to a natural environment. Turtles are wild animals. They will fair better in their own natural environment than in a home or outdoor aquarium.
Release turtles by a wild pond or creek. This is their natural habitat.
If you can't release the turtles right away, you will need a proper enclosure with enough water, light, shade, and food.

, Wild freshwater turtles generally do well outdoors or in a large indoor enclosure. Avoid keeping them in glass aquariums. They tend to be too small.
Try a rubbermaid tub with opaque sides. Turtles in glass or see-through containers will obsessively try to climb through or become afraid by activity in the room.
Seriously consider on outdoor trap with adequate sun, shade, water, and weeds. A small pond (either natural or homemade in a tub) is best.

, This acts as a comfortable cushioning for the turtle. A mixture of potting soil, sand, leaf mulch, and sphagnum moss is recommended.
Keep this misted everyday to hold humidity.
Turtles need a moist, humid environment.
Turtles will burrow or nest into the substrate. This makes them feel comfortable. Make the substrate deep enough that the turtle can completely bury itself.
Put some flat rocks in the enclosure. This will allow the turtles to sun themselves.
Make sure you keep the terrarium or enclosure misted daily. It is very important to keep the turtles habitat very moist or they can develop respiratory problems.

, Make sure the water is warm so that the turtle does not become disabled if it falls into the water.A shallow pool in a plastic tub will suffice for a pond.
Turtles will swim for an hour or more a day.
Turtles tend to defecate in their water so it is very important that this is changed everyday.

, Outdoor enclosures will need to be heated if the temperature drops below 60 degrees.A ceramic heater will help to keep a colder enclosure warm enough for the turtles.
All enclosures should provide a cool area and warm area.
In hotter climates, make sure that the turtles have an area where there is lots of shade and soil for burrowing. This will help to keep them from getting overheated.
Keeping the enclosure misted will help this issue also.
Light is also necessary for keeping the turtles healthy and comfortable.
Make sure the turtle has a sunny area in an outdoor trap or buy an incandescent bulb for an indoor enclosure.

, Turtles like to eat insects, vegetables, fungus, weeds and even snails.Try feeding the turtle a small ""salad"" with some lettuce, grated carrot, and a live earthworm.
You can also feed them mushrooms and strawberries.
You can buy live insects to feed the turtles at pet stores.
Feed the turtles on a flat rock instead of in a dish. This is a more natural way for turtles to eat.
If a turtle is reluctant to eat, try misting or wetting the turtle ahead of time. Feed them in a warm area of the enclosure.

Adopt a turtle.,
Find a pet store.,
Make sure that the turtle is healthy.",How to Find a Turtle1," Contact an animal rescue organization. Run a web search for turtle rescue societies in your area. These organizations recover pet turtles that have been lost, abandoned, injured, or otherwise scattered from their homes. This can be a great way to give a turtle a new home.You will need to visit a turtle adoption center and prove that you will be a responsible turtle owner. Make sure that you understand what it means to adopt a turtle. These animals require specialized and thoughtful care, feeding, housing, and cleaning.;
, If there is a pet store near you, stop in and ask about their turtle selection. If you find a pet store that is relatively far away, then call ahead to ask before you make the trek. Be aware that pet stores do not always take adequate care of turtles.If possible, visit a pet store that is well-reviewed, or that a friend has recommended.

, This is especially important if you are buying from a pet store. In general, a turtle is healthy if it is active, social, and responsive to human interaction. It should be mobile and well-fitted to its shell. If you aren't sure, ask a pet store employee – but do not take their words without a grain of salt!Look for a turtle with bright, clear eyes. Dull, crusty, or pus-filled eyes are a sign that a turtle is infected with disease.
Find a happy and active animal. Watch the turtle in its tank: it should move around, swim, and splash. If it is in a tank with other turtles, it should be friendly and sociable around the other animals.
Check that the turtle is not overweight or underweight. If its skin sags from its body, then it might be underweight. If it cannot get fully inside of its shell, then it might be overweight.

"
"
Provide variety.,
Feed them live food as a snack.,
Keep a regular schedule.",How to Keep Your Turtle Happy2," Turtles are omnivores and have a voracious appetite. Just like humans, turtles need variety in their life. A balanced diet of vitamins and minerals is very important to keep your turtle happy and satisfied. A balanced diet of leafy green vegetables, insects, and prepared turtle foods will keep your turtle growing to full size. Your turtle might also like fruit or even flowers. Make sure you know what type of turtle you have so that you can provide the appropriate diet.
Never feed your turtle dairy products, as their stomach cannot properly digest lactose. Also steer clear of giving your turtle processed foods. Whole, dairy free foods are best.

, Turtles like to chase their food. By providing live food for your turtle, you will give them time for exercise and entertainment. Provide your turtle with live crickets, mealworms, wax worms are delicious insects that turtles love to eat.
Consider adding alternative insects, or even live fish and shrimp, throughout the week to keep your turtle’s diet interesting and nutritious.

, You love your turtle and it loves you, but do not give your turtle food every time you witness begging. Turtles are opportunistic feeders in the wild since they never know when the next meal is coming. Oftentimes, when your turtle sees you they will approach you with an open mouth because they associate you with feeding. Do not veer from the schedule, otherwise you will probably overfeed your turtle. Younger turtles need to eat daily whereas adult or mature turtles only need to be fed a few times per week. Be careful not to overfeed your turtle, they can become obese.
Water should always be accessible. Indeed, many turtles will consume their food under the water, but if they do not, then you should leave your turtle’s food in the same location in the aquarium. That way, your turtle will always know where to go to get their food.
To help avoid overfeeding, you should present food as your turtle eats it and remove all uneaten or partially eaten food after about five minutes.

"
"
Go outside and play.,
Provide live fish as a game.,
Give your turtle toys.",How to Keep Your Turtle Happy3," Even if you are a generous owner and purchase an aquarium that provides space and freedom, a turtle will still need additional room to exercise and play. Remember that turtles are extremely active and, in the wild, cover lots of ground despite their unwieldy bodies. If you plan to let your turtle out of the aquarium to walk around the house, make sure everybody is aware and that you provide some barriers to control the location of their exercise. This avoids any fatal accidents.

, While in the aquarium, you can place small fish or cuttlebones on top of the water and let your turtle “hunt” these items. The effort your turtle makes to swim and hunt these objects is a great source of exercise. Live insects make tasty and hard to catch as well. Consider feeding your turtle mayflies, caddisflies, beetle larvae, crickets, grasshoppers, mealworms, and waxworms.
Earthworms, blackworms, snails, clams, small frogs, and tadpoles are acceptable mollusks, worms, and amphibians to feed your pet turtle.
Other natural fish that your turtle would enjoy chasing and eating are young goldfish, red minnows, guppies, and mosquito fish.

, Some turtles also enjoy playing. Although it is completely okay to pet and play with your turtle keep in mind that turtles are generally a kind of pet that is better to look at than to constantly handle. They will get stressed out. After all, they are not a dog.


Consider providing your turtle with an empty shell that they can slide across the floor with or place a small toy raft in their water that they can push along for fun.
Train your turtle to eat from your hand. This takes some trust and familiarity but once some connection has been established between you and your turtle, try putting a piece of fruit on your hand. If your turtle enjoys this, then try placing the piece of fruit on your wrist so that you turtle has to crawl up your hand to get it.
Try building an obstacle course. Design obstacles out of your turtle’s natural habitat – stones, sticks, plants, and water pits. Place a treat at the end to provide motivation.
Another fun game for your turtle is to “find-the-treat.” Hide crickets, worms, or other live insects around your turtle’s habitat for it to find. This will give your turtle a challenge with a treat as a reward.
Remember that these tricks could take time for your turtle to learn, so be patient. Also, the more difficult the game or the exercise the more stress it will place on your turtle. In other words, it is not a good idea to play these games or exercises on a daily basis.

Consider leaving a turtle in the wild.,
Find wild turtles.,
Catch the turtle by hand.,
Build a trap.",How to Find a Turtle2," It is one thing to buy a turtle from a pet store or adopt a turtle from a rescue society, especially if you intend to take good care of the animal. Taking a turtle from its natural habitat, however, removes it from access to mates, food, and space to wander. Think about whether the turtle would be better off

, Look along the banks of small ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Turtles like damp areas with a lot of rocks and hiding spots. Turtles are especially active at dawn on rainy days, and they move around a lot in the heat of late May and June.Know that turtles love to dig. A turtle may bury itself up to its shell in the loose mud of a sandy bank, and it may be hard to spot unless you keep a sharp eye out. Try poking gently in spots where the bank has shifted. If you feel something solid, it might be a turtle shell.
Keep your eyes out for turtles in the open: in yards or parks, or crossing the road. If you find a turtle in an unsafe space or an inhospitable environment—such as a road, a hot parking lot, or a very dry area—consider at least moving it to the nearest pond., If the turtle is small and easy to reach, then you can simply pick it up by its shell. Expect the turtle to recoil into its shell when you reach for it. Be careful not to shake the animal or injure it in any way. As soon as possible, place the turtle into an open box with water, a bit of lettuce, and plenty of fresh air.


Be aware that turtles can bite, and that some can cause serious damage! Do not try to pick up a snapping turtle. It can be done, but it is a risky move., Consider making a basic turtle trap if you are trying to, say, catch a turtle that's been living in your garden. First, dig a hole deep and steep enough for the turtle to fall into. Alternately, prop up a shoebox on a stick such that the turtle will knock over the stick and trap itself in the box. Then, bait the trap: use leafy greens, or a smelly fish like tuna. Leave the trap overnight, and check it each day until you catch the turtle.


Make sure to poke air-holes in the shoebox! There is no sense in killing the turtle.
Place your trap close to where you've seen the turtle. If the turtle is in a pond, make the trap near the shore of the water.

"
"
Fence in the area.,
Search for the turtle.,
Be patient but proactive.",How to Find a Turtle3," If you have lost a turtle in your home or yard, create a solid perimeter that keeps the animal from escaping further afield. Close doors, move furniture, and try to keep a good idea of where the turtle might be.


Restrain any large pets that might try to prey on the turtle. This includes dogs and cats., Check every room. Turtles can move quickly when they want to do so, and the animal may have roamed further than you expect. Look underneath furniture, and do not make any assumptions about where the turtle might be. Expect it to be most active during the day, and to sleep at night.Make sure that the turtle hasn't fallen down stairs, or fallen from a high place. Block off these danger zones, if you haven't already.
Listen for movement. If you have tile or hardwood floors, then you might be able to hear the quiet scratch of the turtle's claws as it walks.

, Try leaving food and water out for your turtle so that it emerges from its hiding spot. Keep that part of the house quiet so that the animal feels safe. Expect a turtle to survive on its own for one to two weeks, indoors – but try to find it as quickly as possible to minimize any danger!


Remember: turtles don't usually drink from small dishes of water. They drink water as they are immersed in it."

Turtles: In America, most Chelonian turtles are referred to as turtles, whether from land or water. In Britain and Australia, turtle refers only to marine species.
Tortoises: In America and Britain, this tends to refer to land species, while in Australia (which has no land tortoises), this means freshwater species.
Terrapins: In Britain, this refers to freshwater species, while in America, it refers to the Diamondback terrapins Malaclemys terrapin.
The article follows American the convention for turtles.;
, Good quality pet stores will usually be able to supply you with a turtle but they might not have the breed you are interested in, so call before going. Breeders can also be found online and through local reptile societies.

, Turtles are not cheap and will set you back quite a bit of money. Find out ahead of time how much you'll need to spend to get a turtle and its living needs (housing, food, etc.).

, Some countries and states require a licence to keep turtles and tortoises.

, For example:



Hardy land tortoises: Needs land and a small amount of water. These turtles tend to be temperate to sub-tropical and need a hibernation period. Many can cope well with outdoor enclosures that are properly fenced in, with adequate shelter provided. Lawn and weedy patches are useful additions to the ""pen"". As they can burrow, the wire will need to extend under the ground a little way. Something to bathe in is important for warmer and hot weather environments.

Tropical land tortoises: Needs a warmer environment; can be kept outside when it's warm but will need to be indoors for most of the year. You will need to consider additional heating and ways to provide adequate humidity for the tortoise (heating tanks/pads, etc.) A terrarium is one option for such tortoises.

Aquatic turtles: Needs an adequate amount of water. The amount of land needed varies dependent on the species; some are almost totally aquatic will be fine with an aquarium tank unless you wish to also breed them, in which case they'll need a little land too.
Make sure you have at least 10 gallons (37.9 L) per inch. Ex: Your turtle is 5 inches, that would mean that you needed a 50-gallon tank.

, The precise details on what is needed for your species of turtle will vary depending on its own particular needs. Some general observations on what might prove useful are


Indoor turtle: If you are going to have an indoor turtle, you will need a tank, some source of heat light (powerful lamps are generally used-–ask the pet shop retail assistant how many watts it should be), some sort of rock or a place where it can bask and get completely dry (if your turtle is over a certain weight then floating basking ""islands"" are not recommended.), and if needed, water for it to swim in (on some sort of angle so there are deep and shallow parts). You'll also need pebbles or small rocks for the rest of the basic base. Ask pet shop retailer for more advice for what to have in the tank.
Outdoor turtle: An outdoor turtle enclosure should be located in a sunny place with lots of safe vegetation. You will need a pond (it doesn't have to be big) or a bathtub, as they sometimes like to go for a little swim even though they do generally stay out of water. Have little plants in the pond and nice rocks around it. Also for an outdoor turtle, an enclosed hut like place for him to cuddle into at night. Green plants are good for your turtle to just hang around in. You will need a very good fence around the whole enclosure, as turtles are very good escape artists. Even have the fence half a meter under the ground so that your turtle can't climb under it.

, There are lots of different types. Some are stubborn and bite a lot, while others are a little more shy. Consider a Russian turtle. These turtles are much easier to handle for those children who want to have experiences with turtles but are wary of reptiles as they are less likely to be confrontational., Some turtles are basking turtles, so they prefer to stay in waters for long periods of time. Russian turtles are one of those turtles that prefer the water over the sunlight. Turtles are also cold-blooded, so they might wander around looking for warm places.

Consider a really big tank or aquarium. It must be big and spacious because turtles can grow faster than you might expect.
A turtle's habitat must contain two important things - a land where the turtle will dry itself and stay under the purchased SUV light to keep itself warm and dry, and a water part of the tank for the turtle to keep itself cool and happy. Most turtles are what is said to be basking turtles, so this setup is ideal.
A small cave or a dark place where the turtle might want to refuge in if it is uncomfortable of its surroundings after being recently brought into its new habitat (optional).

, It cannot be near anywhere cold unless you want your turtle to freeze. It must also not be anywhere too hot or it will make your turtle upset, and upset turtles are stubborn and they bite!, You will hear many different food preferences that turtles have. The best advice is to try them all, provided you know it is safe for the turtle to eat. Turtles are very picky when it comes to food.


Outdoor turtles: Land tortoises are mostly herbivorous and will happily eat most safe green foliage. Grass and weeds are much loved, along with shredded cabbage/ romaine lettuce (iceberg lettuce is not very nitrous), broccoli, tomatoes. Fruits they like include strawberries, raspberries, dandelion flowers, pears, apples, and peaches. *Only feed them fruits 1-2 times a month because they are sugary.
Indoor turtles: Semi-aquatic and aquatic turtles are more carnivorous than the herbivorous land/outdoor turtles and will appreciate freshwater shrimp, crayfish, grasshoppers, slugs, snails, etc. Make sure that the meat is not fried or fatty (such as hamburger meat) Earthworms and mealworms are a treat, as are bugs like pillbugs and crickets. Some greens, veggies, and fruit should also be added to their diets to ensure adequate nutrition (no spinach, bananas, or iceberg lettuce though!)
Cut all food into small bite-size pieces; turtles are used to ripping food away from anchored plants and need small pieces to reach their mouths. If feeding your turtle cat/dog food or leftover meat, make sure it is in bite-size pieces, and only feed it on rare occasions.
In some cases, your turtle might like frozen fish food, about 1 to 2 squares each feed. Ask a turtle expert for more advice.
Know the food preferences for your species of turtle; do your reading first, as the needs vary depending on the species. It's also important to know what not to feed your turtle and to make all householders and guests aware of this, for the sake of the turtle's well-being.

, Feed the turtle only every other day, unless otherwise advised for your specific species.

, A bite can really hurt you, even if accidental.

, Turtles have quite an appetite for small critters. They tend to eat more than we think and not feeding your turtle for a whole day can make it very depressed and unhappy, so feeding a turtle requires at least twice or once a day depending on how much it eats. Do not over-feed it., Turtles mostly crush their food. Because turtles have no teeth, they are required to crush their pellets, and this also makes it difficult for them to enjoy eating. There are also chances that their pellets are stuck in their mouth, so before feeding your turtle their pellets, wet some of it and break a few into tiny bite size pieces. This eases the turtle while eating it, and also helps the turtle to digest better., Some turtles tend to leave some of their pellets floating in water. This causes the water to smell very badly, depending on the turtle's food. So always make sure to scoop out extra floating pellets to avoid clouding the water and making it tainted., Cichlids, goldfish, guppies, and snails are good choices since they are friendly and don't use up all of the food.

, Never remove all of the water as this will remove the good bacteria that is necessary for a healthy tank; also don't forget to use a water ager to remove all chlorine, chloramine, and fluoride from the tap water and add a good quality beneficial bacteria starter (Biostarter).


Maintain your filter! Never change all filter media at once; this is the home of your good bacteria. Only ever rinse the filter in clean aged tap water.

, Rotate drinking containers to always ensure only a clean one is used each day.

, Otherwise, it will rot and can be a source of bacterial infection. It will also smell most unpleasant.

, This is important for dry land terrariums or cages. Clean any soiled spots thoroughly.

, All animals can pass on infections, disease, and parasites and it is good practice to wash hands after handling them. In turn, you can pass on the same to the animal, so wash your hands before handling the animal too.

, When you first get your turtle, try not holding it for at least 3 weeks. Turtles are very timid animals and will need time to adjust to their new environment. But with time, your turtle will grow to trust you and if so, that's a magnificent thing. Ask the pet shop retailer if it's in your turtle's nature to bite––keep your hands well clear of the mouth if this is likely to be an issue.


If your turtle bites you, simply leave him alone for a week or so; clean your skin with anti-bacterial lotion, and if the bite breaks your skin, see your doctor immediately to check for and treat any bacterial transfer that might have occurred.

, Turtles live for the same time as a human (even longer sometimes!) so you must be in a position to care and love your turtle for a lifetime. If this is not something you're prepared to do, or you're not able to make hand-on arrangements, this isn't the pet for you.

, Fish can be a great addition to your turtle's tank but you have to make sure that you pick the right kind of fish. Catfish are not a good tank mate for turtles. If your turtle tries to eat the catfish, then the barbs will get stuck in your turtle's throat and it could potentially die. Also, some catfish have poisonous barbs.

, Guppies will make a great addition to any turtle tank. Your turtle will be able to eat them and they are quite fascinating to watch.

, Try to buy inexpensive fish like guppies and goldfish.

Floating box traps can be shaped in squares or in hoops. They're placed in shallow water near where turtles congregate. You place bait in these traps to entice turtles to enter. Usually, these traps contain a swiveling trap door that comes down and traps the turtles. You should use this type of trap if you plan on catching a large group of turtles. Floating box traps are best used if you're trapping turtles to use for food later, as you can catch quite a few turtles at once using these traps.If you're going for soft-shell turtles over breeds like terrapins, you may be able to catch the turtle by simply baiting a net. A lot of soft-shell turtles are captured in baited nets by mistake. If you know where turtles generally congregate, you can try baiting a net and dangling it in a river or stream.Nets also work well if you're simply trying to remove an unwanted turtle from a pond or lake for relocation purposes.;
, While a turtle trap can be built by hand, it's a good idea to purchase a trap if you're new to turtle trapping. The correct construction of a trap is vital to successfully catching a turtle.You do not want to risk making a faulty trap. Unless you have personal or professional experience in trap-making, purchase your own turtle trap.You can buy a floating box trap online, although you should be sure to read reviews of any online purchases ahead of time. You do not want to risk purchasing a faulty trap. Depending on your area, you may be able to find a floating box trap at a local hardware or hunting/fishing store. If you live in an area such as Louisiana, where turtle trapping is common, you're more likely to find a turtle trap at a local store.
You should be able to purchase a net at most fishing stores. Make sure the net you use is strong, as turtles can fight quite a bit when captured. You should also avoid mesh-nets, as these can cause injury to a turtle.

, To set up your trap, or attempt to capture a turtle in a net, start by scouting out locations where turtles may live. If you've seen turtles congregated by a rocky section in a nearby pond, this is a great place to put a trap or try and catch a turtle in your net. You can also wade through a pond or stream and see if you notice any turtles hiding in the rocks or crevices.If you cannot find any turtles, set your trap up in an area where they're likely to congregate. Choose a shallow area of a pond or stream near rocks and other hideaways.

, Before you place your trap or net in the water, make sure to bait the trap. For water turtles, you can use lettuce, worms, or other vegetables. You can also use a can of tuna with holes punched in the lid.You can also add sticks and foliage to the trap, making it look like an enticing place to rest.Where you place food-based bait varies by trap. Usually, there will be a contraption somewhere inside the trap for placing bait.
In the rare event your trap does not have a section for bait, you can wrap bait in a mesh bag and hang the bag off one of the bars towards the back of the trap. This way, the turtle will be able to see and smell the bait, but the bait will not be released from the trap. You can also place items like this inside a net to bait a turtle.

, Depending on the type of trap you've chosen, set up will vary. Most turtle traps are placed in shallow water. Choose an area deep enough that only the top of the trap sticks out above water.To start, dig into the mud just below the water. Create a hole, shaped something like your turtle trap, that you will push the trap into until it's secure. You can dig by hand, or use a shovel.Once you've dug a small hole, sink your trap into the hole. Commercial turtle traps are usually fairly heavy. The trap should stay in place on its own without added weights, like rocks or stones.

, Once the trap is set up, you simply need to wait. How long you wait depends. You may be able to catch a few turtles within an hour. However, it may take almost a day for turtles to enter the trap in other cases. It all depends on how many turtles are in your area. Check the trap every few hours to see if any turtles have entered. Keep the trap up until you've captured as many turtles as you want.

, Once you've caught as many turtles as you want, you can remove them from the trap. Do so with care, making sure to use thick gloves to protect your hands. In addition to the risk of injury, turtles can carry a variety of diseases. You do not want to handle a turtle with bare hands until its clean.


You should secure turtles in a closed container, like a cooler, before preparing them for meat.

, If you were capturing turtles that have become pests, do not attempt to relocate the turtle on your own. Turtles require specific conditions to thrive in the wild, and the Humane Society recommends letting wild turtles remain where you found them.Therefore, if you must relocate, take your turtles to a local animal rescue or animal shelter. You can also call your local branch of animal control to help you humanely relocate the turtles.

, If you were catching turtles for food, you should kill the turtles shortly after capture. The easiest way to do so is simply beheading the turtle with a sharp hunting knife. You can get a turtle to protrude its head by applying pressure to the back of a turtle's shell. Then, make a quick and clean cut to remove the head fast. Make sure to wear gloves during this process to protect yourself if the turtle resists.From here, turn the turtle on its back. Cut off each leg. Then, make a cut through the skin or shell that's holding the top and bottom shell together.Place the turtle in boiling water for 10 minutes. This should cause the two shells to separate.Once the shell is gone, you can get to the turtle meat. You can usually get about four even quarters of meat from the fleshy area near the upper shell. If you want to preserve the ribs for a dish like tenderloin, you can cut them away from the rest of the body using a hatchet., Capturing turtles, whether for relocation or food, may be illegal in some states. Make sure to check with your state's Department of Natural Resources, which can be found through your state's government website. If you cannot find any precise rules about turtle capture through the DNR website, there should be a number to call somewhere on the site. You want to make sure capturing turtles is legal before doing so to avoid fines.

, Turtles can bite and scratch when agitated. Wear thick protective gloves throughout the entire process of handling a turtle to avoid injury.


In the event you are injured by a turtle, wash the wound in soap and water and then seek medical care. While many turtle wounds can be addressed at home, it's a good idea to be safe. See a doctor shortly after being injured to make sure you don't need stitches or other medical care.

, In some areas, smaller pet turtles can carry salmonella. This is usually turtles with shells less than 4 inches long. While salmonella has only been found in pet turtles in the United States, it may be a good idea to play it safe. Discard any small turtles you capture rather than relocating them or preparing them for food."

There are plenty of unwanted reptiles who need a good home. Don't give your trade to pet stores, especially since some obtain turtles through increasingly illegal ""harvesting"" or poaching on wetlands and other turtle habitats.Pet stores almost exclusively sell turtles captured from their natural habitats, and you should look for breeders and dealers instead on reputable websites, or check out rescue organizations that have turtles that need good homes.;
, You can do this by asking around at reptile societies or searching on the Internet. Most vets don't know much about reptiles or other ""exotics"" because most of their training is concentrated on mammals. Avoid going to an average non-reptile vet when your turtle is in trouble. Dogs and cats from the ""bread and butter"" of a veterinary practice so a vet with a lot of knowledge about reptiles has accumulated it as a ""labor of love"" and is worth his or her weight in gold. Visit your vet once a year when it is healthy or when you think it is sick.

, There are benefits for doing both. If you care for your turtle indoors, you can keep it in a large glass aquarium, which may be easier to maintain. If you care for it outdoors, you may need to make a large wooden enclosure for it (or to buy one). Indoor care is easier because you won't have to go outdoors or worry about things like temperature or other animals or elements that may affect your turtle. However, turtles are used to being in the wild and may be a little happier outdoors.Even if you decide to care for your turtle outdoors, you should not let it have the run of your back lawn. This is simply too dangerous and will make the turtle prone to attack by other animals.

, Make the turtle enclosure a minimum of 4 feet (1.2 m) by 6 feet (1.8 m) for one box turtle; bigger for more. Use smooth-sided wooden planks about 12 inches (30.5 cm) in width. At the top of each corner, attach a triangular piece of wood that connects to each side. This will provide extra stability to your walls, and provide a ""lip"" over which a turtle can't climb. They always try to climb out at the corners!

, If you want to go the glass aquarium route, then you should get a shallow aquarium that is at least 40 gallons (151.4 L) large. You can also make a cage of plywood or concrete as well. The walls should be adequately high so the turtle does not crawl out. If they are high enough -- at least two feet -- then you don't need a lid. If you do have a lid, make sure there is ventilation so the turtle can breathe. Instead of the glass aquarium, you can also try for a Rubbermaid tub. These tubs and wooden boxes can be better because the sides are opaque, so your turtle won't get scared or stressed out by all of the activity he sees in the room he's in.Line the bottom of the cage with bedding such as sand and soil or wood chips mixed with peat moss. This is known as a humid substrate. If the substrate is drier, then your poor turtle's skin can crack.
Have a 75-100 watt incandescent bulb with a reflector at one end of the cage. Turtles need light to keep warm. If your room is normally 75-80 degrees, then you may not need the bulb, but put the cage near a window so the turtle gets some sunlight for at least 2-6 hours a day, while always having the option of getting out of it.
Tanks can be harder to clean than wooden enclosures, so be diligent when it's cleaning time.

, The substrate is what should be on the bottom of the enclosure, and it should give your turtle the humidity and care that he needs. For outdoor turtles, you can use a mixture of topsoil and leaves, making sure that your turtle has a place to dig into and to hide in, and that there is enough soil for hibernation. You'll have to replace the soil around the wading pool as it becomes wet, preventing danger of frost. For indoor turtles, you can use plain rabbit pellets and mix the substrate daily to keep it aired. You can also use wood chips or reptile substrate if you don't want to make your own.Make sure to mist the enclosure daily to keep your turtle moist.
Some swear by the mixture, ""Bed a Beast,"" while others warn against it. Talk to a veterinarian or turtle carer before you make this decision.

, Whether you are caring for your box turtle indoors or outdoors, it's important to keep its environment clean. You have to be diligent about cleaning its bedding at last once a week, cleaning its water bowl daily, and then cleaning the entire cage once a month, using dish washing soap mixed with a few drops of bleach (just make sure the soap is ammonia free). Remove the turtle before cleaning and make sure that the soap mixture is completely gone before you put the turtle back so the chemicals in the soap or bleach do not harm him. If you use bleach and you don't dry it, it might die.

, Fill his enclosure with edible plants like mint, common grass, or cooking herbs like thyme or chives. Make it an adventure playground with small logs to climb, flower pots to hide in, rocks to bask on, and of course a water bowl to soak in and drink from. Part of the enclosure must get direct sun (especially in the early morning for your turtle to bask in and warm up so he'll feel like eating) and part must have shade. Turtles appreciate a pile of cut grass that you dampen daily; they will like to burrow down and sleep there.


You can do this whether you are caring for your turtle outdoors or indoors.

, These turtles love wading in water, so make sure to have a little pool of water for your turtle to play in. Clean the water daily. If the turtle is indoors, then you should place it in the water every day to keep it from feeling too dry. They aren't the world's greatest swimmers, but if they are in an outdoor environment, then you should make a larger pond for them to swim in. Some love to swim in them for over an hour each day while others just prefer to wade -- they're like people.


Make sure to keep the water warm.
The water area should have an easy exit.
Put the water in a dish, pan, glass, or bowl, making sure it is at least 2"" deep, deep enough for the turtle to fully enter, but not so deep that it struggles to swim.

, Adult turtles need to eat at least 3 or more times a week while young turtles must eat regularly. Turtles should be fed in the morning, and they need to eat a mixture of fruits, vegetables, and protein (50-75% of a young turtle's diet should be made up of protein; 10-20% for grown turtles). All fruits should be washed or chopped. You also need to make sure your turtle gets plenty of Vitamin A. Here are some foods that turtle love to eat:



Protein: snails, slugs, grasshoppers, earthworms, crickets, baby mice, canned dog food, wax worms, cicadas, or sowbugs.

Fruits: tomatoes, grapes, mangoes, melons, figs, pears, strawberries, plums, nectarines, raspberries, and apples.

Vegetables: kale, cabbage, spinach, red leaf lettuce, bok choy, pak choi, sweet potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, dandelions, and squash.

Foods with Vitamin A: whole mice, yellow vegetables, dark leafy greens, food dusted with calcium carbonate, lactate, citrate, or gluconate (do this every 2-4 weeks if the turtle isn't getting enough foods with Vitamin A already).

Know what to do if your turtle is stubborn and won't eat. Try feeding him or her bright, red, yellow, or orange foods, or live animals to stimulate his interest. Feed the turtles when they are the most active, which should be in the early morning or the late afternoon. You can also try misting the cage a bit with water before feeding.



, Your turtle needs some direct sunlight to metabolize Vitamin D3 and to avoid calcium deficiencies. The light won't be effective if it just passes through glass. It's recommended that your turtle gets full spectrum lighting for at least 12-14 hours a day along with other light/heat sources. The indoor enclosure should not get colder than 60°F (15°C) and should be around 70-80°F during the day (21-27°C).Turn off any lights at night, but provide extra heat from heat tape or heating pads if it is necessary.

, If your turtle is sick, then you need to be able to recognize his illness as soon as possible so you can take him to the vet. Here are some things to look out for:


Changes in his eating or behavior for more than 2 weeks
Gray or whitish areas on the turtle's shell or skin
A softening of the shell
A dry or flaky shell
Dry, flaky, or transparent skin
Skin with a red tinge
Discharge from the nose
Swellings or lumps, especially over the ear
Foam or discharge from sides of the mouth

, Your box turtle will want to hibernate during the approximately four to six months of cold weather, depending upon where you live. Get your turtle a checkup from your experienced reptile vet beforehand. Your vet is the best one to clear up all your hibernation questions. Make sure your turtle is protected from harm and that his water stays warm during this period., Turtles don't like a lot of handling, but you can still build a relationship with your turtle without trying to cuddle it. Turtles can bite if they are unhappy, and those bites can really hurt! If you're quiet and careful around your turtle, he will trust and love you. Come to feed him at the same time, and soon enough, you'll build up a routine and your favorite scaly critter will be waiting for you. The more you get to know each other, the stronger your relationship will be.


If you must pick him up, don't let his little legs flail away in empty space. Put one hand under his feet so he'll feel secure. Ideally, just have fun watching your box turtle hunt from afar. She will usually be most active in the morning and around sunset.
Sometimes, they like to eat from a spoon, but don't make the turtle dependent on that.
If you have an indoor turtle, take it outdoors on nice days. But make sure you put it in an outdoor enclosure and keep an eye on it, because they can run fast! This should excite your turtle, but make sure it doesn't get anxious by the change.
Wash your hands before and after handling your turtle, or your turtle's dishes. Keep yourself and your turtle happy and germ-free.

Locate the turtle.,
Dig a hole near the turtle.,
Line the trap with bait.,
Wait for a turtle to enter the trap.,
Remove the turtle from the trap.,
Relocate the turtle to a suitable habitat.",How to Catch a Turtle1," If you are trying to remove one from your pool or pond, then you obviously know where the turtle is already. If you are just looking to catch a turtle in the wild, you can normally find one around smaller ponds that are damp with plenty of hiding spots and rocks. If the water is down slightly, you will probably find the most success on the very edge of the water, if possible.


It's best to leave a turtle in its natural habitat instead of taking it home to be your pet. If it seems happy where it lives, just leave it there. If you are concerned about its well being, you may want to consider contacting your local fish and wildlife department about what to do.;
, The hole should be about ten inches deep, and ten inches across, with very steep sides. The shape of the hole does not matter, as long as it's plenty deep and accessible to the turtle.


Do not dig the hole more than 11 inches deep. The fall into a hole that deep could severely hurt the turtle.
You can also purchase a pre-made trap. There are a wide variety of manufacturers, many of whom are just private citizens who have devised their own unique trap designs.

, Most turtles enjoy leafy green vegetables and small insects, but you can experiment with a variety of different foods. Place a good amount of bait in the trap, especially if you plan on leaving the trap for a day and coming back later.


Different types of turtles eat different things.Turtles are even known to be scavengers, eating the remains of other dead animals, so you can use small pieces of raw meat to catch certain types of turtles.Don't forget to set up bait around the trap as well. Place enough around the trap that the turtle will notice it, but it won't fill it up before it gets to the bait in the trap. A shredded lettuce leaf with the bits scattered all around the trap works well.

, Let it eat the bait leading up to the trap, allowing it to continue until it falls in the hole or enters the trap.


If the turtle ignores or doesn't notice the food, approach quietly behind it, and give it a quick tap on the tail with a small stick. This will, more than likely, startle the turtle, causing it to run forward, right into the hole.
If you have other things to do and are tired of waiting for the turtle to enter the trap, consider just leaving the trap for a while. It may take more than one attempt, as other things may eat the bait, but you will eventually catch the turtle.

, Grip it lightly around the middle, making sure to keep your fingers away from the turtle's limbs.


Turtles have large claws that can scratch surprisingly hard and many are powerful biters, so be careful.
If you don't want to touch the turtle you can scoop it out of the hole in the ground with a bucket or shovel. If you are using a pre-made trap, you will simply need to pick up the trap to relocate the turtle.

, Before you catch a turtle research what kind of turtles are native to your area. Some turtles are harmless and should simply be relocated nearby. Other turtles are considered invasive species and should be dealt with by your local fish and wildlife department. Identify which type of turtle you have trapped and act accordingly.

Recall how you first met the girl.,
Establish contact.,
Craft the right message.,
Determine a contact time.,
Consider establishing a link on social media.,

Reply on schedule.,
Arrange regular visits.,
Give gifts on holidays.,
Know when to back off.",How to Get to Know a Girl You Don't See Regularly," This may be difficult depending how much time has passed, but it can help and will be useful to reference in later steps.


Did you meet at school, work, on a playing field, etc...?
Did you have a casual conversation at length? Just say hi?
Did you exchange any contact information? If so, where have you stored this information? If not, can you recover the information some other way?;
, There are a number of ways to find people online if you have lost their contact information. But whether you have kept the girl's information or not, you need to proceed cautiously.


If you have completely lost the girl's information, consider doing a search on people finder pages. Some are free, some are not so be careful. Some can even be scams.
If you have her phone number, consider a call/text during a reasonable time of day such as middle of the afternoon or early evening. In other words, don't call during the middle of the night or early morning when you are likely to disturb a person's sleep or regular routine.If you have her e-mail address, make sure you are sending her a message from an account that is using your regular name and is an account you check often. Ensure any spam filters aren't going to reject messages from her account.
In the event you are using regular paper-mail to contact her, make sure you have the address correct on the envelope and proper postage. A clerk at your local post office can verify both.

, Using the memory of the first meeting is helpful for this.

Reminding the girl of the meeting will not only help her memory of you, but ideally, give the two of you something in common to discuss.
However you phrase the message, be respectful and consider that the girl may not remember you at all. This is someone who does not see you often either.
You may want to wait for a response before asking for further contact. This way you can be sure you have the correct contact information and give the both of you time to consider if you want to pursue further encounters.
If further contact is desired by both the girl and yourself, suggest a neutral place for the two of you to meet in person if physical distance is not an issue--like a coffee shop or bookstore. Some place public where you can talk without feeling isolated. If distance is an issue, then you may suggest an online chat session.

, You may not stick to this exactly, but it may be a good guide.


Since the girl and you know that you don't see each other often, ask if she wants to set up a regular contact time. This can be once a day, every other day, once a week, etc...
You should consider working this around your respective schedules--work, school, family obligations--so you know you both won't be disturbed during these periods.
If you both are strict about making these times, have a ""rain check"" plan so you can meet at other times if your scheduled time is missed. Consider that learning each other's schedules is an opportunity to get to know each other better.

, Given modern technological abilities, this is a useful option.


Ask the girl which social media services she uses and if she's willing to include you as a friend/follower on them--you can make the same offer to her.
These sites can share a lot of personal information, photos, videos, etc...,--and from others in the girl's and your circle of family and friends--so be sure it is something you are willing to participate in. Do not be alarmed if she refuses or is reluctant at first.
If she agrees, be courteous about protecting what she shares with you.
Ask permission about sharing anything she shares with you.

, After your initial meeting, any amount of time may have passed, so take some time to catch up with the girl.

Don't make this an interrogation, keep things cordial.
Consider that there will be matters you both will not want to share with the other.
Ask about the basics--job, school, family, see where this leads. But don't press if either of you are getting upset.

, Ask about similar interests, including movies, television shows, books, music, craft hobbies, nature/outdoors, or sports. Find a common bond and work to strengthen it.


Compare travel habits and find out if you've done any globe-trotting in the same areas.
Keep in mind some of these ideas for activities you two might engage in together. Consider casually suggesting something like going to a sporting event or concert in the future. You don't have to mention a specific one, and if either of you mentions this and feels uneasy about it--back off the idea for the time being.

, If and when the idea of a meeting is back up for discussion, recall the neutral location idea.


As this is not intended to be an intimate setting, a further relationship shouldn't be assumed.
Use polite greetings, you don't need to be overly formal, but asking about how she's been and her family, etc... are good ways to start. Remember, this is someone you don't see often and vice-versa. So she may ask the same things about you.
If this is a coffee shop/restaurant setting, you can offer to pay for her. If she insists that you don't, remember this is not a formal date and do not press too much.

, You want this to be pleasant for the both of you, and lead to further communications.


Relax, let this be a casual setting for the both of you.
Try not to interrupt.
You can bring up some of the things you have in common or even the first encounter you discussed in your earlier communications if it helps break the ice.
As long as it's not ""off limits"" you might discuss your family histories, friends.
Some sample greetings/questions might include, ""It has been a while, how have your parents been?"" ; ""Hi, remember me from..."" (and include the event that brought you together the first time immediately) ; ""Good afternoon! I haven't seen you since..."" (and use the event or time since you last met). Essentially, be familiar and memorable to put you both at ease.
If things go well, set up a time and place for a next meeting.

, If the girl is interested in something more participatory like a concert, sporting event, etc..., plan this at your face-to-face meeting.


Determine the details of the event you want to go to, dates, cost, transportation, lodging, etc...
Figure out if either of you are going to be bringing other family and friends along. This does not necessarily hinder your ability to get to know the girl. Others could be a distraction, but as they are a part of your life and hers, either of you may be interested in getting to know the other's extended circle of relations.

, Recall your first encounter with the girl and how you may or may not have kept her contact information. Don't risk this.


Save her phone number(s), email addresses, online screen-names, etc... in your account contact lists and a back-up file.
Identity theft is always a risk, so make sure wherever you are saving this information is secure--free of viruses, spyware.
Don't share her information without her express permission.
Your identity needs protecting too, so make sure the girl has the same understanding.

, This works with the regular communication and meeting times to ensure you don't lose contact. Since you and the girl don't see each other often normally, this is essential.


While there is not a rule that the girl and you have to follow these times, it is helpful to remind each other that you wish to stay in touch often since you don't have a routine daily encounter otherwise.
You both may consider setting electronic reminders to send messages to each other or special alerts/chimes when the girl and you call, text, or email each other.

, Don't let large spans of time pass between seeing each other if physical visits are practical. Since you don't see each other on a daily basis, you need to create the chances to meet.


If you and the girl are cross-country from each other, perhaps a couple of times per year would work.
If the two of you are not far in distance, then more frequent visits and shared activities may not be out of the question.

, This is a great opportunity to create a positive bond among the girl and yourself--and perhaps her family and friends too.


Set reminders for her birthday, major holidays (take into account any faith-based ones she may observe), and other occasions she may have brought up.
Make sure to thank her for any occasions she celebrates on your behalf. Thank her with a card, a small token-gift, or something else you think would be appropriate for the occasion.
Consider actually planning meetings with her on these occasions as a common activity.

, Moderation is a good word to know with these steps. However much communication this girl may want, you should be aware when you need to not push things further and stress her out

Pay attention to her tone in communications. If she seems annoyed, irritable at you--consider that your attention may be unwanted.
If you need a cooling off period, withdraw politely and wait a few days, maybe a couple of weeks before attempting communication again. She may ask you for more time, if so, honor that request.
If you notice a more serious problem and suspect that there is a cause other than your communications, you might want to make some discreet inquiries to see if there is a mental health issue at work. But this determination should ultimately be made by a doctor.

Have an experienced reptile veterinarian give your turtle a check-up at least once a year.,
If your turtle is outdoors in a place where they are native to, you can let your turtle hibernate, though it's not recommended.",How to Care for an Eastern Box Turtle," A minimum size for a box turtle habitat is 20 gallons. Bigger is always better, and a turtle will not only grow to the size of its cage. If you cannot afford a glass aquarium, a 30 gallon Rubbermaid tote can make an excellent home.
, The substrate for an eastern box turtle home should hold humidity well and be at least 6 inches deep so they can burrow. Eco Earth, sphagnum moss, peat moss, and fertilizer-free, organic potting soil are all good choices. Keep the substrate moist by misting it daily, but don't turn it into a swamp!, You should have two hides, one for the warmer side of the enclosure, and one for the cool side. They should be big enough for the turtle to enter and exit comfortably, with about one inch of clearance on all sides. Decorations are not necessary, but they make the enclosure look better. You can decorate with rocks, sticks, or herbs for an edible decoration. Make sure you don't inhibit your turtle's movement, though! You should make room for a food and water dish and a large pool for soaking and drinking, too., You should have a heat lamp and a UVB lamp hung over the cage so your turtle can thermoregulate and synthesize vitamin D3 and calcium. Be sure to add a large, flat rock for basking. The heat lamp should be a spot lamp on one side of the cage so the other side is cooler. The wattage should be around 75 and the basking rock should be no more than 90 degrees Fahrenheit., You can get your turtle online, but that can be risky. You can buy it from a pet store, but you should only buy from a quality store. You shouldn't take a turtle from the wild, and in many states it is illegal. The best place to get a turtle is a breeder or an animal shelter., It should have no discharge from the nose or eyes, no parasites such as mites or ticks, and it should feel heavy in your hand. You should buy or rescue a turtle that is captive bred and eats well., The facility should be clean, and the enclosures should be fresh and should not smell or have feces or uneaten food lying everywhere., You can feed your turtle romaine dusted with calcium and super worms every other day. Sometimes you might add a strawberry or a piece of banana. Some turtles, especially hatchlings, will refuse to eat veggies. You should feed hatchlings a high protein diet, so eating greens aren't as important for them., It is normal for your turtle to refuse to eat for a few weeks when he is just adjusting to its new home. Still offer food during this time, and if it doesn't eat for more than three weeks, alert your veterinarian in case he has worms or a similar intestinal disease., Don't overdose! Also, sprinkle the salads with cod liver oil and grated carrots for vitamin A once or twice a week., Most turtles love strawberries and tomatoes! Don't give them treats like this more than twice a week, as they are high in natural sugars. Some foods that turtles can eat are romaine, mustard greens, okra, grated squash and zucchini, earthworms, super worms, sweet potatoes, and chopped, boiled chicken. These are only a few foods you can offer. You can find more complete lists elsewhere., Be sure to discuss the issue of worms. Some warning signs your turtle is sick are: rapid weight loss, discharge from the eyes or nose, listlessness, a soft shell, shell deformities, ulcers, wheezing, or refusing to eat. Take your turtle to the vet if you notice any of these signs., Unless you are breeding them, there really is no need to hibernate your turtle. If you do decide to do it, you need to know the details. Read up on How to Care for a Hibernating Turtle for more information."
"
Decide which animals will live in your tank.,
Find a large tank.,
Add a sand substrate.,
Add a place for your turtle to bask.,
Add live plants.,
Change a third of the water once per week.,
Clean the whole tank once every 2 to 4 weeks.",How to Care for a Soft Shelled Turtle1," Because soft shelled turtles can be aggressive, you should not put them in tanks with other turtles or animals. Sometimes they can live in pairs, but only with enough space and minimal bullying. It is probably best to have just one softshell turtle living in the tank.;
, Allow 5 to 10 gallons of tank for every inch of carapace (shell) length of your turtle. However, no tank is too large for a soft shelled turtle. They are active swimmers. Keep in mind how large your turtle could grow in the future. Look up the particular breed of soft shelled turtle you have or plan on getting and see how large it could potentially get. Buy a tank that will accommodate your turtle even in his later years.Many experienced turtle owners suggest getting at least a 20 gallon tank for babies and a 40 gallon tank for adults., Add a layer of river sand to the bottom of your tank. There should be enough sand such that your soft shelled turtle can immerse himself completely. The sand should be free of rocks or any objects that could scratch your turtle’s shell and cause an infection.You can buy sand at an aquarium store. It should be very high quality sand, because these turtles frequently burrow themselves in the sand. Ask a person at your pet store if you need to clean the particular type of sand before you put it in the tank., Place both natural and manmade structures into the tank, leading up to the surface of and out of the water. Your turtle should have easy access to an area where he can lie completely out of the water and under a heat lamp. Place the basking area accordingly, so that there is enough room for your turtle to lie completely out of the water. Make sure that your surfaces are not sharp and that they make it very easy for your turtle to get out of the water.You can have many successful types of basking areas. You can buy specific basking ramps or platforms at an aquarium store. These would be a safe choice for your turtle. You could also purchase a rock or a log to put in your aquarium, once your turtle is more acclimated to the tank. Just make sure that the surface is smooth and will not scratch your turtle as he climbs onto it.
Basking is necessary for your turtle’s health. Make sure that his basking space is inviting and easily accessible! Put your basking area on a really gentle incline, so that your turtle has a really easy time climbing up to bask.
Watch your turtle for extended periods of time, checking in on him frequently, to ensure that he’s actually using the basking space. If he’s not, he could develop a host of medical issues.

, Live plants are also very important in your tank. They will help oxygenate your water and give your turtle a little more scenery.The amount of plants you have will vary greatly on the size of your tank, but you should make sure that you do not have so many plants that the turtle cannot burrow under the sand. In other words, make sure that there are plants to oxygenate the water, but do not crowd them on the floor of the tank.


Soft shelled turtles might dig up the plants when they are trying to burrow. Plant live plants around the edges of the aquarium, and put soft, smooth rocks around them to prevent this uprooting. Try a Java Fern or a plant from the anubias family. Choose a plant that is hardy and does not mind being replanted., Take out a third of the water in the tank and dispose of it. Treat the new water with a dechlorinating agent before you put it into the tank. Put the water into the tank slowly, being careful not to disturb the turtle or the plants too much., You can vary this depending on the size of your tank and effectiveness of your filtration, but 2 to 4 weeks is a good estimate. While you clean your tank, put your turtle in a smaller container with some of the old water in it.Replace the sand substrate completely.
Take out all tank furnishings (everything but plants and sand). Make a solution that is one part bleach to 20 parts water, and scrub these furnishings with this solution and a toothbrush.

Assess what kind of turtle you are dealing with before you start.,
Put your fingers in water where you can see turtles nearby.,
Allow the turtle to get close.,
Quickly grab the turtle on its side.,
Enjoy looking at the turtle but don't take it home.",How to Catch a Turtle2," Catching turtles by hand with this method works best when attempting to catch small turtles.


If you want to catch a large turtle, you can probably just sneak up on it and grab it by its sides.
Beware of snapping turtles! They have long necks that can reach back and snap your fingers! It's best to just let them be.

, Wiggle your fingers around slowly. This should draw the attention of turtles, as you are mimicking the movement of insects on the surface of the water.

, However, don't let it get close enough to bite you. You will need to assess when it has gotten close enough to grab with your other hand.

, If you are afraid to pick the turtle with your hands, bring a small container to scoop it up with or you can wear gardening gloves or snow gloves so you won't get scratched or bitten.

, While it's great to get an up close look at a wild animal, don't take it out of its natural habitat permanently. Native turtle species populations, like those of many wild animals, are sadly in decline all over the world.We need to help them survive by letting them live in their natural environments.

Buy proper filtration.,
Ensure the correct air temperature.,
Ensure the correct water temperature.,
Ensure the correct temperature in the basking area.,
Add chemicals to the water, if needed.",How to Care for a Soft Shelled Turtle2," Proper filtration is extremely important for soft shelled turtles because they can get infections very easily. Consider buying the more expensive (but more effective and easier to clean) external pumps, rather than ones that are submersible inside the tanks. They are more expensive but worth it because you will get a higher quality filtration and an easier cleaning process., The air in your turtle’s room should be between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in a warm climate, you could potentially keep your turtle outside, but more likely you want to keep your turtle in a room in your house that you can heat or cool to this temperature all the time., The water temperature should be only a little bit colder than the air, between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. You may need to purchase a water heater for the water in your tank. Titanium heaters are suggested because they are more difficult to break if your turtle swims around a lot. Keep a thermometer in the water to ensure that the temperature remains between these temperatures.

, The basking area is the area completely out of the water where your turtle will leave the water to dry out and enjoy the heat of the heat lamp you provide. This area should be between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit.Put a thermometer in the basking area to make sure that the temperature is suitable.

, Go to your local pet store and find water conditioner that is suitable for turtles. The water that your turtle should live in will be free of chlorine, so find a water conditioner that dechlorinates water. Your water should also be slightly acidic and oxygenated.


To make the water more acidic, first buy a pH testing kit and test your tank’s current pH level. Your tank should only be slightly acidic, so somewhere between 6.0 and 6.5.Once you’ve tested your tank, determine if you need to make the water more acidic or more basic. From there, buy the correct kit (either for making your water more acidic or more basic) and follow the instructions on the package from there. Then, test your water again.

Feed your soft shelled turtle live bait.,
Expose your turtle to enough daily sunlight.,
Get your turtle’s beak clipped regularly by a veterinary professional.,
Watch for signs of illness.",How to Care for a Soft Shelled Turtle3," Begin by feeding your turtle exclusively live bait. You can, however, give him some catfish food or commercial reptile food after he is accustomed to his surroundings. You should sprinkle calcium supplement on all of the food you give your turtle. You should also give your turtle a multivitamin if he does not have a specially curated turtle-specific diet or eat live fish.How often you feed your turtle depends on your turtle's breed, size, and age. Ask your veterinarian for advice on how often to feed your turtle. Here’s a list of the different types of food that you can feed your soft shelled turtle:


Small fish (but not catfish or carp)
Worms
Crickets
Crayfish
Shrimp
Commercial dietsTadpoles
Mudpuppies
Snails
Molluscs
Dog food
Cooked chicken, Even if you have UV lights for your turtle, you should give your turtle between 2 and 4 hours of direct sunlight every day. Place your turtle’s tank near a window that gets about this much sunlight., Occasionally, soft shelled turtles’ beaks will overgrow. Go to your veterinarian to have his beak clipped. Ask your veterinarian at what point and how often your particular turtle should get his beak clipped., Soft shelled turtles are delicate and can develop a lot of medical problems. Look out for any of these signs. If you see any of these symptoms, bring your turtle to the vet for further care.


Infected lacerations on the skin or shell
Discoloration of the skin or shell
Raspy breath or wheezing
Swollen limbs
Fungus
General unresponsivenessClosed or swollen eyes
Loss of appetite
Runny nose and eyes
Look online for common health problems in your specific breed of turtle. Different types of soft shelled turtles can develop some different health issues.

Offer your helping hand, if needed.,
Shake up your usual conversations.,
Surprise him or her with something.,
Expect to be a priority.",How to Get Your Friend to Pay More Attention to You1," Find a way that you can make a positive contribution to your friend’s life. Doing this may help the person pay more attention to you. Create a sense of community or even family with this friend. Being able to find ways to help a friend out also establishes a relationship based on the need to give and take from the friendship instead of just taking all of the time.Offering to help a friend out in a role that establishes you as an expert can also lend to your credibility and improve the level of attention you get in the future from this friend. For example, if you are really good at math, offer to help with homework, and show your friend how useful your math skills are. Knowing that you are the best person to turn to for math help will probably increase the amount of attention you get from this friend beyond just math homework as well.;
, Instead of talking about the same old things, look for some new and interesting topics to discuss with your pal. If you always talk about the same thing you make it too easy for others to ignore or even predict what you are going to say. Keep a little bit of mystery in what you talk about or parts of you that you share with friends. That way, they will be sure to listen as to not miss a thing.In the same vein, take the time to really listen to the interests of your friends so you can contribute in a meaningful way in conversations about subjects they like. Most people enjoy knowing that they are truly being heard and appreciated.

, You can surprise your friend with anything—a gift, a gathering or a lunch date out. This does not need to cost a lot of money either. The point is not to buy their affection. Instead, you are making it a point to show that your friend is special to you.A thoughtful gift can actually be free or cost very little, but still carry a lot of meaning. Show your friend you listen to what they talk about by remembering a special day or even just sending them a new song from a favorite artist. Again, it’s the thought behind the gesture not a price tag or dollar amount that matters.

, Act like you deserve attention and maybe your friend will pay you in kind. Make sure your friend knows you want to spend time with them. Put in the work to be a true friend and make it known that you expect that to be returned to you as well.Make a commitment to yourself to not settle for anything less than being a priority in your friend’s life. You have to believe you are deserving of this type of connection and love.

Get a good-sized aquarium.,
Buy some decorations.,
Get a heater to heat the water, if your species needs it.,
Provide a basking rock.,
Provide a heat lamp.,
Provide a UVA/UVB light.,
Provide variety in their diet.,
Feed your turtle as much as it can eat in 10-15 minutes once every 1-2 days.,
Provide calcium.,
Get a very good filter running at all times in your aquarium.,
Clean your aquarium every 3-4 weeks.",How to Care for Swimming Turtles," Generally, for every inch of the turtle's shell 10 gallons (37.9 L) of water for the aquarium is needed. For example, if you got a 5 inch (12.7 cm) turtle, you would need at least a 50 gallon (190 L) aquarium. Aquariums are expensive!;
, Your turtle will need some decorations in their aquarium so he/she won't get bored! Turtles love to play with decorations. Don't get anything that takes up too much space in the aquarium, or the turtle won't have as much space to swim.

, Place it in your tank and set the heater for whatever the normal temperature of your species of turtle needs.

, Your turtle needs a place where it can get fully out of the water. It is extremely important, because otherwise your turtles shell will rot! You can buy a basking platform at pet stores, and place it in your tank. Make sure it is completely out of the water, and that your turtle can easily get on the platform.

, Your turtle will need a heat lamp to be able to properly bask. Depending on the species of turtle you get, the hotter/cooler the basking area will need to be. Place the lamp so that the heat is shining over the basking area.

, It helps take care of their shell, by providing rays from the sunlight. Place it over your tank, just like the heat lamp, except you can put it wherever you would like.

, Most turtles enjoy live crickets and worms. They can also live on traditional turtle food that are pellets. They also enjoy vegetables such as lettuce. Research your turtle before giving certain foods!

, Make sure you do not overfeed your turtle, or it will grow too big for its shell!

, It is good for their shells. You can buy them calcium sticks and put it in their tank for them to eat.

, You should get a filter that is 2-3 times more powerful than needed, because turtles are very messy.

, Do not do a full water change! Only change out most of the water. You will need to rinse off the tank, basking area, and any other decorations in your tank. You will also need to clean out your filter, and replace any parts of the filter if needed.

Be assertive and direct.,
Discuss boundaries for future interactions.,
Maintain kindness and respect.,
Tell your other friends.,
Follow through with boundaries.,
Be gentle with yourself.,
Remember why you ended the friendship.",How to Get Rid of a Friend Who Is Not Trustworthy," It might feel infinitely easier to end this friendship via text, or Facebook, or an email. However, in order to honor the friendship you once shared and to be clear about your intentions of ending the friendship, plan to meet your friend in person to talk if you live in the same city.Call your friend up on the phone and say: “Hi Jane, I’ve been doing some thinking about what has been going on between us lately. Would you be able to meet for coffee sometime this week to talk?”
Ask your friend to meet in a neutral and public space. If you are concerned about how your friend might react, meeting in a place that’s public and neutral will hopefully allow the conversation to stay civil.;
, You don’t necessarily have to write out an entire script for your conversation, but making a bulleted list of all of the feelings you have been experiencing and the specific behaviors that have led to your decision may help ease your nerves about the impending conversation.


On the list, include the “facts,” or the specific behaviors or situations that have led you to want to end the friendship. For example, perhaps your friend broke a promise to you, or betrayed your trust by revealing something you told them in confidence. Write out all of these instances to include them in conversation if necessary.Also include specific points you would like to make that support your argument and embody empathy. For example, you might want to emphasize how much the friendship has meant to you in the past, or you might try telling them your values in regards to friendships, such as honesty, trust, and open communication., Find another friend or a family member (preferably someone who does not know the friend you are going to be talking to) with whom you can practice this conversation. Ensure that you are confident in how to communicate your feelings and that you have specific behaviors you would like to emphasize that have led to your decision.Say to a friend: “I have decided that I need to talk to my good friend about ending our friendship because I do not feel like I can trust them. I have some talking points planned, and I was wondering if I could practice the conversation with you? It would really help ease my nerves, and I would really appreciate your feedback.”

, While it is not recommended to end the friendship through a phone or computer, certain situations might call for it.


One example is that you and your friend might only communicate through text message, and therefore it might not feel strange or passive aggressive to end the friendship this way. You know your relationship best, and if this feels natural to you, go for it. However, if it feels hurtful or evasive, reconsider other methods.In more extreme cases, you may not feel like you can see the person face to face. If your friend has done something truly egregious, email might be a healthier way to facilitate the ending of the friendship so an in-person meeting does not escalate.

, This friend has clearly hurt you, and your first inclination might be to tell them all the ways in which they have betrayed you. In order to end the friendship in a healthy way though, make it clear that you are ending the friendship because of how you are feeling, and not because of their personal characteristics.You might say: “When I heard that you had talked to Sue about my divorce, I felt betrayed and hurt, because I didn’t want that information shared with anyone just yet. I am not sure I can continue in this friendship because I do not feel like I will be able to trust in this relationship anymore.”

, These should emphasize your feelings in reaction to situations that have hurt you or made you feel like you cannot trust your friend. Say something like: “I want to end our friendship even though I have valued the time we’ve had together” instead of “You totally screwed up our friendship when you lied and stabbed me in the back!”, If your decision to end the friendship is surprising to your friend, they might want specific examples of when they betrayed your trust. Remember to focus on the particular behavior or situations that contributed to your decisions rather than admonishing your friend as a person.Say something like: “I know you’re curious about why I’m ending our friendship. A couple things have happened lately that have made me question my trust in our relationship. The most significant one was that I found out that you had told Sarah personal details about some of my recent struggles that I was hoping we could keep between us. I am struggling to feel safe and respected after this.”

, In a difficult conversation, it is common to either act out aggressively or shut down emotionally. However, achieving a middle ground and being direct and assertive throughout the conversation will allow you to address the important issues in a clear and non-defensive manner.If your friend reacts negatively to your concerns you can say: “I hear your frustration and anger right now. I am making this decision to respect myself and my needs, and I am not doing this to hurt you or attack you.”

, You and your friend might share a larger friend group, you might work together, or you might be a part of an extracurricular group together. Therefore, future interactions could prove to be awkward or tense. Be clear about your intentions for these interactions and ask your friend about theirs.You could say something like: “I know we’ll continue to see each other at book club. My goal is to continue our relationship in this context and be cordial and respectful to you while I’m in that environment. However, I would appreciate if we did not have any outside contact. How does that sound to you?”

, Betrayal in a relationship can elicit several negative emotions, such as anger, shame, and sadness. When you finally meet your friend in person, remind yourself that verbally attacking them will be counterproductive to your goal and disrespectful to your friend. While you may not want to continue the friendship, they were your friend once, and you will likely feel better about your decision if the ending is amicable.In order to be kind yet firm in the conversation, you might say: “Tom, I am truly sad that our friendship is ending, but I hope you know that I’m making a decision that is best for me. I wish you nothing but the best as you move forward in your life.”

, If you and your friend have a larger group of shared friends, it will be helpful to be honest with them about what has happened. When you are telling your friends though, try to only talk about your side of the story and again focus on your feelings, rather than the shortcomings of the other person. This person is still a friend of the larger group, and you want to be respectful by not bad mouthing them to others.A helpful way to tell your friends might be: “Hey everyone, I just wanted to let you know that Jenny and I are going our separate ways. We’ve had a good friendship, but we’re just not seeing eye to eye anymore. I’d rather not go into the specifics about what happened, but I’m hoping that I can still remain friends with all of you.”

, Just like a romantic relationship, it might feel easy to fall into old patterns with your friend. You might start to feel like you can trust them again because they have been kind to you since your conversation about ending the friendship. However, remind yourself of the boundaries that you set and stick to them.If your friend asks you to hang out you could say: “I know that when we’ve seen each other at work, we’ve been friendly with each other, but I think it’s best if we keep the boundaries we discussed in our conversation. I still feel betrayed and want to respect the ending of our friendship.”

, The ending of a friendship is likely to be hard on you. After the conversation, you might feel an array of emotions. You might even feel the urge to call your friend and tell them you would like to try again.


Feel all your feelings. The conversation with your friend may go well, but it could also be difficult, contentious, and your friend might say some things to you that are hurtful. If you find yourself feeling angry or sad after the conversation, accept and experience those emotions, because it is very normal to feel them., It can be tempting to ruminate on the end of the friendship or to actually miss your friend. However, it will be important that you remember that you assessed this situation, decided to end the friendship, and you took specific actions that you believed would help you move forward."

Spend some time apart and don’t call as often.,
Make some other friends.,
Get a hobby.,
Do something your friend would never do with you.",How to Get Your Friend to Pay More Attention to You2," Giving your friend some space may win you more attention in the long run. You can get to a point where you have made yourself so available that you become disposable. Maybe your friend knows you are always 100% accessible so they don't value your presence as much.If you are always sitting by the phone waiting for the friend to call, they may not feel the need to respect your time. You may need to step back from trying to spend as much time together as possible and find other activities to fill your schedule.

, If you have doubts about your friendship, make new friends to explore what types of friends work out best for you. Admit that you need attention from friends and find new friends that are willing to give you what you need. Fine tune your skills in being a good friend in return as well.Make space in your schedule for other friends. In addition, set boundaries about your availability to this friend so that they understand you have obligations to others. Doing this can help to make your time more valuable to this friend.

, Find something you can share with others or do on your own to fill your calendar. Sharing an interest and finding a friend who is an expert in the new hobby/activity can start a solid new friendship. Take this time to practice listening and learning as new friends talk about themselves and the interest. People like to talk about themselves and appreciate the sincere attention.It is also a good idea to find an activity that you can do alone. Not only does this allow you to foster growth in other areas of life, but it does not leave you dependent on anyone else for enjoyment.

, This does not mean doing something dangerous or illegal; it is more like opening yourself up to a new challenge in the name of mixing things up.Challenge how your friend defines you by exploring an interest they wouldn’t expect you to do or wouldn’t want to do. Join a new club at school just for the experience and to make new friends. Keep some of your life a mystery from this friend so you pique ongoing interest.
Keeping a little mystery in your friendship can gather a great deal of attention from a relationship that may otherwise become stale.

Confront your friends about their lack of attention.,
Use “I” statements to show how you feel about being ignored.,
Decide if you are putting more into the relationship than your friend.,
Weigh the pros and cons of this friendship.",How to Get Your Friend to Pay More Attention to You3," Own your feelings and tell your friend how you are feeling as a result of not spending time together. Instead of launching into a complaint session or accusing your friends of not caring, explain to them that you have noticed you are no longer spending time together and explain how this makes you upset.Be specific about what you have noticed. For example, if you are used to eating lunch together every day and that suddenly changes, let the friend know you miss them. If the time you are missing is no longer possible, offer ways to fill the void.
Say something like “I’ve really missed you at lunch the past couple days. I feel like I never see you. How about we make plans for the weekend?”

, Frame your concerns in a way that avoid blame and make your feelings very clear to your friend. Instead of blaming your friend for ignoring you and lashing out because they found new friends, remind them how much you value your friendship.Instead of telling your friend how awful of a friend they are, tell them “I really miss you. It makes me sad that we aren’t spending time together like we used to.”

, Not every friendship will remain equal at all times but there should be give and take from both of you. Do you feel like you are getting your needs for friendship met? Are your needs realistic? Everyone has a need to talk about themselves. Does this occur with your friend or are the conversation topics always about them?Friendships can change over time. It is up to you to evaluate how much you should put into any given friendship over time. Just because you share a history with a friend does not mean you have to settle for a relationship that you are not happy in.

, Make plans to resolve the current problems while still honoring the friendship. If your friendship overall is good but you have hit a bit of a rough patch lately, it is probably worth working to save the friendship. If, on the other hand, you are losing far more than you are gaining it might be time to part ways.If you do decide to step back from the friendship, this does not mean there has to be some big blow out or dramatic end to the friendship. It can be as simple as limiting the time you spend together to slowly put distance between you.

Confront the person who takes your stuff.,

Get things you can share.,
Hide your stuff.,
Get a lock.",How to Get People to Stop Using Your Stuff1," Usually, you can talk to a sibling or roommate in a more direct way when someone at school or work. Be polite and speak using nice language, but be assertive. Be reasonable and genuine when you share with them how you feel.


If someone you live with eats a special snack you bought for yourself, you could smile (not a fake, sarcastic smile!) and say, ""You know, I did buy that with my own money, and it’d be better if you could ask next time.”
You could also try saying something like, “I was saving that popcorn for when I watch a movie tonight, and now there’s none left. Please don’t eat my stuff without asking, and if you do, please replace it.”
If it’s a cosmetic product, you might say, “Hey, I’m a total germaphobe! I really don’t like sharing beauty products, so I’d really appreciate it if you wouldn’t use this.”When your sibling or roommate borrows an article of clothing without asking, you could explain to them that it makes you feel like you have no privacy when they go through your drawers or closet. Everyone has a right to their space!;
, You might've already had a conversation with the person taking your stuff, but what if they keep doing it or get mad? You can get an adult to help settle the issue without being a tattle tale, especially when the problem is really hurting your relationship with the other person.


If your sibling is the one taking your stuff, you can ask a parent to be there when you talk, to make sure no one gets upset and starts fighting.
If your college roommate is the problem, resident assistants (RA) and/or director (RD) can help you out, especially if your roommate has taken something really valuable. Don't run to your RA or RD over something small, like a candy bar!

, When you and your roommate or sibling have a talk, you might decide on some things you both can share. Go halfsies on snacks you know you’ll both enjoy. Split the cost of a can of hairspray or leave-in conditioner if you know you’ll both need a go-to product to use in a rush.Make sure that you both clearly understand what’s community property and what’s for personal use.

, If you’ve had a conversation with someone but the problem persists, you might have to hide your stuff. For example, if you've told your sister a thousand times that it bothers you when she wears your favorite necklace, don’t leave it on your dresser or out in the open. If you need something sweet after a tough day, but your roommate always robs your stash, hide your candy in a safe place.


This works best if you’re pretty sure the person won’t go searching through your stuff. You don’t want encourage them to invade your privacy even more!
Hiding something may be hard if you prefer having easy access to it. This method works best for special items of clothing or jewelry that you only wear every now and then.

, Locking things up somewhere is a great alternative to hiding, especially if hiding something will only encourage someone you live with to go through your stuff. Since it's not always the most convenient, it’s best for things like valuable jewelry, special electronics, and other expensive stuff you really don't want others messing with.


It might get even more annoying to have to unlock a safe or drawer for things you use often. Use your best judgment!

"

Tell a teacher or trusted adult.,
Don’t hang around with people who steal.,
Keep track of your things.",How to Get People to Stop Using Your Stuff2," Sometimes it could start a bigger problem if you just confront someone at school about taking your things without asking. It can be better to avoid an argument by someone older and wiser to get involved. If you have any doubts, it’s okay to go to a teacher or other trusted adult to make sure the problem gets solved fairly and without any fighting.If the person is your friend and it’s a little thing, just tell them that it hurts your feelings when they take from you.
If it's someone you’re not so friendly with, it might be better to have a teacher mediate, or help solve, the problem.

, If someone has a reputation for using other people’s stuff without asking, avoid them! Remember, when someone takes something that doesn’t belong to them without permission, it’s called stealing. If you hang out with someone who steals, you might end up in trouble yourself., Just like at home, if you don’t want someone using your stuff at school, you’d better keep it in a safe place. For example, don’t leave art supplies out if you don’t want to share them with the whole class.


If you have a locker, keep important stuff there and keep it locked.
Remember, even if you didn’t buy them yourself, books and school supplies can be very expensive. Be responsible, and don’t tempt people with your valuables by leaving them unattended.

Label your things.,
Leave a note.,
Determine when it’s a big deal.",How to Get People to Stop Using Your Stuff3," In a professional environment, sometimes you can’t run and find an adult. You are the adult! Likewise, you might not people able to confront a coworker like you would someone you share a home with, or your office environment might be so large that you can’t identify a specific culprit.


Talk to someone face-to-face when possible and appropriate, and use labels when not.
If someone routinely grabs your belongings for their own use, label your stuff. Have a personal desk fan? Grab a sharpie and write your name on its base. Try to make the label permanent when you can, so it’s not easily peeled off.
This practice also works great to avoid confusion between an item you supplied and one the company provided. Make a clear distinction between communal property and what’s for your use only. Sometimes there is an honest confusion.

, Everyone who brings a lunch to work has had a nibbler break into their goods. Leaving a note can seem futile, but it’s often worth the small effort. What’s more, when you combine it with some strategic friendliness, it can really pay off.


Clearly mark food items left in a communal fridge or kitchen cupboard. Leave a note asking people to kindly keep from eating your food. Use nice, positive language.
Every now and then, bring in an item for everyone. Leave it out with a note saying, “This is for the whole team!” When you do clearly mark what’s yours and yours alone, people will remember your generosity and respect your boundaries.

, Sometimes people outright steal property willingly and repeatedly, or even take credit for work they didn’t do. Don’t overburden your boss with little things, but if a valuable has been stolen and you have evidence showing who the thief is, you might want to bring it to his or her attention.


If that happens, or someone takes credit for your work and you feel you need to talk to a supervisor, do your best not to just complain and badmouth.
Use the opportunity to show how you want to contribute to a safe, cooperative work environment."
"
Acknowledge your feelings.,
Decide the boundaries that need to be set.,
Be direct.,
Expect the other person to be angry.",How to Get Rid of Clingy People1," Before you can set boundaries, you have to identify exactly what you are feeling. You can become so overwhelmed by the other person's actions that you are not sure how you feel.The two most common emotions you may be feeling are discomfort or resentment.How do you feel when the person intrudes on your time or your space?
How do you feel when you are around the person, but you would rather not be?
Are there specific actions (e.g showing up uninvited, calling late at night, etc.) that cause these feelings?;
, Once you have identified your specific feelings regarding the clingy person, you can develop the boundaries that you need to set. The boundaries should be specific to the actions of the person.For example, if the person calls you excessively or late at night, your boundary may be to stop answering phone calls or not answering phone calls after a certain time.
Set realistic boundaries that you will actually follow through with. Do not say that you will never talk to a person again if you know that you are not ready to take that step.
Create consequences for your boundaries as well. If the person does not do ____, what will you do?

, Communicate your boundaries to the other person. Do not talk to the person when you are angry or annoyed. Be calm and assertive as you set your boundaries. Tell the other person that you are setting the boundaries as a way to take care of yourself, not to be rude or harmful.If you are nervous about talking to the other person, write down your boundaries so that you do not forget them during the conversation.
For example, you might decide to say something like, “Sara, you know that I care about you and our friendship, and I always want to be honest with you. Lately, I have felt smothered because you call me eight times per day, so I’d like to set a boundary at only one phone call per day.""
You can also practice the conversation with a friend or family member that you trust. Have your practice partner respond as the clingy person would., When you set boundaries, you are changing the nature of the relationship with the other person. The other person will probably not like what you are doing and may become angry. Recognize that the anger is not your responsibility, but the other person's responsibility.Do not let the other person's anger change the boundaries you have set. Continue on the path you are on.
Allow the person to be angry and do not try to argue with them. For example, if the person tells you that you are being mean, rude, or selfish, do not try to explain to them how you are not any of those things.
You will not be able to have a constructive conversation with a person when anger is involved.

"
"
Be less available.,
Learn to say ""No."",
Reinforce acceptable behavior.",How to Get Rid of Clingy People2," If you have set a boundary, reinforce that boundary by being available when it feels right to you.By being less available, the person may get the idea that you are serious about your boundaries. If the person calls you, you can choose not to answer the phone call. If the person texts you about getting together, you can choose not to answer, wait a few days to text back, or tell the person again about how important your boundaries are to you via text.Next time you see the person, you don’t need to make up excuses where a simple decline will work. For example, “It’s thoughtful for you to invite me, but I’m not up for it tonight.”
There is no need to be rude, aggressive or even passive aggressive such as not answering text messages.
You may feel guilty or bad for setting boundaries with this person, but remember that you are doing this to take care of yourself.
Although continually reinforcing your boundaries in an assertive way can get tiresome and frustrating, it is important to stay true to who you are without resorting to hurtful behaviors as well as gaining the personal space that you need.

, Saying ""No"" can be difficult sometimes, but it is necessary when dealing with a clingy person. Telling a person ""No"" is easier if you offer an alternative. The alternative you offer should guide the person in a direction that is better for you.For example, if the person asks you to go to hang out, say, ""Sorry I can't. I have homework. Why don't you ask one of your other friends or family to spend time with you?""
She may complain that you said no, but stick with your answer.

, When you set boundaries and create space between you and the other person, you are actually creating new rules for the relationship, and the other person needs time to learn those rules. You want to encourage less clingy behavior and enforce consequences if your boundaries are violated. Be patient; it will take time for the other person's behavior to change.


If the person went to lunch with someone else, tell the person that you are so glad that they went and take interest in the experience.
Encourage the person to meet other people and step out of their comfort zone. Tell the person that you are proud of them for doing things like this."

Take a break.,
Have an honest conversation.,
Deal with your guilt.,
Stand by your decision.",How to Get Rid of Clingy People3," Before you decide to completely eliminate a person from your life, take a break for a trial period to see if this is really what you want to do. Tell the person that you think it would be good to take some time a part to meet new people and explore some different interests. If this is a friend, let the person know that you care about them and you still want to be friends.You may say, ""I really value our friendship and the time we spend together. I think it would be really great for both of us to spend some time a part and meet new people.""
Be kind and respectful when you have this conversation and do not place any blame on the other person. Avoid using phrases such as, ""You always,"" ""You never, or ""You can't.""
Emphasize that you think this is a good solution for both of you.

, If all else fails and you no longer want the person in your life, let the other person know. Tell the other person that you want to end the relationship and the reasons why you want to end the relationship. Be as direct as possible. This will be a difficult conversation.You may say, ""I have thought a lot about our friendship and some things have been bothering me. I want to talk to you about this.""
You may also say, ""I have to do what is best for me. I don't think we should spend time together anymore. I wish you the best in everything that you do.""
Before you have this conversation, be absolutely sure that this is what you want to do.

, You will most likely feel extremely guilty for cutting someone out of your life. Your feelings of guilt are completely normal, and it will take time for you to feel better. Take confidence in the fact that you made a well thought out decision, tried to fix the relationship with the person, and did what was best for you.Accept that people come and go from your life and nobody is perfect.Try to learn from this experience and apply it to your interactions with other people.

, It may take the person a while to come to terms with the end of the relationship. The person may still try to contact you or be around you. The person may ask to have another conversation or try to convince you to change your mind. Stick with your decision and do not give in to the other person's persistence.


If you respond to the person, you will be sending a mixed message.Responding to the person will only encourage them to contact you.
If the person calls you or texts you, you do not have to answer. You can even block the person's number so you will not know when they have reached out to you.
Remember that you have handled the situation the best that you could and have made the best decision for yourself.
You may need to remind that person that you no longer want to spend time around them or see them. Always be assertive and firm."

Create a plan for the future.",How to Get Through a Fight With a Close Friend1," Take some time to think about what exactly happened, what was said, and what the real issue is. The eventual discussion will benefit from your thoughtfulness.


Sometimes this analysis is straightforward and easy, but other times it’s not as clear-cut. For example, some fights seem to begin over a casual insult, but upon closer review, it becomes clear that this insult was merely a symptom of a greater, underlying problem. Make sure that you’re thinking deeply about the problem and questioning its causes.;
, Even if you think the conflict was caused by your friend’s wrongdoing, you should be sure to question your own part in the problem. Chances are that you aren’t entirely blameless, and your conflict will get resolved much more quickly if you acknowledge your role in the conflict.


It can help to write about your feelings in a journal and reflect on them in this way.If you have a therapist who you see regularly, bring up the conflict during your session and request their feedback.

, While it can be good to talk to disinterested parties like your parents or teachers, you should make a special effort not to discuss the conflict with friends. Even if your friends mean well, it’s easy for communication to get garbled as it passes from one person to another, and the last thing you want is for the situation to worsen while you’re taking a break.This goes for social media venting as well. Posting status updates on Facebook or heated tweeting will just further inflame the existing problem and even create new ones.If another friend asks you about your conflict, tell them you would like to talk about it but you don’t want to risk making the problem worse. If they press you, ask them to respect your decision and change the subject.

, Many times, the best way to resolve a conflict is the most direct way.Rather than catching your friend on the go, contact them with a request to meet at a specified time and date. This will ensure that both of you are prepared for the meeting and that you’ll avoid unnecessary distractions, such as stress from work or school.


In addition to thinking carefully about the time of your meeting, you should also consider the venue. Pick a neutral location like a public park or café so that neither of you feel like the other has an advantage.

, While it can be tempting to chat on outlets like Facebook, Skype, SMS, or Snapchat, try to resist the impulse. Even if neither of you says anything deliberately offensive, virtual modes of communication are notoriously susceptible to misunderstanding.It can help to make this an explicit ground rule so that you both of you are on the same page. Tell your friend you think that you should avoid contact until your meeting so that nothing gets worse in the meantime and you enter the meeting with as clean a slate as possible., Show up to your meeting on time and in a calm state of mind. Being on time shows your friend that you value their time and that yo are eager to work out your differences, and being calm will help you work through the problem without letting your emotions get in the way.If you feel worked up, try some quick de-stressing techniques like focused breathing or manipulating pressure points.If these don’t work, consider postponing your meeting, as sharp emotions can disrupt and delay an attempt at resolution.
Avoid alcohol or coffee as these substances can make you more emotionally volatile and jumpy.

, Strive to keep the conversation focused on a particular event or issue rather than aiming insults or blame at one another.Use “I-statements” to explain your side of the argument. Tell your friend how you’re feeling and what you think happened while focusing on your own actions and perceptions. This will help you to avoid sounding accusatory and aggravating the problem.For example, you want to say, “That thing you said really hurt me and I am having a hard time getting over it,” rather than, “You really hurt me and I’m having a hard time forgiving you.”
If you’re worried about staying on track, bring a “cheat sheet” to your meeting which outlines the most important points you want to cover. Remind yourself not to get derailed by bringing up past arguments or offenses.

, Just as your friend has shown you the courtesy to listen to your side, you should offer a respectful and patient ear to them. Resist the urge to interrupt or defend yourself, even if you disagree with their interpretation of events. In a fair and reciprocal exchange, you’ll both be able to air your grievances and reach a better understanding.Restate what you believe the issue is to ensure that you and your friend are on the same page. For example, you might say something like, ""Ok, so you're saying that it wasn't what I said that was hurtful, but that you are embarrassed because I said it in front of other people?""

, Part of maintaining a valuable friendship is understanding that you won’t always see eye-to-eye with your friends. In other words, the two of you are friends not because you have all the same opinions, but because you value one another as people.It can help to periodically acknowledge how much you both appreciate your friendship throughout the resolution. It’s a lot easier to discuss personal blame when you’re both consistently reaffirming that you care about one another and want to reach a resolution.

, A meaningful resolution involves apologies from both parties. This doesn’t mean that both of you are equally at fault nor that you must claim equal blame, but rather that both of you should acknowledge some blame in the creation of the problem.Don’t apologize if you will resent it later. If you apologize solely for the sake of smoothing things over, you’ll resent it later and the original issue will remain unresolved. So, rather than extending an insincere apology, take some more time to reflect on the problem before you meet again.

, Discuss with your friend how you can both strive to avoid similar problems in the future.


You can consider a wide range of options for moving forward. Just make sure that both of you are on the same page."

Take a few deep breaths and remind yourself not to react.Remember that you may not be in charge of what other people do or say, but you are in charge of your actions and reactions. Use an affirmation such as, “I choose how I respond to other people, and I choose to be peaceful right now.”;
, Let the little stuff go. Important matters should absolutely be dealt with, but not every disagreement needs to be a fight. Sometimes, people enjoy getting a reaction out of people. Don’t give in and engage the fight.Change the subject or tell your friend you don’t want to talk about that topic.
Be careful not to respond in a hostile manner. There’s a difference between saying “I’d rather not discuss that” and “Stop bringing that up!”
Sometimes, you do need to discuss things, but maybe now isn’t the time. You can say, “This is important to talk about, but I’m not in a place to engage right now, and I don’t want to say things I will regret. Can we find time to discuss it later once I’ve had some time to think and cool off?”

, Observe your body and see what you are communicating to your friend that may set off an argument. Notice your eye contact (or if you avoid eye contact), your body position, gestures and facial expressions. If you are communicating distance or hostility, chances are your friend is picking up on it and contributing to it with a verbal argument.Closed body language includes crossing arms/legs, looking away, facing your body away from someone.
Aggressive or hostile body language can include clenched teeth or fists, muscle tension, staring eyes, or restlessness., Nobody responds perfectly to conflict every time a conflict occurs. Especially if conflicts are ongoing, chances are it’s not entirely the other person’s fault and you carry some of the responsibility. It’s time to examine the way you react and how you feed into conflicts. Unhealthy ways to respond to conflict include:Inability to recognize things that matter to your friend
Angry, explosive or defensive reactions
Shaming (“I can’t believe you did that, only bad people do things like that”)
Rejecting (“I want nothing to do with you or your apologies, they mean nothing to me”)
Inability to compromise
Fear and avoidance of conflict; having a bad expectation of the outcome.

, Save everybody’s time and energy and own up to your faults. Owning your faults is not a sign of weakness, it shows that you are ready to acknowledge your role in the negative interactions and that you want to resolve the problem.Make it simple, and don’t over-explain or provide excuses. A simple, “I’m sorry I took my stress out on you. I realize I was upset that the cat ruined the curtains and I snapped at you” will do.

, Don’t let previous annoyances or disputes from the day roll into a conflict with your friend. Are you upset with your friend or are you upset about traffic delays earlier and taking your frustration out on your friend? Also, be conscious about your friend rolling his stressors onto you. Perhaps your friend feels overwhelmed with school or work or children and doesn’t have an outlet for stress. Unfortunately, people take stress out on other people. Keep it in perspective.Think about any stressors in your friend's life that may be setting him off. Then, talk about it with him, showing genuine concern.

, After gaining some perspective, have some empathy. It’s probable your friend doesn’t know how to deal with the stress he experiences, and is displacing this stress onto other people. The ability to show you understand how another person feels can be the single most powerful communication skill. It allows the person to feel heard and diffuses conflict.Having empathy does not mean you agree with their perspective, but it does mean you show your understanding of their feelings (i.e. “I can understand you felt upset by that.”)
Reflect what your friend says and feels. “I hear you saying that you feel stressed and overwhelmed. I’d feel the same if I was in your shoes. I totally get why this is a hard time for you.”

, Conflict often arises due to differing needs, or needs not being expressed sufficiently. If two people feel accepted, supported, and understood, it’s unlikely conflict will occur. Think about what underlies what your friend is expressing. Then consider ways that you may not be supporting or accepting your friend. Realize that conflicts will continue to fester until you deal with them head-on.Maybe your friend wants to spend more time together than you’ve been available to spend.
Think about ways you can support your friend. Show that you are there for him.
If you’re not sure what your friend needs, talk to him. Ask, “How can I be a better friend?”

, Approach your friend and say you'd like to discuss the negative dynamics between you. Do this is a non-confrontational way, and don't go into the discussion with a list of things you don't like about your friend; instead, remain open to resolving the conflict and hearing out your friend. Say that you care about your friendship, and don't want to engage in the perpetual conflict. It is likely that your friend feels the same way.Listen closely and let your friend express what he feels and thinks.
Be honest but also respectful. Remember, the goal is to resolve the conflict, not place blame.

, Maybe there are certain topics that you continuously fight about, such as sports teams, religion, or political parties. Decide with your friend to avoid discussing these topics together. Alert other friends close to you that these topics are off-limits and that you’d like them to respect that choice when you and your friend are together.

, Don’t close yourself off or come into a situation with your friend already feeling hostile. Make sure you feel open in your interactions, remaining positive. Foster a climate that encourages problem-solving, such as letting emotions be expressed and obtaining more information when you are unclear.Don’t meet up with your friend expecting to not get along. Instead, meet up expecting that things will go well.
Don’t be quick to disagree. Instead, take away positive things from your interactions, or redirect to more positive topics. If your friend wants to argue about climate change, say, “It means a lot that you care for the environment. I admire that about you.”

, If you notice things heating up between you and your friend, create an out. There are often precursors to disagreements that set them off, so stay alert and take note when you feel tension building. Change the subject, transition to a different topic, or tell your friend, “I’d rather not discuss this”.


If you have mutual friends, ask them to support you by interrupting with a different topic or changing the direction of the conversation.

, It doesn’t do any good to hold onto grudges. It makes you feel bad and hurts the friendship. Holding a grudge can also make you more prone to find fault in your friend, leading to more disagreements. Learn to forgive your friend and move on to enjoying a friendship again.

That individual may have similar values or experiences, or he or she may have helped you through difficult times. Recognize why you've remained friends, and think about what you value most in knowing that individual.Think about the costs and benefits of re-establishing your friendship.
You stand to gain a potentially valuable friend back in your life, but be aware that you may have to be the one to apologize and take responsibility for what happened (even if you don't feel like it was your fault).
Consider any long-standing problems in your friendship. Has that person had a tendency to say or do hurtful things to you over the course of your friendship?;
, Perhaps your friend is trying to give you space, or perhaps he or she feels too nervous to make the first move. If your friend doesn't reach out to you, you'll need to be the one who steps up and begins repairing the friendship.Depending on the nature of your friendship and the severity of your argument, you may decide to call, text, email, or have an in-person visit with that friend.
Meeting in person may facilitate more of a back-and-forth discussion. It may be best to meet in a mutual, public place so that neither of you feels intimidated or under pressure.
Be honest and up front with your friend. If you were hurt, let your friend know so, and if you hurt your friend let him or her know you're sorry right from the start.

, When you talk to your friend about trying to repair the friendship, it's important that you don't say or do anything hurtful. This will only further damage the friendship, and it may make things irreparable.Try to express your feelings without using inflammatory or accusatory words.
Use ""I"" statements rather than declaratives. For example, instead of saying ""You were a selfish jerk,"" say something like, ""I felt like you didn't care about my feelings, and I felt hurt by the things you said.""
Ask questions rather than making accusations. For example, instead of saying, ""You made a really dumb decision,"" ask your friend, ""Why did you decide to do that? I'm having trouble understanding.""

, Even if you feel like your friend was to blame, it will help repair the friendship if you acknowledge your own mistakes. Whether the mistakes are relevant to the situation at hand or have caused problems in the past, a mutual apology will help bridge the conflict and strengthen your friendship.


Friendships require mutual investment and a give-and-take dynamic.By acknowledging your mistakes, you're letting your friend know that this isn't a blame game.
Give a sincere apology. Saying ""I'm sorry I hurt you"" will go a lot farther than a non-apology like ""I'm sorry you feel that way."", Once you and your friend move past the conflict you've resolved, you should try to avoid future conflicts. The best way to do this is by letting go of unrealistic or unfair expectations for your friend and recognizing that friend's value in your life.Take a genuine and sincere interest in your friend's well-being. Ask your friend about work, relationships, and other life events to show you care.
Don't take your friend for granted. Try to reflect on what makes that individual so special every time you interact.

, If you've said or done something hurtful to a friend, that individual may not be ready to talk just yet (let alone forgive you). Sometimes it takes time to stop feeling angry, and trying to force a conversation right away may make it difficult for your friend to forgive you.Tensions tend to be highest right after a fight, and depending on the individual and the nature of your argument you may need to wait a few days or a few weeks.
If you wait longer than a few days after a fight before talking, you may want to at least let your friend know that you're giving him or her some space. That way your friend won't think you've abandoned the friendship.

, While you're giving your friend space, take some time for yourself to calm down and think about what you could have done differently to avoid fighting. In the heat of a moment it may be difficult to consider other courses of action, but as you reflect on what you said or did you'll probably see that you could have behaved differently and avoided this conflict.Consider whether your argument was based on jealousy, malice, or forgetfulness/incompetence. If you acted out of jealousy or ill will, you'll need to analyze the situation and figure out why you behaved the way you did.
Ask yourself whether you would be hurt if your friend treated you the way you treated him or her.
Consider the possibility that you may have deep-seated issues with anger or insecurity. If this is the case, you may want to consider seeing a qualified therapist who can help you work through these issues.

, If you're serious about repairing your friendship and you can acknowledge that you were at fault, you will need to apologize. You will only be able to move forward as friends if you acknowledge those mistakes to your friend and ask him or her for forgiveness.Start the conversation by saying that you're sorry for the way you behaved.
List the specific things you said or did that were problematic and acknowledge to your friend how these behaviors have hurt his or her feelings.
Apologize again. By repeating your apology you'll let your friend know that you understand how you've hurt him or her and have taken it to heart.
Let your friend speak. He or she may want to vent at you or reiterate some of the things you've already said, and you'll need to be patient as your friend does so.
Acknowledge the things your friend says, apologize again, and let your friend know what you'll do differently next time. Then ask your friend if he or she can forgive you, and let him or her know how much you value your friendship.

, Apologies are meaningless if you don't correct the behavior you apologized for. If you're serious about making amends and repairing your friendship, you'll need to make some changes in the way you speak to and interact with your friend. This will take time and a lot of effort, but ultimately it's the best way to grow as a person and rebuild your friendship.


Consider asking your friend (and even other friends) to help you become more aware of bad habits that you can't recognize.
Carry a small notebook and write down any instance in which you feel like behaving badly towards a friend. Then write out the circumstances (where, when, why, and with whom) and try to figure out why you had that reaction.
If you've noticed that you have a consistent pattern of bad behavior, you may want to talk to a therapist about how to make meaningful changes in your life. You can find a therapist near you by searching online or checking your local phone book.

, Often times people hold onto anger in order to feel like they have some control over an unpleasant situation. Other times people simply can't let go of their hurt feelings. Whatever your situation may be, it's important to release the negative feelings you're having and open yourself up to the possibility of forgiving your friend.Recognize that holding onto anger doesn't solve anything. It won't make your friend feel any more remorseful; all it does is make you feel bitter and miserable.
Recognize that you can forgive someone and still have them take responsibility for their words and actions. You don't need to withhold forgiveness in the hope that someone will feel bad, because there's a good chance they already feel bad.

, Depending on the nature of your dispute, you may feel like you could never get over what happened. These feelings often fade with the passing of time, but sometimes they don't fade. If you try to force yourself to forgive someone before you're ready (or if you know you'll never really be ready), you may actually end up feeling more traumatized and/or angry in the long run.Perhaps not enough time has passed for you to feel ready to forgive. If this is the case, let your friend know that you aren't closing the door on him or her, you just need more time.
You're not obligated to forgive anyone. However, it's important to recognize that holding on to anger and resentment won't fix what happened.
Only you can decide if you're ready and able to forgive your friend. Think about the severity of what happened, how to move past it, and whether your friendship will ever be the same.

, If you've decided that you can move past your friend's wrongdoing, you'll need to mentally, emotionally, and verbally forgive your friend. Have a long, calm conversation about what happened and talk about ways to avoid a similar situation in the future.


Don't hold what happened over your friend's head. If your friend has apologized and you've forgiven him or her, it would be wrong of you to bring up past wrongdoings or shame your friend.
Recognize that forgiving doesn't necessarily mean forgetting. Rather, forgiveness means acknowledging the unbiased circumstances of what happened and finding a way to live with it., If you're feeling resentful of your friend, you may be stuck in your subjective interpretation of what happened. However, there may be other factors that you haven't considered, including things that you and others said or did. Even if your friend was at fault, he or she may have had other circumstances that you weren't aware of.Think about how your friend acted, how you reacted, and what circumstances led up to that encounter.
Ask yourself whether you or anyone else may have played a role in your friend's bad behavior.
Acknowledge that your friend may not have been acting out of malice. Many people behave poorly when they're hungry, angry, lonely, tired, or otherwise uncomfortable., Communication is vital in repairing a friendship. If you're serious about moving past your friend's transgression and letting go of your anger, you'll need to tell your friend why you're upset and listen to what he or she has to say.Count to 10 before speaking. Use those 10 seconds to process your feelings and to carefully choose your words before you say them.
Use ""I"" statements to convey how you feel. This will help you communicate why you're struggling to forgive your friend without inciting a new argument.
Be honest. If your friend hurt your feelings, let your friend know what you'd like him or her to do differently next time.

, If your friend decides to apologize, it's important that you listen actively to what he or she says. Your friend may have felt that he or she was justified at the time, or there may be other circumstances that you weren't aware of. Listen to your friend and trust that his or her apology is sincere.Repeat what your friend says back to him or her to register that you understand what's being said. This shouldn't be a word-for-word repetition, just a summary of how your friend feels.
If your friend says that he or she didn't realize that your feelings were hurt, say something like, ""I understand you didn't know how I felt. I'll work on communicating better if you can work on trying to be more sensitive to my feelings.""

, If your friend has apologized, you can either forgive that friend and move on or end the friendship. Even if you decide to end the friendship, you'll need to let go of resentment at a certain point.Ask yourself whether you're really mad at your friend over what happened. Often times people mentally confuse someone from their present life with someone from their past and project anger and resentment on current friends.
Even if your friend was at fault, holding a grudge won't change what happened. Resenting your friend may also impair that friend's ability to grow and change his or her behavior in the future.
If you can't forgive your friend, you at least owe it to yourself to let go of your resentment. Try to come to terms with what happened and move past it if you can.

, It's a difficult fact to come to terms with, but some friendships aren't worth repairing. If your friend consistently treated you poorly or made you feel bad about yourself, you may not want to keep that friend in your life.A toxic friend makes you compete for his or her friendship, whereas a good friend will accept you and make time for you without exception.
Toxic people tend to force you to abandon your own problems to deal with theirs.
A good friend would offer criticism with compassion, not with a self-righteous attitude or with any sense of smugness.
Healthy, mutual friendships involve a balance of both friends reaching out to the other. If your friend never calls or texts you, or if you are always the one who has to make plans, there may be an imbalance in the friendship.
A surefire sign of a toxic friendship is if you feel like you can't be yourself around that person. If you're forced to walk on eggshells, it's probably not a good friendship.

, Even if your friendship wasn't toxic, it may have simply been a bad arrangement. Think about how you felt around this person and ask yourself whether it was honestly supportive and comfortable to be friends with that individual.You should feel like you can generally trust your friend. You should also feel supported by one another.
Your friend should inspire you to grow, and you should do the same for your friend.
Your friend should show you kindness, encouragement, and empathy. If your friend is generally incapable of giving you these things, it may not be a healthy friendship.

, If you've decided that a friendship isn't worth saving, you'll need to cut off all ties with that person. Keeping that person in your life will be damaging and may make it difficult to move past this or other transgressions.Be firm and direct. Don't just block someone's phone number and avoid them forever - get some type of closure by verbally ending the friendship.
You can end a friendship in a polite, respectful way. For example, you might say something like, ""I've been thinking about our friendship and I think I need to take a break. I don't like the way I feel when we're around each other - I think I need to sort some things out for myself.""

Tell them you are not going to fight over text.,

Avoid actions that will make the fight worse.,
Do not respond.,
Avert future text fights.",How to Get Out of a Text Fight with a Friend1," In getting out of a text fight with a friend, it is important to communicate immediately that you are not going to fight with them over text. It will only make things more difficult for the two of you. Be clear, kind, and firm in telling them that you will not continue to communicate this way with them.Try sending the following messages.


”It seems like you are upset. I'd rather not fight about this over text message.”
”I'm not going to fight with you over the phone.”
”It's not going to be helpful to do this over text.”;
, After informing your friend that you will not fight over text, ask them to speak with you in person. Speaking in person will allow you both to get a clearer picture of how you are feeling and what's going on.Schedule a time and a place to meet with them to talk about what is going on. You may have to repeat the request to meet instead of fighting over text. Try the following.


”Let's talk about this face to face instead.”
”I want to make sure I give this the attention it deserves. When can we meet to talk about it?”
”I'm confused, let's meet up and talk.”
”Let me know when you are ready to talk about this in person.”

, It can be very easy to react emotionally when a friend is fighting with you. Try and remember that getting out of a text fight with your friend should include the minimal amount of text communication possible. Try texting just logistics or plans to meet up only.Along these lines, avoid actions that will make the argument worse. Try and take a few minutes before you respond to anything over text to give yourself time to make a more rational decision. Avoid the following.


Sending meme reaction pictures.
Responding with only emojis.
Name calling, cursing, or blaming language.

, After you have made requests to not fight over text and to meet up to discuss in person, your friend may keep sending you messages. If they keep trying to contact you, do not respond. It may be difficult, but stick to your word in saying you will not fight over text.Responding will only show the friend that you will engage with them or continue to fight with them over text.


If it becomes distracting or begins to interfere with you life, consider blocking their number for a while., If you are a teenager, college student, or just prefer texting, chances are most of your communication is over text messages. Using text messages as your main form of communication may result in text fights being a reoccurring problem in your friendships. Fights occur more easily over text as well due to being unable to see reactions to texts or reading tone of the speaker.Try incorporating the following into your friendships to avert any future text fights.


Don't start text fights yourself. If you instigate a text fight with a friend, that sends the message that fighting over text is okay. If something upsets you give yourself some time to process it, and talk to them about it in person.
Set up a “no fight over text” rule in your friendship. Talk to your friend about it. Make an agreement that your friendship is too important to let text fighting get in the way. Remind each other of that rule when necessary.
If you have a friend who repeatedly fights with you over text or who does not respect your wishes to talk in person, consider the future of your friendship. Not everyone is ready to be mature about their relationships. You may have to scale back on your friendship with them until they are able to maturely talk about problems that pop up.

Consider how best to resolve your conflict.,
Ask a parent, teacher, or HR representative to mediate.,
Have your mediator set up a meeting between you and your friend.,
Let your mediator facilitate your conversation.,
Be an active and empathetic listener.,
Stay positive.",How to Get Through a Fight With a Close Friend2," If you think you and your friend can easily talk it out, do so immediately. But, if you’re worried that neither of you have the ability to resolve your conflict independently, think about your options for mediation.


If you go to school or college, your institution likely provides a free or low-cost service that can help you with personal disputes. Research your options on the school website or call an administrator to obtain a referral.
If your friend is a work colleague, you can ask your Human Resources department to officiate a conflict resolution. Don’t choose this option if your dispute is very intimate and you would feel uncomfortable about someone at work learning about it, though.
If neither work nor school offers an option for mediation, ask an adult you both trust.

, If you’ve decided to get outside help for your conflict, contact this party as soon as possible so you can begin the process.


Make sure the party you choose has no stake in the conflict. It might be helpful if the person trained in conflict resolution, such as someone trained as a lawyer or therapist, or a peer who has completed peer mediation training., Let your mediator know what times work best for you and they can help you settle on a time and place that is convenient for everyone.


If your friend declines the invitation, try to stay positive and give them more time. Different people process conflict in different ways and at different rates, so just because your friend isn’t ready now to meet, does not mean they will never be ready., You might find yourself tempted to wrestle control from the mediator in order to vent your feelings, but this approach will just continue and even exacerbate your conflict. Remember that your mediator is there to help, so let them guide your discussion.


When the mediator asks you a question or to clarify your side of the argument, do so in a calm, reflective manner. Focus on your own feelings and actions rather than making accusations.

, When your friend is speaking, listen quietly and thoughtfully. While charged situations like this can make it difficult to listen, make it a priority to do so with an open and focused mind. Try to understand your friend's point of view by putting yourself in their shoes, as empathizing is one of the best ways to resolve conflict.If you catch yourself planning a response while your friend is speaking, chances are that you're not really listening. After all, holding your tongue and listening aren't the same thing, so make sure you wait until your friend finishes speaking before considering and formulating a response.

, Your conversation will be more pleasant and productive if you keep the positive aspects of your friendship in the forefront of your discussion.


It can help to take regular breaks throughout the session where you each say something positive about the other or recall a positive memory. This will remind you both how much you care about each other and that you are meeting because you want to make the friendship work."
"
Look out for early warning signs.,
Ditch your defensiveness.,
Take breaks from each other.,
Dedicate time to each other.,
Change your attitude about fighting.,
Set boundaries.",How to Get Through a Fight With a Close Friend3," Next time, instead of waiting for a conflict to boil over, try nipping a developing problem in the bud. Know your relationship ‘triggers’—that is, things your friend does which annoy or anger you—and share them with each other. This knowledge of one another’s pet peeves will help you change your behavior and preserve the friendship.If you find yourself getting annoyed with your friend, think about your options for addressing it. You could take a break from each other, or you could talk it out right away, or you could try writing a letter asking your friend to stop the behavior. The most important thing is to address it in some way rather than ignoring your feelings until they boil over., One of the best ways to maintain a healthy friendship is to adjust your attitude regarding fault and hurt feelings. Just because you’re hurting, does not mean that the other person is solely to blame. Acknowledge that, as a partner in the friendship, you are partially responsible for keeping the relationship healthy and for any rifts which ever develop., Whether it’s your BFF or your significant other, it can be tempting to spend every second with those closest to you. It’s wise, though, to resist this impulse and take some time apart periodically. It will help prevent future tiffs and make your friendship more enjoyable as a whole.This can be especially helpful if there’s already some tension between the two of you. Giving each other some space will help cool off any simmering resentment and remind you how much you miss each other., Friendships change with time and conflict, and often times friends who were once close lose touch, but studies have shown that relationships can be preserved through communication and dedication. The tightest friendships remain so because the parties involved commit time and energy to one another, so take some time to connect with your friend on a regular basis.If you live far away from each other, this can be more difficult, but sending a quick email, e-card, or text can still be meaningful. Show your friend you’re thinking of them and resolve to touch base over a long phone or Skype conversation as soon as you both have time.

, While you shouldn’t be quarreling constantly, remember that conflict can be a healthy and productive element of friendship. Instead of thinking about it as something awful which you should avoid at all costs, think about it as an opportunity to build better understanding and trust between each other.If you acknowledge that fighting isn’t the worst possible scenario, you’ll be more willing to confront your friend at earlier junctions. Since you’re not avoiding conflict, you won’t let existing problems languish and worsen over time. You’ll also find that your fights take on a different, more positive character.

, If the fight was over a boundary that was crossed, or if you just feel like you and your friend need to have better boundaries, then setting boundaries is a good idea. To do this, you will need to identify what your boundaries are and then tell your friend what types of conversations are off limits.


For example, if you feel like your friend is crossing a boundary when she says negative things about your boyfriend, then you might say something like, “I feel upset when you say negative things about my boyfriend, so in the future, please don’t say those things.”

Talk with them and discuss what the problem is.,
Listen to your friend.,
Try to compromise.,
Apologize to your friend.,
Talk about communication going forward.",How to Get Out of a Text Fight with a Friend2," Getting out of a text fight with your friend will likely include working past the point where you have stopped texting each other. To ensure that the text fight does not reoccur or continue, talk with them about it.Hopefully, you were able to schedule a time to meet with your friend. Pick a place and a time that is convenient for the both of you.Thank them for meeting with you. Even if you didn't start the fight it sets a good tone for the rest of the talk. Try, “Thanks for meeting with me to talk about this.”
Open the conversation by asking about what happened. “What is going on?” or “What had you so upset the other day?”
Explain your side of the situation including your feelings and your actions. “Here's how I feel about it and why I did what I did.”, It is possible that you will be frustrated with your friend, or annoyed at having to take extra time to work on resolving a fight. Try and listen to your friend and view things from their perspective.Allow your friend the time and space to express how they feel, and validate those feelings for them.While you are listening to their side, try the following to communicate to them that you are listening.


Make eye contact.
Put away all distractions including your phone.
Don't interrupt them.
Lean slightly towards them.

, Once you have discussed what the conflict is with your friend, try and come to a solution by compromising. Compromise means that you and your friend come to an agreement where you “meet in the middle.”Offer up suggestions for things you think might help, and be open to suggestions your friend makes.


If it is a big fight, consider taking some breaks or some time apart to think things through. Offer to come back at a specific date and time to try talking about it and compromising again.

, Strong emotions and reactions often stem from feelings of being hurt.If some action you took upset your friend, apologize. Even if it was nothing you specifically did, you can always apologize for the fact that you are fighting.While you are talking with them acknowledge that you heard and understood what they said to you. Apologize by saying the following.


”I did not realize the effect this was having on you. I'm sorry.”
”I apologize, I did not mean to hurt you.”
”I hear you. Thank you for talking to me about it. I'm sorry this happened.”
”I'm sorry we're fighting.”

, It may be helpful, while talking to your friend about this fight, to make a plan for the future.You don't want to plan on a future fight with your friend, but friendships have ups and downs. It may help to talk about your friendship going forward and how you'd like to approach disagreements or fights.Mention that you don't want to fight over text and prefer to face things head on. Try saying the following.


”I'm glad we had this talk. Let's always try and talk things out face to face.”
”Thanks for working through this stuff with me. It's so much better this way than over text.”
”I really hate fighting over text. Next time, just pull me aside or as to talk to me face-to-face, okay?”

Keep your emotions in check.,
Suggest a break.,
Vent to a trusted friend instead of social media.Fighting with someone you care about is always difficult.",How to Get Out of a Text Fight with a Friend3," While you are navigating this fight with your friend, try and keep calm by not letting your emotions get the best of you.It may be difficult to do, but it will make it easier to resolve the tension between you and your friend.Try calming your emotions with the following.


Pause and count to 5 before responding if you are speaking in person.
If you are texting, put your phone down and walk away from it for a few minutes.
Close your eyes and take several deep breaths.
Don't react or retaliate immediately, give yourself time.

, If you feel your emotions getting to you, or if you can see that high emotions are making the discussion difficult, suggest a break.Taking a break from a fight or a discussion allows you and your friend to calm down and gain a little perspective. It may also help the discussion be more successful. Suggest a break in the following ways.


”Okay, things feel a little heated. Let's take a few minutes and cool down.”
”I'm getting really frustrated. I'm going to take a short walk to calm down a little bit.”
”I feel like we are both getting angry and not getting anywhere. Let's take some time to cool down.”

, Whether it was an fight because of something you did or a fight due to a disagreement, it can still be stressful. When you are stressed it is important you have someone to talk to about it. During this fight choose to talk to a trusted friend or a family member privately. Venting over social media involves a lot of people unnecessarily and risks making matters worse."
"
Admit what went wrong.,
Commit to change your actions.,
Plan to express what made you upset.",How to Fix an Argument Between Friends1," In order to begin to solve an argument, you first need to understand what happened and develop some hypotheses about why it happened. This is crucial because you cannot solve a problem if you don’t know what the problem is! Having a plan is one way to approach the situation with a clear head to reduce more arguments.


Begin by looking at what happened from your perspective and thinking rationally about it. Use both your rational mind and your emotional mind, but try to look at the situation objectively. Let’s say you found out that your friend was talking negatively about you behind your back. Think about all of the specifics of the situation. How did you find out? What did the person say? How did you handle it?
In order to analyze the issue, it can be helpful to identify what led to the issue and what happened afterwards. Identify the Antecedent (what happened before the conflict), Behavior (what you did) and Consequence (what happened as a result of the behavior).Let’s imagine that the conflict began by you finding out that your friend is talking behind your back (antecedent), and then you confronted your friend which turned into a verbal argument (behavior). Next, you and your friend stopped talking to each other for a week (consequence).
Know that some arguments are okay; not all arguments are bad. It is okay to disagree with your friends sometimes, and argue or debate about a topic.It is how you go about arguing that is important; each person needs to be respectful and neither should be aggressive.;
, Try to analyze your own behaviors and thoughts about the situation. Think about the possibility of looking at the situation differently and taking on another perspective. This can help you gain clarity about the conflict and understand how you can attempt to solve it. For example, you could commit to your friend that you will do something better the next time a similar situation occurs.


One way of doing things differently is thinking differently. For example, if someone told you your friends was talking negatively about you, is it possible that this isn’t true?
Another way of doings things differently is changing your actions. If you confronted your friend about what you heard, can you identify a better way you could have approached the situation? Were you really mad when you tried to resolve the conflict? Did you say something you regret?

, Analyze how your friend responded to the argument. This can help you to gather your thoughts so that when you talk to your friend about the situation you can be specific about what you’d like her to change.


Gather some ideas about what hurt your feelings or made the situation more difficult for you. For example, perhaps your friend called you a bad name and cursed at you, and this made you feel sad and angry.
Identify specifically what your friend could have done differently. For example, if your friend cursed at you, perhaps she could have lowered her voice, spoken calmly, and used words that were not hurtful or aggressive.

Select an enclosure for your slider.,
Add water to your slider’s enclosure.,
Create a basking area in the enclosure.,
Provide adequate light and heat for your slider’s enclosure.,
Include areas for your slider to hide.,
Consider adding a substrate to your slider’s enclosure.",How to Care for a Red Ear Slider Turtle1," Glass aquariums are a popular type of enclosure for red ear slider turtles.Acrylic aquariums are also available, but are not ideal because acrylic scratches easily.A general rule of thumb for tank size is 10 gallons of tank per inch of shell length.Be mindful that adult sliders can grow up to 12 inches in length. Consider buying a large tank initially to avoid purchasing multiple tanks as your slider grows.If large glass aquariums are not within your budget, you can also use a plastic storage container, plastic stock tank, or wading pool to house your slider.Whichever type of enclosure you choose, it should be clean, sturdy, and durable.
A screened mesh top is helpful to prevent your slider from climbing out.These work well on aquariums.
A large enclosure is necessary for your slider’s health and well-being. He could suffer from poor mental health, illness, and injury if his enclosure is too small.Turtle-specific tanks are usually poorly designed and should be avoided.;
, Red ear slider turtles are strong swimmers and spend the majority of their time in the water.Therefore, it is important for your slider to have plenty of water to swim in. Tap water is suitable to use, but you should test the water for chlorine, hardness, and pH before adding it to the enclosure.


Depending on the test results, you may need to use a filter that removes chlorine or add a water-softening agent. In addition, you may need to lower the pH (ideal pH levels are six to eight) using such substances as peat or bogwood.A helpful rule of thumb is to have 10 gallons of water per inch of your slider’s shell length., Your slider will need a dry, warm area above the water in which he can bask under a heat source. Materials on which your slider could bask include cork bark or driftwood.Use large, smooth river rocks to create a sloped pathway from the water to the basking site.The basking area should be 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (29 to 32 degrees Celsius).If you do not want make your own basking dock, you can purchase a commercial basking dock at your local pet store., The light from fluorescent and incandescent light bulbs are not only good for your slider’s health, but also provide an important heat source. Your slider’s enclosure should be kept at about 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius).


The full spectrum ultraviolet light (UVA and UVB) from fluorescent light bulbs will help your slider produce vitamin D3.Use an incandescent light bulb (75 watts or lower) directly above the basking area.Situate the light bulbs directly above your slider (about 18 to 24 inches up).Consider purchasing a light fixture to secure the light bulbs.
Although direct sunlight provides UV light, it can make your slider’s enclosure too warm. Avoid placing his enclosure in the path of direct sunlight.Replace the bulbs every six months., Red ear slider turtles are relatively solitary creatures and enjoy their privacy.Structures such as live aquatic plants and caves can allow your slider to hide if he feels threatened (common in younger sliders).Be mindful that your slider may eat the live plants. You may need to replace them regularly.Caves are good choices for smaller sliders. However, a small slider could become stuck in the cave as he grows.If you choose to provide extra places to hide, make sure the objects are nontoxic and sturdy., Substrates such as sand and river rocks can be added to the bottom of your slider’s enclosure to enhance its appearance. The substrate could also pique your slider’s interest and give him something to sift through.Keep in mind that adding a substrate may create more work for you, in terms of keeping the enclosure clean.Do not use gravel as a substrate. Your slider’s digestive may become impacted if he eats it. Gravel can also trap food and waste, making the enclosure harder to clean.Marbles, pebbles, and beads should also be avoided. They can break when your slider steps on them, resulting in sharp debris that could injure him."

Set up a time and place to talk.Discussing the situation is one of the most helpful ways to solve an argument and improve a relationship.,
Be empathic.,
Apologize.,
Use Collaborative Problem-Solving.",How to Fix an Argument Between Friends2,"


If you haven’t talked to your friend in a while, try texting or calling her to set up a time to meet. You could say something like, ""Hey. I'd like to set up a time to talk with you in person? Are you okay with that?""
Avoid having a conversation about the issue over text, messenger, email, or phone. Face-to-face contact is the best approach to solving conflict because it reduces the likelihood of a miscommunication; you can’t tell a person’s tone or facial expression from a text message. You can say, ""I think it would be better if we talk about this in person. I really want to be able to understand you better. How about we go get coffee?""
Pick an appropriate location that is somewhat private. Do not involve other people as this can seem like you are ganging up on your friend; talk to your friend individually. Good locations might be at a coffee shop, your home, or a park. Try to avoid places like school or work (where other people you know might be around).
Discuss each side of the situation. First let your friend talk about her experience and her feelings. This shows that you are willing to put your thoughts aside while you focus on her.

, Having empathy for the other person increases the likelihood of healthy conflict resolution.You could say something such as, ""I'd like to hear your side of the situation. Can you tell me how you are thinking and feeling about what happened?""


Put yourself in your friend’s shoes. How would it feel to be in her situation? What would it be like to think her thoughts and feel her feelings? Are there other things going on in her life that are affecting the situation (difficult situations at home or at school)?
Try to be understanding and look at her point of view as an outsider. Maintain a distant stance from your own emotions in the meantime in order to reduce the likelihood that you will take something she says personally and react emotionally.

, Accept that your friend has a reason to be upset even if you don’t agree with it.


Say something like, ""I realize you are hurt and I'm sorry."" Then listen to what she has to say. Don’t say something like, ""I might have been wrong, but you made it worse.""

, Work on the best outcome for both people involved.When collaborating, both sides are equal and each person works toward coming to the best possible response to the situation.


You could start by saying, ""I really want to solve this problem together. Do you think we can come up with a solution that we both agree on?"" You can also emphasize that you are willing to work on things by saying, ""I understand that I need to work on some things too, so I want you to know that I'm open to hearing about what you'd like me to do better next time.""
Focus on being cooperative and helping the other person. Instead of thinking about your own needs, think about your own desires in the context of your friend’s needs as well. Is there a way you can both get your needs met in a safe and healthy way? Perhaps you can help your friend learn how to communicate better, and you can learn how to resolve conflict in a healthy way.
Don’t compromise too much. Compromising may mean you get only part of what you want, and sacrifice of your important desires.Be willing to budge a bit, but don’t completely compromise your wants and needs to appease the other person.
Analyze possible solutions and agree on one option that fits for the both of you. Take a look at the situation and think of how to solve it together. Perhaps make a list of options where both parties involved would work on something. For example, if you heard that your friend was talking negatively about you and you confronted her, some solutions might be that you could have spoken more assertively instead of aggressively, and your friend could have done the same. Once you have come to this conclusion, you can agree on what you both can do differently in the future.

Practice being assertive.,
Reduce aggressiveness.,
Limit passive communication.,
Avoid engaging in passive-aggressive behaviors.",How to Fix an Argument Between Friends3," Assertiveness is about getting your needs met in appropriate and respectful ways.The more assertive you can be, the more likely you will get what you want.


Be direct. Approach your friend calmly and tactfully. Listen to her point of view, and then explain how you feel.
Use “I statements,” such as, “I felt angry when I heard you were talking bad about me to other people.” Make sure you emphasize how you feel instead of what the other person did; you should always state your feelings first in order to reduce the likelihood that the other person will react emotionally or take it personally.
Focus on positive aspects of the relationship. You could say something like, ""Your friendship means a lot to me and I don't want this to come between us.”
Maintain positive eye contact. Don’t stare without looking away every once in a while, and don’t avoid eye contact. Maintain eye-contact that is comfortable, look away every once in a while, then regain eye-contact.

, Aggressive communication is based on, “I’m okay, you’re not okay” thinking. It assumes that you are right and the other person is wrong. Examples of aggressive communication include: raising your voice or yelling, threatening, putting down the other person (e.g., “You’re stupid”), and pointing your fingers.Avoid engaging in hurtful behaviors such as name-calling, put-downs, or blaming.For example, don’t say things like, ""I can't believe you did that. I hate you. You’re stupid.” Instead, say something assertive like, ""I felt really angry when I heard that you were talking about me behind my back. I know that it may have been taken out of context, but can you give me your side of what happened? I'd like to understand where you're coming from.""

, Some people back down and beg for forgiveness at the first sign of a fight, even when they are not the only one responsible for the issue. However, passive behaviors like avoiding confrontation are associated with more negativity within friendships.Don’t avoid the problem, this can result in unresolved conflict.Don’t apologize for everything, only your part in the problem. In other words, do not take the entire blame. There are always two people in a conflict, and in most case both people exhibit behaviors that contribute to the issue.
Look at your friend and maintain eye-contact instead of staring at the floor or fidgeting.
Do not simply accommodate the other person’s will or wishes. Your needs are just as important., Passive-aggression is associated with showing your aggression in a passive way. Instead of telling someone how you feel, you tell the person through your actions. These passive forms of aggression can be confusing and hurtful.


Some examples of passive-aggressive communication are sarcasm, talking behind the person’s back (speaking negatively about her to others), spreading rumors, or getting other people to dislike your friend.

Continue to work on the friendship.,
Manage your anger.,
Pay attention to your own positive qualities.",How to Fix an Argument Between Friends4," Do not expect things to be straightened out right away. Arguments can be messy, and it can take time to work things through.


Allow for space. Sometimes friends need a break from one another in order to re-assess the situation and get some clarity.
Give up control. Trying to control your friend may produce negativity within the relationship.Respect your friend’s wishes if she doesn't want to talk about the situation, but let her know it's upsetting you.
Do not force her to talk things through as this may lead to another argument.

, Anger management is not about avoiding being angry, it’s about knowing what to do when you are angry.


Avoid having conversations when you are very angry. Walk away if there is a conflict that may escalate into aggressive communication or violence. Keep calm and remember to breathe!

, Studies show that when people focus on their knowledge, creativity, and skills, they are better at resolving conflict with peers.Identify your strengths and cultivate them! Let’s say you are good at performing, join an acting class or audition for the school play. The more activities and skills you involve yourself in the better!

Maintain a minimum water level.,
Keep the water at a constant, warm temperature.,
Use a water filter to maintain water quality.",How to Care for a Red Ear Slider Turtle2," This is important to ensure that your slider does not drown. As a rule of thumb, the water level should be at least as high as his shell is long. For example, a slider with a 6-inch long shell should be in water that is at least 6 inches deep.This rule of thumb may be more useful if you are having trouble measuring the amount of water in gallons.
With the right water level, your slider will be able right himself in case he flips over in the water.Low water levels can increase the accumulation rate of harmful chemicals and debris in your slider's enclosure, regardless of the type of water filter., Turtles are cold-blooded animals and need external sources of warmth to keep them warm. Use a thermometer to maintain the water temperature in your slider’s tank at 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 27 degrees Celsius).Infrared thermometers are available that you can stick to the side of the enclosure to monitor the temperature.Water temperatures that fall below the recommended range can slow your slider’s metabolism, which can lead to inactivity and serious health problems, such as impaired digestion.Place a submersible aquarium water heater below the water line to maintain the proper water temperature.The wattage of the water heater should be between three and five watts per gallon of water.Not all submersible water heaters accurately gauge the water temperature.Check the water temperature regularly and adjust the heater as needed.
Turtles can be very rough. Consider purchasing a water heater guard to keep your slider from breaking the heater.Do not plug in the water heater until 10 minutes after you place it in the water. Also, wait 10 minutes after you unplug it to remove it from the water.When you change the water in your slider’s aquarium, make sure that the fresh water to be added to the tank is at the proper temperature., Your slider’s health depends on the quality of the water in his enclosure. Poor water quality can lead to an accumulation of microorganisms that can not only cause the aquarium to smell, but also negatively affect your slider’s health.There are several types of water filters (biological, chemical, mechanical) to keep your slider’s aquarium free of dangerous chemicals (e.g., ammonia, nitrates, chlorine).Biological filters remove ammonia from your slider’s aquarium. A mechanical filter removes debris, and a chemical filter removes various pollutants from the water.The website http://www.redearslider.com/filters.html has a comprehensive overview of the many filters available for your slider’s aquarium. Talk to your veterinarian if you are unsure which filter to select.
It is recommended to use a filter with a filtration rate that is rated two to three times the amount of water in the enclosure.For example, a 50-gallon tank would need a filter that can filter 100 to 150 gallons of water.
Although filters will make it easier to keep your slider’s enclosure clean, you will still need to change the water and filter regularly (check the manufacturer’s instructions). How often you change the water and filter will depend on several factors, such as how many sliders are in the tank and if you have a separate feeding tank.Whichever filter you choose, make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure maximal efficiency of the filter.Aquatic plants can be used to filter the water. However, your slider may eat these plants and thus create more waste."
"
Feed your slider animal-based protein.,
Include fresh produce in your slider’s diet.,
Feed your slider a commercial diet.,
Learn how often to feed your slider.,
Consider supplementing your slider’s diet.,
Feed your slider in a separate tank.",How to Care for a Red Ear Slider Turtle3," Sliders are carnivorous when they are young, but become omnivores as they progress to adulthood.Feeding your slider a variety of foods will help keep him healthy. Examples of good protein sources are live crickets, earthworms and silkworms.It is preferable to choose worms and insects that have been gut-loaded to increase their nutritional value.Live snails are another good protein source, but could harbor harmful parasites, even if store bought.Your slider will also enjoy live fish, such as guppies or minnows.Your slider may suffer from a vitamin B1 deficiency if you feed him a primarily fish-based diet.Be sure to incorporate multiple protein sources into his diet.
Animal-based protein should make up about 25% of your slider’s diet., Your slider can eat a wide variety of fresh produce, including melons, collard greens, sweet potatoes, and bananas.Consider choosing produce, such as greens and lettuce, that can float in the water—this would give your slider something to munch on throughout the day.


Although fresh is preferable over frozen, fresh produce may have pesticides or herbicides on them that could make your slider sick.
Water hyacinth, water lilies, and duckweed are fresh plants that you can place in your slider’s enclosure.Keep in mind that fruit can disintegrate in the water, making it harder to keep his enclosure clean.Fresh produce should make up the majority of his diet (50 to 75%)., Turtle pellets are available at your local pet store. These pellets can be another protein source for your slider.The amount of pellets you feed your slider should be roughly the same size as his head (excluding his neck).Other types of commercial turtle food include frozen and freeze-dried food (e.g., shrimp, krill, feeder fish). They can be used as a small treat for your slider. Commercial food should make up 10 to 25% of your slider’s diet., Juvenile sliders should be fed daily, and adult sliders should be fed every other day.Be aware that sliders are voracious eaters and often beg for food.Do not give your slider food every time he begs for it—this could lead to overfeeding and health problems.
Be mindful that sliders eat only when they are in the water.Do not attempt to feed your turtle is he is in his basking area.

, Even with a well-balanced diet that is full of variety, your slider may need dietary supplements to keep him in optimal health. Calcium is an especially important nutrient for your slider. You can supplement his diet with calcium by sprinkling a calcium-vitamin D3 powder supplement on his food or feeding him cuttlefish bone.A calcium deficiency can lead to metabolic bone disease.To prevent a nutrient imbalance, consult with your veterinarian before supplementing your slider’s diet., Sliders can be very messy eaters.To keep your slider’s main enclosure more clean, feed him in a separate tank or other enclosure. Be sure to clean out any remaining food after your slider has finished eating to prevent the food from rotting.Allow your slider to eat for about 15 minutes before placing him back in his main enclosure."
"
Use both hands to handle your slider.,
Wash your hands before and after handling your slider.,
Minimize handling of your slider.",How to Care for a Red Ear Slider Turtle4," Proper handling of your slider is very important. Handling your slider may not be easy—he will slippery, and may hiss, bite, and even release his bowels in response to being held.To minimize his distress and decrease your chances of being bitten, gently hold and support him with both hands.Place him back in his enclosure if he begins to rapidly flail his arms and legs.Your slider may bite or scratch you when he begins to struggle., Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease than can be transmitted from sliders to humans. Your slider carries the bacteria in his system, but does not become sick from it.However, salmonella can make humans (especially children) very ill.Washing your hands with soap and water before and after handling your slider will decrease the likelihood of contracting salmonella from him.Be aware that sliders can release salmonella in their feces when they become stressed, such as when being handled.If you have children, closely supervise them when handling your slider. Make sure they wash their hands before and after handling him, and do not allow them to put their hands near their mouth after handling him.

, Besides the risk of disease transmission, sliders typically do not like to be held frequently. In fact, your slider may immediately withdraw into his shell when you try to handle him. He may even try to bite you."

Review your pros and cons.",How to Figure Out if Your Friend Is Worth Keeping1," As you try to decide if you friendship is worth keeping it can help to think back on your interactions with the friend recently. Has something happened lately that totally changed the dynamic of the friendship? Was this a one-time occurrence or are you noticing a pattern? Is your friend acting normally or are there certain circumstances affecting his or her behavior?, Now that you have taken some time to reflect on how the friendship has been going, it’s time to write it down. Grab a piece of paper and draw a line straight down the center. At the top, write “Continue the Friendship?” which is the decision you are trying to make. Beneath that write “Pros” on the left and “Cons” on the right.


Making a pros and cons lists is a quick and simple way to help you see the benefits and disadvantages of possible decisions before you make them., Use the reflections you had in the first step to fill in each side of your list. For pros, you will want to list all the reasons it’s a good idea to continue the friendship. For cons, you will write out all the reasons continuing the friendship is a bad decision.For example, you might write “Loyalty,” “5-year friendship,” and “Knows all my secrets” under the Pros side. Meanwhile, you might add things like “Not trustworthy” or “Not reliable” under the Cons side.

, Once you have exhausted your brainpower writing out both sides of the list, you should go back over what you wrote. Immediately, you will want to see if one side of the list is much longer than the other. If so, this may mean that either the pros or cons outweigh the other.


You will also want to look at the content of the individual items on the list. See if anything sticks out to you. For instance, you might consider “Not reliable” to be much more unfavorable than having a “5-year friendship.” Judge the pros and cons against one another to determine which are most important to you.
If you have majors pros that mean more to you than the minor cons, then you might decide to continue the friendship. However, if the cons are major and the pros seem minor, then you may have made the decision to end the friendship.

Start by quizzing your friend about their life.,
Consider whether your friend is able to discern fact from reality.,
Try to catch our friend in the act of lying.,
Tell your friend nicely that you've been spotting inconsistencies.,
Avoid playing the bad cop.,
Consider moving on.",How to Find Out if Your Friend Is a Liar," Ask questions about a few simple things, such as ""What were you doing last week?"". If they answer without any hesitation, it is quite possible that they are lying., Try to make sure that what your friend says are actually lies, and not their version of reality. This may sound odd but if your friend truly believes in their fantasy world, this can be a sign of a mental disorder or condition and they may need help, not scolding for dishonesty.

, If your friend told you one thing the day before, then told you or a friend a completely different story the next day, this is a clear sign that lying is going on. Don't react meanly, just get ready to call your friend out on the lies.


Take it nice and slowly when trying to work out what your friend is really up to. Let them keep lying until you are absolutely positive that they are a liar.

, You could simply say that you think that they are lying about X or Y.


Say something like ""Well, that doesn't sound like what you told X. You told X and now you are telling me . Which is really true?"".

, If you yell at your friend, or falsely accuse them of lying, that will upset them and may cause them to lie even more. Moreover, your actions become no better than theirs if you act all high and mighty and yell instead of listening to their side of things. Stay calm and be willing to listen to their side of the story.


Don't be the source of additional angst in your friend's life. Lying is often a response to other pressures in life and you may just be someone who can truly listen and help your friend get through a bad patch. However, you have to be willing to do so genuinely.
Do not involve other people. This can make your friend refuse to do anything to change for fear of being outed. Moreover, it could get your friend into trouble for lying. Keep it between you and your friend. Possibly you can help your friend overcome the need to lie, possibly you can't but it's best to keep it between both of you. Of course, if it's a lie about something to do with breaking the law, then you do need to tell others but this article is assuming it's not as serious as that.

, If you don't like the response from your friend or feel that they are just going to keep on lying to you, consider breaking the friendship. If you have a ""friend"" who lies intensely, try to pick friends who are more honest and don't feel the need to continuously lie to your face.

Accept yourself.,
Come out.,
Pass as a Guy.,
Find a therapist.,
Make a Plan.,
Start hormone therapy (optional).,
Change your name.,
Undergo surgery.,
Have your gender changed legally.",How to Transition from a Female to a Male (Transgender)," The first major part of your transitioning will be accepting who you are. This is something you might have known your entire life or might have recently realized/come to terms with. Take plenty of time to think about everything, do some research, have a good cry, do whatever you need to do. Know that you're not alone - there are many people who are transgender.


Try to find a safe support group in your area so you can meet other people like you, hear their stories, gather more information, ask questions and come to terms with yourself.
Try to figure out what you need to do to be at peace. Some people who are transgender are perfectly content to dress in the clothing styles of the gender they identify with and be referred to using he/him pronouns or gender neutral pronouns (them/their). Others feel a need to do more to their body to be perceived correctly and accept themselves in the mirror, so they get hormone therapy (testosterone by injection or in gel or cream form). Some transgender people have dysphoria to such a degree that they need to completely transition which includes all the available surgery (top and/or bottom). Remember that you don't need to make any choices right away, in fact it's going to be a long road ahead of you. A lot of people get frustrated at just how slow it can go. (Hormones take months to years to do their thing, beards may not grow in full, surgeries in some countries are not covered by insurance and can be unaffordable, etc.);
, There's no ""correct"" time to come out to people as transgender and it doesn't necessarily have to go second in your transition steps. It is something to do with careful consideration, if you decide coming out is something you want for yourself. Know that you are under no moral obligation to come out to others, it should be something you want to do if you do it. This is going to be a very long process for you and a hard road to go down - you're going to need a support system in place and people who are there for you.


It's probably best to tell either a really close friend or your parents first (especially your parents if you live with them). Letters are perfectly appropriate if you're not good with talking or don't know what to say.
You can test your family's attitude on the subject by talking about a transgender man or boy in the news. Look for an interesting story like ""the pregnant man"" and get a family discussion going. Find out how they react to him before coming out to them about who you are, especially if you're under legal age. In some families there may be risk of physical violence. Don't come out unless you feel it's physically safe and have a ""worst case scenario"" plan if the situation turns violent.
Most people will have a lot of questions (especially family). Be knowledgeable. Know what you should do next and know some of the options for down the road that you're considering. Be patient with their questions and don't tease them for obvious things they say. Don't be wishy-washy, or appear to not be sure of what your plans are. This is because they may take it as a sign you have not really thought the matter through or that they can talk you out of transitioning. Expect that every example of your being transgender (such as being uncomfortable in an all female group, wanting to be buff, or maybe daydreaming of being a famous football player as a kid) will be met with their excuses why that is normal for many girls, as they are trying to find a way to show you that you are mistaken.
There are support groups for family and partners of transgender people if that's something they're interested in. PFLAG can be checked out online and has chapters around the USA. You could also take them to your meetings if you go to any that allow it (ask them first as it is generally confidential).
Transgender and gay often get confused or intertwined and may cause confusion when you come out. Remember that transgender refers to a person's GENDER identity- a transgender person can be any sexual orientation that a cisgender person can be: gay, straight, bi, asexual, etc. The confusion probably comes in on how to ""label"" a trans person during transitioning. So, as a transgender man, you are a male, which means you may need to explain to others that if you like guys you are (can come out as) gay, if you like girls you are straight, and if you like gay men and straight women you are bisexual, but no matter who you want to date, you are always a man. Another reason some may confuse transgender with gays could come from cross-dressers (who are portrayed by media as gay but are sometimes straight), butch lesbians who are definitely not men but dress like them, and gay (and straight) drag queens and kings.
Remember that no matter how confused or surprised someone may be by your coming out, they should always have as much respect for you as they always have, even if they don't fully understand. If someone is treating you like a burden or lashing out at you, you may want to strongly consider ending your relationship with that person.

, If you don't do this already, you'll probably soon want to start dressing like a male to show outside how you are inside. There are some places online where advice is given to ""act"" male, but you will probably discover that is counterproductive as you want to stop the acting and become your true self. Some advice given by well meaning transgender people include being crude, spitting, using vulgarities and cursing, taking up a lot of space by putting legs wide open even if it is on a bus, and swaggering. Most cisgender men around you probably do not do that, so it is better to just observe what actions you were taught to do that are feminine that you are still doing and quit.


Be careful and subtle in how you go about this. A very sudden complete shift at home before you come out may startle your parents and lead to tension or other uncomfortable conversations. Doing this at school, especially elementary or middle school, or work, could create a lot of problems with peers and co-workers. You may want to restrict ""passing"" to home at first, or to public places where you're unlikely to see people you know. When you are ready to try dressing normally in school or at work, try it in phases, such as getting a haircut that is androgynous and boyish clothing, then replace with some shirts and jeans or shoes from men's or boys department, and gradually get shorter haircuts if that is what you prefer. Slow transition may make it easier on you in the long run, how long a transition is completely up to you. You are the man in charge of your destiny now.
Feel free to educate your classmates or co-workers about being transgender to make yourself more comfortable at school or work with your new look. Again be aware that unfortunately not everyone in this world is as accepting as they should be, and could say things that are hurtful and untrue. Take it one day at a time and talk to a support group as needed, even if this is only online.
Remember that being a man doesn't mean you must reject all things feminine. If you have hobbies or traits or fashion choices that are considered feminine, you don't have to reject them entirely. Feminine men are men too. Less feminine men may have an easier time ""passing"", but it's always a good idea to be yourself unless you are in a situation where it is unsafe to do so.

, This is important for two reasons. One, there are experiences that often come with being transgender that can cause stress or anxiety, such as transphobic harassment/assault, or dysphoria. Transgender individuals are highly associated with depression and suicidal thoughts (about 50%). You may want someone to talk to just to help with these problems and feelings. The second reason is, before you can progress farther, you may need a psychologist to confirm that you are in fact transgender and from there they can refer you to an endocrinologist for hormones and surgeons for the different surgeries, although in some places this is becoming no longer true since the changes in DSM 5 removed transsexualism from the list of mental illnesses (note that homosexuality was removed decades ago). Surgeons in the USA (legitimate ones at least) will not perform bottom surgery without a doctor's or psychologist's note. Never try to buy testosterone online or do it yourself! The reason that the doctor or psychologist will send you to an endocrinologist is to get blood samples to test your current hormone levels. It is vital that they do not give you too much testosterone or it will be turned by the body into estrogen, which sort of back fires your plans, right? So if your state or nation requires you to see a psychologist do it, and be patient, and if you are lucky enough to live in an area that no longer does (such as DC) it will be faster but just as safe.


It's best to find a top surgery surgeon or a psychologist who specializes in or is often seeing transgender people. If you're having a hard time finding one, try going to support groups or checking online to find out who they recommend (and do not recommend).
Transitioning is a very serious life step and you shouldn't rush into anything. If you see one, it could take the psychologist a few sessions to make a confirmed diagnosis and from there they can continue working with you through the transitioning process.

, There are a lot of steps to consider, between hormones, surgeries, coming fully out to everyone you work/live/interact with, so having a basic guideline can be really helpful. It can put everything in perspective, keep you on track, help you keep track of resources, list names of good doctors, plan when to change your name on legal documents (Drivers license, passport, birth certificate, etc) and motivate you to budget your money (which will be a big one, since most insurance plans do not pay for everything you will need to save up a few thousand dollars).


Try to be realistic. As much as you're going to want to have this all done in a year, in reality it will take several to complete. If your plans include full transitioning, a realistic goal would be more like five years. This gives you time to adjust to every step, and it also gives your family, friends, and co-workers time to adjust. Your therapist can help empower you in your process in deciding how soon you'll be ready for each step, and in some states in the USA and other places around the world, you are also required to live full time as a male for one year before receiving hormones or some surgeries (although that is changing).
Your therapist will be the best person to ask for help coming up with a working plan. They know the approximate time periods to wait between steps and they'll probably have a good idea of what's realistic based on past experiences with other patients. If you do not see a therapist, ask your transgender support group members as they can tell you when they did these steps.

, Not all trans men choose to start Hormone Replacement Therapy (or HRT) for many reasons including cost or that their body can't accept ""T""(androgen sensitivity), which does not make them any less men or transgender. Transgender males have a lot of luck when it comes to testosterone, also called ""T"", as it is very powerful really changes the body over time, unlike much milder estrogen used for MTF's. Testosterone makes your body look and feel more masculine by:


adjusting the fat distribution causing the fat to move off your hips, buttocks, thighs, and (slightly) chest, and moving it onto your stomach (you will not lose fat, just redistribute, so it is important to continue to exercise to lose weight).
increasing muscle definition (if you workout, it is not going to make you buff if you are a couch potato), broadening the shoulders, and perhaps thickening the hands and feet (may make them wider because of cartilage growth but no guarantee).

The increased muscle definition and fat movement usually squares out the face (if you are under 21, you may grow an Adam's apple as well).
Guys are able to lose fat quicker because they can gain muscle more easily (which burns a lot of fat) and thus you should be able to lose some of that stomach fat eventually (however you will gain a lot of weight first from becoming much more hungry and again you can't lose weight on Testosterone just sitting around, you must get your metabolism going regardless of your gender).
Most men report feeling a lot stronger soon after going on testosterone.


Increased body hair growth as well as facial hair growth (and loss of hair on the temples, sometimes it triggers male pattern baldness which is irreversible even if you stop using Testosterone or T.
Deepening of your voice (This can be similar to an adolescent boy's voice 'breaking' and you can lose vocal range if you sing).
Thickening of your skin and making you more tolerant of cold.
Changing your body odor and increasing sweating.
Testosterone may cause a small amount of growth if you haven't finished puberty and still have some growth left in your body.
Testosterone also stops your menstrual cycle, generally within 3 months (depending on your dose).
Your sex drive will likely increase, as will your appetite.
Your clitoris will also begin to grow. The clitoris and penis develop from the same cells in the fetal stage, and T triggers its enlargement. Usually it grows to become 2-5cm (about 1-2 inches).

This is important for metoidioplasty (one of the two options for bottom surgery), which uses the enlarged clitoris to form the penis.


Beginning hormone therapy is very much like going through a second puberty; note that if you had acne the first time around, you may once again develop acne or your skin may become more oily (get ready to dig out the Clearasil boys).
There is no exact time frame for physical changes, but your menstrual cycle should cease within 6 months. Your voice will likely be at its deepest around after 6 months to a year, the same is true regarding clitoral growth.
Most start by taking T via injections but can change to pills, patches, creams, or gels. Cost for testosterone therapy will vary depending on your dosage, method of delivery, and insurance (if you do not have insurance, you will have to pay the costs yourself; if you do have insurance, some policies cover hormone therapy for transition and some do not. Note that some universities have student insurance plans that cover some or all of the cost for hormone therapy, and sometimes will cover some surgery costs as well).
Some transmen choose to have top surgery before starting T. There are many reasons for this: some choose top surgery as the first step because continuing to have breasts once you start looking more like a male could be awkward or embarrassing; for others, top surgery is as much about psychological well-being as physical appearance - society at large holds the idea that breasts represent femininity, and for many transgender persons, they are the most uncomfortable and unwanted part of their bodies. In some instances, top surgery can turn out better before T usage, and in other cases it is better after T usage has begun, so be sure to consult with your physician and your surgeon for advice on what will be best for your situation. Still other transmen choose to use garments to minimize the appearance of their breasts while they save money for surgery; they may also start programs to lose weight in an attempt to reduce bust size and thus have more options for top surgery (there are three types based on bust size; note that weight loss does not reduce the size of breast tissue in all individuals).

, Most transgender people will start having their friends and family call them by their chosen male name at the beginning of transitioning. Usually by the time you start T, it's probably best to get a name change as you'll really start to look male. You'll have to check the laws for your state/country. Usually there is a monetary cost (as much as $200, possibly more) for processing fees.


Be sure to update your official government identification (driver's license, Social Security, Social Insurance, etc.) with your new name and new photograph, if applicable. You'll also want to notify your school or place of employment, especially if you are required carry to school and work ID cards (Note: If you live in an on-campus dormitory, there may be issues if you are residing in an all-girls dorm. Some schools accommodate transgender students by placing them in private rooms during transition, and still others will go ahead and place them in a dorm or with roommates of the gender they are transitioning to. Many schools, however, will not do this until a person fits the legal definition - of the country, state, or province- of the transitioned gender. Check with your school beforehand so that you won't have any surprises).

, As with HRT, not all trans men choose to have surgeries. If you are okay with the way your body looks without surgery, that's just as okay as if you're not. Trans men's bodies come in all shapes and sizes, just like cisgender men's. There are actually three types of surgeries you can elect to undergo to become physically more male.


Top Surgery: removes the breast tissue and makes the chest look more masculine. There are a few different procedures, which depend on chest size, skin elasticity, and what you prefer (i.e. scarring, recovery time, and risks/benefits). The three main surgeries are:


Bilateral Mastectomy or Bilateral Incision (if you have a cup size C, D, or bigger, this is your only option)

Subcutaneous Mastectomy or Keyhole (best for guys with hardly any tissue, such as AA)

Subcutaneous Mastectomy or Peri-Areolar (not as much scarring as Keyhole, but if you are bigger than B you can't do it)


Hysterectomy: is the removal of the uterus. This is often combined with Bilateral Salpingo-oophorectomy, removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.

Because testosterone stops menstrual cycles, some doctors speculate it could increase the risk of reproductive cancers (more studies are currently being conducted to determine if this is so). Your doctor may recommend getting this procedure within the first five years or so of starting testosterone. It is important to remember that once the ovaries and uterus are removed, your body will not produce testosterone on its own and you will be relying solely on Testosterone therapy. If you, for any reason, decide to quit hormone therapy, you may need to take estrogen and progesterone pills to prevent bone loss.
Many men choose to have hysterectomies so they can avoid having to see a gynecologist, as they find this embarrassing.
Some states/countries require genital surgery before a transgender person can legally change their gender.


Bottom Surgery: the construction of male genitalia. There are two types: metaoidioplasty or phalloplasty.

At the same time, surgeons can extend the urethra so the constructed penis can be used to urinate. The vagina can also be sealed during the procedure; as well, the patient can choose to have a scrotum constructed and prosthetic testicles inserted.


Some health insurance policies consider bottom surgery to be cosmetic, which means the patient is financially responsible for covering the cost, which can be expensive. Top surgery tends to run around $5,500-7,000; hysterectomy cost is similar. Bottom surgery can cost between $5,000-20,000 depending on the procedure that is chosen.

, Once again, each state/province/country has its own laws on what an individual needs to do to officially become another gender. Many require documentation from a psychologist or doctor confirming true gender. New York state requires an endocrinologist to confirm that a person has been on testosterone, as well as a surgeon to confirm that top surgery and a hysterectomy has been performed.

Notice whether she shows open appreciation for women.,
Recognize that it’s possible she’s attracted to women but doesn’t realize she’s bisexual.,
Determine whether she is going out of her way to be around another woman.,
Figure out her relationship status.",How to Tell if Another Woman is Bisexual1," If the woman seems to generally appreciate women, including their sex appeal, there is a chance she is bisexual. Does she always notice other people's looks and comment on them in a sexualized way?As with every potential clue, it’s possible she is just admiring another woman without having a sexual attraction to her. After all, women are constantly scrutinizing other women’s appearances.
However, if she repeatedly openly admires another woman’s sex appeal, maybe she is open to more.;
, This is not an uncommon phenomenon. Although it’s getting easier, it can be hard for people to admit they are bisexual to families and friends or even themselves.


Go with your intuition. Sometimes you just get a vibe. You generally know when someone seems attracted to you or someone else, right? Sometimes intuition can mean more than words. Some studies have found that up to 60 percent of women are attracted to other women, so it's not that rare. Whether they will act on it might be another story.Society encourages women to develop emotional closeness to one another. For some, this can spill over into attraction. Realize that sexuality can be very fluid. Studies have found that women define their sexuality more ambiguously as they age.
The tricky part is that many platonic female relationships mirror romantic relationships because they are built on sharing intimate details and talking about personal issues for hours on end.

, Is she always trying to strike up a conversation with you or another woman? Does she try to sit next to the woman at meetings? These could be signs of interest.


If she goes out of the way to interact with another woman in ways a partner would, that’s a sign. Does she show up at the other woman’s soccer games or head to the bar when she hears the woman is there? Does she try to arrange things where it's just for two?
Is she always texting, emailing or calling, and not to talk about guys? This could be a sign that she is trying to get closer.

, Although some women in relationships with men discover they are really bisexual, if she seems to have no man in her life, that’s also a sign she could be bisexual.


This is especially true if she seems like she has never had a man in her life in a romantic sense. Inquire about past romantic relationships that were serious.
Check out her social media. Does she post pictures of herself with only male friends and a lot of females? Does she seem to be surrounded by women a lot who aren’t relatives? What's her body language like around them? All of these could be signs.

Consider whether your friend listens and values your opinions.A meaningful and important part of being a friend is caring about what your friends have to say.,
Question if your friend respects your personal boundaries.,
Decide if you feel good after interacting with this friend.,
Reflect on your friend’s trustworthiness.If you don't feel comfortable around them and cannot tell them some of your secrets or about your past, something is wrong.,
Ask yourself if the friendship is one-sided.",How to Figure Out if Your Friend Is Worth Keeping2," When you express your ideas and opinions does your friend make an effort to listen and receive what you are saying? Or does your friend ignore your opinions and just do whatever they want?


If your voice is not being heard in this friendship, it may be a sign that you need to end it.

, Boundaries are a necessary aspect of any successful and healthy relationship. If you have set boundaries with your friend for what you will and won’t accept in the friendship, then he or she has a duty to oblige.If you have told your friend that you value privacy and keeping confidences, but she goes and shares intimate information with the entire class, then she is not respecting your boundaries. Evaluate your friendship to see if there are a lot of boundary violations. If there are, you may not have a healthy relationship.

, Sometimes, because you are dealing with a “friend,” you might overlook what a real relationship should be like. Is your friend kind to you? Does he or she know about your life, past, likes and dislikes? Does he or she seem to enjoy spending time with you? And vice versa?


You need to consider overall whether you think this relationship is a positive element in your life or simply a toxic deadweight.If no matter how much you correct them, they still seem to mix up details about your life, put you down, and or make jokes at your expense, this friendship is probably not making you feel so good.

, Have they ever spread your secrets or spread rumors about you? Do they act one way with you and then totally different with someone else? If so, they are not worth keeping. They may cause a lot of drama in your life and that’s not a sign of a healthy friendship.

, If your friendship is off-balance—meaning you are always giving and your friend is always taking—it may be a sign that the friendship is unhealthy. Sure, at some point in every friendship, one person will be doing more. However, if you can honestly say that more times than not the giving falls in your lap, then it may be time to find a new friendship.Giving behaviors might include working around your friend's schedule when you make plans, discussing your friends problems together, supporting your friend at work or social functions, caring for your friend when she is sick, etc.
""Taking"" behaviors include allowing your friend to listen to you and help you when you have a problem, letting your friend support you at an important school or work event, allowing your friend to care for you when you are sick, etc.

Decide if the friendship is worth keeping.,
Ask to have a talk.,
Get straight to the point.Although it may feel awkward to end a friendship, the ordeal will be better for the both of you if you are forthright.,
Focus on your own feelings without blaming.,
Give the person an opportunity to respond.",How to Figure Out if Your Friend Is Worth Keeping3," After you have considered how your friend treats you, you may feel ready to make a decision about whether or not the friendship is worth continuing. Review your concerns and weigh them against the positive aspects of your friendship to help you make your decision. If the friend has done some things to upset you in the past, then you might decide that you want to keep the friendship as long as your friend is willing to make an effort to change some things.


For example, if your friend always wants to discuss her problems and never listens when you need to talk, then you might say something like, ""I want to continue our friendship, but it seems like we are always focusing on your concerns. If we are going to continue out friendship, then I need to know that you will make an effort to listen to me when I need to talk.""

, Once you have decided to end the friendship, you need to formally follow-through. In some cases, it may be okay to let a friendship simply fade. However, if you have had a long friendship, see the person often, or decide to end the friendship after a horrible betrayal or indiscretion, it’s better to do the deed in person.Invite the person out for lunch or coffee so that the two of you can talk face-to-face.

, Don’t beat around the bush. Explain to your friend why you asked him or her to talk.


You might say something like “I know you’re wondering why I asked you here today. I wanted to discuss our friendship…”

, Even if the person did something terrible, there’s no use accusing or chastising the person for the wrongdoing.If you have made the decision to end it, simply say that and then explain your reasoning. Take ownership for how you feel. Try not to attack the person, but the behavior. Use “I” statements.""I"" statements provide a way for you to express yourself in a non-threatening way. Instead of using ""you,"" which has the tendency to cause defensiveness, starting a statement off with ""I"" allows you to take ownership for how you feel without blaming.
Try this approach “I think we need to end our friendship. I have been consistently hurt by you spreading rumors about me and I cannot do it any longer. I wish you well.”

, Of course, the response will not change your decision, but it is considerate and polite. The person may become defensive or angry, and that’s okay. You cannot control the reaction, but you should still stick to your guns.Allow the person to vent any frustrations or respond how they would like. If necessary, simply repeat yourself by saying “I’m sorry, but we can’t be friends anymore.”

Figure out whether she has had past experiences with women.,
Tease out her feelings.,
Go ahead and just ask her.,
Know the difference between bi-curiosity and bisexuality.,
Avoid saying things that might insult her.",How to Tell if Another Woman is Bisexual2," Women kissing women has become more common in popular culture over recent years. If the woman is open about a past experience with a woman, there is a chance she would want to do it again.


You would need to gather more information, though, such as whether she liked doing it, who initiated it, and the context surrounding what happened.
If her past or present includes girl-on-girl porn, that’s another dead giveaway. If a woman enjoys watching a woman pleasure another woman, there’s a chance she’s imagining what it would be like to feel that way herself.

, Start generically. Ask which celebrity she has a crush on, and see if she names a woman. Or ask directly which female celebrity she finds the most attractive, and why, and see how she responds.


Bring up issues in the news like gay marriage to see how she reacts. Such issues can be contentious, but broaching them can give you clues about her sexuality.
You could mention that you are gay or bi to see how she reacts. Recognize that being bisexual can be a very confusing experience for some people. She might be very unclear about any of it, so resist the urge to label and seek bottom-line pronouncements. Just gather information.

, The best way to find out if a woman is bisexual is to ask her. Do this in a roundabout way at first, though, and if she’s giving you more signals she might be bisexual, eventually come out and ask. For example, start by inquiring what she thinks of bisexuality. Or whether she’s ever found another woman attractive. Or whether she’s ever kissed a girl.
If you show an openness and genuine empathy and interest in her experiences, without judgment or pressure, she may level with you. Don’t be over serious. Ask in a casual, light-hearted way.

, A woman might be bi-curious, meaning she wants to explore sexual activity with a member of the opposite sex.


Such a person might be bisexual or they just aren’t sure. A bisexual person is clearly attracted to people of both sexes, not just in it to see if they are. Of course, a bi-curious person could learn they are bisexual with more experience. Sexuality can be very fluid.

, Bisexual women sometimes get sick of being asked clichés. It’s always a good idea to avoid generalizing any group of people and to instead get to know her as an individual.Insisting she must really be gay or implying that she’s bisexual because she wants to have a lot of sex with different people or insisting you can change her (and make her either straight or gay) are things to avoid.
Don’t assume she’s bisexual because she doesn’t like or had a bad experience with men. Let her explain how she sees her own bisexuality. Let her define herself and her experiences. Make her feel comfortable talking about it. Tell her how much you respect gay and bisexual people and how many friends you have that are bisexual. Let her know that you think it is okay and that she can trust you
Don’t make quick judgments about her. The bottom line is that, although there are some ways to get clues, there is no way to know for sure if someone is bisexual just by looking at them.

Assess her mood and body language signals.,
Watch what she does with her eyes.,
Look for clues in her fashion sense.",How to Tell if Another Woman is Bisexual3," Recognize that men are often more overt about expressing their interest in someone romantically. Women often hint.What’s her mood like when she sees you? If she becomes giddy, extra happy to see you, and full of smiles, that’s a good sign. Does she ever show jealousy? If she shows jealousy, such as when you spend time with another friend, that could be a sign she’s interested.
Is she trying to get you alone or does she only hang out with you when other friends are along? If she’s always trying to get you alone, it might mean she wants to hook up with you.
Does she have open body language (body facing toward the woman, palms up, feet pointing toward the woman) or closed (arms crossed over her chest, palms down, body facing away, etc.)

, If you catch her making eye contact with you (you’re a woman interested in her) or if you catch her making eye contact with another woman (if you’re a guy or a female friend of hers), she may be bisexual.


Persistent eye contact can be a way of creating intimate connection and to flirt. Also, you should pay attention to the amount of personal space she leaves between herself and other women. Is she trying to create a zone of intimacy?Looking someone in the eyes and then glancing away is a sign of flirtation in many cases. People don’t usually lock eyes with people they only consider friends., Avoid stereotyping people. That being said, sometimes you can pick up clues from how she dresses her body.If she goes for an androgynous look, or something like a suit-and tie combo, she might have a bisexual vibe. Other clothing that might provide a clue would be low-slung pants, Calvin Klein briefs, and trendy fitted blazers.
Keep an eye out for rainbow accessories or pins that show she’s out. Some hairstyles are more associated with being a lesbian than others, such as a barber’s cut or military cut. Short fingernails could also be a giveaway. However, absolutely none of these clues is surefire. There are many bisexual women who dress differently. It’s all individual.

Decide if both of you are equally invested in the friendship.,
Think about whether your conversations are balanced.,
Make sure you both have individual interests.",How to Evaluate if Your Friendships Are Healthy1," A healthy friendship is balanced, with both people equally invested in the relationship. For example, both friends should take time to call each other or make invitations to hang out.For example, if you are doing all the calling and inviting, it could be a sign that the friendship is unhealthy.;
, A healthy friendship is filled with conversations where both friends share their joys, frustrations, and stories. If you have a friend who calls to only talk about her problems, and rarely asks you questions about your life, you might be involved in an unhealthy friendship.The next time you have a conversation with your friend, pay attention to whether the conversation seems balanced.

, A balanced, healthy friendship means both people have individual hobbies, lifestyles, and favorite things that don’t necessarily reflect those of the other person. It’s important to maintain individuality in a healthy friendship, rather than adopting the other person’s views and interests."

Learn the terms.,
First, learn about sexual identity.,
Learn about transgender and intersex people.,
Learn about nonbinary genders.,
There's also the Q in the LGBTQIA acronym.,
Be accepting.",How to Understand Different Sexual Identity Terms,"


Lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender, and queer are the most commonly used ones, but there are more, such as nonbinary and asexual. Getting some books from the library can help you understand more about these people and how they live.;
, Sexual identity defines which gender(s) of people an individual is sexually attracted to. It says nothing about the way they dress, behave, or present themselves.


Lesbian: A lesbian is a person who identifies as female that is attracted to another person that identifies as female. Some fall into the ""butch"" (masculine) or ""femme"" (feminine) categories. However, their gender presentation is usually more nuanced than that, and not every lesbian couple is a mixture of the two.
Gay: Gay is a term to refer to all homosexual people, male or female, while lesbian is strictly for women. Gay men can be masculine, feminine or in between.
Straight: A person of ether gender attracted to the opposite gender. Also called heterosexual.
Asexual: A person who experiences little to no sexual attraction. They may still fall in love, however. For example, a panromantic asexual is capable of falling in love with someone of any gender, while a homoromantic asexual only falls in love with people of their gender. There are many sub-categories in this identity, so it all depends on how a person feels about themselves.
Aromantic: A person that does not feel romantic attraction (but can be sexually attracted to someone if they are not also asexual).
Bisexual: A person of either gender, that likes people of both their gender and other genders. In contrast to pansexuals, gender usually plays a role in their attractions.Pansexual: Sometimes described as 'gender blind', a pansexual is attracted to men, women and everything in between (agender etc.). Also known as omnisexual.

, Transgender people identify as a different gender than the sex they were assigned at birth. They usually figure this out in childhood, and then transition to their real gender (if the environment allows). Their ""real name"" and ""real gender"" are the ones that they prefer.


Transman/Transgender man/FTM/AFAB man (Assigned Female At Birth): A man who was thought to be a girl when he was born.
Transwoman/Transgender woman/MTF/AMAB woman (Assigned Male At Birth): A woman who was thought to be a boy when she was born.
Transsexual: A person who has undergone sex change surgery so that their genitals match their gender. This term is rarely used because some transgender people do not need surgery to feel comfortable with their bodies,and some people consider it offensive. Most transgender people do not use this word at all because the word has ""sexual"" in it, which usually points to sexual orientation, and gender has nothing to do with your sexuality.
Intersex: A person whose genitals did not neatly fit into the ""male"" or ""female"" category when they were born. An intersex person may be of any gender.

, Some people do not feel that they are male or female, and believe that a different label best fits them (if a label fits at all).


Genderqueer: An umbrella term people use to refer to not cisgender.
Nonbinary: An umbrella term people use to refer to a person who does not identify as male or female, and may use gender neutral pronouns.
Bi-gender: A person who switches between two genders, usually masculine and feminine gender-type behaviour depending on the situation.
Genderfluid: A person who flows between two or more gender presentation, sometimes feeling male, sometimes female, sometimes others regardless of their birth gender.
Neutrois/Neuter/Agender: A person who feels no gender.
Androgyne: A person who is multiple genders at the same time, or middle gender.

, It stands for ""queer"" or ""questioning.""


Queer: An umbrella term people use to refer to anything in the LGBTQIA+ acronym.
Questioning: People that are of any gender or circumstance that feel they may be one of the above sexualities or gender identities.

, Show sympathy and compassion for diverse people. Understand that there is more than one kind of couple and that love comes in many forms. LGBTQ people are your neighbors, family members, friends, peers, co-workers, and classmates. They are individuals, not what Hollywood stereotypes them, and are humans with dreams, feelings, and talents, just like you!

"
Gather up your knowledge of this girl you've become smitten with.,
Find a secluded place where there won't be any onlookers.,
Avoid holidays if you can.,
Open with a hug, those are always nice, but if a kiss is what your girl wants, refuse subtly.,
Be sincere and honest as you break the truth to her.,
Show her empathy and compassion, without becoming overwhelmed by emotion.,
Allow her to let out her feelings.,
Give her a chance to talk it out with you.,
Stay single for awhile.",How to Tell Your Girlfriend You Are Not a Lesbian," You're going to have to think of the least painful way to break it off, and only you will know how.;
, You don't want a public scene—you don't want to embarrass or hurt her any more than necessary. Try to find a place that doesn't hold any loving memories; that will make it harder on both of you.

, You don't want to remember this every year, and it isn't fair to burden her that way, either.

, That will direct her on the road you will need her to be on.

, Don't beat around the bush. Come to the point, but try not to be so blunt that you're more crushing than necessary. Breakups hurt and you need to keep that in mind, but do your best to care for her emotions as much as possible - don't forget that you are the one who screwed up here. She fell in love with you in good faith, believing that you returned her feelings. If it turns out this was just a passing fancy for you, then she is most definitely blameless.


Example: ""Katie, I'm so sorry to have to tell you this, because it was a surprise to me, too. I have to face the fact that I am actually straight/aromantic. I think you're so great, and there's nothing you did wrong; this is just me having a lot of feelings for you that I've never had for any other girl. I'm not saying I never was in love with you, I'm saying, though, that I can't keep it going. I care about you, but only as a friend, and I hope you won't hate me for very long.""

, Show enough sympathy so that she understands that you feel bad about breaking her heart, without becoming so overly emotional about it that you let her talk you into ""trying one more time.""


Refrain from telling her stuff that will only serve to hurt her worse, like ""I'm in love with Jonathan; that was the tip off."" You have to keep those emotions under your belt.

, This is a huge piece of news. She is going to cry, and you'll need to show some sympathy about that. You're not going to make things all better, because in the end, you're going to walk out the door and leave her. But you do owe her the consideration of allowing her to vent some of her frustration and grief to you, and treat her kindly if and when she cries. This is a huge deal to her—just wait until a guy breaks your heart, and then you'll know how she's feeling right now. The fact that your feelings for her were not real in no way means that her feelings for you were not real.

, Spend enough time with her, talk with her, answer her questions (try to dodge any about new male interests, though—that could hurt her even worse).


When you feel you've given her all the answers she needs, and when the conversation starts going in circles (you're repeating the same things over and over), it's time to go. Tell her gently: ""Look, I think we've covered this, at least as much as we can tonight. I feel really bad about it, and I wish I could do this without hurting you, but I can't. I have to go now. I'll see you."" Then leave.
Don't be swayed by pleading, waterworks, threats, etc. Just get up and leave. If you're terribly concerned that she may do something rash, call one of her loved ones (sibling, friend, parent) and let them know what's happened. Suggest they check up on her right away.
Give her some space afterwords. Even if you want to talk to her again, don't initiate anything. She probably needs space to get over her feelings, and trying to chat will just make it harder for her. Keep a polite distance, only engaging in long conversations if she is the one who initiates them.

, You need some time before you jump into another relationship. Reflect over your orientation (straight? asexual? bisexual?) and get over the breakup yourself. Take time to focus on yourself, repair, reflect, and move on.

Timing.,
Privacy.,
Sit down and explain it calmly.,
Listen to your friend.,
Give them space.,
Accept the fact that it may take time, or may not end well.",How to Tell Your Friend You Are Gay or Lesbian and Like Them Without Them Freaking Out," Seriously. Blurting it out right after they've had a bad day is not the best thing to do, but neither is putting it off until another day ... and another day ... and another day ... Choose a moment when you all have a little time to spend to talk it out, and approach the issue seriously - don't just open your mouth and blab.;
, Another important point. Telling a friend in front of a bunch of other people isn't clever. Find somewhere private, just you two.

, Ask him or her to hear you out before any comments are made.

, After all, this is your friend we're discussing, so don't forget to listen. Your friend might have had some suspicions, or might be freaked out. Whatever the reaction is, remember that you have had the chance to say your piece. Now it's your turn to let your friend respond to what you've said. Even if the reaction is bad at first, listen calmly and allow your friend to say what's on his or her mind without interruption.

, It may be a big shock for your friends, so give them space. Allow a day or two to pass, then approach them again, and ask (calmly, as usual) if they've had time to think, and whether you can talk some more about it.

, Your friends are your age, and if you've realized you're gay at a young age (pre-18), your friends may have some trouble coming to grips with it at first. Some may not get over their initial negative reaction for quite a while. Continue to be nice, friendly and open - don't be whiny, overly insistent, or creepy - don't stalk them constantly. If your friends have some trouble accepting you right away, just leave them be. If they don't come around, at least you know the truth about them - they were friends as long as it was easy and at the first sign of any difference between you, they bailed out. That's okay. Find new friends.

Observe to see if he mimics your body language.,
See if he smiles and sustains eye contact.,
Notice if he steals glances.,
Take note if he wants to know all about you.,
Watch for him touching you unnecessarily.,
Analyze if he’s nervous around you.,
Pay attention if he gives you a nickname.,
Think about whether he tries to make you laugh.,
Consider whether he treats you differently from other guys.",How to Tell If a Guy Likes You (Guys)1," When people are listening to one another intently, they tend to subconsciously imitate each other’s body language. The next time you’re engaged in a good conversation or discussion, cross your arms, put a hand under your chin, lean forward, take a drink from your glass, etc. If he tends to follow suit, it means he’s very focused on you.



Don’t waste this experiment on a ho-hum conversation; if his mind isn’t absorbed in what you’re both saying, it probably won’t work.;
, Platonic guy friends smile at each other. They also make plenty of eye contact. But if your guy makes prolonged eye contact while flashing you a big grin, he’s being far more intimate than most straight guys are around each other.

, Okay, so maybe he doesn’t stare deeply into your eyes, but if you catch him looking away suddenly when you turn to face him, it means he watches you when you’re not looking. Unless it turns out that there’s a huge glob of food on your cheek, it probably means he’s interested.

, Guys aren’t known for their ability (or desire) to untangle the threads of their guy friends’ personal lives. If your guy asks a lot of questions about your life, interests, hobbies, friends, and, most importantly, feelings, he isn’t content with chitchat and wants to get to know you on a deeper level. Or, you're his best friend.

, Straight guys may high-five, roughhouse, or even slap each other’s butts on the playing field, but most won’t feel comfortable with touches that aren’t rooted in play. If your guy lets his hand brush against yours, puts his hands on your shoulders while standing behind you, gives frequent hugs, or finds an excuse to pull something out of your hair, he’s probably trying to kick the intimacy up a notch – or even test how you react to his advances.

, Does he get sweaty palms, laugh awkwardly, or have trouble speaking when you’re around? Then he’s nervous about what you think of him – which means he’s trying to impress you.

, A group of guys will often bestow a nickname on a friend when he does something memorable, but if your guy comes up with a nickname for you on his own, especially if you haven’t done anything remarkable to earn it, he’s making a point of how special your relationship is.

, Everybody has a guy friend who’s a perpetual joker and loves the attention of a crowd, but if this guy makes a special effort to get you to laugh, he’s either trying to cheer you up (have you been blue lately?) or flirting heavily.

, Okay, so not all guys are showy about their feelings. Gay guys in particular might hold back until they know it’s safe. If he doesn’t seem to be willingly dropping you any hints, look for the opposite. Does he avoid eye contact? Speak to you quickly, briefly, or in monosyllables? Make a point of never touching you? Are you the only one he does this with? Then he either really dislikes you (if he can’t find reasons not to be there when you’re around, this likely isn’t the case) or is struggling with his feelings for you.

Think about how your friend makes you feel.,
Reconsider overly critical friendships.,
Think about whether the friendship feels like an obligation.,
Talk with someone you trust.",How to Evaluate if Your Friendships Are Healthy2," Hanging out with friends should bring positivity to your day, elevate your mood, and make you feel good about yourself. If hanging out with a friend makes you feel negative, agitated, or bad about yourself, you should pay attention to this red flag. It could signify that this friendship is unhealthy.Try making a list of your feelings after hanging out with your friend. In a healthy friendship this list will include positive feelings.
Consider how often you and your friend complain when you are together. If your friendship is based on mutual complaining about problems, then it may not be a healthy relationship.

, In a healthy friendship, both people support each other. While it’s normal to provide feedback and criticism to a friend, this should not be a hallmark of the relationship. Unhealthy friendships sometimes include constant criticism that is rooted in jealousy and cruelty.For example, if your friend is continually pointing out your mistakes, you might be in an unhealthy friendship.
Consider whether you have been making excuses for being mistreated and criticized. If so, then this is a big red flag of being co-dependent.
Also, consider if your friendship is keeping you from growing personally or if you are maintaining the friendship due to personal fears. If so, then this is another sign of an unhealthy relationship.

, Take some time and think about whether you feel obligated to be friends with a particular person. Healthy friendships are based on mutual respect and interest in developing and maintaining a connection with another person.If you feel like you have to be friends with someone, rather than wanting to be friends, you could be involved in an unhealthy relationship

, Discussing your concerns with an objective third party, such as another trusted friend or a family member may help you to evaluate your relationship. It can be hard to evaluate your relationship once you have been in it for a long time, but someone outside of your relationship may be able to provide objective feedback. They can alert you to things that you may not have been aware of, especially if these things have become normal for you."

Make honesty a priority.,
Take trustworthiness into account.,
Maintain relationships that are mutually supportive.",How to Evaluate if Your Friendships Are Healthy3," Being honest with one another is an important part of a healthy friendship. Dishonesty is a sign your friendship might be unhealthy. A healthy friendship is one where both people are genuine, honest, and comfortable being their true selves in the relationship.For example, a good friend should not lie, make excuses, or hide the truth from you.

, Trustworthy friends are an important part of a healthy, fulfilling life. Everyone needs a friend with whom they share intimate details of their life. You should be able to trust a friend in whom you confide.For example, a good friend should not divulge your secrets or betray your trust.

, In a healthy friendship, both people are equally invested in supporting the other. You should both take time to support one another, whether that means being an active listener during your conversations or helping one another through tough times.Make time in your life for friends who value mutual support.

Consider ending the unhealthy friendship.",How to Evaluate if Your Friendships Are Healthy4," The first step in dealing with an unhealthy friendship is being honest with yourself and with your friend. Try writing down what is bothering you about the friendship.Make a list of all the healthy and unhealthy aspects of your relationship, placing a star next to things you’d like to change.
After you make your list, write out possible solutions to the issues you identified.

, Ask your friend to sit down and talk about your friendship. Be honest with your friend about what is bothering you, and why you think the friendship might be unhealthy.


Try saying, “Kendra, I really value our friendship, but I feel like our relationship is unbalanced. I’d really like it if you asked me more questions about what’s going on in my life.”

, After talking with your friend about the relationship, you will have a better idea of whether you want to mend or end your friendship. Some unhealthy friendships are not worth your time and energy, while others are worth saving.Only you can decide whether or not you want to continue being in a particular friendship.

, If you decide you want to work on the friendship, both friends will need to spend time and energy making changes. Sit down together and make a list of ways you can both work on making your friendship healthier. Then make an honest effort to do your part.


If you or your friend do not make the agreed upon changes, you might want to consider ending the friendship.

, Deciding to end a friendship can be a difficult decision, even if the relationship is unhealthy. If you decide to end an unhealthy friendship, consider telling your friend why you are ending the relationship instead of ghosting them.Sometimes a simple email will suffice, while other times a conversation on the phone or in person is necessary.
Giving your former friend and yourself closure is the respectful way to end an unhealthy friendship.

Make peace with whatever happens.",How to Tell a Friend You're Gay and You Love Them," Explore your identity and keep in mind that the first step in coming out and telling your friend that you love them is being comfortable with your own feelings. Because of societal pressures and expectations related to sexual orientation and gender identity, this isn’t always an easy process. Work on getting more comfortable in your own skin so that you can be strong and confident when you come out.
, Consider how you would like to come out to your friend. Remember, there’s no “right” way to come out. Just do what is most comfortable for you. You can make a big announcement or just casually slip it into conversation. Things you may wish to consider:


Decide if you would rather tell your friend individually or in a group setting.
Think about places you’d be comfortable telling your friend. Consider a place or activity you both enjoy; for example, getting coffee, playing tennis, or while at your favorite pizza place.
Give your friend enough time to ask questions and respond to you. Make sure they’re able to be focused on what you’re saying to them. For example, you might not want to tell them between classes or if they are running late for an appointment.

, Before you share the romantic feelings you have toward your friend, you want your friend to know that you are gay. Come out to your friend before you tell them you are in love with them. Give them a few weeks to process this news first.


It is best to just come right out and say it: “Matt, I’m gay” or “Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I’m gay.” Try not to get yourself worked up over it and wait for the “perfect” moment.Do your best to speak clearly, even though you might be nervous. It might be more stressful to have to repeat yourself!

, This will help you determine if you want to move forward in sharing your romantic feelings at a later point. They may be happy for you, freaked out, or somewhere in between.They might want to talk to you a lot about it, or they may just say, “Okay, that’s cool,” and change the subject.
Answer their questions. They may ask you how long you’ve known, if you’ve told anyone else, how you’re feeling, or how they can help you. Be honest and open with your friend.
It is possible that your friend had suspicions, and if so, will probably say they aren’t surprised.

, Hopefully, your friend will respond positively to your news, but there is a chance that they will not. Be prepared that it might not be received well.


If your friend gets angry or upset about the news, you could say, “I’m sorry this has made you upset. I hope you can support me anyway. This is who I am.” Then give your friend some space to process the news.Your friend may just need a little time to accept the news. Remember, it likely took you a long time to come to accept who you are! You can extend the same patience to your friend.
If they are not supportive and continue to remain unsupportive, you will probably not want to continue the friendship. This will be painful, especially if you have romantic feelings toward the person, but you do not want to be in any type of relationship with someone who does not accept you for who you are.

, In this moment, it’s very normal to have feelings of fear, isolation and shame, but you may also feel liberated, courageous and happy, especially if your friend was supportive and enthusiastic about your coming out. There are a lot of emotions for you to process and work through, and this is a lot of news for your friend to process as well. Don’t drop another bombshell on them just yet.


Wait a few weeks to determine your next steps, to allow your friend to process your news and for you to see how they take it.

, If you haven’t already, it is a good idea to tell others that you are gay, too, besides just your friend. Pick a few people you know and feel comfortable with to tell first. Do your best to stay hopeful and optimistic and remember that whether people’s reactions are positive or negative, you are a worthy, valuable person. Above all, make sure to go at your own pace and always do what is best for you during this time., Talk to another person besides your friend to help figure out what you are feeling, and to figure out what steps to take. The listening ear of another close friend or a trusted mentor may help you clarify what you want to do.


Ask for your friend/mentor’s perspective on the situation, and what they would do if they were in your shoes. You could ask, “What would you do if you were gay and had a crush on your friend?”
If you and your confidant have this friend in common, he or she may be able to help you figure out how your crush will take the news. Of course, you want to be talking to a person you trust, who will not be spreading your personal business to others. You probably don’t want your crush to find out your feelings from someone else.
For example, you might say to a mutual friend, “I think I have feelings for Tom. I really want to tell him, because we’re such great friends, and I think we would be such a good couple. But I don’t know if it’s a good idea. What do you think? You’ve known him as long as I have, and I’d appreciate your point of view.”

, After you tell your friend you’re gay, pay close attention to their behavior when they’re around you for a while. Keep in mind that their initial behavior towards you may not be their genuine feelings towards you, especially if your announcement was a shock to them. You may want to wait a period of weeks or months before you take the next step.


Watch their body language around you. If they are leaning towards you, smiling, or even acting flirtatiously toward you, they may be receptive toward your feelings.Conversely, if you find them moving away from you or not making eye contact, they still may be adjusting to you telling them you’re gay. You may want to wait until they are more comfortable with you, or not say anything at all.

, If you know for a fact that your friend is straight or has another sexuality that is not compatible with yours, it might not be worth the risk of ruining a friendship by sharing your feelings.If you are unsure of your friend’s sexuality, or think it is more fluid, you may want to tell them you’re in love with them.

, Telling someone you are in love with them changes the nature of the relationship. Consider that there is a risk of ending the friendship. There is also the chance that your friend will have feelings for you.


Think about your friendship. Do you think your friend would still be friends with you if you said you were in love with them? Would it be okay if your relationship if you disclosed your feelings? Would you begin a romantic relationship with your friend, even though it risks a breakup down the road?

, Think about several outcomes of your conversation and decide how you would react and handle the results. Also consider how you would feel if you decided to keep your feelings about your friend to yourself.


Your friend may respond warmly to your announcement but not be interested in having a romantic relationship. Would you be able to handle still remaining friends, knowing it will not go any further?
You may want to imagine your worst-case scenario, and determine if revealing your feelings is worth the risk of a negative outcome: ruining your friendship or your friend gossiping about you, for example.
Imagine how you think you would feel keeping your secret. Do you think the feeling would subside as time passes, or as life changes (for example, if you move away)?

, You may decide it is, because you want to be open and honest with your friend.


On the other hand, you may have a hunch that your friend doesn’t feel the same way as you and decide to wait.

, Make sure to talk to your friend privately. Choose a time and place where you can have a private conversation.


Have your conversation in person if at all possible. It is easier to determine their reaction than via phone or text.
Do not talk to your friend while you are intoxicated. It might feel easier, but your friend will not take you seriously.
You could also consider writing your friend a letter to express your feelings, if you are too nervous to do it in person.

, Share your history and your friend’s importance in your life. Help your friend to understand where your feelings come from.You could say, “We’ve been friends for a long time. Your friendship means so much to me, and I can’t thank you enough for supporting me after I came out. We have so much fun together, and I really enjoy being with you.”

, Let your friend know that you are in love with them (or have a crush on them, whatever language you want to use). Acknowledge that this might be awkward or uncomfortable for them.


For example, “I am in love with you. I know you might think this is really weird, but I want to be honest about my feelings for you.”
Say you thought for a long time about telling them because you were worried it would ruin your friendship. For example, “I have wanted to tell you for a long time, even before you knew I was gay, but I waited because I didn’t want to drop all these bombshells on you at once. I don’t want to ruin our friendship, but I also decided I wanted to be honest with you.”
Express how sharing your feelings makes you feel. You could say, “I am so scared to tell you this because I am scared you don’t feel the same way, and that I am ruining our friendship by sharing this with you.”

, Your friend might not know what to say. Let them know it’s okay if they don’t want to say anything right now and want to think about it.


You could say, “I’m sure that was really overwhelming to hear. It’s okay if you don’t want to talk about it right now. But I would like to know what you think.”
Keep in mind that your friend may never respond directly about their feelings for you. They might not feel the same way, or they are confused, or they are uncomfortable. If so, let it go and move on. You said what you needed to say, and the ball is in your friend’s court.

, Be proud of yourself for sharing your feelings. Telling a crush you like them is a big deal no matter what, because you have made yourself vulnerable and shared a very deep part of who you are with them. It takes a lot of bravery to do this, so hats off to you!


Give your friend some distance if your announcement did not go over well, and accept that it’s what they need to do right now.
Your friendship may or may not rebound from the pronouncement of your feelings. If your friend does not want a romantic relationship, it may take time before things feel “normal” again between the two of you.
If your friend is not interested, you may find yourself moving on anyway. You have gotten this off your chest and now feel freer to pursue other romantic opportunities. You may be less heartbroken than you think."

Try subtle touches.,
Get closer to him.,
Pop the question.,
Give it time to develop.",How to Tell If a Guy Likes You (Guys)2," Let your hand touch his, you can let it ""accidentally"" touch. If he moves it out of the way quickly, then he may not be interested- watch his facial expression. On the other hand, if he slowly moves it, or doesn't withdraw at all, then he may be interested.

, When you are sitting on a sofa, lean towards him – a bit like in the movies when the guy trying to get the girl reaches his arm out across her shoulders. Don't turn your head toward him right away. If he moves away from you, this slims the chances of him being attracted to you. But if he either has a very slight or no reaction, or he repeats the gesture to you, then this increases the chances that he is interested and attracted.

, Well, not literally - you don't have to ask him to marry you. But at this stage, if he responds to ""accidental"" touches and obvious interest from you with a return of those gestures, you need to just come out and say the words. Say something like, ""You know, I'm getting a vibe from you, and I wonder if I'm reading it right. Are we just friends, or is there something more there?"" Give him a chance to think it over and answer - don't rush him. Maybe he isn't sure himself, or maybe this is his first experience. He may not be clear about how he feels. If you are still in doubt, you should then say you are attracted to him and make no bones about it. If he smiles or nods, that's a good sign.

, Once you've made your interest in him known, that will tell the tale. If he is interested and into you, he will be calling or dropping by very soon. If he isn't, he'll probably start avoiding you. If you're okay with just being friends, give him a little space and then make contact with him. When you do, don't flirt with him at all - show him that you may be interested, but you are okay with being just friends. If he's straight, there's nothing you can do about that, nor should you try. But if he's interested, give him a little time to think things over. Don't just write him off if he doesn't immediately call for a date. Keep contact up, and be patient.

, Treat it the same way you'd treat questions like ""Why do people get married?"" or ""Why do people have crushes?"" This sends the message that same-gender couples are normal, and nothing to get worked up about.

, Frame a relationship as one of responsibilities, personalities, identities and mutual support and caring - things that make everyone human. Don't discuss LGBT+ sex in a way you wouldn't discuss heterosexual sex.


If your child is curious about sex, then give them honest and accurate information. If they turn out not to be straight, they may have a same-sex relationship, and you'll want them to get information from a reliable source.

, The most credible answers to any child about sexual orientation are answers that are solely informative based on credible information, and are without any agenda, political affiliation or religious dogma. Keep out rhetoric or judgment.


Look to credible sources such as the American Psychological Association (APA) when looking for facts.

, Most kids are only looking to understand the basics, and if they want greater detail in an area, they'll ask. Simple is usually the best. They are two people who love and care about each other.


More inquisitive or older children may be interested in marriage, taxes, sex, and other issues. Young children probably aren't ready for this.

You may worry you’re not going to be accepted by your peers or family members. You may start to feel isolated from others.


If your family, culture, and/or religion is against LGBT identities, you might have more difficulty with feelings of fear, shame, and denial.At this stage, it’s normal for you to compartmentalize your sexual identity or to feel like being a lesbian may not be permanent.;
, To move past the negative feelings of shame and isolation, explore more about what it means to be a lesbian. Seek out and connect to other lesbians. Find out more about LGBT culture.


If you are a university student, most campuses have a LGBT resource center, where you can find information, community resources, cultural events, and supportive people.
If you are teenager, and have a family and school that is accepting of LGBT identities, consider connecting with resources in your school, such as your guidance counselor or other students.
If you are a teenager and don’t feel safe going to anyone in your community, find online resources from The Trevor Project. They have online resources about sexual orientation and the coming out process, as well as a safe space for you to chat with others online for more information. They also have a hotline you can call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week., Once you’ve accepted who you are, it’s time to share that with others. Choose who to come out to and when you want to tell them. You do not have to come out to everyone at once, and some people choose to come out only to their friends and family, but not at work.Choose someone who is supportive of you to be the first person you come out to.
Prepare yourself for negative reactions and rejection. Unfortunately, some people may not be accepting of you. Don’t give up hope, they may just need time to adjust., Begin immersing yourself in the lesbian community more. Find out about lesbian subculture, values, and organizations. Find LGBT-friendly churches and businesses. Look for festivals, events, and support groups for lesbians in your community. Consider joining or following the news of these organizations:


National Center for Lesbian RightsAmnesty International
PFLAG chapters available in every state.
GSA Network for teens and youth identifying as queer or transgender., Having lesbian role models you can look to helps affirm you can be who you are. Seeing these women and their success will give you a sense of pride and hope. Consider paying attention to people like:


Ellen DeGeneres
Rachel Maddow
Ellen Page

, Before you become an activist, start with small ways to show your pride. You can do simple things like:


Fly a rainbow flag.
Put the Human Rights Campaign logo on your car.
Watch television shows that affirm lesbians, like ""Orange is the New Black.""

, Be open and authentic in public. Don't be afraid to hold hands or kiss your partner or girlfriend in public. Don't feel the need to hide the fact that you're dating a woman.


Use caution and know where it's safe to show your pride.
Every time you meet someone new at work or in your community, share your story, or advocate for LGBT rights and equality, you're continually coming out. You’ve likely helped someone else who is struggling with their identity., There is a stereotype that if you're a lesbian, you must look ""butch"" or dress more like a man. This isn't necessarily true. Celebrate lesbians of all shapes, sizes, and styles., When others say discriminating things like ""dyke,"" ""fag,"" or ""that's so gay,"" explain what words are okay to use for the LGBT population. Educate and encourage others, heterosexual people especially, to become allies. Challenge heterosexual people to examine their privilege, gender roles, and sexuality., Advocate for lesbian and gay rights. You can do this by:Going to rallies and demonstrations.
Participating in LGBT Pride parades and celebrations.
Joining and advocating on behalf of CenterLink, a network of LGBT Community Centers.Ensuring your employers recognize same-sex partners in your health plan.
Visiting your representatives in Congress and educating them on the needs of the LGBT population.
Protesting in other areas in the world where LGBT people face discrimination.

, Recognize the struggles, challenges, and discrimination you've faced because you’re a lesbian. It’s not always been easy for you, but it’s allowed you to develop strength in the face of adversity. Take time to celebrate your greater self-confidence, pride, and increased empathy for others.

, Sexual orientation is only one part of who you are. Increase your time spent in other communities and cultures, not just lesbian-oriented, and be comfortable being a lesbian in these other spaces. Allow yourself to build trust, communication, relationships, and connection with others who are not lesbians. Continue to educate them and be proud of who you are."

Register every time you use gay in a derogatory manner.,
Avoid talking about negative subjects.,
Come up with alternative phrases or words to use.,
Apologize immediately.,
Stop other people from using the word inappropriately.","How to Stop Using the Word ""Gay"" Inappropriately1"," Every time you use the word gay to refer to someone or something that you don't like or think is stupid, wrong or bad in any way, take a mental note. Examine why you want to use it. What situations are you in when this usually happens?


Keep track of the times that you say it, think it, or almost use the word. You can even write it down.
If you find yourself using it when you are around certain people or discussing certain topics, you may want to limit your time in those scenarios until you get things under control. You could also be more careful in those situations because you know they trigger your use of the word.;
, When ""gay"" is used inappropriately, it is typically to describe something that is negative, silly, or dumb. If you do not talk about these things, you will be less likely to call something ""gay."" Spend more time talking about good and positive things and experiences.If you find yourself in the middle of one of these conversations, try to think of something positive to say or change the subject.
It will take time to change the way you speak and the type of conversations you find yourself in.

, When using replacements, remember that they apply not only to spoken language, but also to writing and thinking. If you constantly challenge yourself to use alternatives, you will eventually become used to using these alternatives. The alternative words and phrases will eventually become part of your vocabulary.


Instead of using ""gay"" try using ""inappropriate,"" ""weird,"" ""strange,"" ""wrong,"" out of place,"" out of line,"" or ""out of order.""Expand your vocabulary to have more words to pull from. Having a wider knowledge of words that you have at your disposal is amazingly useful.
Buy yourself a thesaurus, a word-a-day calendar, or add a word-a-day widget to your browser's homepage.

, You may have a slip up when you are trying to stop using the word ""gay."" If you do make the mistake, apologize immediately. When you apologize immediately, it shows that you are trying to change, and you are taking responsibility.You might say, ""I'm sorry. I chose the wrong word. I meant to say ____.""
You can also say, ""I'm trying to stop saying that word. It slipped out. I'm sorry if I offended anyone. Please forgive me.""

, It can be difficult to stop doing something when everyone around you is doing the same thing. Even though you are trying to stop, constantly hearing the word used casually can keep it in the back of your mind. This does not have to be done in a rude or confrontational manner. Try some of the following phrases when it happens.""Do you know what ""gay"" means?
""You are probably not trying to be hurtful, but using the word ""gay"" to describe something that is bad or stupid is hurtful. Do you know why this is hurtful?""
""Using the word ""gay"" as a put down is not okay. That is a hurtful word and affects the people around you""
""Could you not use that word around me? I don't think it's cool, and I'm trying to stop saying it.""

Understand that God does not care who you are sleeping with.,
Address ""No bed men... (usually translated as ""homosexuals,"" even if hedonist is surely a better interpretation)http://biblehub.com/greek/733a.htmhttp://biblehub.com/greek/733b.htmhttp://biblehub.com/greek/2845.htm...will inherit the kingdom."",
Review the sins of Sodom.,
Read the Bible for yourself.,
Read in your language.",How to Reconcile Your Orientation and Christianity,"
Despite the effluvium of interpretations of Scripture, and the apparent availability of passages that might suggest otherwise, understand that the Bible is a reflection of spiritual principles, and it is incorrect, and sinful, to use the Bible to condemn others, which is plainly stated, in many places. Thus the references to ""homosexuality"" should likely be taken in the same spirit as ""prostitution"" in the following: Hosea 4:12 My people consult a wooden idol, and a diviner's rod ...... My people ask their wooden idols for help. A piece of wood tells them what to do. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray.

, don't you know that there is no marriage in heaven? So, no heterosexuals will inherit, either, in that sense. But since this is still not clear, and you have not heard a witness yet,
To put that another way, we are ""two men in a bed,"" in an incestuous relationship with Law and Grace, and one is taken, and the other is left. And this is a divorce, which we can read about @ ""And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel, I had sent her away and given her a writ of divorce..."" (hmm, more sexual innuendo). We are invited into a marriage, of Law and Grace.(be advised that you probably do not want to engage with those people, however)
See that God is not interested in who you are sleeping with, per se, although that is an expression of our spiritual state, speaking broadly. He only cares about your incestuous marriage. We can read of prophets walking around stark naked for years, too. Now, shouldn't this mean it is ok to be a hedonist, in that case? Christ came, not to judge you, so do not expect judgement from anyone other than people, ok. But recognize the spiritual state of a hedonist, which since that sounds religious recognize how a hedonist comes off to you, to people, that being self-centered, egotistical, and we are now discussing the part that matters, rather than the part people obsess over.
, These will verify this position....just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.
This is the biggie. scary, huh. get that one tossed at ya a lot, don't you. Do they ever recite the whole thing though? Here's the frame,For certain men have secretly slipped in among you--men who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe--ungodly men who have turned the grace of our God into a license for evil and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe. And He has kept, with eternal chains in darkness for the judgment of the great day, the angels who did not keep their own position but deserted their proper dwelling.
And so, we see people who have ""denied Christ, and turned Grace into a license for evil"" being compared to the Wanderers who had no faith, equating them with the Nephilim, who did not keep their position (who again are conflated with ""sexual"" perversion, even though angels are sexless), portrayed as having ""indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh in the same way as these.""
Now you will see other translations of these verses--and you should go read them , you always get a fuller understanding in parallel; there are five in parallel right there--some with a more ""sexual"" take on ""license for evil,"" etc. but rather than detracting from the point, notice how they add to it, because again, it is Grace that is portrayed as being perverted, into...well, quite a number of different characterizations, an amazing variety, actually, let's lexiconthat, wherein we see
""asélgeia (from aselgēs/""brutal"") – properly, violent spite which rejects restraint and indulges in lawless insolence (wanton caprice)""
being done to Grace.
We'll just bring up the other four occurrences of ""sins of Sodom"" for a complete picture,The expression of their faces bears witness against them, And they display their sin like Sodom; They do not even conceal it.
(the Israelites, haughtily denying God)Now the men of Sodom were wicked exceedingly and sinners against the LORD.
(setting up the famous violence scene at Lot's house)But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his evil; all of them have become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah. (prophets ""committing adultery"")
And finally, a listing of the sins of Sodom,Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy.
(Sodom being the ""sister"" of Jerusalem, here; get it?)
Which pretty well encompasses the state of mind of the inhabitants, including the (psychotically) arrogant episode at Lot's place, wherein careless, violent debauchery is being portrayed, and gay people who love your neighbor simply are not.
A perspective that is broadly understood to be ""unnatural"" by most people--yet which feels completely natural to you--is being used to expound upon our perversion of Grace, in such a way as to provide a false imprimatur for oppression of others, so that hearts may be revealed, and strangely--because let's face it, God is strange, the Unknown God--to work a blessing in the oppressed, which might be hard to grasp, until you reflect upon the parent/child relationship that you have been on at least one end of. And if you are a child with absentee parents, and cannot relate to that, suffice it to say that people are often hard on other people out of love, and not always fear., Seek your own salvation. You are specifically commanded to read for yourself, with the Spirit as your guide; and you might note that Paul, the writer of much of the body of the New Testament--who incidentally is talking in the same code, because he is talking about the same stuff--purposely avoided the other Apostles in Jerusalem for three years, so as not to absorb their opinions, but be led by the Spirit. And, when he did finally meet them, he found no cause to be impressed, or change his point of view., As a great first read, try a Message Bible, and don't hesitate to go to the lexicon--a click away now--and make up your own translation, based upon the most applicable definitions of each word. You are not compelled to trust anyone else's translation, when you have the virtual original, right there in the Lex, and in fact that comes the closest to honoring the Scriptural instruction. ""Find the right translation, and then let the Spirit guide you"" is not in there, anywhere."

Accept differences in others.,
Consider allowing LGBT+ media into the house as well as heterosexual media.,
Demolish negative biases.,
Discuss the spectrum of orientations.,
Don't make assumptions about your child's orientation.,
Keep explanations simple for young children.,
Go into greater detail for older children and preteens.,
Prepare teens for the realities of adult life.",How to Tell a Child About Same‐Gender Relationships2," This includes LGBT people, but also disabled people, people of color, religious minorities, and more. If you teach children that diversity is natural and nothing to be afraid of, they are more likely to respond well when they meet someone who is not like them.


Treat groups of minorities the same way you'd treat anyone else. That can say a lot to a child who is observing.
Answer questions calmly to reinforce that this is typical. ""Yes, I see those women holding hands. Maybe they're in love.""

, Your child has seen the princess kiss the prince again and again, so you may want to let them see a princess kiss another princess once or twice (or no one at all).


Screen content to make sure that it delivers an appropriate message and fits your child's age and maturity level. For example, a mature 16-year-old might be ready for Orange is the New Black, while a 6-year-old would be better off with books about the boy with two daddies or the girl who has a crush on another girl.

, Once kids reach a certain age, they have probably already heard the phrase, ""oh that's so gay"". They have already heard epithets, slang terms, been introduced to stereotypes regarding nearly every single demographic group, including LGBT persons. This is a time to impart factual, carefully selected and credible information.


Encourage them to be empathetic towards people of other orientations, and to consider their feelings.

, Explain that not all men are attracted to women (and vice versa). There is a wide variety of orientations, including gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, and aromantic.

, If you assume that your child will be straight, this puts pressure on them, and may make them afraid to be honest with themselves or you. Instead, make it clear that you love them and that this love won't change based on sexual orientation.


Trust them to figure out their orientation. Be supportive and accepting, whatever they realize about themselves.
For example, instead of asking ""Have you noticed any cute boys yet?"" ask ""Do you have a crush on anybody?"" This way, if your child actually likes girls, they'll feel that they can tell you.

, Just as a man and woman fall in love with each other, two men or two women might fall in love. Reduce fear or uncertainty by focusing on how same-gender relationships are very similar to mixed-gender relationships.


Leave out mentions of gender when discussing relationships in general. For example, instead of ""When a man and woman fall in love,"" say ""When two people fall in love."" This helps lay the groundwork for understanding that love is not only limited to heterosexuals.

, They may have noticed discrimination or the erasure of same-gender couples, and you might want to explain as much of that as they are ready for. They might have questions about how sex works, and you can help them find answers.


Emphasize the importance of respect for people who are different. Many kids start developing serious crushes around their preteen years, so your child might have LGB peers at school.

, Discrimination will happen, and they'll have to choose how to respond when they witness it. They'll meet people whose identities are new to them, so help them feel comfortable with that idea and not conflate something new with something dangerous. If you instill good values in them, they should grow up to be accepting, compassionate adults.


Talk to them about how to handle bigotry. These things can be sudden and alarming, so it helps if they already have an idea in their head of what they would do.

Accept that you have power over your tongue.,
Determine if what you are saying is true.,
Ask yourself if your words are kind.,
Ask yourself if using the word is necessary.","How to Stop Using the Word ""Gay"" Inappropriately2"," Before you can begin to change the words you use, recognize that you have power over the words you speak. You do not have to speak first and think later. If you have a problem with speaking before you think, you can train yourself to slow down and be more thoughtful with your words.Practice closing your mouth before you speak. If you are having a conversation with someone, this will force you to pause before you speak.
Closing your mouth as soon as you feel it opening teaches you self-control.
Learning to think before you speak is a process. It is a very valuable thing to learn. It will help you to not only stop using the word ""gay"" inappropriately, but it will also help you in many other situations in life.

, Before you say anything, ask yourself if what you are about to say is true.You know that the word ""gay"" has an actual definition that applies to a specific situation. Is what someone said truly ""gay?"" Did someone do something that was ""gay?"" It probably is not.


By choosing to speak only words that are true, you can avoid a lot of gossip and misunderstanding.
Asking yourself this question can also help you use a word that is more appropriate for what you are actually trying to say.

, What are your true intentions when you are using this word. Are you trying to express yourself? Are you trying to fit in? Are you trying to be funny? Are you trying to hurt someone? Will what you say hurt someone?


When you describe something as ""gay,"" you are probably not saying something that is kind or helpful.
If your goal is to be funny or express yourself, what other ways can you do this and still be kind? There is always an alternative.

, Is it important for you to say what you are saying? Do you have to say it at this particular time? Are you adding anything to the conversation? Does the other person need to hear what you are saying?


There may be times that you should choose to be silent instead of calling something ""gay."" If this is the case, don't make a comment at all.
There may be other times that it is appropriate for you to be speaking, but you should just use a different word.
A good rule for deciding if what you are saying is truly necessary is to decide if what you are saying is more important than being silent."
"
Know the true definition of the word.,
Recognize that using the word gay as a derogatory term is offensive.,
Know that words have meaning regardless of your intention.","How to Stop Using the Word ""Gay"" Inappropriately3"," The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) defines ""gay"" as an ""adjective used to describe people whose enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attractions are to people of the same sex."" This is the only appropriate way to use the word ""gay."" Any time you use the word to mean something other than this, you are using it inappropriately.Unless someone has told you that they are gay, do not use this word to describe them. It is not your job or business to discuss another person's sexuality.
Also avoid calling gay people ""homosexuals."" This term is considered out of date and can be offensive to gay people.

, Using the word gay to insult something or someone implies that you think there is something wrong with being homosexual. Even if you do not believe there is something wrong with being gay, your use of ""gay"" in this manner suggests that you do. This can also be hurtful to people around you. You do not always know that you around a gay person or someone that has gay friends or family members.For gay people, constantly hearing the word ""gay' used inappropriately can have a negative impact on their mental health and how they feel about themselves. You do not want to contribute to anyone's pain.
Using the word inappropriately can also give people the impression that you are insensitive or have an issue with people that are gay. You do not want people to think things about you that are not true.

, Although you may not have intended to be offensive or hurt someone's feelings when you use the word ""gay"" as a derogatory term, the end result still remains. You cannot take back or cancel something that you have said. Even if you apologize and explain yourself, your words can still hurt.Your words can be used to both help and harm.
Your words have a life of their own once they leave your mouth. Think of your words as a living, breathing extension of yourself. What you say may stick around once you have left. For example, you may casually call something ""gay,"" but the person may think about what you said throughout the day.

Try to use some humor.,
Remind that person that there are not just two simple sexes (let alone two genders).,
Try to appeal to their empathy.,
Remind them that, in many places, there are laws that prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ* people.,
Firmly state that being part of any LGBTQ* group is not a mental illness, a sin or wrong in any way.,
Explain that people's identifications may fluctuate as they discover more and more about themselves.,
Stress that being gay, transgender etc.,
Point out that cisgender people too sculpt their bodies to match their ""inner beauty standards"": larger boobs, bigger muscles, long/short hair, punk style or academic style, makeup/no makeup etc...,
Encourage them to recognize and appreciate the experiences of others.",How to Respond to Someone Being Disrespectful About Gender Identity or Sexuality," It is a very powerful tool. If you can make the person laugh at themselves (and their own silly response), it makes it easier to let them see other people's points of view. For example, you could humorously misgender or misname them. , Bring up the fact that intersex people exist - they may have ambiguous genitalia and other sex characteristics (like chromosomes) so they can't be strictly defined as ""male"" or ""female"" in terms of their biology. They, too, usually identify with some gender identity - and it doesn't have to match their genitalia (or assigned sex). In other words, not all intersex people automatically identify as ""intersex/genderless/a bit of both"" but they too can strongly identify as men or women. They too like to be referred to as ""she"" or ""he"" accordingly and they use the gendered spaces appropriate to them (matching that gender identity).
They too are assigned a sex at birth and they are brought up accordingly - but it doesn't always match their true gender!
Informing your friend about this might make them see that physical sex characteristics don't have to determine a person's sense of self!

, Explain that while using the right pronoun or terms is not a big deal to them, it is a huge deal to the transgender individual involved. Tell them that misgendering, willful dead-naming (calling by birth name) etc. cause anxiety, depression and real hurt to that person's feelings. Tell them straight that they are capable of learning to use a certain set of pronouns each time they meet a new person, so they are perfectly capable to learn what pronouns to use when the person in question happens to be transgender. Explain to them that it hurts exactly as much as it would hurt to deliberately misgender a cisperson. That is the same way it feels to a transgender person. , Just like it's wrong and illegal to discriminate against people based on their ethnicity or faith, discrimination based on gender expression can be just as harmful. If possible, find out about local laws and teach the person about them. This might help them see that what they are doing isn't just harmful and hurtful - it might be also illegal! , Explain that you can respect other people and treat them with respect - even if you're not familiar with their lifestyle or personal traits. Do not get into an argument about this, though. Firmly state it as a fact, end of discussion. Let them think about what you just said on their own.


You can also point out that homosexual behavior is documented in 1,500 different species other than human, so it's a natural part and expression of sexuality. Only people have condemned it wrong. .

, That does not mean a certain identity wasn't valid. Tell them it's necessary to respect every person's feelings and they are always valid at that time. Even if their identity changes later, that was how the person in question described themselves and their experience at the moment, the best they could. Remind them that other people's identities can't be seen from outside and it's up to each individual to figure out things about themselves; it's nobody else's job. , is not a choice! They might not be aware of that. People don't ""choose"" to like certain things or people or to be certain way - just as you don't choose to like brown bags or blue shoes or look certain way (blue eyes, dark hair, olive skin).


An intersex person didn't choose to be born with ambiguous genitalia, and transgender people don't choose to be born with sex characteristics that don't match their sense of self. No matter how someone identifies (man, woman, genderless, non-binary, trans...), their outward expression and appearance is a reflection of their unique, real personality.
Being attracted to certain individuals or certain types of people is entirely subjective to that person in question. You can't ""choose"" who you are attracted to, just like straight cispeople can't. This might be a hard concept to grasp.

, While being trans is not about a ""beauty standard"" (it's more complicated than that), you could try to explain that they are genuinely trying to match their inner feeling of how they feel they'd like to look like with their clothing choices and sometimes via hormones and/or surgery. When trans people see some inspiring individual, they too get the feeling of ""That's me!"" or ""That's exactly like me!"" or ""That's exactly I'd like to be/look like!"" The only difference is their idol is usually the same gender that they feel they are inside.


Transgender people can suffer from gender dysphoria which means their desire to look certain way is so strong it causes anxiety and distress when the outside world is incapable of seeing that. , It's not about what are the causes of someone being gay/trans/non-binary/* - it's about recognizing that their experience is real and valid as is! They are being themselves, the person/character they feel and know they are, just like everyone else. Trans people are not deceiving anyone or pretending something - they are being the person they are. The same goes for gay people. They just happen to be attracted to certain (or many) types of people. This means that people have the right to look and dress how they please and identify or not identify with anything - and still be respected as a person, as a human being. "

lgbtcenters.org has a database of community centers in the United States.
If you are not fully out, attend events in neighboring towns where you are less likely to run into someone you know.;
, This doesn't need to be someone you know well, or that you're attracted to. A coworker, friend of a friend, former classmate — any local, out lesbian can introduce you to the LGBT community in your area, or recommend lesbian-friendly places to hang out., If you're lucky enough to live in a place where LGBT people can gather openly, take advantage of it. This is a nerve wracking step for many newly out or semi-closeted lesbians, but gather up your confidence and get out there. If your town doesn't have a lesbian-specific bar, visit the gay bar to see if it attracts a wider LGBT clientele.


If you're not interested in a party or hookup scene, show up on a weekday evening. The atmosphere will be more relaxed and friendly conversation will be easier.
Straight bars are rarely a good place to look for same-sex dates. Only about 11% of U.S. lesbians in a relationship met their partner in a bar or restaurant, which might be related to the small and shrinking number of lesbian bars., Look for bands with a large lesbian fan base performing in your area. Note that this doesn't just mean bands with LGBT musicians (although it helps).If you think that lead singer is attractive, you're probably not alone.

, You don't need to attend a rainbow-themed roller derby club to meet other lesbians. The more time you spend in social activities, the better the chance of meeting people who catch your interest. Whether it's attending classes at a community center or joining a sports team, picking up a hobby is a great way to meet like-minded people. Even just starting conversations at the gym or getting to know progressive coworkers can help you make friends, and potentially something more.


Small towns may only have one or two locations where LGBT people are comfortable meeting openly. In that case, it may be easier to make your first connections with that community online or through LGBT events.

, Misconstrued signals are a perennial problem for lesbians trying to date in straight spaces, especially for people who fall more on the femme side of the spectrum. If you don't want to spend an evening becoming a straight girl's new friend, you'll have to muster up some confidence and make it obvious what you're there for. Make a casual reference to an ex-girlfriend or a comment about how you'd love to date that hot, female celebrity.If you don't want to risk a homophobic encounter, try something more subtle before you out yourself. Mention an LGBT event you attended, and see whether she reacts positively.

, Volunteering at activist meetings and charity events is a great way to become involved in the LGBT community. You get to work for organizations that represent your values, and meet other lesbians at the same time.


In the United States, look into GLAAD, Gay for Good, Equality Federation, and the National Organization for Women.
The international organizations ILGA, Out Right Action International, and IGLYO (for youth) can direct you to country-specific resources., It is much more difficult to date another lesbian if your sexuality is a secret. Besides the scarcity of comfortable opportunities to signal your intent, many lesbians in LGBT-friendly areas are not interested in a closeted relationship.If you've been thinking of coming out already, maybe that should be your priority before jumping into the dating pool. If coming out would risk your safety or the health of important relationships in your life, or if you're just not ready, think carefully about the level of public disclosure you are willing to make.A few options include:


Coming out to close friends who are unlikely to spread the word back to your family and coworkers.
Traveling to neighboring towns where you can be open in public with a lower chance of seeing someone you know.
Discreet online dating, as described below. This can be a great way to expand your comfort zone.

Provide water.",How to Tame Snakes," Whether you are dealing with a hatchling or captive-bred snake that shows little aggression, or a snake that is exhibiting a great deal of aggressive behavior, the first thing you should do is allow your snake to adjust to you. For the first week or so that you have your snake, just sit outside its cage for about an hour each day and allow it to get used to your smell. Don’t attempt to touch your snake at all during this week., At the end of this initial week, you can begin to move things around inside your snake’s cage. However, it is still important that you do not attempt to touch the snake at this point. Do this for another week so that your snake can get used to the idea that you are not trying to harm it. Being around it without attempting to touch it will let your snake know you are not a threat., Once you have let your snake know you are not a threat, you can begin to touch it while it is inside its cage. To do so, place your hand in its cage and gently start working with it by touching it, moving it around inside the cage, and lifting its tail. Continue working with your snake in this manner for three or four days., Unless you’re taming a hatchling or captive-bred snake, you’ll likely have to deprogram your snake of its aggressive behavior. The first step to doing this is to determine what type of aggression your snake is showing. There are two types of aggressive responses you can deprogram in snakes—territorial, or defensive responses, and feeding responses.


Territorial responses are instinctive and not an indicator of aggression. Snakes live most of their lives in fear of being eaten by bigger predators (which includes humans) so this response is a defense mechanism that can be tamed with consistent, gentle care.
Feeding responses are another natural, instinctive response. Snakes are generally “taught” to bite whatever comes into their cage. Because they assume anything that enters their cage is food, you might get bitten if you stick your hand into their cage without first deprogramming this response., Some species of snakes are more aggressive than others and might require more training. If you’re dealing with a particularly aggressive species or snake, you’ll want to “hook train” it. To do so, gently rub its body or push down on its head with a hook, or a similar inanimate object, every time you go to get it out of its cage. Doing so will let your snake know it is not feeding time so there is no need to bite whatever enters the cage.If your snake appears scared when you open the cage, spend a little more time rubbing its body with the hook until it appears to calm down. For instance, if your snake coils into a ball, flattens out its body, or assumes a striking position, spend some time rubbing its body until it relaxes a bit.Start rubbing your snakes body from its tail end and work up to its head. Starting with its head could seem threatening, especially if your snake is already scared., The most common reason people get bitten is because their snake is reacting to its feeding response every time something enters its cage. To deprogram it of this response, stop feeding your snake every week. Instead, feed it only once every three weeks, but make sure you handle your snake every day. This will deprogram the snake from thinking everything that enters its cage is food.


It can also be helpful to feed your snake in a separate tub. This will also help it from thinking everything that enters its cage is food. However, don’t feed it only in the tub because this will just transfer its response from the cage to the tub.
It is perfectly safe to only feed your snake once every three weeks. Snakes can go weeks without eating with no harm done., Now that you’ve introduced yourself to your snake and have worked on deprogramming it of any aggressive behavior, you can begin to handle your snake outside its cage. It is important that you handle your snake with confidence. If you are hesitant or fearful, your snake will sense this and act in turn.


It is a good idea to handle the species of snake you want to keep as a pet under the supervision of a professional or long-time owner before getting one for yourself. This will help ensure you are comfortable with your snake when you get it., You should wash your hands thoroughly before attempting to handle your snake. Reptiles have excellent sensory organs so if there is even a light scent of prey on your hand, your snake might mistake your hand for something it should eat.


In addition, washing your hands before you handle your snake helps prevent the possibility of introducing foreign bacteria, parasites, or germs into your pet’s habitat., It is important to support your snake’s body when you are picking it up so that it is comfortable and there is no strain put on its body. This is true whether you are picking your snake up with a hook or with your hands. Keep the first third of your snake’s body supported with either the hook or one of your hands, while supporting the back two thirds of your snake’s body with your other arm.Remember your “hook training” before placing your hands in your snake’s cage. Lightly pressing down on your snake’s head with a hook will let it know it is not feeding time so there is no need to strike.
Don’t ever grab a snake by the end of its tail to pick it up or move it. This can cause fear and serious strain to the snake’s body., Restraining your snake’s head can cause it to believe you are a predator that is trying to hurt it. When you handle your snake, stick to holding it by its body and avoid holding or restraining its head., Until you are completely comfortable handling your snake, it is a good idea to hold it with its head facing away from you. This will give your snake a chance to become accustomed to you and the motion of your hands or body without the threat that the experience may turn negative., If your snake is still displaying aggressive behavior after you’ve introduced yourself and deprogrammed it, it could be that something in its environment is making it sick or upset. If a snake is upset because it is too hot or cold, or feels vulnerable or threatened in its environment, it is more likely to lash out. Therefore, creating and maintaining a proper environment for your snake is imperative to taming it.The first step to creating the right environment for your snake is to get it a proper cage. Most snakes fit into one of three groups when it comes to cage size:


Garter snakes and grass snakes need a 10 to 20 gallon (37.9 to 75.7 L) aquarium.
King snakes, rat snakes, milk snakes, gopher snakes and other colubrids need a 30 to 55 gallon tank.
Boa constrictors and pythons may need a custom-built cage, as they can vary greatly in length and size., Most diurnal snakes, or those that are active during the day, need a bright white light during the day and very dim lighting at night. If the room you are keeping your snake in has only dim lighting during the day, you’ll need to place an incandescent white light above your snake’s cage to give them enough light. At night, they need very little light. Nocturnal reptile lights or decorative incandescent lights in dark colors (like red, blue, and green) will provide the right amount of light during the night.The amount of light a snake needs varies by species so find out exactly what your species of snake requires. For example, unlike diurnal snakes, ball pythons are nocturnal and don’t require a supplementary source of lighting. Continuous overhead lighting is especially stressful to a nocturnal species.Lighting and heating your snake’s cage go hand in hand so you’ll want to pay attention to how one affects the other.

, Snakes require the optimal temperature to live comfortably. This requires both a primary heat source and a secondary one. The purpose of the primary heat source is to keep the temperature of the entire cage in the correct range. This is best achieved by adding a series of incandescent lights along the top of the cage.The ideal temperature for a snake enclosure varies by species. In general, however, most snakes prefer a temperature between 80 and 88 degrees Fahrenheit (26 to 31 degrees Celcius). At night, however, it is best for snakes to be held at a temperature 5 to 20 degrees cooler than their daytime temperature.To create the right night time temperature, you can use such things as a heating pad placed under your snake’s cage, ceramic infrared heat emitters, or nocturnal reptile incandescent light bulbs, all of which provide heat without much light.Get several thermometers to place in the cage to ensure you are keeping it at optimal temperatures.

, Reptiles need to be provided a temperature gradient in their cages so that they can go to whichever temperature is most comfortable for them at the moment. To do this, you must install a secondary heat source in your snake’s cage. This secondary source should only cover approximately 25 to 30 percent of the snake’s cage.


To create this secondary heat source, you can either mount a 50 to 75 watt incandescent light bulb on the outside of one wall of the cage, or place an under-the-tank heater underneath only one-quarter of the tank.
Specially made ”basking lights” are a great way to create a heat gradient as well. These lights are placed outside the cage and create heat in one specific area of the tank.Again, the needs of different species vary, so find out the appropriate head gradient for your species of snake. For example, ball pythons prefer an ambient temperature of 78 to 80 °F (25.6 to 26.7 °C) and a basking spot temperature of 88 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit (31 to 35 degrees Celcius)., Snakes are hiders by nature and do so if they feel threatened. If you do not provide places for your snake to hide, it will likely feel vulnerable and threatened, thus becoming aggressive.A cave made of rock or a clean piece of cardboard your snake can get under both make great hiding places for a snake. You can also use clay or plastic flowerpots as hiding spots for your snake., Just like other animals, snakes need water. Ensure your snake has fresh, clean water at all times. You can use a water bowl in its cage, just make sure it is not easy to tip over."

Figure out what you're looking for.,
Choose a dating service.,
Protect your privacy.,
Be clear about what you're looking for.",How to Meet Other Lesbians2," For many newly out or closeted lesbians, online dating is their first opportunity to feel accepted, flirt, and overcome introversion about their sexuality. Maybe that's all your looking for, maybe you're looking for casual sex, or maybe you're interested in long-term romantic relationships. Think about your comfort level and what your goals are before you enter the digital dating world.

, The LGBT online dating scene has grown tremendously in the past ten years. Here are a few of the more popular sites and apps:LGBT-specific: Her (lesbian-only dating and social networking), Chemistry.com, Compatible Partners (for serious relationships only), Brenda
All-purpose dating: OK Cupid, Match.com, and eHarmony all have lesbian options. Hinge seems to tailor results for LGBT people better than other ""swipe"" apps.

, Online dating has its perils, so don't take chances. Keep your personal information private, use a free email without your real name, and meet up with strangers in public locations. In addition, if you are not out to everyone in your life, take extra steps to prevent nosy employers or family members from finding you. Most sites allow you to hide your profile until you've agreed to accept communications from someone, but this option makes it harder to make connections.


Ok Cupid has an ""I don't want to be seen by straight people"" checkbox in the privacy settings.Chances are good that your straight friends won't be browsing an LGBT-only dating site. Just make sure the profile doesn't show up when you google your name.

, Unfortunately, there is a minor plague of straight women contacting lesbians for a threesome with their boyfriend. Forestall some of this — and make your intentions clear to other lesbians — with a clear, direct description in your bio. ""Lesbian seeking same"" is a simple example."

Speak up when you witness homophobia.,
Report hostility and discrimination.,
Be open about your own identity.,
Vote for pro-LGBTQ candidates only.,
Boycott homophobic institutions.",How to Take a Stand Against Homophobia1," Whenever safe and possible, speak up in response to homophobic statements or actions you witness. If you hear someone using slurs or calling a bad thing ""gay,"" speak up. If you hear someone being bashed, defend them.If it is a friend, family member, or close acquaintance who is exhibiting homophobia, appeal to your connection. ""Karen, I think we both value tolerance and kindness towards all people. The way you addressed my gay friend last week made it sound like you didn't want him around; can you explain what was going on?""
If it is a stranger, simply state your beliefs: ""I find that language very offensive."";
, If you or someone you know has been discriminated against or harassed by a business owner, a store employee, a boss, a teacher, or someone else who represents an institution, don't let it rest. If the harassment takes place at work, talk to HR and your supervisor, and file a complaint if nothing happens.


Report homophobic words and actions that you experience in a place of business or other organization. If someone at a place of business says something offensive, report them to a higher up.
If a business or public institution in your neighborhood is engaging in homophobic slurs or discriminatory practices, report them to an organization such as the Better Business Bureau: https://www.bbb.org/consumer-complaints/file-a-complaint/get-started

If the person or people who engaged in the harassment or discrimination is the highest on the totem pole, take them to the court of public opinion: consider organizing a protest, writing a letter to a local paper, or passing out informative flyers about the homophobia.

, Do not hide your own sexual orientation or gender identity. Insofar as you feel safe and comfortable doing so, be open about your love life, and introduce your partner to others. Tell your acquaintances how you prefer to be identified.


Even if you are in a heterosexual partnership or generally pass as straight, consider speaking up when questions of identity or attraction arise.
If a coworker asks if you have a boyfriend, for instance, you might say, ""I actually date men and women, but yes, I do have a boyfriend.""
Coming out is a personal decision and depends on many factors. Make sure you are safe and in a position to fend for yourself before you come out to somebody homophobic.

, Take a hard line when voting: do not vote for anyone who is not explicitly pro-LGBTQ. If you don't know where a politician stands, call their team and ask, or look up their voting record.


Check out endorsements by LGBTQ organizations such as the Harvey Milk LGBTQ Democratic Club: http://www.milkclub.org/endorsements2016


, Do not give your business or time to institutions that practice homophobic policies. Boycott institutions headed by leaders who donate to homophobic candidates. Don't enroll in classes at schools with anti-LGBTQ policies.


If you aren't sure where an institution stands, check for explicit language about equality and minority protections on their website.
Look for administratively-recognized LGBTQ student groups at schools.

Form a basic outline of what you might say if someone asks.",How to Show People Your Religious View Is Separate from Your Sexual Orientation1," Try researching your religion, as well as any sects it has, and perhaps other religions too. You may also find prayer to be useful. Ask yourself...


How does God (or the gods) feel about sexuality?
What does your religion say about how to treat people who are different?;
, Learn about different identities—from lesbian to bisexual to aromantic. You may find that it helps to have a word for your sexuality, or you may not care much for labels. Your identity is your own, and you will understand and accept it at your own pace.

, You may choose to actively participate there, or just read/listen to what other people have to say. This can help you understand yourself and others, and inform your worldview.

, What do these groups of people feel? Do you agree with them? Consider whether your views upon sexuality align with those of your church, or if you are at odds with your religious leaders.


For some people, their church's view upon sexuality is a dealbreaker, and they switch to another church or stop being religious.
Some people feel that while their religion's views on sexuality are undesirable, the rest of the religion has enough merits to make them stay in the church. You are not obligated to agree with everything your religious leaders say.
Some people find a church that shares their views on sexuality.

, Having a general sense of what to say can help you be prepared to communicate your views. Here are some things to consider for your outline...


Discuss how your personal religious beliefs tie into accepting people of all sexualities.
Assure people that you do not share the beliefs of religious fanatics (for example, the Westboro Baptist Church).
Define your religion and/or sexuality, especially if they are obscure.

, When the snake is near the end of the tube quickly detach the tube from the port on the shift-box and grab the snake's body at the base of the tube. It is important to keep the snake from moving forward too much or backing out. You don't have to squeeze too hard.

,, Let the snake do the work.

, You don't want the snake to strike the edge and break a fang.

,, The venom should be frozen −20 °C (−4 °F) or colder within an hour after extraction. Venom can be stored in this way for up to one month.

, Keep one port open for the snake's reentry.


Since the snake's head is already near the end of the tube, it is often easier to let the snake progress forward. Return the snake to the shift box by allowing the snake to crawl through the port head-first.

, You don't want your hands near the open port of the shift box.
