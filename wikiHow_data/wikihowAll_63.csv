Pay attention to regurgitation.",How to Keep a California King Snake," Choose a clear glass terrarium or similar container.Though California King Snakes usually only get about 4 feet long, some can reach an adult length of 6 feet, so you should get a habitat that can accommodate your snake at its largest possible size.If your snake lays around the edge of the tank and doesn’t cover more than 2/3 of the distance around the perimeter, the tank is probably big enough.
Bigger is better. The more room you can give your snake to crawl around, the happier it will be.
Most adults need about a 20-gallon enclosure or larger.;
, Be sure that the enclosure is completely escape-proof. If there is any weakness in the structure at all, your California King Snake will find it and get out., If you want to be able to see your snake better, you can add a standard florescent bulb to the habitat, or just put a light nearby. You don’t need any kind of special lighting in the tank., Since snakes are “cold blooded,” they quickly become the temperature of their surroundings. You can buy heaters, pads, or cables (online or in a pet shop) for this purpose. Try to make the warm end stay around 85 degrees F and the cool end stay around 70 degrees F.Don’t put the habitat near a window with direct sun. It can become too hot very quickly, and your snake will die.
Some people use lights to heat one end of the tank, but this doesn’t always work well. It requires a lot of energy, and lights often heat the air but are ineffective at heating the floor of a tank.
Never use “hot rocks.” They can cause burns.

, You can purchase commercial substrates or use newspaper, paper towels, or indoor carpet. Don’t use cat litter or anything chemically treated or oily. Avoid anything that has an odor.If your snake can’t burrow into the floor covering of your choice, provide a few places for it to hide inside the tank so that it feels secure. You can use half-logs, cork, or pieces of grapewood., If you want, you can add a few branches or other structures for your snake to climb on and hang from. These aren’t strictly necessary, but they’ll make your tank more interesting for both you and your California King Snake., Never keep them in a habitat with other kinds of snakes. Don’t keep juvenile King Snakes in the same habitat, because they might eat each other. California King Snakes should be kept in their enclosures alone so they feel safe, comfortable, and don't have to compete for food.Only keep King Snakes together if you have decided to breed them.
Make sure to do your research before breeding so you don't accidentally put your animals at risk.
Watch them carefully for signs of aggression.
Do not keep King Snakes together after breeding has occurred.

, Never feed two King Snakes in the same habitat. Separate them for a few minutes before they eat to avoid food aggression, and then keep them apart for several hours after they’ve finished., Live mice are fine, but they’re not required, and they can often wound your snake. Freshly killed mice are the best choice, but if you want to freeze some for convenience, it’s okay to give your snake a very well-thawed one.One mouse per week will be enough, but if you want your snake to grow faster, you can give it up to two per week. Once they’re fully grown, in order to avoid obesity, you may need to cut back to once a week.
When your snake is a baby, feed it newborn mice (about the size of your pinky). Increase the size of your mice as your snake grows. The largest adult snakes can often handle a small rat instead of multiple mice.You can usually buy mice at your local pet store, but you can also order them online.

, Don’t pick your snake up until it has digested the mouse enough that the lump in its middle has disappeared, because it might still feel aggressive before its food is digested., Use a relatively deep bowl. Sometimes King Snakes like to take a soak in their water bowl, so fill it up only about halfway to prevent them from spilling the water over the edges. Check the water bowl every day, and keep it clean. If the habitat starts to feel very moist, take the water bowl out and only put in for a few days every week.

, Remember that this is a wild animal, so it may be afraid of you for quite some time. Hold your snake gently, and stay away from its face, especially at first. Start with just a few minutes of handling once a week and work your way up. It’s not unusual for king snakes to defecate or urinate on you when you handle them, especially at first.
If you notice that your snake’s behavior or appetite changes suddenly, it could be because it’s stressed from too much handling.

, Don’t handle your snake when it’s getting ready to shed. You’ll know this is happening when their skin starts to turn milky or bluish. In a few days, they’ll crawl completely out of their old skin, and it will be safe to hold them again.Particularly around the time when they’re shedding, King Snakes will enjoy an occasional mist of water all over their tank. Any plastic or glass spray bottle will work., California King Snakes almost never bite, but if you restrain them, they may. Never pinch or squeeze them. Let them flow gently through your hands and fingers. Don’t let them dangle unsupported., Most vets don’t come in contact with snakes that often; they tend to have a lot more experience with animals like dogs and cats. You may have to travel to find a competent vet, so it’s a good idea to get acquainted with one before anything goes wrong so you can call them if you have questions.There are a variety of vet locators online. Try kingsnake.com to find one who works with King Snakes regularly.

, These tiny black parasites love to live on King Snakes. Keep an eye out especially around their eyes, mouth, and under their scales. If you notice that your snake is lethargic or not eating, mites may be the cause, so give them a good inspection.To get rid of mites, bathe your snake in warm water. Disinfect everything in the tank and provide fresh flooring.You may want to wait a while to put any “furniture” back in the tank, because you will be more likely to see mites if they don’t have a lot of hiding places.
If a good cleaning and disinfection doesn’t get rid of the mites, talk to someone at your local pet store or ask your vet about possible products to get rid of stubborn infestations.

, If your King Snake sounds wheezy or has excessive saliva, it may have a respiratory infection (caused by a dirty cage, low temperatures, or contact with another infected snake). If the problem persists for more than a day or two, or if you feel alarmed, call your vet. Your King Snake may need an antibiotic., It’s not uncommon for snakes to regurgitate part of their meal after they eat it, but since this may be a sign of serious illness, you should keep an eye on your snake for other symptoms if you see them do this. If it happens repeatedly or your snake starts to lose weight, it’s time to take it to the vet.One common reason that snakes regurgitate their meals is that their owners pick them up too soon after they eat. Try to avoid this, particularly if your snake is have a regurgitation problem.

Donate to organizations that fight homophobia.,
Volunteer for causes that benefit LGBTQ people.,
Join a local LGBTQ group, or start your own.",How to Take a Stand Against Homophobia2," If you have money to spare, take a stand by giving to organizations that support LGBTQ causes. You can donate to a large institution like the ACLU, the Human Rights Campaign, the Trevor Project, or Lambda Legal. You might also consider donating to smaller local organizations, such as your local fund for queer youth, LGBTQ health center, or Centerlink community center.Help homeless LGBTQ youth. Trans and homosexual youth are at far greater risk of homelessness than heterosexual youth. Consider donating your time or money to a homeless shelter for youth, whether or not it is specifically for queer youth.

, Donate your time to political campaigns for gay-friendly candidates. Volunteer your special skills and your extra time to LGBTQ charities and organizations.If you are highly skilled in any area, such as medicine, teaching, legal work, or administration, offer your services to small organizations that would not be able to afford to hire you.
Volunteer with a suicide prevention hotline. Homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia can cause isolation and suffering that lead to a high rate of suicide among LGBTQ individuals, especially youth. You can complete a simple training and be on-call for LGBTQ people who are suffering from suicidal ideation.

, If you belong to a church or a school, you may find organizations within your institution. If not, search for organizations in your area, ask your friends, and check out a few meetings. Start an affinity group if you don't find anything.


Consider taking on a personal role in the struggle for justice.
Think about what communities you belong to. With whom can you have the most productive dialogue? For instance, if you come from a Christian background, you may do the most good by holding information sessions at churches about LGBTQ issues.

Defend LGBTQ families.,
Remind your friends that orientation is inherent.,
Counter the ""slippery slope"" argument.,
Defend yourself with facts.",How to Take a Stand Against Homophobia3," Many people wrongly believe that same-sex parents are unfit to raise children. This is untrue: all serious research has shown that same-sex parents are as fit as opposite-sex parents to provide loving, supportive homes for children. Children in LGBTQ families are as well-adjusted and happy as children in heterosexual two-parent homes.The myth that gay people are more prone to child molestation than straight people is untrue.

, Some people believe that homosexual orientation is a choice. Others say it is an illness related to childhood trauma. Both of these statements are untrue. Scientists affirm that a person's sexual orientation is inherent and cannot be chosen or ""changed"" by another.Sexual orientation is formed from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors, and may be in place before a child is even born.
While being LGBTQ can raise a person's risk for traumatic experiences, it doesn't work the other way around. Trauma doesn't cause homosexuality, but homophobia can raise a person's risk of trauma.
You might say to your friend, ""You say that 'these people are sick,"" but there's nothing unhealthy about homosexuality. It's a natural form of human sexuality.""

, A common logical fallacy is that if one previously taboo practice achieves mainstream acceptance, every other taboo will also become mainstream. This is untrue: while some social conventions are prone to change, others, especially those rooted in scientific fact, tend to remain.A common homophobic statement is, ""If we allow homosexuality, what's next? Bestiality? Pedophilia?"" You can counter this by saying, ""There is no relationship between homosexuality and bestiality or pedophilia. Homosexual relationships are consensual bonds between adults. Bestiality and pedophilia are nonconsensual acts of sexual violence against the powerless.""

, Ultimately, homophobic rhetoric returns to logical fallacies and easily debunked myths. The best thing you can do is get the facts. Research statements by legitimate organizations such as the American Psychological Association for scientific evidence that homosexuality, transgenderism, and other varieties of human identity are natural and healthy.Then someone you know says something like, ""Nobody is born gay,"" you can say, ""Actually, many scientists believe our sexual orientation is in place before we were born, and the American Psychological Association has proven that sexuality is not a choice.""
Look out for hate groups disguised as legitimate organizations, such as the fringe group American College of Pediatrics.

Try wearing symbolism that evokes both your religion and your sexuality.,
Show an accepting attitude through your actions.,
Distance yourself from bigotry (whether it has religious overtones or not).",How to Show People Your Religious View Is Separate from Your Sexual Orientation2," Maybe this means wearing hijab along with a rainbow bracelet, or an asexuality shirt and a Christian cross necklace. This shows your views to anyone who happens to look.


If you are from a minority religion, or are wearing your LGBTQIA status openly, you may be at increased risk for discrimination. This is not fair, but it does happen, and you will want to consider it before going public.

, If you want people to know that you are LGBT-friendly, then be kind to LGBT people. An accepting attitude communicates to other people that they are safe around you,


Many religions talk about kindness, love, and not judging others. Drawing upon this may help you cultivate a compassionate attitude.

, This is especially important if sometimes people of your religion try to use religion to argue against LGBT rights. This will make it clear to others that you are not part of one of the anti-LGBT sects of your religion.


""What a weird sect. I can't imagine spending so much energy on fighting gay and bisexual people.""
""Ugh, I hate it when people say that. I think they forgot about 'love thy neighbor.'""

"

Briefly explain to people who express confusion over your two identities.,
Clear up the fact that sexuality is not a choice.,
Guide them to religious or LGBTQIA resources if need be.,
Don't worry too much about it.",How to Show People Your Religious View Is Separate from Your Sexual Orientation3," Some people don't realize that people of a given religion can be of all sexualities, and vice versa, and a quick explanation is all they need


""I'm Jewish and pansexual. Sexuality and religion are two separate things.""
""I was raised Catholic, and I'm bisexual. I find that the doctrine of loving your neighbor certainly applies to LGBT people, so I'm comfortable with my religion.""
""Yes, gay people are everywhere, including Iran! I am Muslim and gay.""

, Some people might think that you are choosing your orientation because of your religion, or because you want to be counter-cultural.


""I didn't choose to be asexual any more than you chose to be straight. Just like you couldn't make yourself turn asexual, I can't change my own orientation.""
""Being bisexual isn't a choice—if it were, who would choose to get harassed or discriminated against?""

, Some people have a lot of questions or misconceptions, and you might not have the time or energy to explain it all. Encourage them to do some research, and perhaps help them get started.

, Not everyone will understand you, and that's all right. You don't have to exhaust yourself explaining to someone who isn't interested in hearing it.


Some people are jerks, and talking to them is a waste of time. Put your mental health first, and spend time with different people.
Some people don't really understand religion or sexuality. Maybe they're open to being taught, or maybe they're too young or not interested. This is all right. Just be yourself, and don't worry much about the rest.

Cut the excess tape from around the spot where the tape is stuck.,
Get some natural oil such as olive or coconut and some Q-tips.,Dip the oil in some of the chosen oil around the edges of the snake.,
Carefully stick the q-tip in the uncovered area.,
Try to avoid pulling on the snake, if possible.,
Once the snake is off the tape, check for any cuts caused by areas a scale was pulled off.",How to Remove Duct Tape from a Snake," You don't have to be precise, but to much extra tape is a welcome for getting restuck. Be careful to not cut the snakes skin, as it may stretch outward slightly when stuck.
, Ear Buds(Australian Equivalent),, Apply pressure. Rotate the Q-tip quickly., Pulling too hard may hurt the snakes scales and skin. Continue to rub the oil, only pulling if it comes easy. If there's excessive resistance to the tape, or you feel it may hurt it, use more oil., There may be a minor spot that should be watched over in case they are needed to be taken to a vet."

Provide room to exercise.,
Find the best toys.,
Play ""hide and seek"".,
Monitor reactions.",How to Play With a Pet Snake1," Snakes are not very social animals. For the most part, they prefer to be left alone, and do not always enjoy the company of people or other animals. However, there are some ways that you can constructively interact with your snake.Most snakes do enjoy moving around. Make sure that you offer your pet the option to exercise.
Some larger snakes enjoy swimming. If possible, provide a small pool, such as a kiddie pool, for your snake to swim in.
Snakes also like to climb. Consider getting a climbing pole or artificial tree to place in your home.
Your snake does not need unlimited access to exercise facilities. But your pet will enjoy coming out of his cage to move around a few times a week.;
, Your snake doesn't need a lot of expensive toys to enjoy playing. One of a snake's favorite activities is curling around a long object. You can look in your yard or a local park to find a suitable material.The size of branch that you want depends on the size of your snake. Snakes like to wrap their bodies around objects.
Look for a stick or branch that is at least 1 foot long, or larger, if you have a large snake. Make sure it is sturdy enough to support your snake.
You can allow your snake to play even when you're not around. Look for a small log to place in his cage. He will enjoy winding around it.

, Snakes love this game, although they generally only participate in the hiding part. It's natural that you want to spend quality time with your pet. Just remember that you want play time to be enjoyable for the snake, too. Take care to make sure that you choose a suitable place for your recreational activities.The majority of snakes do not enjoy being around multiple people. Even though you might enjoy showing your pet off to a group of your friends, remember that is not enjoyable or comfortable for your snake.
Choose a quiet room to play with your snake. Some snakes like to play a version of ""hide and seek"".
If your home has a secure room, allow your snake to roam free in that room. He will likely find somewhere to hide, like behind some furniture. You can then find him.
Make sure that your snake cannot escape from the room. You don't want to lose your pet during your game.

, Snakes have personalities. They have their own likes and dislikes, just like people. Get to know your snake so that you can tell whether or not both of you are enjoying play time.Remember that most snakes don't really like to be touched. Your pet will probably most enjoy playing if he is able to do so independently.
If you are playing with your snake, pay attention to his mood. If he seems to be showing signs of discomfort, let him go back in his cage.
If your snake strikes out at you, that is meant as a warning. You should give him some space.
Hissing can also be a sign that your snake would prefer to be left alone. Respect his need for alone time.

Ensure it's not venomous.,
Wear thick gloves.,
Distract the snake.,
Pick up the snake.",How to Pick up a Snake1," You should never attempt to pick up a venomous snake under any circumstance. If, however, you're absolutely certain that a snake is not venomous, it may be safe to catch the snake by hand.Never attempt to handle any snake you cannot identify with 100 percent certainty.;
, If you're intent on picking up a snake that you've confirmed is not venomous, you should wear a thick pair of gloves (sturdy garden gloves may suffice).Just because the snake's bite will not kill you doesn't mean you should chance getting a painful bite.


Even a non-venomous snake's bite can be dangerous. All snakes have bacteria in their mouths which, if you are bitten, could penetrate the skin and lead to an infection., As you approach the snake, you should distract it to ensure that it will not turn and strike you. Try to distract the snake away from your reaching hand with a long, sturdy object, like a long tree branch, a wooden yard stick, or a household fire poker.Keep the tool low to the ground and near the snake's head. This should distract the snake, as it will think the object is a potential threat.

, Using your other hand (which, again, should be gloved), grab the snake's tail and lift it quickly. You should keep the majority of the snake's body flat on the ground until your grip is secure. Then you can use the long tool to lift the front part of the snake's body.Alternately, you can drop an old shirt, towel, or thin blanket over the snake, scoop it up in the fabric, and gently drop the whole bundle into a pillowcase. You can then relocate the snake to a safe outdoor area away from people. This method is more dangerous, though, since you cannot see where the snake's head is, and it may bite you through the fabric.
If using a pillowcase, gently shake the pillowcase by the opening to ensure the snake is at the very bottom. If you must set the snake down, be sure you either twist the opening or flip it over on top of the rest of the pillowcase so that the snake cannot easily escape."

Choose the right snake.,
Teach your kids to play with your pet snake.,
Respect hibernation.,
Handle your snake carefully.",How to Play With a Pet Snake2," When you decide to get a pet snake, it is important that you choose the right one. There are several kinds of snakes that make good pets. Think about your priorities when choosing the one that is right for you.The larger the snake, the more space you will need. If your home has limited room, look for a smaller snake.
If you are not an experienced snake owner, you need a snake that is easier to handle. Don't immediately try to get a large snake with a bad temper.
Corn snakes are among the most popular options. They usually grow to less than 6 feet long, and they are even tempered.
The king snake is also a good choice. They adapt very well to living in captivity.

, If you are going to keep a pet snake, it is important that each member of your household learn to care for the snake. It's a good idea to teach your children to learn to properly care for the snake. This will help them remain safe when they play with their pet.Remind your kids that snakes are not toys. They are living creatures and it is important to treat them respectfully.
Pets are great because they can help teach your kids responsibility. Use feeding times to teach your kids the importance of sticking to a routine.
Snakes are fairly low-maintenance, so they can work well for kids. There is no hair or fur to clean up, and they don't need to be walked.
If you have kids, consider getting a corn snake or ball python. If they do bite, the wound won't be severe.

, Part of keeping your snake safe means paying attention to physical needs. Some snakes require regular periods of hibernation. This occurs most often in the winter.Provide your snake a proper environment for hibernation. Keep the room cool and dark.
If your snake is hibernating, do not try to handle him. It is not the right time to play.
For the most part, leave your snake alone during hibernation. How long it lasts will depend on what type of snake you have. Just remember to check on him regularly and supply fresh water.

, Most snakes prefer not to be handled regularly. But if you make a habit of gradually getting your pet used to being held, many will adapt. Just make sure to use the right technique.Hold your snake firmly but gently. Make sure most of the body is supported.
Your snake will often tolerate being held, but that doesn't mean he will enjoy it. Your snake will let you know when to put him down by struggling or squirming.
Do not hold your snake for 48 hours after a feeding. He needs time to digest his meal.
If your snake is moved to a new environment, give him time to adjust. Avoid handling your pet for 5-7 days.

"

Provide a comfortable home.,
Monitor the temperature.,
Feed your snake well.",How to Play With a Pet Snake3," Your snake needs a comfortable home in order to be happy and healthy. Make sure to clean the cage on a regular basis. You should also make sure that you get the proper size of enclosure.Small snakes, such as garter snakes, can happily live in a 10-20 gallon aquarium. King snakes will be fine in 30-55 gallon tanks.
If you are going to keep a large snake, such as a python or boa constrictor, you will need to get a custom cage. These snakes can become very large, so average pet stores do not sell cages for them.
Provide a log for the snake to hide in. A fake log will work just as well as a real one.

, Snakes, like all reptiles, must live in an environment with an optimal temperature. Snakes are not able to heat themselves the way mammals do, so you will need to provide heat sources.The best temperature depends on which type of snake you have. Corn snakes, for example, should be kept at 75-85 degrees. A ball python will enjoy basking in a spot between 88-96 degrees.
Provide more than one heat source. Consider using a heat lamp and an under the tank heating pat. You can purchase both at pet stores.
You can use a thermostat to monitor your snakes environment. Make sure all of your heating equipment remains in working order.

, Snakes are well-suited for living in captivity. It is easy to provide them with all of their nutritional needs. Most snakes live on a diet of insects and rodents.It is a good idea to feed your snake rodents that are already dead. You can buy frozen mice at most pet stores and keep them on hand. Just make sure to thaw thoroughly before feeding to your snake.
If you have a corn snake, it will happily eat every about every 10 days. If your snake doesn't eat within 10-15 minutes of being offered food, remove it. He is not interested.
A ball python will usually eat every 10-14 days. Don't worry if your snake refuses a meal or two. That is normal.
Snakes rarely drink, but it is important to keep fresh water in the cage. They need the moisture to keep their skin healthy.

Confirm it's not venomous.,
Have your tool on-hand.,
Lift the snake.,
Move or contain the snake.",How to Pick up a Snake2," No matter how you intend to pick up a snake, you should always ensure that it is not venomous. A venomous snake can strike quickly, and if you're anything short of a professional you could fall victim to its dangerous bite., Whether you're using a snake hook or snake tongs, you should have the tool ready and on-hand before you approach the snake. You should also have a temporary container ready and close by so that you can gently place the snake inside once you catch it.


Some snakes are fast-moving and will not stay on a snake hook for more than a few seconds. If you cannot safely catch the snake and deposit it (gently) into the temporary container, you may want to consider using tongs, or leaving it to a professional.If you feel comfortable using an intact pillowcase as a transport container, that should suffice. If the snake is outdoors, or is too large or aggressive for a pillow case, you may want to use something sturdier like an empty garbage can.
Be cautious if using snake tongs. These tools can be difficult for an inexperienced catcher to use, and could result in the snake being injured or even killed.

, If you're using a hook, carefully slip the hook underneath the snake's body. If using snake tongs, you should be able to simply grasp the snake using the tongs. No matter which tool you use, you should move quickly and carefully for both your own safety and the snake's.For smaller snakes, grab or lift the snake around the middle of its body or lower. For larger snakes, grab or lift the snake approximately 1/3 of the way down its body from the head.
You should never grab a snake by the neck, as this could cause serious injury and may make the snake struggle and bite you.

, If you're trying to move the snake a short distance, you may be able to simply carry it to the desired location. Otherwise, you should put the snake into a container to transport it or await for professional animal control personnel.


For smaller snakes, an intact pillowcase may suffice. Otherwise, use a deep bucket or, even better, a sturdy (and empty) garbage can."

Recognize a rattlesnake.,
Identify a cottonmouth/water moccasin.,
Spot a copperhead.,
Recognize a coral snake.",How to Pick up a Snake3," Rattlesnakes are fairly easy to recognize. Not all venomous snakes have a rattle, but rattlesnakes - one of the four most common venomous snakes in North America - do have this distinctive feature. A rattlesnake will typically warn you when you get too close by shaking its tail, producing the distinctive ""rattle"" sound.There are over a dozen distinct species of rattlesnake across North America alone. Knowing which species inhabit which geographical regions in the country will help you narrow down which species you're dealing with.Rattlesnakes also have a triangle-shaped head, which may make them fairly recognizable.
Depending on the species and its environment, fully-grown rattlesnakes can range from one foot in length to eight feet in length.
Rattlesnakes can live in forests, grasslands, swamps, deserts, and can also swim across bodies of water.

, The cottonmouth snake (also known as a water moccasin) is the only venomous water snake in North America. However, they are semi-aquatic, meaning cottonmouths can inhabit both aquatic and terrestrial habitats as needed. The most distinctive features of the cottonmouth are its head and mouth. The head is blocky and triangular, and the mouth (should you see it open) has white coloration on the inside.Many cottonmouths also have a distinct white, raccoon-like ""mask,"" and an elliptical eye shape.Cottonmouths can range in a number of colors, from copper/brown to black to green. Their coloration may be solid, spotty/blotchy, or in distinct bands.
The native range of cottonmouth snakes is confined to the southeastern United States.

, Copperhead snakes have a similar appearance to cottonmouths, but their colors tend to be brighter. Many copperheads have a burnt copper to bright orange coloration, but some are silvery, pink, or even peach-colored.Copperheads have a triangular head, whereas their look-alike the corn snake has a more oval-shaped head.

, Coral snakes are from the cobra family. They typically have long, slender bodies, and their heads are marked by large scales. There are two species of coral snake commonly found in North America: the eastern coral snake and the western coral snake.The western coral snake has a distinct banded color pattern: red on white on black, running the length of its body.The eastern coral snake has a similar coloration, only its pattern is red on yellow on black."

Remove the snake from his/her enclosure and place them in a tub.
,
Fill the tub with room temperature water that goes a bit above the snake's body.,Place a secure lid, with air holes, on top of the tub.,
Let your snake soak in the water to drown the mites, for at least 15 minutes, up to an hour.,
Check the snake's head after soaking him/her.,
Repeat the steps until you don't see any mites left on the snake.",How to Get Rid of Mites on Snakes1,", Make sure that the water isn't too cold.,, Make sure to monitor your snake to make sure they are not drowning or escaping., If there are still mites, carefully and gently rub the snake's head with a damp towel or cloth. If there are any mites left around the eyes, dab a bit of petroleum jelly on the caps to help kill the mites., You may have to repeat this process daily until they are gone."

Mix up a bleach/water solution, about 10% bleach.,
Set the enclosure back up once all of the bleach smell has been rinsed away.",How to Get Rid of Mites on Snakes2," Make sure to put these items outside of your house., Soak all of the cage decorations and the inside of the cage with it. You can also purchase reptile specific cleaners. Soak the items for at least 20 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. Keep rinsing until all of the bleach scent is gone., But use paper towels as the substrate, as you can see if the snake still has mites and if you need to repeat the cleaning processes."
"
When you get a new snake, quarantine the snake in a separate room, far away from your snake room, for at least a month.,
Try different reptile products to help prevent mites.",How to Get Rid of Mites on Snakes3," Use paper towels as substrate so you can see if the snake has mites. This way, this helps your collection no get infested if the new snake has mites. If this is your first snake, of course you can just put it in your designated snake room., Research them all. After all, using a product once a month is easier than going through trying to rid an entire collection of mites."
"
Choose an appropriately sized enclosure or tub (rack system) for the snake.,
Choose an appropriate heat source.,
Choose an appropriate hiding spot.,
Choose an appropriate sized water bowl.,
Choose an appropriate substrate for the species you intend to keep.,
Choose a secure locking lid as snakes are escape artists and will find a weakness and exploit it quickly.,
Add thermometer, hygrometer and thermostat.,
Decorate as you see fit.

",How to House Pet Snakes," Arboreal snakes will need much higher enclosures than terrestrial. The enclosure or tub should be large enough to let the snake stretch and move around and incorporate a water dish and hide and any other decor and the snake comfortably.;
, Basking bulbs can make the environment too dry for some more tropical species so Under Tank Heating (UTH) by way of commercial reptile heat pad or heat tape is a popular method. Ceramic heat emitters may also be used with some species.

, Commercially made PVC hides can be purchased as well as cork bark, drift wood, live and fake plants, rocks and more depending on your imagination.

, It must be big enough for the snake to soak in but for snakes that soak more, or if using racks with smaller tubs, smaller bowls can be used. Ensure that the bowl is sturdy so that the snake cannot spill the water or tip the bowl over.

, Popular choices are: newspaper, paper towel, cypress mulch or other commercial reptile mulches, sand, coco husk, coco fiber, aspen.


Do not use pine or cedar shavings, as these can be toxic to reptiles.

, If using racks ensure there are no gaps the snakes can squeeze through between the shelves.

, These are each required for accurate temperature, humidity monitoring and control.

Identify garter snakes by their markings.,
Search for garter snakes during the heat of the day.,
Look for snakes near their food sources.,
Look for snakes in their hiding places.",How to Find a Garter Snake1," Garter snakes are known for their unique stripe pattern. Make sure you know what a garter snake looks like so you don’t accidentally encounter a deadly snake.Garter snakes come in many different colors. They often blend into their environment, but can be red, green, black, yellow, or many other colors.
These snakes can be best identified by three long stripes down their body. One stripe goes down the center of the back, while two others are on the side of their body. However, some garter snakes have no stripes, so pay attention to the specific species in your area.
Garter snakes are usually between 25 and 30 inches, but some can grow as long as 5 feet. They can also be lean or stout in appearance.
If you’re not sure if a snake is a garter or not, avoid it, especially if you live somewhere with venomous snakes. You don’t want to be accidentally bitten by a dangerous snake.;
, They are cold-blooded creatures, so they are not likely to be visible during the evening. However, during the day they will bask in the sun to regulate their body temperature.March to April is the most likely time to catch your first sighting of a garter snake. They usually will not emerge earlier so they can avoid a late frost.
In early spring, garter snakes only emerge very briefly from hibernation. It may be harder to find them, since they don’t leave very often or for very long periods of time.
Garter snakes bask during the day, which means they find a location to soak up the sun. These locations are also likely to have a place where garter snakes can quickly hide like rocks, bushes, or animal burrows.
When it's cooler outside, such as the early morning or early evening, garter snakes will likely be searching for prey. During these times, you won't find them exposed in the open, so they may be harder to find., If you live near water, you may find garter snakes nearby if they eat fish. However, if you do not live near water, garter snakes are more likely found in areas where amphibians and earthworms are likely to be.


Garter snakes eat fish as one of their primary food sources. Look for them near water, especially during times when fish are highly visible in your area.
Amphibians are also a food source for garter snakes. They eat animals like small frogs or toads. These should be especially visible after it rains.
Garter snakes also eat earthworms. Look for them in areas with a lot of dirt and soil.

, Gartner snakes hibernate during the winter months. When not hibernating, look for snakes to live in dark, secluded areas during the evening and out in the sun during the day.During hibernation, garter snakes occupy large, communal sites called hibernacula. These areas will likely be secluded spots that stay relatively warm during the cold winter months.
Most garter snakes hide or live in dark places during the spring and summer when they are not basking.
Check for garter snakes in fields, tall grass, under leaves, and logs. They prefer to be close to the ground and camouflaged in the grass.
During the winter, you may also find garter snakes holed up in your basement or attic. If this is the case, you can either keep it until the spring or dispose of the garter snake outside, which will likely kill it."

Get medical attention if you get bitten.",How to Find a Garter Snake2," Looking for one can be a fun activity. It’s important to be careful when looking for one, since you can easily step on or run over garter snakes.


Search in the primary habitats of garter snakes. Keep an eye out for hidden garter snakes underneath logs or behind bushes.
Walk slowly and carefully in the grass or other environments. Consider wearing light shoes, since garter snakes can feel vibrations in the ground.
Look for any movement in the grass or other garter snake environments. They move quickly, but you may be able to spot them through close observation.
Watch for any sunny areas. Garter snakes need to bask in the sun during the day, so you may be able to find them there.

You can trap them underneath until they finish thrashing and are subdued.Try catching a garter snake by the tip of its tale. This may be harder, since they can slip out of your hands, but it’s possible to catch a garter snake by hand.
Give garter snakes plenty of support. They may slide or crawl over your hands, but may also fall. Be careful to not drop them or let them slip out of your hands.
Don’t restrict garter snakes’ movement. They will get frightened if they feel restricted in movement by you handling them.
Garter snakes may musk on you. This is a bad smelling fluid that comes out of their vent. It’s harmless, so simply wash it off.

, Garter snake bites are not dangerous, though they can hurt and be unpleasant. If you are bitten, stay calm and maintain a grip on the garter snake.Though they are unlikely to bite, it may occasionally happen if they are frightened. If the snake does bite, stay calm and handle the snake carefully.
Since garter snakes are trying to escape, they do not usually hang on to the bitten area. They will try to strike and escape after biting.
Some garter snakes may be hungry and hang onto the bitten area. If they do, gently push its head forward to remove its teeth from where it has bitten you.
The best way to avoid being bitten by garter snakes is to avoid handling them. Garter snakes do not seek out humans, so if you stay away from them they will not bite you.

, Even though garter snakes are not venomous, care for your snake bite wound the way you would any other injury. If it becomes infected, go see a doctor immediately.

Make an appropriate habitat for your garter snake.,
Feed your garter snake.,
Release your garter snake into the wild.",How to Find a Garter Snake3," If you want to keep a garter snake as a pet, make sure you have a cage that is the best size for the snake and has a place for the garter snake to hide.Supply your garter snake with the right amount of space. A 5- to 25-gallon tank is appropriate, depending on the size of the snake. If there’s not enough space, the snake will not be able to exercise and be unhealthy. With too little space, the garter snake will feel exposed.
Give your garter snake with a “hiding box”. A hiding box is a space where the garter snake can conceal itself. Consider putting in a plastic box or a hollow log for the snake to curl up into.
Provide your snake with a water dish that is regularly refilled. This will give them water to drink as well as a way to stay cool.
Keep your snake safe by making sure it cannot escape. Garter snakes are at risk in a home by other pets and humans. Also, a garter snake on the loose can frighten people who do not know if it’s a venomous snake or not.

, These snakes eat a variety of food, but it’s important to provide your snake with a good diet. Ideally, give them mice, but fish and earthworm are also good food for garter snakes. Avoid frogs and toads, since they can cause dangerous infections for garter snakes in captivity.Mice provide garter snakes with a balanced diet. Not all garter snakes eat mice, so make sure yours is one that does. Otherwise, you’ll have to keep in mind ways to balance the garter snake’s diet.
Earthworms are a particularly good diet for younger garter snakes. Cut them into smaller pieces, so they are smaller than the garter snake. They may not be able to eat full-size earthworms when they are younger.
Fish can also be used for garter snakes. Frozen fish is best, since parasites will not be a problem. Don’t give them fresh fish, since your garter snake may become infected.
Avoid feeding your garter snakes frogs and toads. Though garter snakes eat frogs and toads in the wild, they are more resistant to the parasites in frogs and toads. Your pet garter snake will not be as resistant, so it’s best to avoid them entirely.

, Garter snakes may make fun pets, but it may also be best to release them back into the wild. Make sure to bring them back to where you found them, so they will have the best habitat to return to. Also, always release garter snakes back into the wild during the warmest months.Some garter snakes may refuse to eat in captivity. If this is the case, release your garter snake as soon as possible so it does not starve to death.
If the garter snake is not adjusting to captivity, release them within a week or two. Keeping a garter snake too long can reduce its chances of survive in the wild.
Bring garter snakes back to where you found them. They can easily find their way back to their habitat. Returning them to a foreign environment may make them less likely to survive.
Release garter snakes into the wild only during warmer months. Since they hibernate, garter snakes are not able to survive during the winter. Keep them in a warm, safe space until they are ready to come out of hibernation.

Get a male and a female anaconda Make sure both anacondas are at least three to four years in age, as this is when they will be sexually mature.,
Clean the female anaconda’s enclosure.,
Cool down the female anaconda.,
Warm up the female anaconda.,
Introduce the male to the female’s enclosure every seven days.,
Check the female for ovulation.,
Put the male anaconda in the enclosure.,
Check the female for eggs.,
Wait six months for the litter.,
Allow the female to rest for one to two years before mating it again.",How to Mate Anacondas," Check that both snakes are healthy and have a good body weight.You may purchase two anacondas of the opposite sex or contact a snake breeder to use a male or female with your own pet anaconda.
In the wild, anacondas will mate in groups, where there is one female and multiple males. You may start with one female and one male to begin with, and then decide to add more males to increase the chances of mating success.;
, The mating should occur in the female’s enclosure. Wash and wipe down the enclosure well before mating so it is comfortable for both snakes. Make sure the enclosure is large enough to fit one to two more anacondas.You may want to ask a friend to help you by holding the anaconda while you clean out its cage. This way, the snake is attended to while you clean the enclosure.

, Adjusting the female anaconda’s body temperature will make her more receptive to mating. Cool down the female about eight weeks before you plan to mate it.Reduce the daytime temperatures in the enclosure by 5 degrees Fahrenheit, making the cool end 75 to 77 degrees and the hotspot 83 to 87 degrees.
Make the nighttime temperatures in the enclosure cooler by 10 degrees, so the cool end is 68 degrees and the hotspot is 74 degrees.
Give the anaconda two to three meals during the cool down. Feed it smaller than normal meals, as it will be harder for the snake to digest food when its body temperature is lower.

, After the cooling period, warm the anaconda up by increasing the temperatures in the enclosure 2 degrees per day. Do this until the normal ranges in the enclosure are reached.Daytime temperatures should be between 80 and 82 degrees, with hotspots that are 88 and 92 degrees. Nighttime ambient temperatures should be above 78 degrees, with nighttime hotspots that are 84 degrees.
Once the anaconda has warmed back up, give it as much food as it wants.

, To get the female interested in the male, start by putting the male in the female’s enclosure for 24 hours. Then, wait seven days and put the male in the enclosure again for 24 hours. Do this for several weeks. This will give the snakes enough time to get to know each other in a controlled way.You can time the introductions for when the female snake is in a cooling period and then after the cooling period. Having the male and female interact during a range of temperatures can increase the likelihood of mating.

, After the female has met the male several times, look to see if her midsection is bloated, like she has had a large meal. Check that its skin is distended and there is stretching between the scales on its midsection., Once the female shows signs of ovulation, place the male anaconda in its enclosure for mating. Allow the snakes to interact in the enclosure. The courtship may take some time to develop. Over time, the male will wrap around the female for mating.You may decide to put more than one male anaconda in the enclosure for mating. This will allow the males to wrap around the female to compete for it, creating a breeding ball. The breeding ball can last up to four weeks.

, After the anacondas have mated, the male and female will separate. Remove the male from the enclosure. Then, watch the female for signs of pregnancy. The female may appear bloated and develop a large midsection., Female anacondas incubate their eggs in their bodies. It will take six months for the tiny snakes to be born. Anacondas are ovoviviparous, so they give birth to live young. The litter can vary from four to 82 young.Once the tiny snakes have been born, the female anaconda will leave the young to fend for themselves. The babies will shed their skins ten days after birth. You can then feed and house them.

, Female anacondas do not mate very often, as they give birth to large litters. Most species of anaconda will breed every one to two years in the wild. Do not force female anacondas to breed too often, as this can put stress on them."

Check with the U.S. Department of Interior, or your local government, to see if there are regulations regarding pet snakes.;
, There are many different species of snakes, some more suited to becoming a pet than others. Certain snakes grow up to 30 ft (9 m) long! Some snakes can live up to 30 years, so you need to be prepared for that kind of commitment.


If you’ve never owned a snake before, you may want to start with a corn snake, a ball python, or a kingsnake. These snakes have the best temperaments, least amount of feeding issues, highest level of hardiness and healthiness, and come in a variety of colors., You’ll need to learn a lot about the snake you want before purchasing it. Research to find out about the particular snake’s habitat (including lighting and heating requirements), diet, size, temperament, and life span. Make sure you really want a snake and are prepared to take good care of it for the entirety of its life.

, Pet store snakes are often poorly bred or captured in the wild. A better option is to find a breeder you can trust that offers high-quality snakes for a price that you are willing to pay. You should also consider adopting a snake, rather than purchasing from a breeder. This way, you can provide a good home to a snake that someone else wasn’t able to properly care for.


Look for a small-scale breeder, rather than someone who mass produces reptiles.Read reviews about the seller or breeder to see find out if others have had good experiences.
Good breeders and sellers know about the animal they are selling to you and should be willing to answer questions that you may have.

, A healthy snake should have a clear nose and eyes, neatly arranged scales, healthy-looking skin (no blisters or partial shedding), and breathe without respiratory distress. It should not be lethargic, and should allow you to pick it up without too much fuss.Ask the snake's previous owner about the animal's history. This is an important step to ensure you are getting a healthy snake; ask if the snake has had any issues eating, drinking, moving around, or shedding its skin.You also need to know what it eats and how often as well as the date and quality of its last shed (a well-shed skin comes off all in one piece, if the snake sheds in bits and pieces it may be unhealthy)., You'll need a tank or terrarium with a diagonal at least the length of the snake. Make sure you have a place to put a cage this size. You may need a larger home for your snake as it grows, so be sure you are prepared to purchase a larger terrarium if needed.You can choose a plastic enclosure, a cage made of wood, or a glass terrarium.Don’t pick a cage with mesh screens, as they don’t hold heat well, plus the snake may injure its snout by rubbing on the screen, or wear a hole through it and escape.Snakes are escape artists, so you need to have a very secure lid on your tank to ensure the snake does not get out.

, Your snake will also need a hiding place, such as a cave made of rock, a splinter-free piece of driftwood, or a ceramic log to curl up in. Choose something that is durable and easy to clean or replace.Make sure your hiding place is just large enough for your snake. The snake should be able to hide completely out of view in a snug, secure place.
You can also provide rocks, branches, and vines for your snake to climb on. If you choose living vines or plants, ensure they are compatible with, and not poisonous, to your snake species.

, Your snake needs a soft, absorbent material for the bottom of the cage. Find out what kind of bedding is best-suited for the species of snake you are going to purchase. In many cases, shredded newsprint works well.


You can also purchase aspen or cypress shavings for your snake’s bedding. Avoid using fragrant wood shavings, such as cedar or pine.Don’t use aquarium gravel, as the snake could cut itself on the sharp edges of the rocks., Snakes cannot regulate their body temperature the way mammals can. Snakes require heat lamps either above, on the outside walls, or underneath their tanks. Find out which method is best for the species of snake you have.


You should also provide a thermal gradient in the snake’s home; a warm basking area at one end and a cool area at the other end allows the snake to move around depending on its needs.Though heated rocks may look nice, they can burn a snake’s sensitive skin, so do not use them.
You will also need thermometers and hygrometer (humidity gauge) for your snake’s cage to ensure it is the right temperature and humidity., Some snakes do well in natural light, while others require special lamps or lights. Do your research to find out what kind of lighting is best for your snake species, and purchase lights if need be.Some snakes are nocturnal while others are diurnal. Be sure to find out which type your specific snake species is and use timers on your lights if you won’t be home or awake when the lights need to turn on or off.

, You’ll need a small, heavy, dish for the snake to drink out of. You will also need a larger dish for the snake to soak in., Snakes are carnivores and eat frogs, fish, worms, and rodents. Make sure you are comfortable with the idea of this before getting a snake.The best snake food is pre-killed prey: you buy the prey frozen, thaw it out at home, and feed it to the snake.
Be aware of the risks of feeding your snake live prey. Live mice and rats can carry diseases and parasites, and they can bite and struggle, possibly injuring your pet.

, Don't feed or handle your snake for a few days after it has been introduced to its new home so it has time to acclimate. Ensure the temperature and humidity are correct for your snake species before introducing it to its new home., How much and how often you should feed your snake depends on the species and age. Ask your veterinarian when, what, and how much to feed your snake based on its species.


In general, young corn snakes should be fed one small mouse every seven days, while adult corn snakes can eat two small mice every week. Both young and adult kingsnakes should be fed a large mouse or rat every seven days.Great care should be taken around the feeding times of all snakes, as this is when they are most aggressive. Never handle your snake when it is hungry. Do not handle them directly after feeding either, as this may cause them to regurgitate their food.

, Ensure the temperature and humidity are within acceptable ranges for your species of snake. Adjust them immediately if you notice a problem.


Different kinds of snakes need different humidity levels, depending on their native area (e.g., Amazonian rain forest versus American southwestern desert). Find out what is best for your particular snake.
You can change the humidity in the cage by changing the bedding (aspen shavings decrease humidity, while cypress shavings increase it), putting the water dish in the warmer part of the cage (to increase humidity) or the cooler part (to decrease humidity), or adding sphagnum moss to the cage (to increase humidity)., Change the water once a week (or more if it is visibly dirty). You should clean the entire cage at least once a month. Replace the bedding, wash and refill all water dishes, and clean the sides of the tank. Make sure you have a place to put your snake while cleaning its cage so it does not escape.All reptiles can carry salmonella bacteria. After handling your snake, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly. Don't let children under age 6 handle snakes.
Never clean the cage or its components in your kitchen sink, and keep the snake away from human food and dishes.

, Snakes are good pets and solid friends. Handle your snake carefully, bond with it, and enjoy your new pet.

Use your dominant hand to gently squeeze the water out from top to bottom until you reach the bore brush. Skip that part and then continue in the same fashion for the rest of the snake’s length., Use a clean, dry cloth to pat the snake down. Sponge out as much water as you can. Then hang it over a drying rack or clothes hanger, or pin it to a clothesline to air-dry."
"
Bag or bundle your snake.,
Prepare your washer.,
Let your snake soak.,
Restart the washing cycle.,
Air-dry the snake.",How to Clean a Bore Snake2," Put your snake inside a wash bag, pillowcase or something similar. Tie it shut. Alternatively, roll the snake up and then tie it up with white shoelaces or a similarly light-colored machine-safe cord. Do not use the snake’s pull cord to do this, since the knots may tighten during washing, which means you might have to cut the cord to undo your bundle., First, set your washer to a small load on the delicate cycle. Start filling it with water and add a few drops of mild laundry detergent. Once the machine fills, switch it off., Once the machine has filled, place the snake in the soapy water. If it isn't too dirty, give it 15 to 20 minutes to soak. Give it 30 to 40 minutes if it's very soiled., Switch the machine back on once the snake has had a chance to soak. Let the cycle run to its end., Once the cycle completes, take the snake out of its bag or remove its ties. Pin the snake to a clothesline or hang it over a clothes hanger or drying rack so it can air-dry.

"
"
Dry thoroughly before using.,
Use only a toothbrush to clean the bore brush.,
Use only white or light-colored laces or cords to tie your rolled snake.",How to Clean a Bore Snake3," Wait until your snake is totally dry to the touch before running it through your gun’s barrel. Keep in mind that water can rust or otherwise damage your gun. Protect your gun by giving the snake the chance to totally air-dry before bringing the two into contact.Drying times will depend on the materials and size of your snake.

, If you’re in a rush, it may be tempting to wipe the bore brush with the same cloth that you used for the rest of the snake. However, be aware that this will most likely result in fibers being left behind on the brush’s bristles. These in turn will end up in your gun’s barrel when you use the snake next, so definitely use a toothbrush in order to keep your barrel clean., If you’re machine-washing and choosing to roll your snake up and tie it into a bundle, never use dark-colored shoelaces or cords to do so. Expect these to possibly stain your snake during its wash. These stains will make it harder to judge what’s dirt, what's oil, and what’s just a stain."

Take good care of them.",How to Choose Your First Pet Snake," Here are some options you can consider:

There are small snakes, and big snakes. Big snakes can be 30 feet (10m) long, most people want a smaller snake. Smaller snakes need smaller cages and eat less food.



 


Many snakes eat mice, you might prefer a snake that eats fish or snails or other. It is much easier to own a snake that eats frozen food rather than live.






Some snakes are easy to handle, others not so much. Think about how much you want to play with your snake.






Some snakes are venomous. OK, most people would not buy a rattlesnake or a cobra.





;
, There are a couple of beginner snakes that you should think about for your first pet snake. These are snakes with a calm temperament and are fairly easy to look after.


Corn snakes are perhaps the easiest of snakes to care for and can be held and tamed very easily. These are an active and curious species which will like to slither around and check stuff out.






You could also take a look at Ribbon snakes, Black Rat snakes, King snakes and Milk snakes which also have similar personalities as members of the Colubrid family.






If you would like a snake that is less active and slow moving, a great choice is a Ball Python. They do not get very big and will enjoy just sitting in your hands or hanging around your neck.







, Children will often benefit from different kinds of snakes than adults. The minimum age for a child to have a snake it about 5.



Corn snakes and Ball Pythons are great choices for kids, since they are friendly, slow, don't get that big and are fairly robust.

, If you are not purchasing from a reliable source, you can find a lot of snakes appear to look the same and it can be difficult to know exactly what species of snake you are getting unless you seek professional advice.

, Anacondas, reticulated pythons, venomous snakes and Burmese pythons can be dangerous animals if proper care and locked enclosures are not provided. It is best to leave these species for more experienced keepers. You will also find that these have very specific care requirements meaning that the smallest of mistakes will result in an almost catastrophic accident!

, Before you decide upon having a snake as a pet, remember that some species can live over thirty years, making this a lifelong commitment that you should be one hundred percent sure about.

, Different snakes have different needs for equipment and feeding. More advanced snakes need monitoring of temperatures, humidity and complicated feeding that you need to take into account. Research is essential and is the first step that you must take.

Corn snakes and Ball Pythons are equally friendly, but Ball Pythons can not tolerate temperatures below 75 degrees F (24 degrees C). If your house gets cold, would need heating for the Ball Python's cage.






Asian Vine Snakes are very interesting, but they only eat lizards. Buying one would involve quite a chore in keeping it fed.







, On occasion, a child brings home a snake caught in the wild, which turns out to be an endangered species! Check with your local humane society or the Department of the Interiorto check.

, Exotic animal smuggling is a large business and can contribute to the extinction of endangered species.

, Animals that are wild caught and smuggled across continents have the following issues that you may notice:

You may see increased aggression. A wild captured snake will be stressed out and unsure of the new smaller surroundings. This can make the snake scared of you and be more aggressive.






You may have trouble getting a smuggled animal to eat due to its stress level. Secondly, it may not eat until it is adjusted to captivity.






You may find parasites in snakes that have been living in the wild and may need expensive treatment by a veterinarian.







, Even when you get a snake from a friend of a friend and you do not know how badly or how well the snake has been treated, making long term implications for future care of the snake.

Craigslist is full of people trying to get rid of their snakes, but for reasons above is less good than other places to get a snake. Still, many times you can get a snake for free there.






Reptile shows are fun places to get your snake, and the exhibitors are knowledgeable compared to pet store employees. Still, it is hard to decide which are the reputable breeders and which are not.







, There are many related wikihows for all kinds of snakes that you can read. It is also great to chat with other snake owners and learn from them.

,, Snakes are wonderful creatures if you take care of them and make sure that they are fed correctly, homed correctly and handled in the right manner. Research cannot be stressed enough; the more you know, the higher the chance that you will get everything right and the longer and happier relationship you will have together.

Go around the entire house on your knees, or even better your belly which puts your eyes at bunny level, looking for potential threats.,
Find a way to deal with every threat.,
Place a crate around chewable things.,
Tidy up.,
Make a list of rules for the whole family to follow.,
Spread suitable rabbit toys around the room/house.,
Provide a safe spot for their bathroom needs.,
Train your bunny to come, if possible.",How to Rabbit Proof Your Home," Even if the bunny will be confined to one room, he will get out sooner or later, so it's best to do the entire house. Potential threats include:


Electric cables, especially when attached to heavy things (e.g., kettles, irons, etc) or if they are dangling in their path.






Bleach, pesticide and other chemicals






Small cracks, holes and gaps which your bunny may get stuck in. They can get into surprisingly small spaces and are drawn to dark hideaways. Remember that they are burrowing PREY species.





;
, Put it out of reach (preferably somewhere high up, rather than simply in a cupboard) cover it up with something your rabbit cannot chew through, or get rid of it all together. If none of these are possible, keep the room strictly off-bounds for the rabbit until you have a solution.


Electric wires and cables are dangerous; unplug and store them, or cover them with plastic sleeves. Don't choose cord covers/protectors that are scented, or have spaces in them.







, You probably have furniture or items made from wood, metal, plastic, and stuff that your bunny can chew on that is not edible but may seem attractive to the rabbit. To avoid letting your bunny chew on these things is to put a pen or some kind of crate around it. This way he/she can't get through to it., Something as innocent as a piece of string can potentially kill your rabbit if he finds it lying on the floor. Remember, rabbits are curious and love to chew.

, You are essentially rabbit-proofing your family as well. Make children in particular aware of the rules. Make sure these are included:


Do not feed junk food to the rabbit






Do not feed too much fruit to the rabbit






Do not pick up the rabbit without warning






Do not squeeze, hit, poke or shout at the rabbit






Do not leave chemicals, junk food, rubbish or string/yarn lying in the rabbit's reach. This is especially true for chocolate, which is very appealing to them and is poisonous for bunnies.







, These can be used to possibly distract the bunny from chewing things., Bunnies do not litter train like cats do, but you can put a litter box where they have had a pee and they will use it, especially if you wipe the inside bottom of the pan with the paper towel you just wiped the pee up with (clean the original spot with an enzyme odor-removing cleaner). They key off of both scent and location. Once they are using the box regularly, it can be gradually moved to a more convenient nearby location, if necessary. Some bunnies can be trained to poop only in their litter box but others cannot. This is not usually a problem, since their pellets are usually dry and easily swept up.

Do not use clumping clay litter for bunnies. It can cause digestive problems.

, Some bunnies can be trained to the ""come"" command. If they can, do so, since this makes them much easier to find/ catch/ remove from behind the washing machine... Be sure to always reward a bunny well for responding promptly and enthusiastically to this command, since it can be a life saver."

Make sure you wash your hands after feeding.,
Do not handle the snake after feeding.,
Provide a temperature gradient by placing a heat mat under the cage.,
Give your snake a moist area.,
Pick up your snake at its center.",How to Care for Baby Cornsnakes," For babies, a 10 gallon tank with a heating pad under 1/3 of the tank is perfect. If you choose to house a baby in a larger aquarium, include many more hide boxes to make it feel more secure. Set this up several days before getting your snake so that the temperature can regulate.When a corn snake is purchased as a baby, place it in a small vivarium and increase vivarium sizes as the snake grows. If a small baby is placed into a large vivarium straight away, it will become territorial and strike at anyone who goes near it and will most likely bite them.
Keep only one snake per tank because they may become hostile if kept together.;
, For easy access and viewing, place it high enough to look in, but low enough you can reach into it. Do not place tank near a window or other drafty area, as this can effect the temperature too much.


Also, keep in mind that you should place your snake's home somewhere where it will not be disturbed by other pets or small children.

, You will need to put aspen shavings or similar bedding in your snake's tank. at least two hides (one dry and one moist for shedding), and decorative plants.Aspen substrate is best. Do not use pine, cedar, soil, or bark as substrates.

, It is important to include a dish of water containing clean water in your snake's tank. Use a water dish that's a bit heavy, so your snake will not tip over the water bowl.The water should be changed every day.

, Once you purchase a baby corn snake you should get it into its new home as quickly as possible. Try not to handle the snake, however, so just release it into the tank. Lift the cover off its travel container and setting the container in the tank, allowing the snake to come out in its own time.


Handling can cause the snake stress and it will already be stressed from traveling to its new home.

, Spot clean your tank to remove feces as soon as it appears. However, you should also do a full clean once every two weeks to a month, depending on your snakes size and the amount of waste it produces.To clean the tank, you will need to remove the snake temporarily. Remove all substrate, clean all items that need to go back in the tank, and then put new substrate and cleaned items back in the tank once it is dry.

, Pinkies are dead mice that were only a day to a week old. They are available at most pet stores and can be ordered online from reptile suppliers. Make sure that you are getting small pinkies, as baby corn snakes need a smaller pinkie than older snakes.Buy frozen mice in bulk because it can save you money.
Never feed live food to your snake. The live food can harm your snake and potentially kill it. Also, feeding live animals to snakes in the UK is illegal.

, Some people who have snakes simply feed them in their tank. Others prefer to feed their snakes in feeding tubes outside of their tanks, which are typically just plastic tubs that are lined with paper towels. The idea behind this option is that if the snakes are never fed in their tanks, then they will bite less often. A hand going into the tank will never be assumed to be food, as the snake will never have been fed in the tank.Additionally, some argue that the snake can ingest substrate if it is fed in its tank. This can cause a snake digestive problems.

, Warm the pinkie if it is frozen. Put it into warm water and wait for it to fully defrost. When it is defrosted, dry it off with a paper towel and then pick it up by the tail with tweezers.The pinkie doesn't need to be totally warm but it should not be frozen when you offer it to your snake.

, Place the mouse nose-to-nose with the snake. Slightly shake the tweezers you are holding it with to catch the snakes attention. If your snake is hungry, it should begin to bite the pinkie.When the snake strikes, let go of the mouse and allow the snake to swallow it.

, Baby cornsnakes will need to be fed every 5 to 7 day to keep them healthy. You should see whether your cornsnake seems interested in food after 5 days have elapsed by dangling a pinkie in front of it. If the snake is interested, give it the food. The prey item should be at least as wide as your snakes thickest body section but can be up to 1.5 times bigger. If the prey item is small compared to your snake, feed it two. If it is larger, feed it one.
Adult cornsnakes should be fed every 7 to 10 days. They are no longer growing, so they need fewer calories to thrive.
Corn snakes will overeat if you offer them more food.

, Always use antibacterial soap or hand gel before and after holding your snake and before and after feeding it. This will help to stop bacteria and parasites, like salmonella, from spreading.Washing your hands when you are interacting with your snake is very important. It helps to protect your health, as well as the health of your snake.

, Wait 2-3 days after feeding to handle the snake. Your snake will need some time and privacy to properly digest its food.If you feed your snake in a feeding tub, simply pick up the tub after the snake begin digesting its meal and allow the snake to reenter its tank without being handled.

, Corn snakes ONLY need belly heat. Snakes in the wild do not bask they hide most of the day so they do not benefit from a basking lamp like lizards do.You will want to place a heating pad under about 1/3 of the aquarium. This will give your snake a side of its tank that is warmer and a side that is cooler.


The temperature should be 85-90 on the warm end and 70-75 on the cool end.
Place a thermometer inside the enclosure so that you can monitor the temperature.

, Your snake should have access to a moist area when it is shedding. Do not raise the humidity of the entire tank, as this can cause respiratory infections. However, you should put a moist paper towel or moist moss in an area to give it some moisture.Corn snakes are not tropical and do not need raised humidity.

, When picking up your snake, scoop it up at the center of its body. Don't pinch or grab it. Picking it up improperly can injure the snake or can cause the snake to bite.You should approach the snake from the side when picking it up. This will be less stressful for the snake, as approaches from the top are similar to predator attacks.
Be aware that the snake may bite when you try to pick it up, especially when you are first beginning to hold it. Corn snakes are great snakes for beginners due to their docile nature, but they can still bite.

See if your rabbit is dehydrated and/or overheated.,
Observe your rabbit's drinking habits daily.,
Fill your rabbit's water bottle or bowl with cool, fresh water.,
Consider adding an ice cube to your rabbit's water bottle or bowl.,
Feed your rabbit vegetables and fruit daily.",How to Make Sure Your Rabbit Is Hydrated During the Summer," Rabbits cannot pant or sweat. The most recognizable signs of dehydration and being overheated are very red and hot ears, heavy breathing, and lying flat on the ground. If your rabbit is overheated or dehydrated, take him/her to the vet immediately.;
, Is he/she drinking lots of water?

, It shouldn't be too cold.

, Special ice cube trays can be purchased so that the ice cubes will fit into water bottles.

, Good fruits and veggies to feed your rabbit are carrots, celery (which is great to keep your rabbit hydrated), Romaine lettuce, a bit of cucumber, or a slice of apple. Make sure that they are not being feed more than 2 tablespoons of fruit sugars daily.

Pick an appropriate probe.,
Have someone hold the snake face up.,
Apply lubricant to the probe.,
Bend the tail backwards.,
Insert the probe.,
Examine how far the probe went in.",How to Sex a Corn Snake1," Ball-tipped probes are generally safest so they don't hurt the snake, though ones that are dull-tipped are also appropriate. You can find kits online that come with several sizes.You don't want to use one too small. The probe should just fit inside the opening when you perform the procedure.However, don't ever use one over 4 millimeters on a corn snake.;
, It is difficult to do this procedure by yourself. It's much easier if you have someone available to hold the snake face up. You should be looking at the tail end.Make sure the person is supporting most of the snake's body with her hands, especially the middle part of the body.You can also have her control the head by placing gentle pressure on either side of the head at the base. The reason you don't grasp the snake underneath the head is because it can cut off breathing., It helps make the procedure go more smoothly if you apply some kind of lubrication to the probe. You can dip the probe in petroleum jelly or something like KY Jelly., Gently tip the tail away from you. This slight bend will expose the cloacal opening, which is where you will be inserting the probe. Locate the opening., Use the tip of the probe to gently find an opening, going towards the tail end. You don't want to push too hard, as you can hurt the snake. Once you find an opening, push the probe in, letting it go as far as it will without too much pressure., Count how many scales the probe went in. If you can't tell, mark where it is at the opening with your finger and pull it out. Hold it up against the snake from the opening towards the tail. Count the number of scales. If it only went in a couple of scales, it's likely a female. If it went in 8 to 16 scales, it's likely a male.The reason you probe a snake is to see how far the probe goes. If it goes a longer way in, you have a male snake. If it goes a short way in, you have a female snake. Essentially, when you are inserting it along one of his hemipenes, one of two of his inverted genitalia. A female doesn't have these parts, so you won't be able to go as far."
"
Get a vivarium/tank.,
For Bedding/Substrate, NEVER use Cedar bedding, it's toxic to ALL snakes.,
Place the repticarpet in the bottom of the vivarium (it should be swapped out and cleaned every 1 to 2 weeks.,
Give your snake places to hide.,
Provide climbing branches and plants.,
Get the right types of fake plants.,
Provide some Other vivarium items/decorations:


ALSO: Plastic/artificial logs, rocks, etc.,
Put climbing objects and other 'decorations' in the vivarium.,
Provide a source of heat.,
Have a way to provide humidity.,
Have a method for temperature and humidity control.",How to Create a Corn Snake Vivarium," For hatchling (baby) corn snakes, a 10 gallon (37.9 L) or even a 20 gallon (75.7 L) viv (vivarium) is sufficient. If your snake is an adult, most recommend a 40 gallon (151.4 L) viv, which your snake will happily live in for life. A glass vivarium will be perfect for housing one corn snake.;
, Many snake owners like newspaper since it's cheap, efficient, and easy to clean. If you prefer something more natural, many snake owners recommend Aspen. It's 99% nontoxic, cheap, looks pretty, natural, and virtually snake safe. To protect your snake if using a UTH (Under Tank Heater), It's recommended that you buy two repticarpets. They're relativity cheap and fit in the bottom of the vivarium. This allows your snake to burrow for extra warmth without the risk of burns from the UTH.

, This is why you should have two so while one is being cleaned the other one is in use).


Pour about a half inch to an inch of substrate on top of the repticarpet and evenly distribute/lay out over the whole floor of the viv.

, Your corn snake will need hides to make him/her feel secure/safe. Corn snakes prefer to have a tight-fitting hides that touch them on all sides, so avoid using anything to large. If you are using a hide that's too big, try stuffing it with crumpled paper-towels, it works quite well!


Place one hide on the warm side and one hide on the cool side, you can even place a hide in the middle. For hatchlings a lot of snake owners prefer to give them a rang of hide options, placing one on the warm side, cool side, and middle.






If the hide is too big, stuff it with paper-towels. REMEMBER: You can always make homemade hides instead of buying them! A paper-towel roll, a glued together Popsicle stick hide (Use a hot-glue gun), plastic containers, etc!







, Corn snakes are partially arboreal snakes and providing artificial plants and climbing branches will provide stimulation, comfort, hiding places, etc.

,

Artificial plants, leafed vines, and other artificial foliage can be placed throughout the vivarium, on the warm side, cool side, and in between, against back walls, sides, etc. Wherever you want, but remember to provide more than one plant. This will give your snake a range of spots to climb, relax, warm up, cool down, etc.






Provide a climbing branch for your snake. You can either make one yourself or buy one from your local pet store. These can be angled wherever you like but remember to make sure:






The snake can climb up and down it.
it can support the snake's weight.
It's not so thick the snake can't coil around it.



, that can be found in pet stores and are meant for snakes/reptiles can also be put into the vivarium to provide as more forms of stimulation, encourage exploring, climbing, and provides more hiding places

, Put these decorations/objects in different areas of the viv, not just all on one side.

, Corn snakes require temps of: Day- Warm side: 80–85 °F (27–29 °C) and Cool side: 72–80 °F (22–27 °C). Night- Warm side: 75–80 °F (24–27 °C) and Cool side: 70–75 °F (21–24 °C). The most popular way to heat a vivarium for corn snakes in an UTH, aka Under Tank Heater.


How to place an under tank heater:(1) Place UTH on bottom of viv on side meant to be the warm side, make sure it covers NO MORE THAN half the vivarium. (2) Buy a THERMOSTAT and use it to regulate the temps of the UTH.






Other heat sources: You can also use a heat lamp to provide extra heat, since in some areas during the winter months a UTH will be unable to provide enough heat. Using a lamp with a Full Spectrum or UVA bulb also provides a day and night cycle. You want about 12 hours day and 12 hours night.






Setting up heat lamp: (1) Screw Full Spectrum Day Bulb or UVA day/basking bulb into heat lamp. (2) Place on warm side of vivarium in the middle of the warm side (Not crossing over into cool side or in middle of viv). (3) Plug lamp into RHEOSTAT to control how hot the bulb gets and plug the RHEOSTAT into a timer which will provide the day and night cycle. (4) Plug rheostat into a TIMER to provide the day and night cycle for your snake. 12 hours day and 12 hours night is good.

, You'll want the humidity to be between 35-60%. No more than 60%, no less than 35%. 50% is ideal. Heat lamps take away from humidity some recommend taking a dish-towel and soaking it, ringing it out, and placing it over half the vivarium, but there are many other ways out there, which are listed below:


Humidity ideas: (1) You can mist the cage every day or every other day if you prefer. A recommended method suggests using Distilled Water so it doesn't leave droplet marks on the glass. (2) Wet dish towel over half the viv (rung out before placing). (3) You could also make a humidity box by getting a small plastic container with a lid and making holes in the sides and lid of the container, but make sure they're not big enough for the snake to get in through them. Place damp peat moss inside of the container and put the lid on. Place it on the warm side of the viv.

, You'll want to buy a rheostat to control brightness/dimness/heat of bulb in the heat lamp, Thermostat to control temps of UTH, Thermometer/Hydrometer to read the temps of bot sides as well as the humidity.


Note about Thermometers/hygrometers: To put it simply the analog thermometer/hydrometers can be very inaccurate. Most snake experts recommend getting a digital Thermometer/hygrometer that has a good rating and reputation.

Know when snakes shed.",How to Care for a Corn Snake," Corn snake adults can get to be as big as 5 feet (1.4m) long. You may not need a 20 gallon (75.7 L) enclosure at start, but eventually you will. The enclosure can be either a tank or vivarium. When the snake is small, it is ok to start your pet off in a smaller tank such as a Living World Faunarium or similar product. For a large snake, the vivarium should be around 30–50 inches (76.2–127.0 cm) long but there's not real limit on size, just make sure it's big enough.;
, Provide a heat mat that covers about 1/3 of the tank floor to provide a proper heat gradient. The heat mat must be thermostatically controlled because they reach in excess of 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) which will severely burn the snake. Position the heat mat over one side to get that gradient. Temperatures should be about 75-85 degrees F, 23-29 degrees C, with the higher temperature on the warm area of the tank at one side.


Corn snakes are nocturnal and use the heat from the ground, not heat from the sun so heat lamps are not suitable. Hot rocks are never suitable for any pet as they provide a localized source of heat that is too hot. A cold snake may curl around it, seriously burning itself.

, Try to provide a hiding place in the hot side for sure, others are optional. The hide should be placed in the warm area of the tank over the heat mat. Hides can be anything from shop-bought ones to Lego pieces. Be creative here but make sure you materials are non-toxic.

, There are many, many different floor coverings commercially available for corn snakes but you best options are aspen chips and newspaper. Newspaper is the best as it is very absorbent and easy to replace. While practical, newspaper is not very aesthetically pleasing. If you want a decorative substrate, use aspen. Other good options are bark or cypress mulch. Do not use cedar shavings in a snake habitat as it is toxic to reptiles.

, Corn snakes are becoming more and more easy to obtain, but that doesn't mean you should seek them out. Wild ones do not adjust well to captivity and have a low survival rate. Captive bred ones have been in captivity for many generations and have become very domesticated. Find a good breeder, either through a forum or other source. Pet shops are not good as you cannot be sure if the snake comes from a reputable source. Once you have your snake, leave it 5 days before feeding or handling it so it can settle in.

, You should provide a bowl of water for your snake, big enough for it to soak if it wishes. Change the water twice a week. The bowl can be on either the cool or warm side. Be aware that a bowl on the warm side will increase the humidity.

, You do not need UV lights or calcium supplements like you do in other reptiles that eat insects. Snakes DO in fact use UV to synthesize vitamin D3 but in captivity they don't need it because they receive vitamin D3 from the mice They eat. They also get calcium too. Vitamin D is in the liver of mice and calcium is in the bones., They are a solitary species. Keeping two snakes together can increase their stress. Corn snakes in captivity (especially hatchlings) have been known on occasion to eat one another, with both snakes involved dying. The only exception is a breeding pair. If you wish to breed, check that your female is 300g, 3 feet (0.9 m) long and 3 years old (333 rule) and consult a good book. Do not cohabit your breeding pair until you know that they and you are ready. Inbreeding is best avoided.

, Baby corn snakes are started on pinkie size mice and progress up the sizes of: pinkie mice, fuzzy mice, small mice (hoppers), medium mice (weaned), large mice (adult) and extra large (jumbo adult) as they grow.


Here is a rough guide of what to feed a snake.Note that names vary regionally. The slashes in the size guide work like this: American English/British English.

Snake: 4-15g — Mouse: Pinkie;
Snake: 16-30g — Mouse: Pinkie x2;
Snake: 30-50g — Fuzzy;
Snake: 51-90g — Mouse: Hopper/Small;
Snake: 90-170g — Mouse: weaned/medium;
Snake: 170-400g — Mouse: Adult/large;
Snake: 400g+ — Mouse: jumbo adult/large.


It is best to feed your snake on frozen/thawed mice as they will not injure your snake and it's much more humane. You can also keep frozen mice for longer as they will not grow or die.
To feed, hold the prey item in the tweezers and wiggle it in front of your snake. It will strike and possibly constrict then swallow it's food whole. Do not feed on loose substrate as this can cause a fatal gut block if the substrate is digested. Feeding your snake out of it's tank is an easy solution to this and also it means that the snake does not associate feeding with its tank but be careful because if you handle your snake after a feed then it can regurgitate its meal so wait 48 hours before holding your snake again!

, Snake droppings aren’t very big so cage cleaning doesn’t need to happen often. It will need to be cleaned about every 3 or so weeks but scoop out fresh excrement where possible. Feed your snake weekly and give it a change of scene once in a while and it will be happy in it’s new home.

, Pick your snake up by the middle of the body and support it with both hands. When holding your snake, hold it away from your face. Pet it in the way the scales go; they don't like it the other way around. Do not handle a snake after it’s eaten for 48 hours. Wash your hands before and after handling your snake. If it struggles, do not put it back but persevere or it will never learn to be friendly.

, When your snake’s eyes glass over it’s time for it to shed. Your snake should not be handled at this stage; as they may resort to self defense, wait until after the shed.


To aid in shedding, all you have to do is provide a moist hide. This is a plastic container either lined with moist paper towel or filled with damp moss. The container should have a lid and a hole cut out so they can go inside. Although the water dish should be on the cold side most of the time, you should put it on the hot side when your snake is in pre-shed. Mist 2-3 times daily in this time also.
After a few days, your snake's eyes will return to normal and a few days after that the shed will happen. You may want to measure and laminate the shed as a record.

"
Have someone hold the other end of the snake.,
Find the cloaca again.,
Place your thumb under the cloaca.,
Use your other thumb to apply pressure.,
Watch for the hemipenes.",How to Sex a Corn Snake2," Some corn snakes will bite when you pop them. Therefore, try to have someone control the head so you don't get bitten. The person should hold the snake near the base of the head, placing light pressure on the sides of the head. Don't apply pressure underneath the head, as that can cut off breathing.Remember to only perform this technique on hatchlings.

, With the snake's belly up, look at the tail of the snake. Find the opening that is a few inches from the tip of the tail. Have tip going away from you., Using your dominant hand, apply gentle pressure just underneath the opening. Hold the tip of the tail with your other hand., Moving from the tip of the tail towards the cloaca, apply gentle pressure along the snake. You are gently squeezing it toward the cloaca, sort of like getting toothpaste out of a tube.Applying excessive force could cause tissue damage to the snake. Make sure you don't press too hard.
Before you try this procedure for yourself it is best to be shown what to do by an expert, such as a specialist reptile vet or a trained herpetologist.

, In a male snake, the hemipenes will pop out.You'll see two little tubes pop out of the opening if it is a male.A female won't have these tubes. All you'll see is two pink dots at the opening.

"
"
Find the cloaca opening.,
Look at the girth.,
Count scales.",How to Sex a Corn Snake3," The cloaca opening or vent is near the end of the tail. Find the opening to help identify where to look., In a female snake, the body of the snake will immediately taper after the vent, going towards the tip of the tail. In a male snake, generally the tail will stay the same girth for an inch or two before tapering.Males will also be longer from the cloaca to the tip, but that is difficult to distinguish if you don't have another snake for a comparison., Another method to visually determine the sex of the snake is to count the scales from the cloaca to the tip of the tale on the underside of the belly. It's easiest to do this process on a shed skin, as you will have a hard time keeping a snake still for the process. In an adult, males usually have more than 140 scales, while females usually have less than 130 scales. Between 130 and 140, it is difficult to tell the sex.If you can't see it very well, try taking a picture and zooming in."
"
Learn to differentiate between an adult corn snake and a newborn.,
Go to a reptile breeder.,
Ask whether the snake has eaten if it's a newborn.,
Ask what type of food the snake has eaten in the past.,
Ask to hold the snake.,
Inspect it to make sure it looks healthy.",How to Buy a Pet Corn Snake," A newborn will simply be smaller than an older one. It's important to ask whoever you purchase your corn snake from the snake's age. There are pros and cons to each side- A newborn can't breed and is more fragile, however can be trained to be friendlier and easily eat frozen mice. An adult, on the other hand, can breed, is less fragile, but may have issues eating frozen mice.
, Rather than a pet store, it's best to contact a reptile breeder and meet them. This way, you can ask them about the conditions in which the corn snake was raised and possibly see the snake's environment for yourself. You can also be sure that the snake was born in captivity and now caught wild., Some young snakes aren't fed for a long time, until they are bought in order to save money for breeders. This means that the snake could be starving and possibly near death, and as a result unfriendly to humans as well., This will provide you with a clear understanding of what to feed the snake in the future and whether or not you need to transition the snake out of live mice into frozen ones., Hold the snake for several minutes. The corn snake will naturally be scared at first, however it should begin to calm down the more you hold it. If the corn snake does not calm down, however, this may indicate that it was mistreated or caught in the wild rather than being born in captivity. Also look to see that the corn snake is sticking its tongue out regularly as well as alert, as this indicates a healthy snake., Specifically make sure the snake has clear eyes without cloudiness, even skin that doesn't seem particularly thin in areas, no cuts or scrapes, and no signs of mites or ticks."

Bring your bunny indoors.,
Keep your rabbit out of direct sunlight.,
Ensure good airflow.,

Cool your rabbit quickly.",How to Keep Your Rabbits Cool on a Sunny Hot Day," If it is an especially warm day and you are concerned about your rabbit overheating outdoors, just let it hang out inside. Make sure that your house is cooler and bunny-proof first, however (all electrical cords should be covered or hidden, rooms your rabbit should not be in must be closed off, etc.).If your rabbit spends most of its time outdoors, be cautious when bringing it indoors. Sudden changes in environment might make it physically or emotionally stressed. Keep an eye on your bunny while it is indoors. If it seems stressed, take it back outdoors and look for other methods to keep it cool.If your bathroom or another room has cool tiles on its floor, this can be a great place for your rabbit to play and beat the heat.;
, When it’s very hot outside, your rabbit will naturally want to seek some shade. If it is in a hutch that has bright sun beaming down on it, move the hutch to a covered area. If it is not possible to move the rabbit’s hutch, take the animal itself to a safe and cooler location.If your rabbit or its hutch are indoors, closing curtains and/or blinds will also keep sunlight out and your rabbit cooler.Keep in mind that you might have to periodically move the rabbit’s hutch during the day as the sun travels across the sky.
Painting the hutch white will also keep it cooler, since this will radiate more light away.

, Making sure that air is circulating in and around your rabbit’s hutch will help keep it cool. If the hutch is outdoors, keep it away from any walls so that it is free on all sides. Indoors, you can place fans near the hutch. Don’t let the fans blow directly on the hutch, however, because many rabbits will not like this.Hutches should have wire floors so that air can circulate in and out.

, Indoors or outdoors, you can provide some additional shade by placing a light sheet, umbrella, or similar covering on top of your rabbit’s hutch. If you are placing the cover directly on the cage, however, make sure that it is made of a breathable material—cloth works, but plastic or very thick covers might make the hutch too hot., If the covering on your rabbit’s cage is dampened, this can provide additional cooling power. You can also mist your rabbit’s hutch with water for a similar effect.If it is both hot and humid, however, this technique may actually make things worse. Only use damp dowels or misting to cool your rabbit when the humidity is relatively low., When it gets hot, rabbits in the wild will naturally start to dig around in the ground to seek cooler spots below the surface. You can provide similar comfort to your rabbit by putting some cool ceramic tiles down in its hutch (or on the floor if it is indoors). You should be able to find some tiles at a hardware store. Spraying them with water and/or putting them in the refrigerator for awhile first will make them extra cool., Automatic cooling can be provided by a regular icepack or even a frozen water bottle. If you set one in your rabbit’s hutch, it can lean against it for a hit of relief. Make sure to wrap the icepack or bottle in a towel first, however, since direct contact with the frozen item might can be painful or cause frostbite.If your rabbit has a habit of chewing on water bottles or plastic, keep the bottle/icepack on top of or near the cage, but not in it., Rather than perspiring, rabbits radiate heat from their ears to cool themselves. You can help this process by slightly misting your rabbit’s ears. Don’t overdo it, though—you want to dampen the ears, but not soak them. If it is humid outside, skip this step, since it can actually make your rabbit more uncomfortable., It’s always important to provide your rabbit with fresh water, but when the weather is very warm, it is critical. To encourage your rabbit to stay adequately hydrated during the heat, give it both a dripper and an open bowl of water. Replenish both frequently., When it’s hot, you might be tempted to get a cool treat to beat the heat. Your rabbit might just appreciate this, too. Try giving it frozen or chilled vegetables to nibble on and get some relief.If you are adventurous, you can even try pureeing some vegetables and freezing them in ice cube trays. Once the cubes are ready, give one to your pet and see if it is interested in its very own rabbit “ice pop.”

, If you are concerned that your bunny is bothered by the heat, offer it one of its favorite treats. The comfort food might make it feel better. If the rabbit refuses treats, it could be a sign that it’s sick, or possibly seriously affected by the heat., Even if your rabbit is used to being moved around, this can cause it to feel stressed. When it’s already uncomfortable because of the heat, this stress can be more than the rabbit can take. If you must handle your rabbit during a period of hot weather, do so early in the morning or at night, since it will be cooler at these times., The normal body temperature for a rabbit ranges from 101 F - 103 F (38.3 C - 39.4 C). If you think that your rabbit might be too hot, take its temperature to be sure.The best way to check your pet’s temperature is to use a plastic rectal thermometer. If you don’t have experience doing this, or are afraid of harming your rabbit, take it to a veterinarian for help.

, When your rabbit is exposed to high temperatures for a prolonged period, they may begin to suffer heat prostration, which is a form of heat exhaustion. This is more likely to happen when temperatures are above 92 F (33 C). Symptoms of heat prostration in rabbits can include:Bluish lips, tongue, or ears
Increased pulse or breathing rate
A wet nose or mouth
Froth at the mouth

, If you see that your rabbit is showing signs of heat prostration, you will have to act quickly to save its life. Place the rabbit in a tub or basin of cool (not cold water) for a few seconds, making sure to keep its head out of the water. This will help bring your rabbit’s temperature back down. Call a vet or bring your rabbit to one for an examination as soon as possible."
"
Monitor the temperature.,
Keep your rabbit cage well-ventilated.,
Hang a wet towel over top of your rabbit cage.,
Use ice to cool down its cage.,
Limit exercise time to morning and evening hours when it's cooler both indoors and outdoors.",How to Keep Pet Rabbits Cool1," The ideal temperature for a rabbit is between 55 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. They can tolerate temperatures as high as 85 degrees Fahrenheit, if absolutely necessary, but anything higher will increase the risk of heat stroke.If you keep your rabbit outdoors, pay attention to the temperature. Summertime is the most common time of the year to be concerned. If your rabbit is left outdoors in a pen or a cage during the summer months, its fur will trap the sun’s heat, causing it to heat up quickly.Keep your rabbit’s cage out of the sun.Cover any windows with blinds and curtains if necessary. If this doesn't make a difference, consider moving the cage to a cooler part of the house, such as a basement. If you have a window air conditioning unit, you can close the doors to that room and keep the bunny there. If you have central air conditioning, you may want to close some vents and direct the cool air to the rabbit room to manage the electricity bills. You can also purchase standing air conditioning units for a particular room.;
, Use fans to cool your rabbit. Position an oscillating fan so that it blows in the rabbit cage, but not directly on the rabbit. This will create a breeze to cool your rabbit down. Make sure that your rabbit can escape the fan if it chooses. You can build a hiding place for the rabbit with a cardboard box. Be careful that the rabbit doesn't chew on the cords. This can be quite hazardous.
A wire covered cage allows air to flow freely from all sides. If your rabbit is outdoors in a hutch keep them in the shade and allow for cover without compromising ventilation. Bedding should be absorbent and non-toxic like straw, aspen shavings, CareFresh (recycled paper), or wheat-based like Eco-Straw. These materials air out easily and don’t retain heat.A circulating ceiling fan above the cage is another option. Used in combination with floor fans, ceiling units can effectively ventilate your rabbit’s area.

, This is especially effective in combination with a running fan. Not only will the towel provide shade, but the cool moisture will help as well.


Take a normal sized shower towel (roughly 2.5' x 3.5'). Soak it in cool water. Wring it out and place it on top of the cage. Try to to cover the entire cage with the towel. You want to make sure that you don't obstruct the cage's ventilation. Make sure that the towel is not still dripping either. You don't want to soak your rabbit., Put some ice packs underneath your rabbit cage. This will cool the bottom of the cage. You can also freeze a water bottle and place that inside the cage to create a cool spot for the rabbit to lie against when it is too hot. Never apply ice directly to the rabbit's body. Doing so may lower your rabbit’s temperature too quickly., Rabbits should get at least a couple hours of out-of-cage play time a day. Your rabbit won't feel like running and playing as much if s/he is very hot."

For rabbits that live outdoor in hutches, make sure that the latch is on securely.,
When the rabbits are playing on the lawn (whether its in a rabbit pen or on a leash), always keep an eye on them.,
For indoor rabbits, make sure all electrical plugs and cords are hidden and out of the rabbit's reach as well as potted plants.,
Don't accidentally step on your rabbit.,
Never leave two un-neutered rabbits together in a room unattended.,
Always feed the rabbits the right food.,
Keep the rabbit's pen/cage/hutch clean.,
Keep your rabbit up-to date with the veterinarian.,
Never feed your pet human-processed food.,
If you are having mice/rat problems, don't place poison sitting in dishes on the floor.,
Always make sure they have fresh water available.

,
If you have other pets, such as a dog or a cat, always be aware of when the dog/cat goes near the rabbit.,
Make sure your rabbit isn't overheated in summer and freezing in winter.,
Keep an eye that your rabbit doesn't chew the furniture.

",How to Keep Pet Rabbits Safe," Always double check.;
, Eagles, hawks, vultures or even cats and dogs could attack them at any moment.

, Make sure all plants are safe for your rabbit if he/she accidentally eats a few leaves.
, Also, don't drop your rabbit. Rabbits' spines aren't that strong and can break easily.

, Male rabbits fight for dominance. The weaker rabbit may get bitten and hurt.

, Alfalfa hay is just for baby rabbits. Adult rabbits need Timothy Hay to stay healthy. Food without the treats is the best kind.

, A rabbit that is free to wander the house would rather stay out of its cage if it gets really stinky and messy., Lots of rabbit owners don't take their rabbit to the vet, but the veterinarian can help detect any harm in your rabbit's body.

, It may be poisonous to your rabbit just like chocolate is poisonous to dogs. Never feed your rabbit raw potatoes. Potato is poisonous to rabbits.

, Your rabbit could access it and die.

,, Even a super friendly and out-going dog could attack the small, frightened rabbit.

, If the rabbit's ears are hot, the rabbit is hot. If the ears are freezing, the rabbit is freezing. For outdoor rabbits in winter, you may want to consider a heating lamp if you live in a cold wintered region.

Make adjustments to your rabbit's hutch.,
Insulate the hutch.,
Provide a warm bed.,
Add straw.",How to Keep a Rabbit Warm1," During the winter months, your rabbit will need to stay warm. You'll need to make certain adjustments to his hut to make sure it's hospitable for your rabbit.


If possible, the easiest adjustment you can make is to simply move the hutch somewhere warmer. If you can bring it indoors or to a heated garage, this is ideal.Check for any gaps in the hutch's wall. It's not uncommon for rain and other weather conditions to wear down a hutch. Wood may also be old and rotting. If you see any damages, apply rabbit-safe wood protectant coating. You can also line the hutch with newspaper to keep cold air from entering through any gaps.If your rabbit hutch has mesh doors, cover them in clear plastic wrap. This will allow your rabbit to see through the hutch doors while preventing air from entering. However, leave a small gap towards the bottom for proper ventilation.;
, You want to insulate your rabbit's hutch during winter. To do this, place sheets of newspaper and a warm blanket on the roof. Then, cover in an outdoor tarp. Not only will this trap heat and keep the hutch adequately warm, it will prevent snow or rain from falling on your rabbits., Rabbits need warm beds year-round, but especially in the winter. There should be some kind of box in your rabbit's hut with an entry hole the rabbit can climb in and out of. You can buy a rabbit bed at a pet store or online. You can also make your own out of a cardboard box.


During winter, line the floors and walls of a rabbit's bed with newspaper. This will help insulate the bed and keep your rabbit warm.Place a lot of bedding material in the sleeping area. You can use dust-free hay as bedding. Avoid giving your rabbit a blanket in his bed. Rabbits may chew on blankets, which can cause intestinal blockage., When it comes to keeping rabbits warm, straw is one of the best materials. Place straw throughout the cage. Pack straw towards the edge of the hut, adding insulation, and place a bit of straw inside the rabbit's sleeping area. Make sure to change straw every few days. Rabbits may urinate on the straw and you do not want your rabbit sleeping in dampened material."
"
Keep your rabbit in a securely enclosed area.,
Provide your rabbit with shelter.,
Lock your hutch.,
Put away tools and chemicals.,
Keep your garden clean.,
Provide plenty of fresh water.",How to Have a Rabbit Friendly Garden1," If you want your rabbit to be able to roam freely in your garden, the entire perimeter needs to be completely fenced in and free from holes. This will prevent your rabbit from escaping and predators from getting in. Alternatively, you can create a rabbit run or pen that keeps your rabbit safely in a specific area of your garden.Pick sturdy, durable materials for fencing, such as vinyl, wood, iron, concrete, brick, or masonry. Chicken wire will not keep predators out.
If there are any gaps between your fencing planks, they should be completely lined from top to ground with a heavy-gauge metal wire with a diameter that is no more than 2.5mm so that your rabbit and potential predators cannot wiggle or chew through it.
Consider privacy fencing so that predators can’t see in. They’re less likely to attack what they can’t see.
If you opt for a run or pen, the wire mesh should be of a heavy-gauge with gaps no bigger than 2.5mm. The edges should be secured, either by digging at least 8 inches of the bottom into the ground or by placing heavy flagstones all around it.;
, The easiest way to protect your rabbit when they are outdoors by themselves is to get them a hutch. Hutches should provide spacious, secure enclosures with shade, insulation, and ventilation. Most come with a wooden home for your rabbit to rest in and an airy rove for them to play in.The hutch should be elevated on legs or have a heavy-gauge wire mesh flooring to keep other animals out.
A hutch is an absolute essential if your rabbit sleeps outside.

, Foxes and badgers are experts at unlatching hutches. If you want to keep your rabbit outdoors at night, be sure to put a padlock on the door of their hutch., Keep toxic chemicals, like antifreeze or pesticides, and dangerous tools, like a saw or lawn mower, safely locked away in a shed. Be sure that there are no holes or gaps in the structure that will allow your rabbit to squeeze into the shed., Pick up any debris or litter that could be harmful to your pet. Ensure the area is clear of litter, such as cigarette butts or food packaging, as well as toys and tools that may attract your rabbit., Keep your rabbit’s water dish constantly replenished. Hydration is important to their health and essential during summer months to help prevent heat stroke. Providing them with a constant supply of clean water will also help ensure that they won't go anywhere else looking for a drink.

Check for common signs of heat exhaustion.,
Brush your rabbit's fur.,
Keep your rabbit hydrated.,
Do not submerge your rabbit in icy water.,
Lightly mist your rabbit with water or a rubbing alcohol/water solution.,
See your veterinarian.",How to Keep Pet Rabbits Cool2," Your rabbit's ears are the most important to pay attention to. When rabbits overheat, blood vessels in their ears swell and cause a general redness to appear. This is a great indicator of heat stroke in rabbits. An overheated rabbit may also have one or more of the following symptoms:Wet fur below the nose
Heavy and fast breathing
Flared nostrils
Sprawled out on the floor
Hot ears and feet
Inactive and not as alert as usual (lethargic)
Eyes half closed, Rabbits shed a lot. Normally, they clean themselves and remove all the excess fur and dander. If your rabbit is shedding and not cleaning itself properly, this extra fur can act as another layer of insulation. In the winter, this works well for a rabbit. In the summer, it can lead to heat exhaustion.


Brush your rabbit from head to posterior. Keep your strokes light. You don’t want to remove too much fur or hurt your rabbit. Do so during the summer months regularly., Place small ice cubes in your rabbit's water bottle to lower its temperature. If you have to leave your rabbit for a long period of time in warmer temperatures, this is a good step. Over the course of the day, the water will remain cooler for longer as the ice cubes melt. Dehydration can lead to heat stroke more easily in rabbits. If your rabbit is overheated, it will look for ways to cool itself off. If its water is colder than usual, it will seek it out and drink more to cool itself down.Give your rabbit veggies to help keep it hydrated. Soak small carrots, celery stalks, and other vegetables that your rabbit enjoys in water and then place them in your rabbit’s cage. This way your rabbit will get additional water through its food., It is ok to dip its feet in water, but don't completely dunk it in it. Rabbits by nature are not strong swimmers. You may think that a quick dunk will cool them off, but in reality, it may exacerbate your rabbit's condition. The shock of the water may cause anxiety, which will elevate your rabbit’s core temperature.You can lightly mist your rabbit with water, but don't drench it (see next step)., Mix 1 part 50% rubbing alcohol and 3 parts water in a spray bottle; then spritz the solution on the outside of the rabbit's ears and on the top of the paws. Wet them well and the evaporation will cool the rabbit tremendously. (The alcohol just speeds evaporation.)
, Try calling your vet first. He may ask you to try different cooling measures before you bring your rabbit in for an exam. He’ll probably suggest many of the tips included above. If you’ve already tried all of these tips, tell your vet so and then proceed to bring your rabbit into the clinic."
"
Make sure water bottles and bowls don't freeze.,
Dry rabbits if they play in the snow.,
Keep rabbits in pairs.,
Clean the cage regularly during colder months.",How to Keep a Rabbit Warm2," In the winter months, water bowls and water bowls can potentially freeze. This will leave your rabbit without water, which he needs even in the winter.


Check water bottles and bowls a few times a day. If they freeze, replace them promptly.Insulating water bottles can reduce their risk of freezing. You can wrap a water bottle in an old towel. You can also buy water bottles designed for winter use, which come wrapped in materials that keep them warm.Make sure to have lots of spare bottles handy. Plastic bottles especially may crack in the winter months. You do not want your rabbit to go without water in the event his bottle breaks., If your rabbits sometimes play outdoors, they may get wet in the snow. You want to make sure to dry your rabbits off before putting them back in their hut. Dry your rabbits with a towel. If they're still wet, let them warm up indoors. Allow them to dry indoors naturally. Do not put them by a heater to dry., If you have more than one rabbit, try to keep them in pairs over the winter. This will both provide socialization and help keep your rabbit warm. Rabbits can snuggle with one another in the winter months for heat.If you haven't introduced rabbits, take some time with the introduction process before winter. It may take awhile for rabbits to get comfortable with one another. Make the first introduction in neutral space, like a room in your home. Rabbits are territorial and throwing them in a cage together right away can be a disaster.Introduce the rabbits in 20 minute increments. In the event of fighting, separate them and then try again in an hour or so. You can use a water bottle to break up fights.Keep your rabbits in eye contact with each other when they're not interacting. Once they seem comfortable with one another in a neutral space, you can try caging them together for short periods. Eventually, you should be able to move your rabbits into the same cage for the longterm.
Some rabbits may simply not get along, even with your best efforts. If your rabbits continually fight, it's better not to cage them together. If rabbits get aggressive or territorial, they could injure one another., As it grows colder, make sure you regularly clean your rabbit's cage. Urine can cause bedding, straw, and hay to dampen and even freeze. This can cause health problems if not dealt with properly. Remove any clumps of urine from your rabbit's cage on a daily basis, paying special attention to his bedding area."
"
Be careful with heated blankets.,
Keep baby rabbits indoors.,
Make sure your rabbits exercise over the winter.,
Watch for signs of health problems.",How to Keep a Rabbit Warm3," Many pet stores sell heated blankets to keep rabbits warm during the winter. If you choose to use these, practice extreme caution. Do not leave your rabbit unsupervised with an electronic blanket. There's a risk of electric shock if a rabbit chews through the cords. They could also potentially cause a fire if left near hay, newspaper, or flammable material., A baby rabbit's body temperature needs to be around 100 °F (38 °C). It's nearly impossible to keep a baby rabbit adequately warm outside during the winter. If you have babies, you must keep them inside for their safety.The first 10 days of a rabbit's life are especially crucial. If the temperature is below 50 degrees, it's very difficult for a baby rabbit to stay warm enough to survive.It's a bad idea to let rabbits breed during winter. However, if your rabbit ends up having babies in the winter months, you should bring the mother and babies indoors., Rabbits do not hibernate in the wild. A period of inactivity for the winter months is not natural for them. Therefore, you need to take steps to make sure your rabbits get exercise even in the winter.


Consider bringing your rabbits inside to play. This will prevent his coat from getting wet with snow. If you have a rabbit-safe room in your home, bring your rabbit indoors a few times a week to let him run and play.However, be careful not to let your rabbit spend too much time indoors. Rabbits develop thick coats in the winter to protect them from the cold. If your outdoor bunny spends too much time inside, he could start losing his coat. This puts him at risk for a variety of health problems., With proper precautions, your rabbit should be safe and healthy over the winter months. However, be on the lookout for signs of health problems. If your rabbit has a cold or respiratory problem, he should be evaluated by a vet and kept indoors. Watch for the following:


Discharge from the nose
The appearance of dirt around the nose
Discharge from the eyes

Avoid growing plants that are toxic to rabbits.,
Grow a bunny garden.,
Practice chemical-free gardening.",How to Have a Rabbit Friendly Garden2," Rabbits aren’t picky. Your rabbit will likely chew on anything and everything it comes across. Some common garden species can cause sickness, long-term health problems, or even death when ingested, so it’s important that you ensure there are no poisonous plants within your pet’s reach.It’s always best to keep your rabbit away from evergreen trees, evergreen shrubs, and flowers grown from bulbs.
Flowers that are toxic to bunnies include azaleas, bluebells, buttercups, clematis, columbine, dahlias, foxglove, ivy, hellebore, hemlock, lupin, mistletoe, poppy, primrose, rhododendron, and wisteria.
When in doubt, look up if a particular plant is toxic to rabbits. Medirabbit offers an extensive list of poisonous species that’s available here: http://www.medirabbit.com/EN/GI_diseases/Food/Toxic_plants_en.pdf


, Rabbits are herbivores who are famous for nibbling on (or even decimating) garden crops. This means that you can grow much of their food yourself if you want to. Dedicate one bed or more to plants your rabbit loves to eat.The staple of a rabbit’s diet is grass hay, but they will be thrilled if you supplement it with fresh fruit and vegetables.
Greens, like kale, dark-leaf lettuces, radish tops, and spring greens, are a safe staple for bunnies. They’ll also go for broccoli, sprouts, carrots, green beans, pea pods, and peppers.Rabbits love garden fruit, but they should only be fed about two tablespoons a day since it is high in sugar. Try apples, peaches, pears, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and/or strawberries.Herbs and flowers can also whet your rabbit’s appetite. Basil, coriander, dill, parsley, rosemary, borage, chamomile, comfrey, clover, lavender, nasturtiums, dandelions, and yarrow are all good options to feed your rabbit in moderation., Do not use any weed killers, insecticides, or synthetic fertilizers on areas where you allow your rabbit to roam. Your rabbit can absorb these harmful chemicals through playing in the grass and ingesting plants.Instead, opt for organic gardening practices in those places where you keep your rabbit. For example, use natural, non-toxic alternatives to synthetic fertilizers, such as nutrient-rich soils that are suited to each plant, crop rotation, and organic fertilizers.
Your rabbit’s droppings actually offer an excellent organic alternative to synthetic fertilizer. Sprinkle them over the top of your beds, or work them just under the surface of the soil with a rake or trowel to give your plants a slow-release dose of nutrients and nitrogen.You can also mix rabbit manure into your compost pile to enrich your compost.

Keep your plants safe.,
Give your rabbit toys.,
Move your rabbit’s run frequently.",How to Have a Rabbit Friendly Garden3," If you want to keep your rabbit away from particular plants and crops, be sure to safeguard them with fencing. Use chicken wire so that light can still get through to your plants.The fencing should be at least 3 feet tall with an extra half a foot buried underground to prevent digging under it.
The mesh should be no bigger than 1 inch.
You can also keep your rabbit confined to an area of the garden where they can’t get to your plant beds.

, Rabbits are known for destroying gardens with their chewing and digging. To minimize these destructive behaviors, provide them with toys when they’re outside that offer convenient alternatives to having their way with your yard.Chew toys like wicker balls and willow sticks can distract your rabbit from your plants.
Tunnel toys and digging boxes can keep your rabbit entertained while protecting them from the sun and possible predators. They also allow your pet to express their digging impulses in a safe way instead of destroying your raised beds or scooping out an escape route.

, If you’re keeping your rabbit in a pen or run, regularly relocate where it is in your garden to minimize the impact on your grass. That way, you can maintain a healthy lawn that both you and your bunny can enjoy."

Buy insects ahead of time.,

Keep the faunarium at a comfortable room temperature or above.,
Feed the insects daily.,
Feed the insects a healthy diet.,

Selectively feed gut loaded insects to your reptile.",How to Gut Load Locusts and Crickets," As the words suggest, gut loading is about filling the insect's gut with healthy nutritious foods. In turn, when the plump, juicy insects packed with minerals and vitamins are eaten by the reptile, they represent great nutrition for the hunter.This gut loading takes time, however, so you need to have the insects a few days before they are to be fed to your reptile.

If you order live food by mail, the stress of going through the postal service means the insects are in poor health when they arrive through your letterbox. Therefore, try to plan ahead so that you can feed the insects for at least 48 hours before feeding them to the reptile. This allows them to recover, rehydrate, and be nutritionally more beneficial.;
, It's important to equip yourself with a suitable container to keep the locusts and crickets in. The plastic tubs they travel in are too small to keep them in for gut feeding or for the longer term.Faunarium is the term used for containers used to house reptiles and other small pets, but they can also be called terrariums or reptile tanks. They consist of a clear tank or box, with a plastic lid with multiple breathing holes in it.The larger faunarium, the better, so that the insects have space to get away from one another.
Commercial faunariums are inexpensive and widely available on the internet or from reptile shops. They have an access hatch which flips open for you to remove individual insect with tweezers, without the need for removing the whole of the lid. This design makes for good ventilation, plus they are easy to clean and disinfect between batches of insects.If you don't have a faunarium you can improvise with a plastic container, such as a 2-liter plastic ice-cream tub. Be sure to punch multiple holes in the lid so it is well ventilated.

, Line the bottom of it with layers of disposable paper towel. Make the space comfortable for the insects by providing some hiding places for the locusts or crickets, such as the egg cartons that come in the traveling packs.If there is bran in the travel pack, it's fine to dump that into the faunarium as well.

, Do not mix species in the same faunarium.They have different needs and can compete for resources if kept together., Insects kept in cool or cold conditions will not adequately digest what they have eaten and it could ferment in their gut. This can potentially disagree with the reptile that eats them.

Crickets prefer 80 - 85 F and locusts prefer slightly warmer temperatures, at 95 -105F.
Avoid the faunarium becoming humid or overly damp, as this encourages the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.

, Put a supply of nutritious food in the faunarium, but do not put in more than they can eat in a day. Wash all foods prior to putting them in, as the residual moisture on the food provides all the water the insects will need.

Avoid leaving rotting foods in the faunarium. Remove any leftover food at the end of each day and replace it with fresh., The goal of gut loading is to make the insects healthy so that your reptile is eating healthy food when it eat them. Good foods to offer the insects include cabbage, spring greens, romaine lettuce, apples, half green grapes, butternut squash, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and any other fresh fruit or vegetables that are safe for your reptile to eat.

Note that avocado is toxic to many reptiles and not a suitable meal for livefood.Alternatively, you can buy commercial 'gut loading' foods or gels from reptile shops, that are high in vitamins and minerals. These have no real advantage over feeding of good quality fresh foods, except some of these foods are fortified with calcium., Extra calcium is a good idea, since pet reptiles are often at risk of developing MBD (metabolic bone disease) as a result of low levels of calcium in the diet or inadequate UVB lighting (which the metabolism needs to process the calcium). A simple way to make sure the reptile takes in plenty of calcium is to sprinkle a calcium supplement (such as Nutrobal, sold through reptile shops) onto the fruit and veg fed to the insects.

Experts disagree about how effective this is at supplementing the reptile, since some argue the calcium stays within the locusts or crickets gut, but it seems there is no harm to be done by doing this. However, to be on the safe side also dust the live food with calcium powder immediately prior to feeding to the reptile., Be sure only to feed healthy looking insects to your reptile. Remove any dead insects from the faunarium and don't give them to your reptile."

You can buy crickets on-line or from a local pet store, raise them yourself, or capture them from outdoors. Whichever way you choose, make sure you have enough crickets to feed your particular reptile enough and maintain a good level of nutrition. You will want to buy house crickets (Acheta domestica) for your reptile.
Don't buy too many crickets at once as they may die before your reptile gets a chance to eat them all.
You will likely want to have some kind of storage container for your crickets. A plastic bin with with cardboard tubes for the crickets to hide in can work fine.;
, An important part of offering crickets to your reptile is selecting crickets that are a safe size. Exactly how large the crickets you choose are will depend on how large your reptile is. Larger reptiles will enjoy larger crickets. However, smaller reptiles may be injured by larger crickets or may not eat them at all. Make sure the crickets you are offering are an appropriate size for your reptile.Your reptile should be able to easily fit a cricket in their mouth.
Crickets larger than your reptiles mouth should likely be avoid.
If a cricket is larger than the distance between the reptile's eyes, it's too big.

, In order to provide the best nutrition for your reptile, you will want to dust the crickets in a coating of calcium powder. This will allow your reptile to get even more nutrition and ensure that they are strong and healthy, reducing the chances of illness or injury occurring. Always make sure to coat the crickets in calcium powder when feeding your reptile.This powder can be bought at most pet stores or online.
You can put the powder in a simple plastic container. A tall plastic pitcher can work well.
Shake some crickets into the container.
Lightly shake the container to coat the crickets in the powder.
The crickets should be coated completely in the calcium powder and can then be fed to your reptile.
It's a good idea to find a powder that contains both calcium and vitamin D3., Once you've dusted the crickets and selected which ones are an appropriate size for your reptile, you can begin introducing them to your reptile's enclosure. If you already know how much your reptile generally eats, add only that amount of crickets to the cage. If you are unsure of how many to add, try adding only a few at a time and waiting to see if your reptile eats them all, before adding more. Don't dump an uncounted amount of crickets into the reptile's enclosure.
You can try adding them one at a time by picking them up with tweezers and placing them in the enclosure.

, Once you've added the crickets to your reptiles environment, keep an eye on how many your reptile eats. It's important that you only feed them the amount they are able to eat in one meal. Count how many crickets you placed in the cage and compare it to how many crickets are left untouched after a half hour of fifteen minutes.Next time, add only the amount of crickets your reptile can eat in one meal.
Give your reptile a maximum of one half hour to eat all the crickets you've added.

, Crickets are omnivorous and will attempt to bite and eat your reptile if they are left in the enclosure for too long. Save your reptile needless stress and pain by removing any uneaten crickets at night. Adjust how many crickets you feed them next time based on how many extra were leftover.Never leave leftover crickets in the reptile's enclosure.
If your reptile is not hungry, it will not eat the crickets. Leaving extra crickets in the enclosure will only cause your reptile problems.
Crickets can also carry diseases or parasites and will also create waste in your reptiles enclosure.

, Reptile's metabolism is based on how warm their environment is kept. Warmer environments will increase activity levels, metabolic rates, and will allow your reptile the energy to hunt and eat healthy amounts of food. Always watch the enclosure's temperature to ensure that your reptile is able to eat and properly digest their food.Your reptile will have varying temperatures that it enjoys depending what type it is.
Generally, the temperature will be lowered at night and your reptile won't want to eat during that time. Make sure they eat enough during the warmer hours of the day.

, You will need a few spaces for your crickets to live, reproduce, and grow in. Making sure that they have everything they need will help ensure that the crickets are healthy and are able to reproduce, eventually providing nutritious food for your reptile. Try to build your cricket houses with some of the following features in mind:You will likely want three houses. One for normal living, one for breeding, and one for the crickets who are soon to be fed to your reptile.
These can be simple plastic or glass containers. Make sure the lid is screened and not air tight.
The housing container should have things like cardboard tubes for your crickets to hide and live in.
The breeding container will have the same tubes but should have moist dirt on the floor, encouraging your crickets to lay eggs.
The feeding container will be set up the same way as you have built your housing container.

Check out this guide for more detail about cricket housing.

, If you want to raise your own crickets, you will need to obtain enough crickets to start a colony. These starter crickets will breed and produce a substantial amount of hatching crickets, growing the size of your colony and providing plenty of food for your reptile. Keep some of the following tips in mind when starting your cricket colony:These crickets will likely be labeled as “breeding stock”.
You will need around 15-20 large crickets to start your colony.
This colony should produce around 100 hatchlings.

, Your crickets will need to stay warm in order to maintain health and keep reproducing. You can provide warmth by using an incandescent bulb during the day. Use a thermometer to check the temperature, keeping it at a level that is best for your crickets.A 40 watt incandescent bulb will provide enough warmth for a 10 gallon tank.
Use the light for around 16 hours a day.
Keep the temperature between 75° to 85°F

, Although the goal is to provide proper nutrition to your reptile, properly caring for your crickets is just as important. Well-fed crickets will be loaded with all the vitamins, minerals, and other elements that your reptile needs in their own diet. Gut-loading your crickets is a simple and effective way to make sure that your reptile is receiving the most nutrition they can get.Feed your crickets pesticide free, leafy greens.
Fruits are also a great meal for your crickets to eat.

, To successfully breed your crickets, you will need to move them back and forth from the breeding container and the housing container. This will ensure that the numbers of crickets are being kept at an optimal level and you won't run too low or have too many crickets. Keep the following tips in mind when managing your crickets and their housing:You will want a few pairs of males and females in your breeding container.
Females have a long tube that comes out of their abdomen. This is used to deposit eggs. Males will not have this tube.
Eggs should appear within four to seven days.
Return the adult crickets to the housing container to keep the eggs safe and allow them to hatch.

, After you notice eggs in the breeding enclosure, it's time to wait for them to hatch. However, you will have to care for both the eggs and the hatchlings while they are growing. Keep these points in mind when caring for your cricket hatchlings:


Keep the eggs moist to allow them to properly hatch.Once hatched, give the crickets water by providing a damp sponge. A water bowl will cause the hatchlings to drown.
In four to six weeks, the hatchlings will be fully grown and can return to the colony.

Take your rabbit to your veterinarian.",How to Keep Rabbits Warm in Sub Zero Weather," If your rabbit stays outside, it can tolerate extremely cold temperatures by staying warm and dry in a well-ventilated, waterproof hutch.Check the inside of the hutch for any water stains and/or dampness. If there are signs of leakage coming from the roof, either repair the roof or replace it completely.


Roof sealant can be used to repair the roof and is available at your local home improvement store.Follow the label instructions when you apply it to the hutch’s wood.
You can also use a wood preservative or waterproof paint. Apply the product only to the outside of the roof to prevent your rabbit from chewing the product and possibly ingesting harmful chemicals.If the sides of the hutch look leaky, patch up the leaks in those areas as well.;
, If your rabbit’s hutch stays on the ground, you will need to elevate it to keep out snow and rain. Keeping the hutch off the ground can also provide extra protection from the sub-zero temperatures by keeping the bottom of the hutch away from direct contact with the ground’s coldness.How much you raise the hutch is up to you—placing 1 brick under each corner of the hutch would be sufficient.If you are especially crafty, you could construct legs for the hutch if it does not already have them. Visit your local home improvement store for guidance on how to add legs to the hutch.

, To protect your rabbit from cold gusts of wind, position the hutch so its front is facing away from the wind. Facing the hutch away from the wind also allows warm air to enter the hutch. In addition, try to position the hutch against the side of your home to brace it against the wind.If you are not sure from which direction the wind is coming, stand outside near your rabbit’s hutch and wait for wind to pass by.
Repositioning the hutch will also keep wind-whipped rain or snow from entering the hutch., Plenty of warm bedding is necessary to keep your rabbit warm in sub-zero temperatures. Straw and hay are good bedding choices. Straw is the best choice, though, since it provides better insulation and your rabbit is less likely to eat it.You can either fill a nest box with straw, or place the straw directly on the hutch floor if your rabbit doesn’t like nest boxes.Consider placing newspaper under the bedding for extra insulation.Even if you don’t use hay for bedding, place plenty of it in the hutch to give your rabbit something to chew on., With sub-zero temperatures, your rabbit will likely stay in the straw to keep warm, and likely urinate and defecate in it. Replace the soiled straw with clean and dry straw about every 2 days.Soiled and damp straw is not only unhygienic, but is also less effective at keeping your rabbit warm and dry when it is cold outside.Consider placing wood shavings under your rabbit’s bedding to absorb wetness.Replace the wood shavings when they become damp.

, Fortunately, you do not have to purchase expensive insulation material for your rabbit’s hutch. Thick blankets and tarp make excellent exterior insulators. Place the blankets directly over the hutch, then place the tarp over the blankets.Hutch covers are commercially available, either online or at your local pet store. If the hutch has a mesh door, you could cover it with plastic to keep out drafts., Making sure your rabbit has fresh air is very important, even with sub-zero temperatures. Whichever type of insulation you use, leave it at least partially open during the day and close it nearly all the way at night.Adequate ventilation will prevent the accumulation of ammonia, which can be toxic to your rabbit.Ammonia would accumulate because of your rabbit’s urination. Replacing the bedding regularly also helps prevent high ammonia concentrations.

, Your rabbit will be using a lot more energy to stay warm in sub-zero temperatures. Extra calories will help give your rabbit that extra energy. Corn and alfalfa hay are good sources of extra calories. However, feed them only in small amounts —too much corn can cause digestive problems, and alfalfa hay’s high protein and mineral contents can cause health problems.Talk with your veterinarian before adding corn or alfalfa hay to your rabbit’s diet.
Continue to feed your rabbit his usual diet.

, This is very important! Even with the extra calories, your rabbit needs to remain slim. Although it may be tempting to feed your rabbit a lot more when temperatures fall below zero, those extra pounds will be very difficult to lose once the weather warms up again.Weigh your rabbit periodically.


If your rabbit has gained weight, talk with your veterinarian about the best way to reverse the weight gain. You will probably need to adjust your rabbit’s diet, but not reduce the caloric intake so much that your rabbit does not have the energy to stay warm.

, Fresh water is as important when it’s cold outside as when it’s hot.Place the water in sturdy water dishes, since water bottles can freeze and crack in sub-zero temperatures. Consider having several water dishes so when the water in one dish starts to ice over, you can easily replace the dish with another one.To keep the water dish from freezing, you could warm up a small microwaveable heating pad and place the dish on top of the pad.Be aware, though, that your rabbit may be tempted to chew the heating pad. You may be better off replacing the water dishes regularly.
Water helps keep your rabbit’s digestive system working properly, which is essential to making sure your rabbit gets the maximum amount of energy from the food to stay warm., If you do not want to keep your rabbit outside when the temperature falls below zero, you can bring it inside to warmer temperatures. However, rabbits do not tolerate sudden temperature changes very well.It would be best to make the move over a few weeks.In general, you should move your rabbit to a warmer yet unheated area for about a week or two before moving it to a fully heated room.During the week in which you have moved your rabbit to this warmer area, check on it for signs of overheating, including panting, weakness, and reluctance to move.Heatstroke occurs when rabbits are in temperatures above 82 degrees Fahrenheit (27.8 degrees Celsius).An unheated shed or room will not become this warm, so it is unlikely that your rabbit will develop heatstroke. You should still check on it periodically, though, and provide it with plenty of fresh, cool water.

, Exposure to drafts is bad—and potentially fatal—for rabbits, even when they are not housed outside.As you transition your rabbit to heated indoor housing, choose an area that is free of drafts. A non-drafty outdoor shed or enclosed porch would be a good place for your rabbit’s hutch.An unheated, draft-free room of your home is another good choice.If it is not feasible to bring your rabbit's entire hutch inside, you could use a large rabbit cage or exercise pen for housing. Place his food and water bowls, along with bedding, toys, and some hay, in the area.Your garage may be draft free, but the fumes from your car are toxic to your rabbit.Do not place your rabbit’s hutch in your garage.

, After a week or two, transition your rabbit to a heated room. If you were using a large rabbit cage or exercise pen in an unheated room, you can simply move the housing into the new room. Make sure to move your rabbit’s normal ‘creature comforts’ as well: food and water bowls, favorite toys, comfortable bedding, etc.Since this new room is heated, keep a close eye on your rabbit for signs of overheating. If your rabbit is overheating, cool it down by placing cool (not cold) water on its ears, feet and fur.Give your rabbit water with ice in it and call your veterinarian for further instruction on treating the overheating., Sub-zero temperatures can make your rabbit very susceptible to hypothermia. A rabbit’s normal body temperature is 101.5 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit (38.6 to 39.4 degrees Celsius). A body temperature below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) will make your rabbit hypothermic.Take your rabbit’s temperature by inserting a flexible, well-lubricated thermometer about 1 inch into the rectum.Lubricant is available at your local pharmacy.
Signs of hypothermia include lethargy, cold and pale limbs and ears, shallow breathing, and a weak pulse. Stupor occurs with severe hypothermia.Hypothermia in rabbits is classified as either mild (temperature of 86 to 89 degrees Fahrenheit/30 to 31.7 degrees Celsius), moderate (71 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit/21.7 to 25 degrees Celsius), or severe (32 to 47 degrees Fahrenheit/0 to 8.3 degrees Celsius)., Hypothermia in rabbits must be treated promptly. Bring your rabbit into a heated room. Warm up some water bottles, wrap the bottles in towels, and position your rabbit between the towels.Continue to monitor your rabbit’s temperature until it returns to normal.You will probably need to change out the water bottles periodically as they cool down.


To warm up the water bottles, warm some water in a pot on the stove. Fill the bottles with water and place them in the warm water.
Alternatively, you could warm up some towels in the dryer, let them cool down a little, then wrap your rabbit in them.It is very important to let your rabbit warm up naturally and gradually. Rapid rewarming, particularly by vigorous rubbing, can cause your rabbit to go into shock by causing an increase in blood flow to the core and away from the extremities (e.g. ears, toes)., Hypothermia that becomes severe requires immediate veterinary care.Start warming your rabbit up naturally at your home, and get it to your veterinarian as soon as possible.Continue warming your rabbit in your car.


Do not blast the heat in your car in an effort to warm up your rabbit. The sudden temperature change could send your rabbit into shock.

An early sign of vitamin A deficiency is swollen eyelids. Sometimes, the eyelids are so swollen that the eyes cannot open.Occasionally, the iris (colored portion) of the eye can look swollen or enlarged.;
, The conjunctiva is the inner lining of a reptile’s eyelids and is usually not visible. If your reptile is deficient in vitamin A, the conjunctiva will be red, swollen, and very visible.There may also be a buildup of a solid, whitish-yellow substance in the conjunctival area., A reptile’s eyes should be clear. Without enough vitamin A, the eyes could become cloudy.Cloudy eyes would look glazed or hazy.

, Tear ducts are located on the sides of the eyes closest to the nose. When a reptile does not get enough vitamin A, the ducts’ cellular linings can thicken (‘squamous metaplasia’) and block the normal flow of fluid through the ducts.The ducts would then become plugged and unable to function properly.If you do see tear duct secretions, they will probably look thick and gummy., Vitamin A deficiency can weaken a reptile’s immune system, increasing the likelihood of bacterial or fungal infections. The mouth is a common location for infections.Infectious stomatitis, also known as mouth rot, is a mouth infection occurring in reptiles with vitamin A deficiency.Signs of infectious stomatitis include redness in the mouth, pus and/or dead tissue in the mouth, and fluid draining from the mouth and nose., Without healthy epithelial cells, a reptile’s skin condition can worsen. If your reptile is deficient in vitamin A, its skin will become red and thin. In some places, the skin may thicken and begin to crack. In addition, the skin may start to blister and slough off.These skin conditions will likely be uncomfortable and painful for your reptile.


Your reptile’s skin could also become infected.Signs of skin infection include redness, swelling, and possible skin lesions.

, Vitamin A deficiency can cause a runny nose in reptiles.The runny nose may be due to damage or infection within the nose., Although breathing patterns can vary between reptiles, reptiles generally breathe through their lungs.Vitamin A deficiency, however, can make breathing difficult. Signs of troubled breathing include open mouth breathing and wheezing., Reptiles with vitamin A deficiency can lose their appetite and start losing weight.In addition, if your reptile cannot open his eyes, he would not be able to see the food you place in his cage, making eating difficult. This could also cause him to lose weight.Digital reptile scales are available, either online or in your local pet store.

, Vitamin A deficiency can make a reptile feel pretty miserable. As soon you recognize the symptoms of the deficiency, take your reptile to your vet. Do not try to treat your reptile on your own., To accurately diagnose a Vitamin A deficiency, your vet will need to know as much as possible about your reptile’s diet and overall care. Be very detailed when describing your reptile’s diet, including what your reptile eats (including supplements), how much it eats, and when it eats.Describe the symptoms of vitamin A deficiency that you’ve seen, and when you first started noticing them.
Tell your vet how you care for your reptile. For example, describe your reptile’s cage environment, including how you clean and maintain the cage.
Consider taking your reptile to a vet who has experience working with reptiles.

, Your vet will physically exam your reptile, paying close attention to the eyes, mouth, and abdomen.Your vet may also want to perform several diagnostic tests. Since internal organs (e.g., liver, kidneys, pancreas) can be affected by vitamin A deficiency, your vet will take a blood sample and analyze it for indications of organ damage.


A biopsy would be helpful for diagnosing an infection.However, it may be expensive and not very practical.Your vet will be able to come up with a treatment plan after examining your reptile.

Reptiles such as iguanas or Burmese pythons, and most turtles or tortoises, are best for experienced reptile owners who are knowledgeable about the animal's care and have owned or cared for similar reptiles. If you are a beginner, keep in mind that choosing an expensive, high-maintenance reptile is very likely to lead to discouragement, wasted money and yet another unwanted animal.;
, Reptiles are exotics and can be very expensive to care for, as some require large enclosures with specific temperatures and humidity levels and care from an experienced veterinarian who specializes in reptile care. The purchase cost of a reptile is very often far smaller than the cost of caring for a reptile - a bearded dragon that costs $60 can cost you hundreds of dollars more to care for, especially if you purchased it from a chain pet store or if it's unknowingly sick. Talk with your family honestly about how much you expect the reptile will cost, and decide if you can afford to purchase and care for it.

, Reptiles are not ""starter pets"" or ""easy to care for,"" and larger reptiles in particular require large time and financial commitments. In addition, many reptiles can live for twenty or more years - consider how events in your life (such as going to college, moving, having a baby, etc.) will affect your ability to care for your reptile. You can't just put a reptile in the closet when you get bored with it like a child does with a new toy. Decide if you're ready for the responsibility - and boredom - of cleaning the cage, preparing the food, handling the reptile if necessary, checking the temperature, etc.

, Large reptiles require extremely large enclosures that are very expensive. Very large reptiles such as anaconda snakes can be difficult to handle without assistance, and without regular handling they can become nippy and potentially deadly. Smaller reptiles are less expensive but can be more skittish and difficult to tame. Ask your family how comfortable they are with the size of the reptile you're considering, and consider how big of a commitment the reptile you want will become.

, Bring up the idea of owning a reptile, and sit down together to discuss whether a reptile would be a good fit for your family. Review species of reptiles, and discuss if anyone is afraid or uncomfortable with a reptile such as snakes. Overview how much you expect the reptile will cost, and whether you will be able to cover all of it's needs or if some or all of the family will have to pitch in. Is this going to be your pet, or a family pet? If it's going to be a family pet, who will feed the reptile, take it to the vet, clean the cage, etc.? Explain that most reptiles will have to be fed animals such as rodents and/or insects such as roaches. Is the family comfortable with that? What about feeding the reptile rats or rabbits? Be honest about how much money and time you expect the reptile will require, and take your time while deciding if a reptile is a good fit for your family.



Remember that the entire family must agree. Even if Sally is the only person afraid of snakes, respect that she's afraid of them and do not purchase a snake.

Lizards are a great choice for anyone who wants a cat or dog but can't have one due to factors like allergies. Lizards are very entertaining to watch, they have large personalities, and they tend to live long lives.
At the same time, lizards can be a lot of work for owners. They can be expensive and they tend to live long lives.
Depending on the species you get, your pet lizard may require precisely-controlled temperatures in order to remain healthy.;
, Snakes like corn snakes, rat snakes, milksnakes, and kingsnakes are very popular pets.If lizards seem like too much work, you might be able to bring home a snake instead.


Snakes are generally considered to have low energy, which makes them more lethargic and easy to manage.
Snakes are usually thought of as a relatively low-maintenance pet. However, they will require live food and a heat lamp to remain healthy.

, Turtles and tortoises, like box turtles, red-footed tortoises, and yellow-footed tortoises, are often considered an adorable option for a pet reptile. If the thought of a snake makes you squeamish, a turtle may be the right pet for you.Turtles are slow and have low energy. They typically don't require a lot of attention beyond feeding and cleaning up, though some species do have very specific needs.
Depending on the type of habitat a given turtle/tortoise lives in, it may require a lot of maintenance. Aquatic turtles, for example, will need to have their water changed on a regular basis, and they may harbor harmful bacteria like salmonella., Reptiles do not like to be handled as often as furry pets tend to be handled. However, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't handle your reptile at all. You'll just have to be more gentle and limit how often you handle your reptile, as well as how long you handle it for.Some reptiles are more open to being handled than others, so if that's a factor in your decision you may want to do some further research to determine which reptiles match your needs.Green iguanas as prone to unexpected acts of aggression and fierce territorial guarding. However, some green iguanas take a strong liking to humans and may enjoy being handled lightly.
Tortoises typically enjoy being petted and socialized, but may get anxious or frightened if they are picked up and held in the air.
Box turtles tend to be more willing to be handled and won't put up any kind of fight.
Bearded dragons are generally considered good pets that are willing to be handled.
Chameleons do not usually like to be handled in any capacity.
Some snakes can get well-adjusted to being handled, especially if they have been regularly handled from an early age. However, you should never handle a snake that is preparing to shed its skin (marked by dull skin and bluish eyes), or any snake after you've handled its prey.

, Depending on where you live and how much room you have, space may be a limiting factor. It's worth considering that some reptiles can get very big and will require a lot of room. If you cannot provide that room, it may be best to look for a smaller pet.Some snakes, like Burmese, reticulated, and African pythons, can grow in excess of 20 feet in length. These snakes can also be quite dangerous to humans, especially once they reach full length.
Some tortoises can grow to be quite large. African spurred tortoises (also known as spur-thigh and Sulcata tortoises) can weight over 100 pounds when fully grown. These pets may need large indoor enclosures with special heat and humidity accommodations.

, Reptiles are generally considered low-maintenance pets. However, some reptiles require more maintenance than others. Think about how much work you're willing to put into maintenance and upkeep of your reptile, including what type of habitat that reptile will need.


Turtles are somewhat notorious for carrying and transmitting Salmonella.Aquatic turtles will need to have their water changed on a regular basis.Snakes are generally considered to be among the easiest reptiles to care for. They're also (usually) easy to handle and willing to be touched.

, This may not be a factor for every pet owner, but some people may be worried about getting a pet that could outlive them. Reptiles often live long lives, and depending on your age and the type of reptile you're interested in, you may need to make arrangements with a family member or friend who is willing to take over ownership if you become ill or infirm.Some tortoises live over 50 years.
Many geckos, turtles, and snakes live 20 to 25 years.
Different species will typically have different lifespans. Conduct further research online or talk to a reptile expert at your local pet store if you're interested in adopting a reptile but worried about its possible lifespan.

, This is another factor which may not bother everyone, but should be considered before you take home a pet. Reptiles often prefer live food, which means that you'll be responsible for purchasing living creatures, keeping them alive in your home, and feeding them to your pet.Some reptiles like crickets and other insects, while snakes often prefer to eat live mice.
If the thought of buying mice just to use as food for your snake upsets you, you may have a hard time feeding your snake the diet it needs.

, Depending on where you live, certain species of reptiles may be off limits. In some places, there may be very rigid restrictions on owning any type of reptile. Before you decide to take a pet home, it's important to look into any national, state/provincial, and regional laws that govern owning a reptile as a pet.In the United States it is illegal to sell any turtles/tortoises as pets whose top shells measure less than four inches lengthwise. This includes baby turtles that have not yet reached their full size.
Other countries may have looser or stricter laws that regulate reptile ownership. Check online or talk to a representative from your local government to see if there are any restrictions in your area.
Think about restrictions in other states/provinces as well. If there's any chance you might have to move in the next few years (and remember that some reptiles can live over 20 years), it's important to know whether you'd be able to keep that reptile in your new home.

, One of the biggest considerations in choosing a pet should be assessing whether you can even have that pet in your home. There may be restrictions due to the terms of your lease, the input of your housemates (especially if you still live at home), or the needs and requirements of the reptile you're thinking of adopting.Before you do anything, check with your landlord and any housemates you live with to see if you can bring home a pet reptile.
If you're a child or adolescent and still live at home, ask your parents for permission first.
Make sure you have adequate space to house a reptile. Remember that bigger reptiles like tortoises and turtles may need a considerable amount of space.
Snakes need an enclosure with a secure lid that can be clipped in place to prevent escapes.Lizards typically need an area to perch and/or bask, especially if that species requires a UV light.
Keep your home's temperature in mind as you determine if you can house a reptile. Remember that reptiles typically need a stable, warm temperature.

, Each species of reptile has different temperature, humidity, habitat, and nutritional requirements. They may be prone to different behavioral issues as well. Before you take any pet home from the pet store, it's important to do your homework and decide if that pet will work best for your needs.Consider the reptile's needs first and foremost. Can you realistically provide that reptile with everything it needs?
Think about the costs of owning a reptile. Make sure you can afford that pet before you commit to taking it home.
Remember that some animals don't get along well with other animals - including reptiles living with other reptiles. If you have any existing pets at home, you may need to make special accommodations to avoid confrontation or undesired mating.
Don't forget that owning any type of pet is a great deal of responsibility. Assess whether you're honestly capable of caring for that reptile and whether you would make a good pet owner for it.

, Once you've chosen which reptile to get as your new pet, you should have its tank set up before you ever bring the reptile home. Reptiles have very specific needs, and many reptiles are stressed (physically and mentally) from transportation, so it's imperative that your reptile can begin exploring and adjusting to its new home right from the start.Most reptiles require a glass tank, called a terrarium or vivarium. Glass withstands the elements of heat and moisture, which reptiles typically need in their environment, better than other materials.
Choose a tank that is slightly larger than your reptile's present needs. It may grow, and even if it doesn't it will need a lot of space to move around and explore.
Your glass tank will need a source of ambient heat, which is usually provided by an overhead heat lamp. Make sure you use a fluorescent, full-spectrum bulb and a separate incandescent light for basking.
The heat source you provide should be on a timer to ensure that the tank does not get too hot or too cold at any time. It should also be positioned in a place where your reptile will never be at risk of getting burned by direct contact.
Choose a secure screen as a lid instead of a glass lid. Glass may filter out heat and UV light from your overhead heating element, which can cause serious health problems for a reptile.
Make sure the tank has a cooler area that is sheltered from the ambient heat source. Most reptiles will need to seek cooler conditions (including shade) from time to time if it gets too hot.

, Once you've purchased and assembled a tank for your future pet, you'll want to prepare a safe environment for when you finally bring a reptile home. That involves making sure the environment is safely guarded from any other animals in your home and ensuring that your reptile will have its needs met once it arrives.Your tank should have a secure lid, as reptiles are highly skilled at escaping their enclosures. If your reptile gets out of its enclosure, it could easily become injured or even killed (especially if you have other pets in your home).
Make sure your reptile will not be able to scratch or chew on any electrical cords you use for the reptile's habitat.If you have dogs or cats, keep your reptile in a separate room closed off from these pets. They may harass, frighten, or kill your reptile if they have access to the tank.
Make sure your reptile has fresh drinking water readily available as soon as it gets to your home. Many reptiles suffer from dehydration during transportation and captivity.

, Depending on where you live, you may encounter reptile breeders or sellers who are not affiliated with pet stores or who deal in the illegal capture and trade of reptiles. You should only buy a reptile through a lawful, reputable breeder or seller to ensure your pet's health and your own safety, and also to ensure that you're in compliance with any legal requirements in your region.Reptiles sold by illegal or untrustworthy sellers and breeders tend to have more health problems than those purchased through reputable sources.
Many reptiles that are captured and sold illegally endure significant hardships and suffering during their captivity and transport.They may have a higher risk of carrying contagions, and they may have been acquired, bred, or sold illegally.Additionally, reptiles bought through unlawful sellers/breeders may be illegal for you to own in your region.
You should only purchase reptiles that were born in captivity. Captured reptiles are generally illegal to own in many regions.

, You should always assess any pet's health before you decide to bring it home from the pet store. Reptiles can live very long lives, but they need to be kept in good health. Look for visible signs of malnourishment, parasites, and other health problems before you select that reptile, and consider having a veterinarian give your new reptile a thorough examination.Always choose reptiles that appear active and alert, and that appear to have a healthy appetite. These animals are less likely to have any existing health problems.A healthy lizard should not have any visible, projecting bones in its tail or hips.
The eyes and nostrils of a healthy lizard should be free from swelling or crusting, the skin should not be scratched or bitten, and the head should be free of mites (distinguished by the presence or absence of tiny moving flecks in black, brown, red, or orange).
A healthy snake should have a well-rounded body, clear eyes, a spine that doesn't protrude, and no visible parasites.
Select a snake that flicks its tongue a lot, seems aware of its environment, and has enough muscles to gently squeeze you when you pick it up.
A healthy turtle/tortoise should have clear eyes, dry skin, no damage or white spots on the shell, and no visible parasites.
Check the turtle/tortoise's stool, as loose, runny stool may be a sign of a parasitic infection.
Schedule an initial veterinary checkup, and make sure you bring your reptile in for regular visits to make sure it remains in good health.

, If you've set up a tank, prepared a quiet/secure space for your reptile, and found a reputable breeder or seller, you're ready to bring your new pet home. Finalize the purchase and bring your new reptile home to the environment you've prepared for it.Let your chosen heating element(s) warm up the environment well before you release your reptile in its new home. When you release it, turn the overhead lamp off for a bit, as this can be disorienting, but consider leaving on the under-tank heater (if you have one).
The pet store or breeder you buy from should give you some type of container or cloth bag for transporting your reptile. Release your pet into its tank by placing the container/bag on its side in the tank and opening it up.
When you set down the container, try to place it near the reptile's water dish. Your reptile will probably be quite thirsty, but may be too timid to cross the entire tank right away.
Let your reptile emerge from the container when it feels comfortable. It may be frightened and disoriented from the trip to your home.
Allow your reptile to explore its new environment for about an hour before you turn the ambient heat source back on. Once your reptile seems comfortable, turn the light on and remove the container you used to bring your pet home.

Give your iguana a lot of proper light.,
It is very important to provide adequate heat for your iguana.,
Prepare your iguana's home.,
Other things to consider include the need for large branches, as iguanas love to climb.,
Feed your iguana properly.,
Multiple Iguanas- Not a good idea if in the same cage.",How to Care for an Iguana," Iguanas need lots of natural special light so they can absorb U.V.B. and U.V.A light.
U.V.A light keeps your iguana feeling good and helps reptiles have a good feeding response. U.V.B. light allows the iguana to digest their food and absorb vitamin D which allows them to absorb the calcium that they need to help prevent metabolic bone disease.The best source of U.V.A light is the sun or basking lights. U.V.B. light should be purchased at pet stores like Pet Smart offer fluorescent bulbs that are designed specifically for U.V.B. output. It is necessary to change out the U.V.B bulb every 6-12 ""nine months is usually best"" to keep your iguana healthy.;
, These reptiles are native to warm climates such as Central and South America, and they are not used to lower temperatures. When keeping an iguana as a pet it is important to have a heat lamp to keep the iguana warm. Average temperature needed on a day to day basis is between 80 and 90 degrees. Once you have a heat lamp in place it is important to make sure that you watch your iguana to see how they react to the heat. If they are constantly under the heat lamp it needs to be warmer, if they are never under the heat lamp it needs to be cooler. Nighttime temperature shouldn't drop below 75oF, daytime temperatures should be in the range of 85-95oF, with a hot stop between 97-99oF. Check your temperatures. These temperatures can be attained by use of heat lamps hooked up to a dimmer. Iguanas are cold blooded and cannot regulate their temperature like humans. Therefore when they get to hot or cold they move to where it is cooler or warmer. Do not allow your iguana direct access to the heat lamps as they may burn themselves. Electrically heated terrarium rocks, though aesthetically pleasing are potentially dangerous and should not be used.

, You'll need a nice large house for your iguana. An aquarium that you get from a pet store is not big enough, even for your baby iguana. A good size for an adult iguana cage is 3 feet (0.9 m) deep x 6 feet (1.8 m) wide x 6 feet (1.8 m) high. This will give even an adult iguana some space to move around.

, As a way to regulate the humidity within the cage consider buying a humidifier to put moisture into the air. The most important thing to remember when buying or making your pet's home is that iguanas grow very fast.

, Iguanas are vegetarians and a variety of dark green leafy vegetables will keep your iguana healthy. Recommended greens are -collard greens, mustard greens, alfalfa, dandelion greens, watercress. Iguanas do not eat head or iceberg lettuce as these have virtually no nutrition! Romaine lettuce is acceptable, yet iguanas also need a wide variety of other fruits and vegetables to maintain a healthy diet. These include -yucca root, snap peas, parsnip, papayas, okra, mango, kabocha squash, green beans, butternut squash and acorn squash ""avoid citrus fruits though, as reptiles can't handle the acidity"". For treats you can give them - dahlia, hibiscus, grapes, raspberries, strawberries, or whole wheat bread pieces ""give them bread very sparingly though"" and do not be afraid of giving your iguana some ""Commercial Iguana Food"". It does provide the nutrients they need. However, it is ""highly"" recommended to give them vegetables and fruits so they have a broad source of vitamins and nutrients they need as well as extra hydration. Iguanas need a constant supply of fresh, clean water to drink from! Be sure to change the water frequently, otherwise you risk having a sick lizard!

, Iguanas are by nature very territorial, in the wild they live on their own and only get together to mate. Having two or more iguanas in the same cage will usually cause them to become aggressive with each other leading to fights and injured iguanas. This can cause disease such as mouth rot. Mouth rot happens if the iguanas get hurt at the mouth and the wound gets infected. Likely you won't notice it for a while but he or she will eventually stop eating due to the infection. Mouth rot can also occur from bacterial, viral, and parasitic origins. Mouth rot can occur from incorrect cage humidity and temps, poor nutrition, or bacterial infection. You can tell right away if your pet has mouth rot by just looking at his mouth. If you see puss in the mouth ""usually looks like cottage cheese"" or any swelling on the jaws, its most likely a type of mouth rot. There are vast ways an iguana can be in danger of something going wrong but mouth rot can be more common due to improper cage setup. It is treatable, but do not wait until your pet is very weak to get him treated, otherwise it may be too late to save the iguana. Don't wait to treat a problem or your iguana may die. Do as much research as possible, and set thing up right the first time around. An iguana can become a wonderful pet if care is taken seriously, as these lizards can live 20+ years!

Get appropriate housing.,
Provide water.,
Make sure they have enough places to hide and climb, iguanas on they natural environment like to rest on big tree branch.

,
Remember you will need to provide enough heat in order for them to digest the food.",How to Care for a Green Iguana Hatchling," It is recommended to have a large aquarium, at least 2'4 feet (1.2 m) long, 1'5 feet (1.5 m) tall and 1'2 feet (0.6 m) width. As they get larger your cage sizes should change accordingly. Your iguana will continue to grow regardless of its cage size. Remember that height is most important but don't get a telephone booth shaped cage. Your iguana should be able to lay flat without being cramped.;
, Iguanas are a tropical reptile and therefore require a high humidity in order to shed properly and be over all more healthy. The Habba Automatic Misting Machine is a great mister than you can use from hatchling to adult! Don't forget the water dish!

,, They are cold blooded reptiles and can not properly digest their food. They should always have a basking spot which should be kept in the mid 90's. Heat rocks are NOT acceptable as the heat can not be regulated and may cause burns on the underside of your iguana. Without the proper heat source, your iguana WILL die.

Place a water source inside the cage.,
Install a ramp, shelving, perches, or branches, or add small trees inside the cage.,
Put the finishing touches on your enclosure.",How to Build an Iguana Cage," The environment an animal needs to thrive as a pet depends on several factors, including:


The size of the adult animal.Most people purchase a baby iguana when it is only a few inches long, but adult iguanas can reach 20 pounds and 5-7 feet from the tip of their tail to their nose. They live to be about 20 years old and reach their full size at about 2-3 years.It is crucial that iguana habitats are built to accommodate this size.
The type of habitat it has in the wild.Because an animal's natural habitat is ideal for its temperament, habits, and adaptive traits, the environment you construct must mimic the natural habitat to the greatest extent possible. Wild green iguanas are naturally found in rain forests throughout Mexico and Central and South America.Its habits.In the wild, iguanas live in trees and rarely come to the ground. They are good jumpers, and they enjoy swimming.They are diurnal, which means they sleep at night and are active during the day, and because they are cold-blooded they tend to sunbathe in the morning to raise their body temperatures. Knowing these features of iguanas can help you to prepare the optimal environment.;
, Because iguanas can grow as large as 6 feet from head to tail, an enclosure must be quite large in order for the adult iguana to have room to move around and explore.


In general, this means the cage will need to be about 6 feet high, 3-6 feet wide, and 10-12 feet long.The height is crucial, since iguanas live in trees and the enclosure must contain perches or branches for it to climb.
Most iguana owners reserve the length of a wall for their iguana's enclosure. The enclosures generally need to be too high and heavy to place them atop furniture.

, As long as they are large enough and kept at the right temperature, iguana enclosures can be made from a variety of materials including plastic wire, Plexiglas, or even a large re-purposed china cabinet.


One thing to keep in mind is accessibility. You will need to easily put food and water inside the enclosure, and you need to be able to clean and disinfect the entire habitat (floors, walls, branches, food dishes, etc.) about once a week.Be sure that the enclosure you design is accessible for these purposes.
Keep in mind whether or not the enclosure will be seen by visitors to your home. This can help you make a decision about how fancy or simple it should be, and whether or not you should take the time to design an enclosure that will blend with the decor of your home.

, Using graphing paper, draw the front, sides, top, and bottom of the cage to scale. It is simplest to create a rectangular design, but a more experienced builder can create any design as long as it is tall and wide enough.


Be sure to include where you will place a door, several branches or perches, a light source at the top on one side (it should keep one side warm and the other side less so, so the animal has a place to go to cool down), and a water source at the bottom.
Consider making one side or wall removable for easy cleaning, as the entire cage will need to be disinfected weekly. Some people build a large, human sized door into the enclosure, so that they can easily step inside to clean it or spend time with their pet.

, Because iguanas spend most of their time in the branches, the frame and walls can be constructed from a variety of materials.


The frame can be constructed of PVC pipe or wood. Use standard hard woods that come in 2x4s like pine or spruce, but avoid aromatic woods like cedar or redwood which contain oils that can be dangerous for iguanas.Most people construct their enclosure walls from Plexiglas, plastic mesh (not wire, unless it is covered with plastic, as it can hurt your iguana's toes), or tempered glass so that they can see their iguana, but this is not strictly necessary. You can use solid wood if you choose.
PVC pipe and plastic mesh (or wire mesh covered in plastic) is a good plan for a cage that can be rolled outdoors on warm days. However, Plexiglas or glass will get too hot inside from the greenhouse effect, so plan to keep a Plexiglas or glass enclosure indoors.
Consider building your enclosure on wheels to make moving it easier.

, You will need lumber or PVC pipe for the frame, plastic mesh or Plexiglas for the walls, pre-made perches or sealed wood branches, tools for construction, and a heat lamp and water source for the completed enclosure.


Purchase enough lumber or PVC pipe to build a cage according to your blueprint measurements, but at least 6 feet high, 3-6 feet wide, and 10-12 feet long. If you're using PVC, consider buying special fittings like the ""3-Way Ell"" which is a joint that connects the angles of the structure.Purchase enough plastic or plastic-covered wire mesh, Plexiglas, or tempered glass for your floors, walls, and ceiling, along with glue or PVC cement to seal it to the frame. If you're using mesh, you can also dry-fit the mesh to the frame using zip ties.Purchase or make perches. These are available widely at pet stores and online, or they can be simple wood branches that are stripped and sealed. Just be sure that they are made from safe woods such as spruce or fir.
Get a saw or hacksaw, to cut the wood or PVC frame to length. You can also ask the home supply or hardware store if they can cut the wood or PVC for you, as long as you know your correct measurements. You will also need some side-cutters or electrician's pliers to cut the mesh if you're using it, and wood stain (if desired) and a water-based polyurethane sealant if you're building with wood.
Purchase a heat lamp, available at most pet stores. An adult iguana will need a hotspot of at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit that includes both UVA and UVB light. You can use a special heat lamp that fits these specifications from the pet store, or build your own fixture using fluorescent tubes. One reliable and simple option is to use two ZooMed 5.0 bulbs, available online, mounted in a high-quality fluorescent fixture, which can be purchased in any hardware store., This will be the first step, and then you will affix the walls, floor, and ceiling to a completed frame. It’s a good idea to build this in place in the room you'll keep it in; otherwise a large enclosure may not fit through the doorway.


Cut the wood or PVC pipe to your desired dimensions and affix frames for each side of the cage with glue and butt joints.
Once each side of the cage has been constructed, nail or glue the sides together to create the cube.
Include a door mechanism on the frame for easy access inside. This can be a removable top, a hinged door on one side, or both.

, This will prevent deterioration. If you plan to stain or paint the frame, be sure to seal after painting.


The sealant will make the wood easier to clean and protect your iguana from fumes., Make sure to leave no more than 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) holes in the walls.


If you are using Plexiglas or tempered glass, glue it to the frame instead of stapling it.
Cut and nail additional wood to place over the corners of the frame if using mesh as a side material.

, It should be at the top and off to one side, so that the iguana has a warmer and cooler region in the enclosure.


The heat source must be located no more than 8"" above where the iguana will spend its time basking (generally the top of the enclosure), because iguanas have sensors on their foreheads that regulate how frequently they need to bask.Affix the heat lamp to the top of the enclosure using zip ties, ensuring that cords extend on the outside of the cage. Be sure that if the fluorescent bulbs are exposed, you cover them with a wire bulb guard to prevent your iguana from touching the bulb and burning its skin.You should also install a couple of reliable thermometers in various locations in the enclosure to ensure that it is kept at the right temperature, which is crucial to iguana health. Under the basking light should be low to mid 90s (Fahrenheit) and the rest of the enclosure should be no lower than 80 degrees., In the wild, iguanas are excellent swimmers, and actually stay hydrated in part by soaking in water. You can use a large bowl or other container filled with water. Iguanas need a water source that is not only for drinking but also big enough to climb inside.

, You can attach these using secure zip ties or additional glue.


Iguanas like to climb and bask in heat. They need exercise and the ability to get closer to the heat lamps to digest their food.
Be creative, but ensure that it is accessible to the iguana. Branches and layers in the enclosure should ensure that the iguana can move to a variety of temperature zones by getting closer or farther from the heat source. For safety, the branches should be as wide as the width of your iguana., Before putting the iguana in its new habitat, ensure everything is put together properly for its arrival.


Place newspaper at the bottom of the cage for easy cleanup.
Ensure that there is fresh water in the bowl and plenty of food. Iguanas are strict herbivores and enjoy a varied diet of consisting of mostly vegetables (primarily leafy green vegetables), some fruit, and an occasional treat of cooked rice, pasta, or whole wheat bread.Use a shallow bowl for food (plastic, ceramic, or glass will work fine) and change it daily.

Insert the needle between the scales and into the muscle.",How to Give an Iguana an Injection,"


This procedure should be done by two people who are familiar with the procedure and comfortable working with an iguana.;
, The leg that you will inject should remain uncovered. (The towel helps shield you from the lizards claws, gives you an easier grip to gently hold the lizard still, and by covering the iguana’s head and eyes helps the lizard stay calm.

, For this example, the medication is injected into the muscle on the front leg. All medications must be injected in the front third of the lizard’s body and most antibiotics are shot into muscle. However, you must always check with the vet for each medication.

,, Trying to insert into a scale will bend most needles. Make sure the needle has gone into the muscle then inject the medication.

Pick a treat for a carnivorous reptile.,
Select a treat for an insectivorous reptile.,
Choose a treat for an herbivorous reptile.,
Pick a treat for an omnivorous reptile.,
Give your pet fresh food.,
Pick a treat based on your preference as well.,
Research the nutritional needs of your pet.,
Avoid treats that could be toxic to your reptile.,
Focus on complete nutrition.",How to Choose Treats for Pet Reptiles," Giving a carnivorous reptile, such as a monitor lizard or a snake, a ""treat"" simply means giving them a new or different type of food. Because they are carnivores, you should only give them animal protein for food.Trying to feed your pet other ingredients will make the treats unappealing or it could make them ill.Most captive carnivorous reptiles are fed rodents. If you would like to switch up your reptile's diet, consider switching between mice and rats once in awhile; however, all of your carnivorous reptile's dietary needs are taken care of by feeding them healthy mice or rats.Carnivorous reptiles tend to eat specialized prey, meaning that they won't eat just any small animal that they come into contact with. For example, ball pythons can have a very hard time recognizing prey that they are not used to, and can starve if not tricked into eating.This makes giving a carnivorous reptile a new ""treat"" difficult.
One factor that limits a reptile's ability, and desire, to eat certain prey is the size of the prey. For instance, if an animal you are giving as a treat is more than two thirds the size of the reptile's head, then they are unlikely to be able to eat it.;
, If your reptile is an insectivore, there are a wide variety of insects you can give your pet that are relatively easy to find and purchase. While an insectivore's diet usually consists mainly of crickets or mealworms, giving your pet reptile a different insect every once in a while will be a great and unexpected treat. See if your reptile likes other insects that are available at your local pet store or are commonly available online, such as silkworms, waxworms, or even a cockroach.
Consider giving your insectivore a treat of an insect you catch outside. A garden pest, such as a grasshopper, can be a great treat for your reptile. Just make sure it is an insect your animal can eat.

, If you have an herbivorous pet reptile, such as a chuckwalla or desert iguana, you will need to feed them only fruits and vegetables, even when giving treats.Most of the time they should be eating leafy greens.To give your pet a treat, then, simply give it a piece of fruit or vegetable that it does not get very often, but that is safe for the reptile to eat.


For example, desert iguanas loves dark leafy greens, soft fruits, and some types of flowers. If you have never given yours a dandelion or nasturtium bloom, give your pet one and see how they like them.
Treats that are not leafy green vegetables should only account for about a tenth of your herbivore reptile's diet. That means that these other foods should really be an occasional ""treat.""
Try giving your herbivore some additional fiber in the form of hay. Tortoises tend to like it.
To give your herbivore reptile a little protein you can see if they will eat a small portion of hard boiled egg with the shell on or a little piece of cooked chicken. Only give them very little of this treat, as too much animal protein will injure an herbivore's kidney function.

, Many reptiles eat both plants and animals. One such reptile is the crested gecko, which likes fruits and insects alike.This type of pet is easy to feed treats to, as they will be less picky about what you give them and there are a wider variety of foods you can provide as well.


Insects that you can give an omnivore are usually available at your local pet store but can be found online as well, like those for insectivores. Just be aware that you will need to know how to store and keep the insects alive long enough so your reptile can enjoy them.
Treats for an omnivorous reptile could include a cricket or a piece of fruit. Fruits that are high in calcium, such as figs, are a good choice.Give your reptile a well-balanced diet, meaning a mix of plants and animal foods. Being a true omnivore means that it needs nutrients from both types of foods.

, Whether it is a live baby mouse, a lively cricket, or some fresh dandelion greens, the best treat for your reptile is a fresh one. Commercial foods made for reptiles can serve a nutritional purpose, especially if you are lacking access to fresh foods, but it is always best to fill as much of your pet's nutritional needs as you can with fresh options. After all, that is what it would eat out in the wild.


Most pet stores will be able to supply you with fresh food for your reptile, whether it be a carnivore, insectivore, or an omnivore. If your local pet store doesn't have what you need, or if you don't live near a pet store, then there are online businesses that can send live food for you to feed to your reptile.

, If you have the option of feeding your pet a variety of treats, and all of them would be a nutritious option, then your preference can come into play as well. Weight the cost and availability, as well as whether you like or dislike handling certain foods, when picking a treat for your pet.


For example, there are a variety of insects you can give an insectivorous reptile. Pick the one that is the simplest to get, the cheapest, or the easiest to deal with. This could mean crickets, because they are sold at most pet stores and are relatively cheap, or it could mean mealworms, because you can keep them in the fridge and they don't need food, water, and their own tank the way that crickets do.

, Every type of reptile is different and each one has different dietary needs. As a pet owner, it is your job to supply those nutrients so that your reptile can live a healthy life. So, before you bring a reptile home, do some research about what you can and can't feed them.


Doing research into what specific reptiles eat can help you decide if you can take care of a specific reptile. If one requires live prey, for instance, you need to be ready to give it to them. If that will be difficult for you, then you should probably find a different pet.

, In general, there are certain foods that are not good to feed reptile pets. These foods have chemical components that can make reptiles very ill or even kill them. Some include:Avocado
Rhubarb
Apple seeds
Daffodil
Eggplant
Cherry pits
Peach pits

, Feeding your pet a special treat can be fun but that should not be your primary focus. Animals living in captivity, including your pet reptile, rely on humans to give them all of the nutrients they need. With the fun of having a pet comes the responsibility of taking care of it well.


If you want to give your pet a treat, consider covering it in supplements or vitamins that the reptile needs. This is done regularly when giving insects to lizards, but is a good way to supplement a variety of reptile's diets."
"
Consider whether this is the right pet for you.,
Decide which type of iguana you want.,
Consider where to obtain the iguana from.,
Look out for potential problems when choosing an iguana.,
Have everything set up before taking the iguana home.,
Provide the iguana with a large water bowl in its tank.,
Keep the tank very green for the iguana, as they like the color.,
Let the iguana be.,
Don't force food on the iguana too much at first, but let it eat what it wants, if it wants to.",How to Buy an Iguana," Iguanas as pets aren't for everyone. You need to know that they get up to 4 feet and some grow as much as between 5 to 6 feet long and have been known to get a little larger. They can overpower small adults and can seriously injure you if you're not careful. They have a very strong bite, and a very strong tail which they use to whip. Most of their body is tail and that is their main defense. Do your research thoroughly before deciding, and if it's not for you, there are smaller choices for keeping a pet lizard, such as a bearded dragon.


Make sure that you are ready for the commitment. Iguanas can live from 15 to 30 years, and sadly, they are the most thrown away pet; people let them loose outside and they get rid of them because they get too large and require a whole lot of food when they get fully grown.;
, The typical green iguana is the most commonly sold iguana used for captive keeping. There are also red, blue, albino and rhino iguanas but these are harder to find.

, You may be better off purchasing from a breeder than a pet store––check the environment in which the iguana has been raised; it should be a spacious, quality environment to ensure the optimal health of the iguana.

, Iguanas may have mouth problems, missing toes or fingers, injuries, or be sick looking. Go for the biggest greenest iguana in the bunch. Ask the breeder about the iguanas and if he or she has the parents, ask to see them too, to make sure they look healthy and well formed.

, The housing must have the right temperature and humidity for the iguana. For more details, read How to care for an iguana. You also be interested in building your own iguana cage.


Iguanas will require plenty of room. You will need a 55 gallon tank at the least and that is just starting off. A juvenile iguana can stay in that size tank for a while but you will need to go up as it gets older.
Iguanas need a UVB (ultraviolet B) light in order to absorb the calcium they need to help them avoid a common problem for captive iguanas, namely metabolic bone disease.
There must be a heat lamp, and no light at nighttime so that they can sleep, although they will sleep most the day too.

, That is what they prefer to use for washing, using the bathroom in, and sitting around.

, It helps them to feel safe.

, The iguana will be nervous, so don't bother it for about a week. Let it get used to the new home and surroundings before it starts to get used to you.

,


Get calcium powder and dust the iguana's food with this every day.

Consider the behavior of your reptile.,
Choose materials to work with.,
Determine the size of the cage you need.,
Ventilate the cage.,
Create a sketch of the cage.,
Construct the cage.,
Add any finishing touches.",How to Build a Reptile Cage1," Think about the type of reptile you have. Does your reptile need water? What type of light does your reptile need? Is your reptile young? How large is the reptile expected to grow? Will the cage be kept inside or outside?The cage should resemble the reptile's natural habitat as much as possible.For example, a chameleon would need a tube cage.
Turtles, frogs, and some snakes will need water in the tank.
Some reptiles eat other insects and animals such as crickets and mice. Your cage needs to be able to accommodate those animals as well. You do not want those animals escaping into your home.;
, The materials you choose for the cage will depend on your budget and the needs of your reptile. Cages are typically made using screen or mesh, plastic or wooded, or acrylic or glass boxes.Also consider how often you will need to clean the cage.


Unless you have experience working with acrylic and glass, buy pre-cut panels. The panels can be attached together or you can attach the panels to a wood or plastic frame.Plastic cages are more expensive, last longer, and hold heat better than glass cages.Melamine, high pressure particle board with a decorative laminate coating, looks good, holds up well and is easy to clean, but it's heavy. Other options include a good grade of plywood or pre-cut shelving boards.
Walls can be made of wood, glass, transparent thermoplastic, or coated wire mesh.
Consider building a reptile cage out of existing items, such as an aquarium, old chest of drawers, entertainment center or a refrigerator with the door removed.

, Your reptile should have room to move around and hide in its cage. There should also be enough room to incorporate the necessary lighting, heating, and flooring. Most cages are rectangular in shape.


Small reptiles such as leopard geckos and garter snakes need two to six square feet of space.Medium sized reptiles such as pythons need six to eight square feet of space.
Small reptiles that move around a lot such as bearded dragons need eight to 32 square feet of space.Large reptiles such as iguanas, tortoises, and constrictors need a closet or room size for a cage., Wire mesh, pegboard, and holes are all ventilation options. For example, screen and mesh are needed for reptiles such as chameleons that need plenty of airflow. The ventilation you choose should be based on the needs of your reptile.


Ventilation holes should either be too small for the reptile to escape through or covered with wire mesh, hardware cloth, or black window screen. Don't use wire mesh in snake cages.
Pegboard is good if the reptile likes to rub its nose against things.
If you are concerned about the reptile's nails injuring the cage, you can use quarter-inch plastic coated hardware cloth.

, Once you have chosen the size of the cage and the materials you plan to use, make a sketch of the cage you plan to build. This will help you determine exactly what you need to buy, and help you develop a game plan for building the cage. Also measure the area where you plan on placing the cage to make sure that there will be enough room.Make a list of the tools that you will need such as a chisel, drill, saw, etc. Also gather any screws, hinges, glue, or adhesive that you may need.
Plan your approach to building the cage. Decide what pieces you will put together first. Will you use pre-cut materials or cut your own?

, Attach the walls of the cage using wood or glue. Plexiglass and wood will require screws. Create cut outs for ventilation as well. Construct a door for the cage and apply hinges or latches to the door frames.Doors should always open sideways or down. If you have to hold the door up with one hand, cleaning the cage or caring for your reptile will be more difficult.
Put the door in a place that allows you to reach all areas of the cage easily. A badly placed or sized door may make it more difficult for you to care for your reptile.
Do not place hinges on top of the door.
Make sure that all of the hinges, screws, lids, and doors are sturdy. You do not want your reptile to escape from the cage.

, Sand down any rough areas or sharp edges. Seal the bottom of the cage so substrate, water and excrement don't leak out. You can use non-toxic silicone sealant and a durable plastic sheeting. Cover the raw edges of any wire mesh inside the cage.


If you plan to paint or decorate the wood, stain bare wood and apply a topcoat, such as polyurethane, to protect it. Be sure to air it thoroughly afterward so fumes don't sicken your reptile.

"
"
Choose the substrate (flooring).,
Add heat to the reptile cage.,
Provide ultraviolet (UV) light.,
Furnish the cage with items that simulate your reptile's natural environment.,
Observe your reptile in the cage.",How to Build a Reptile Cage2," Flooring choices include sand (fine beach sand, playground sand, silica sand), gravel/stones (lava rock, pea gravel, polished stones), wood and paper products (bark, mulch, butcher paper, newspaper, paper towels, shavings), soils and mosses (sphagnum moss, potting soil, Spanish moss), or litter (cat litter, clay litter, alfalfa pellets).The type of substrate you use will depend on the needs of your reptile.


When in doubt, seek professional advice from a reptile specialist. Some substrates, for example sand, can readily cause gut impactions if the lizards eats some when feeding off insects.
Wood is best for arboreal species of reptiles, such as lizards, that do not spend a lot of time on the ground.Paper towels and newspapers can be shredded and placed on the bottom of the cage. These materials are inexpensive and are easy to clean up, but they do not help with odor control.
Coconut fiber is good for reptiles that need a high humidity environment and helps control odor. It is also good for reptiles that like to burrow and hide.Moss is good for high humidity reptiles and is good for reptiles that like to burrow as well.Sand works for desert species reptiles; however, it can be harmful if large amounts are ingested.Never use soil, grass, bark or other substrates from the park or your yard. They may contain organisms and bacteria that may be harmful to your reptile., All reptiles need an external heat source because they cannot control their own body temperature and many of them come from warm climates. If your reptile spends most of his time on branches or in the upper portion of the cage, he will need basking heat. If your reptile spends most of his time on the ground, you will need ground heat. All cages need a thermometer as well. The ideal temperature is between 20 and 32 ºC (68 to 89.6 ºF).Ceramic heaters, basking lamps, and basking lights can be used to provide basking heat. Basking lights are used to create a desert environment. Basking lamps have time limits (14 hours in the summer and 8 hours during the winter) and must be monitored.Heat mats and pads, hot rocks, and heat cable and ropes provide ground heat. Heat mats and pads provide constant heat. Hot rocks are best for nocturnal reptiles, but may malfunction from time to time. Choose your hot rocks, mats, and pads carefully. Some mats get too hot and the reptile could burn his belly lying on it. Heat cables and ropes are flexible and can be wrapped around different objects. Heat cables and ropes get very hot. You will need to use a rheostat to monitor the temperature.
Do not place a basking light above a heat pad. This can cause the temperature of the heat pad to reach unsafe levels and can hurt your reptile.

, Most reptiles need full spectrum lights that provide either UVA or UVB light. Proper lighting will keep your reptile healthy and happy and provide adequate levels of Vitamin D3 and calcium. The specific light you use will depend on the type of reptile you have.Lights should be placed 12 to 18 inches from where the reptile will lie.
Lights that provide 4% to 10% of radiation as UVB are best, depending on the animal.
You will most likely need at least two UV bulbs. It is best to switch your lights on and off — including the UV — to mimic day length in the habitat in which your lizard lives in the wild.
Lights should be replaced every six months, regardless of whether they appear to be functioning. This is because the UV levels emitted drop off markedly after six months.
Incandescent lights will add heat to a cage. While you can use this type of light as a heat source, take care that it doesn't make the cage too hot.
Install lights outside the cage if possible. If you choose to install a bulb inside the cage, build a shield around it so the reptile doesn't come into contact with it.

, Put in tree branches for species that like to climb and flat rocks for those who enjoy basking under a heat lamp. Give your reptile places to hide, ideally one hide at the warm end and one hide at the cool end of the cage. Purchase the furnishings from a pet store or trusted online retailer. Branches, sticks, and leaves from our natural environment may be harmful for your reptile.


Consider your reptile's water and food needs. Some need a large dish they can climb into, while others need a drip bottle to drink from.

, Place your reptile inside and observe his behavior closely to make sure he is comfortable. A reptile that acts strangely or is constantly trying to escape may be in distress, requiring that you make adjustments or build a more suitable cage.

Buy a healthy tortoise - if you know of a reliable, reputable pet store that specializes in reptiles, they may have one for you.,
Create a natural habitat - the Leopard tortoise is found natively throughout south and east Africa.,
Create an outdoor captive habitat - if you live in a warm, dry climate similar to that described above, you are poised to emulate the tortoise's natural habitat by building an outdoor pen for your new pet.,
Create an indoor captive habitat - avoid the use of an aquarium since they do not offer enough horizontal space for your tortoise to roam about in.,
Provide suitable food - the leopard tortoise feeds primarily on grasses in the wild.,
Select appropriate heat and light - your tortoise will need two main sources of light for daylight and heat.,
Provide appropriate supplements - a supplement that can be fed to the tortoise is the Mazuri tortoise food.,
Enable socialization - tortoises are mostly solitary animals in the wild, but they are not opposed to a little attention once in a while, especially when they get older.",How to Care for a Leopard Tortoise," Better yet, contact a tortoise breeder and get one directly from them. You can also get one at a reptile expo. In either case, examine your new pet carefully before buying it. Make sure that its eyes are clean and glossy (not cloudy or filmy) and that its fecal droppings are not too runny. Do not pick one up from the road.;
, They are typically found in areas with dry or semiarid climates. They prefer areas with lots of grass. You should try to emulate this sort of habitat for your 'captive' tortoise.


By captive this means non-wild, not necessarily in a cage and never captured from the wild - see ""Warnings"" below.

, (That’s a subject for a separate article)

, Start with a nice size pen or terrarium, at least 2'x2' with smooth, 12' (min.) vertical walls so that your tortoise will not try to escape and accidentally flip over. Cover the bottom of the pen with clean paper (newsprint is cheapest) and then put down a layer of substrate using a combination of the following - barks, soft sand, dry grass. You may also want to add some rocks for your tortoise to bask on. You should definitely include some sort of hollow log or other cave-like covering for your tortoise to retreat to when he's feeling overwhelmed by the world. Most importantly, supply your tortoise pen with proper heat and lighting. (that is covered below in another step)

, For captive kept tortoises, a mixture of grasses. Leaves and straw are best. Many have had good results with timothy orchard grass. Some have also found that a nice mixture of spring greens will work well. Be careful with vegetables though - too much wet food can cause digestive problems and will lead to excessively soft, smelly fecal matter. It's good to cultivate weeds and wild plants in your yard that are palatable to your tortoise such as: clovers, dandelions, wild grass...etc.

, For the daylight, you should buy a UVB lamp (100 watt) to emulate the full spectrum of the sun's light. Also, provide natural light for your guy whenever possible. For the nights, use a 60 watt red heat lamp to keep the cage warm. It is good to put the lights on timers so that they will turn on and off automatically and keep the cage at a fairly constant temperature. The temperature should average around 100 °F (38 °C). it should never be much cooler than 70 (F) or hotter than 100 (F). Use a small disk thermometer to monitor the heat at all times. Adjust the timing and wattage of the lights as needed.

, The Mazuri tortoise pellet was developed for Galapagos tortoises but may tortoise owners have found that it works well with many other tortoises. Due to their rate of growth, their demand for calcium and mineral trace elements is high. A calcium-D3 supplement should be provided daily to juveniles and also for adults less frequently.

, When your tortoise is still a baby, begin socializing him by gently picking him up and holding him in the palm of your hand. Do not tap on its shell or yell at it to come out, as this will frighten and stress your tortoise. Instead, let it take cover inside its shell until it is ready to come out of its own accord. As your tortoise grows up and realizes you are its food and care provider, it will be comfortable enough to eat right out of your hand, it may even let you pet it sometimes.

Take your tortoise to the vet.,
Decide whether or not to keep your tortoise in a vivarium.,
Decide if you should keep your tortoise in a green house.,
Add variety to your tortoise's diet.,
Bathe your tortoise regularly.,
Keep you tortoise away from other pets.",How to Care for a Non Tropical Tortoise," This is to check for any illnesses or ailments. Believe it or not, there are many diseases that harm tortoises, and it is your job to protect yours.;
, This is a good idea for young tortoises because they can't get lost. The floor of the vivarium should be covered in newspaper, and some fresh water should be kept in a flat dish. Add a small shelter for them to sleep in. This is like their home, so you should try your hardest to make it cozy.

, If your tortoise is old, you should keep it in a green house for easy access to a garden. This way, they don't need to move around too much to get food.

, Don't just feed them lettuce. They eat cabbage, dandelion, and occasionally tomato. Vary their diet, but always check first. Be careful to not overfeed your tortoise.

, Scrub their shell with Hi-Bi-Scrub. Be careful to not get any in their eyes.

, Make sure that dogs, cats, foxes, and hamsters stay away, or else your tortoise could get seriously hurt.

Allow your vet to trim your gerbil’s teeth.,
Schedule regular teeth trimmings.,
Feed your gerbil what he would eat in the wild.,
Give your gerbil chew toys.,
Check your gerbil’s teeth at least once a month.",How to Treat Dental Problems in Gerbils," Gerbils’ teeth continue to grow throughout their lives. To keep their teeth from growing too long, gerbils need to gnaw or chew on something. If your gerbil doesn’t have much to chew or gnaw on, or is old and cannot chew very well, his teeth will begin to overgrow.Sometimes, your gerbil may have broken or missing teeth.You may notice that your gerbil’s teeth do not align well with each other. This can cause the incisors and/or cheek teeth (teeth in the back of the mouth) to overgrow. Overgrown incisors look like tusks.;
, With dental problems, your gerbil may not be able to eat very well, causing him to lose weight. If you are used to picking him up every day, you will probably be able to tell if he has lost weight. If he feels a bit lighter, but looks otherwise healthy (e.g., bright eyes, alert), he probably has a dental problem., Other than weight loss, you will notice other changes with your gerbil if he has dental problems. For example, he may begin drooling because he can’t chew his food properly.He may also start preferring soft foods over hard foods, or stop eating completely.Your gerbil may not want to open his mouth, and might shy away from you when you touch his head., Since your gerbil’s dental problems could cause serious health issues, you should take him to your vet when you notice any signs of dental problems. Your vet will be able to take a closer look in your gerbil’s mouth and come up with a treatment plan., If your gerbil’s teeth are overgrown, your vet will need to trim them. They will use specialized dental tools so they can trim the teeth and even out any sharp or uneven surfaces on the teeth. For example, your vet will use a dental drill or bone file to smoothen the teeth's edges.If your gerbil’s teeth are really overgrown, your vet would need to sedate your gerbil for the teeth trimming.Do not attempt to trim your gerbil’s teeth at home! Not only would this be painful for your gerbil, but you may also worsen his dental problems.

, Since your gerbil’s teeth are always growing, you may need to take him to your vet for regular teeth trimmings. Be aware that, over time, these regular trimmings may get tedious and expensive.Your vet can let you know how often your gerbil would need to come in.

, Wild gerbils will chew on grass and gnaw on tree bark to prevent their teeth from overgrowing.Feeding your gerbil grass from your yard wouldn’t be such a good idea though, since the grass could contain harmful ingredients like pesticides that would make your gerbil sick.Not all types of wood are safe for your gerbil. Feed your gerbil only safe woods, including mulberry, magnolia, and poplar. If you have any of these trees in your backyard, wash and dry the wood pieces before giving them to your gerbil.If you are not sure if the tree branches in your yard would be safe for your gerbil to gnaw on (or if you think they have pesticides on them), purchase a gerbil-safe wood block from your local pet store., Other than wood, chew toys are a great way to prevent dental problems in your gerbil. Toys made of wood, leather, or rope make excellent chew toys for gerbils.Empty cardboard boxes, Kleenex boxes, and toilet paper rolls are also ideal for your gerbil to chew on.Watch the chew toys for signs of wear and tear. Replace them frequently.

, The more regularly you check your gerbil’s teeth, the quicker you will be able to tell if he has a dental problem. Make a habit of looking in your gerbil’s mouth about once a month.Fortunately, since gerbils are so friendly and like to be handled, it should be easy for you to check your gerbil’s teeth."

Listen for thumping sounds.,
Watch for the male gerbil rubbing themselves around the cage.,
Look for aggressive behavior in the male.",How to Tell when Gerbils Are Mating1," You may also observe the gerbil pounding both rear feet. The sound is usually a quick thump, but can vary in tempo and volume. This can be mistaken for the gerbil being excited for reasons other than mating.Sometimes gerbils other than the mating pair will “catch on” and start pounding their feet too.;
, This is scent marking, and may be a sign of the male signaling his suitability as a mate to the female gerbil. You may also see the gerbil rubbing their stomach on cage objects.The male gerbil, however, could also be doing this to establish dominance and/or mark territory.

, The male may be reacting to the female’s readiness to mate. The first sign of aggressive behavior is usually a loud squeak from the male. The male gerbils may appear to “box” or wrestle with other males to ward off rivals for mating. Do not let this go on too long. Separate them if necessary.The aggressive behavior could also be for a perceived threat unrelated to mating.

, He should approach her from the rear.The male will attempt to mount the female in line from behind to get into the correct mating position.

, Either can occur with a squeak.If she turns and faces the male she has rejected the male as a mate.
If the female does not turn, but stays in place, she has accepted the mating pair.

, Both the male and female gerbils can make these sounds. The male may thump his rear feet softly during mating. The female may squeak. Both of the male and female behaviors are signs of sexual excitement., Both male and female gerbils should groom themselves after the mating act. The male and female gerbil should be allowed to groom their own genitalia. "
"
Look at the gerbil’s belly.,
Weigh the female gerbil regularly.,
Provide extra privacy and comfort.,
Provide measured help for the litter.",How to Tell when Gerbils Are Mating3," Gerbils can mate frequently. A female can be in heat every 6 weeks for 4 day periods. If she is with a male partner and not mating you should check for pregnancy. You’ll have to wait about a week to notice any visible body changes. Hold a piece of food or seed above the female’s head after a 2-3 week period to find the bulge in her belly., You’ll observe increases in weight of the female gerbil as she carries her litter. Weight the gerbil in a small pet scale or ask your veterinarian to do it. Either way, re-weight the gerbil every 10 days., The gerbil parents will want more privacy and female will require more nutrition during the pregnancy. Acquire a hideaway from a pet store, and provide extra tissues for bedding to let the gerbils build a nest. You can also put up a cloth or paper as a privacy drape on their cage. Check the food that you are providing for them is balanced for pregnant gerbils. It should have at least 18 percent protein., Birth usually will happen at night and can take a couple of hours. The gerbil will stretch until the baby is about to come out, reach to help it out, and then bite and eat the placenta. The babies will be born hairless, blind, deaf, and helpless. They will depend on their parents for weening for 21-35 days. Try to disturb this process as little as possible for a couple of weeks except for changing food, water, and overly wet bedding.Don’t be surprised to see the two parents mate again right away. The male will then often get expelled from the hideaway for a few days before the female lets him help with the babies.
Cannibalism is a concern with gerbil mothers and their babies. This is rare and usually only occurs with dead babies or if the mother is highly disturbed or sick.

Clean your gerbil’s cage.",How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Gerbils," Signs of respiratory problems in gerbils include sneezing, runny nose, and runny eyes. Your gerbil might also make a 'clicking' noise when it breathes, indicating moisture clearing out of the airways.In addition, your gerbil's eyes might look dull and half closed., Many cases of respiratory problems in gerbils require treatment with antibiotics, which are available through your vet. Many types of antibiotics are available. However, the bacteria causing respiratory problems in gerbils can be resistant to certain antibiotics.Your vet will need to be careful about choosing which antibiotic to use in your gerbil.

, If you house multiple gerbils in one cage, move the sick one to its own cage.Respiratory problems in gerbils can be contagious, so you will not want your sick gerbil around your healthy gerbils. In addition, having the sick gerbil in its own cage will allow it to be more comfortable during treatment.


Keep the sick gerbil isolated until it has completed antibiotic treatment., After your vet selects an antibiotic, they will explain how you should give the medication. Because gerbils are so small, you can give the antibiotic using a syringe. Make you give the entire amount of prescribed antibiotic.Stopping the antibiotic too early—even if your gerbil looks better—could leave bacteria in your gerbil’s system that could become resistant to other antibiotics.


The antibiotic will be a liquid solution. Your vet will provide you with small syringes (without needles) in which you will draw up the antibiotic. Or, your vet will give you pre-filled syringes so you do not have to fill the syringes yourself.
While holding your gerbil, position the syringe in the back corner of its mouth. Slowly empty the prescribed amount of antibiotic in your gerbil’s mouth. Watch your gerbil swallow so you know the medicine has gone down its throat.

, Usually, antibiotic treatment is very successful with treating respiratory problems in gerbils. However, this success may be temporary. For example, if a gerbil improves while on therapy, but then gets sick again after treatment ends, there may be another health problem making the gerbil sick.During treatment, the symptoms of respiratory illness (loss of appetite, noisy breathing, tiredness, etc.) should start to improve.
If your gerbil gets sick again after the antibiotic treatment, take your gerbil to your vet. If your vet diagnoses another health condition, follow the treatment instructions carefully and keep your gerbil isolated until the end of treatment.

, A gerbil can develop respiratory problems if its cage isn’t getting enough fresh air. If your gerbil’s cage is a glass aquarium, place a mesh or wire lid on top. These types of lids are available at your local pet store.Too much humidity can cause respiratory problems in gerbils.Adequate air circulation will make the cage less humid.
Do not place your gerbil’s cage near an open vent. Fresh air blowing through the vent into your gerbil’s cage could make your gerbil uncomfortable and/or cold.

, Gerbils can develop respiratory problems from their cage bedding, particularly pine or cedar shavings. For example, cedar shavings have fragrant oils that can irritate a gerbil’s airways. Paper bedding, such as CareFRESH®, is ideal.Shredded paper towels also make good bedding for gerbil cages.If your gerbil’s nose feels irritated from the bedding, your gerbil may rub its nose against the side of the cage. If there are cage wires, your gerbil could damage its nose on the wires. In this case, your vet will prescribe an ointment that you will put on your gerbil’s nose., Whether you’re treating your gerbil with antibiotics or just changing bedding types, a clean cage will help your gerbil feel better. Each day, remove left over food and soiled bedding. Each week, clean the entire cage and cage accessories (water bottle, food bowl, plastic toys) with hot, soapy water.Here are some other weekly cleaning suggestions:Use a toothbrush to clean tough spots or corners in the cage.
Disinfect the cage and its accessories with a diluted bleach solution (1/2 cup bleach per 1 gallon of water).
After cleaning, disinfecting, and rinsing the cage and cage accessories, let them dry completely.
Wash your hands after you finish cleaning the cage.

Be sure you have a male and a female turtle.,
Be sure your turtles are sexually mature.,
Cool your turtles.,
Feed your turtles well.",How to Breed Turtles1," Typically, a male turtle will be more colorful and more outgoing than a female. Males have a flat or concave plastron (bottom shell), and females have a flat or convex plastron, which allows more space for eggs.


Among water turtles, size is also a good indicator: males are smaller than their female counterparts. Also, male sliders have long claws on their front legs.
When it comes to box turtles, males generally have bigger, fatter tails, and a vent (cloaca) that's further from the shell than the female's.;
, Turtles are not able to breed until they've reached sexual maturity. When it comes to water turtles, males should be at least three years old, and females need to be about five years old. Neither male nor female box turtles will breed before they're at least five years old.


Don't plan to breed a recently acquired turtle. Wait at least a year.

, To increase the chances for successful breeding, it's suggested that you cool your turtles. Nesting season can run from March through June, so the cooling period actually needs to take place January into February for water turtles and December through February for box turtles.


Keep turtles at a temperature between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit for six to eight weeks for water turtles and eight to 12 weeks for box turtles.
Leave the turtles alone during this period. You can make food available, but they'll eat little or nothing at all.
If your turtles live in an outdoor pond, you can take advantage of the natural cooling that wintertime offers and allow them to hibernate.
After the cooling period has ended, return your turtles' habitat to its regular temperature.

, It's particularly important that your turtles eat well during the breeding season. In addition to their regular diet, be sure the females get enough calcium and Vitamin D3.


A healthy diet for a water turtle will contain some combination of: earthworms, snails, well-washed butter lettuce, melon, bananas, strawberries, blueberries, vegetable scraps, peas, tomatoes, cooked sweet potatoes, dandelion flowers and leaves and mulberry leaves.
A box turtle has the same basic diet as a water turtle, but the menu could also include whole feeder goldfish, crickets, kale, boiled egg, corn on the cob, chopped and steamed broccoli and lots of green leafy vegetables.
You can meet your turtles' need for calcium but putting a Cuttle fish bone to be nibbled on in the their habitat, or you can feed them calcium supplements.
Turtles that are kept outdoors don't need additional Vitamin D3; they make plenty of their own. But indoor turtles need exposure to a full spectrum reptile light or a D3 supplement.

Watch for hypnotic seizures.,
Look for muscle contractions.,
Monitor the duration of your gerbil’s seizure activity.",How to Know if Your Gerbil Is Having a Seizure1," Some gerbils have mild hypnotic seizures. These seizures are usually mild. During this type of seizure, the gerbil may stop moving and just stand in place. Their ears and whiskers may start twitching.During hypnotic seizures, the gerbil may feel limp if you pick them up.;
, Another type of seizure, called a grand mal seizure, may look scarier or more intense. During this type of seizure, your gerbil may have muscle contractions and their body may go rigid.Even though this seizure looks intense, it generally lasts for less than a minute and will not cause any damage to your gerbil.

, Your gerbil’s seizures should last somewhere from under a minute to a couple of minutes. Most gerbils who experience seizures have very short seizures that last less than a minute. If your gerbil experiences seizures that last much longer than that, it could be a symptom of a more serious condition.If your gerbil experiences seizures that last for a long time, you should take them to the vet to check for more serious brain damage.
Many gerbils take up to 10 minutes to recover after a seizure.

"
"
Give your turtles some space.,
Check your male to female ratio.,
Create a nesting area.",How to Breed Turtles2," There's not much you can do to try to get your turtles to mate. You simply have to put your sexually mature turtles together and let nature take it's course. It is important, though, that they have room to move around freely. Give them plenty of space and create a nesting area (see below) where female turtles can lay their eggs.


If you have several different species of turtles, consider separating the smaller from the larger during mating season as some turtles become more aggressive during this time, and larger turtles can bite the heads off of smaller breeds.

, It may be in the best interest of your turtles to be sure you have more females than males. Sexually motivated males can make such great demands on females that their health will suffer. Males may also fight with one another over a female.

, Provide an area for the females to lay eggs that has shelter and soft soil. This area should have 6"" to 12"" of soft, slightly moist soil as well as some rocks and logs so the female will feel safe laying and hiding her eggs there.


If you already have an outdoor pen for your turtles, create the area within your established pen. If you're putting your turtles in a larger area just for mating, you can create a nesting area in a box and make it easily accessible to your turtles.
Most water turtles lay several clutches, each containing between two and 10 eggs. Laying usually takes 24-48 hours per clutch, and a few weeks will pass between clutches.

"
"
Purchase an incubator.,
Create a nest.,
Incubate the eggs.,
Find out what determines the sex of your turtle.,
Check the eggs.,
Discard bad eggs.",How to Breed Turtles3," You can buy an inexpensive incubator to house your turtle eggs. What's important is the temperature control an incubator provides. Be sure to use the thermometer that comes with your incubator or purchase a thermometer to monitor temperature.


You do not have to have an incubator to hatch turtle eggs. Keeping them at normal summer room temperatures should do. On particularly hot days, move them to a cooler spot and be sure the eggs are moist. Do not put them in the sun; you'll risk overheating.
If you're not using an incubator, be sure to put the nest(see below) somewhere you'll see it and not forget about it.

, The nest for your turtle eggs will sit inside your incubator. It's very simple to make one with a container you may already have at home and a few things from the garden supply store.


Container. Find a sturdy container with a lid and punch air holes in the lid. Simple take-out containers from the deli and plastic containers you may have in your kitchen can make perfectly good nests. Be sure the lids you use are not too tight. If the lids are hard to open, you can end up jarring the delicate eggs when you check on them.






Loosely set the lids on the containers until it gets closer to the time for the turtle eggs to hatch. As hatching time arrives, tighten the lids enough to contain the babies.
It's important to use lids so that the incubator heat source does not overheat the eggs.



Nesting material. To your container, add a mixture of one part vermiculite, one part peat moss and one part sphagnum moss. Soak the mixture and squeeze out the excess water.






Vermiculite, peat moss and sphagnum are usually easy to find at garden supply stores and some hardware stores. If you can't find all three, you should be fine creating a mixture of water and only one or two of the materials.

, Once the female has laid her eggs, pick them up very carefully. Do not turn them over or you will kill the embryo. Make small depressions in the vermiculite mixture and gently position the eggs inside. Keep the lid on and the temperature between 75 degrees and 85 degrees.


Use a magic marker or a piece of charcoal to mark the tops of the eggs so that you don't accidentally turn them over.
If eggs stick together when you pick them up, try very gently to separate them. If they don't come apart easily, leave them alone.

, For many turtles, the sex of the hatchlings is determined by temperature not genetics. In those cases, higher temperatures (maximum 85 degrees) will yield mostly females. Eggs incubated slowly in temperatures around 75 degrees will yield mostly males. An incubation temperature of about 80 degrees will yield an equal number of males and females.


Avoid letting your incubator temperature reach into the 90's; the eggs will spoil and the hatchlings will die. It's better to allow the eggs to incubate slowly than to risk killing your turtles.

, For the first month and a half, plan to check your eggs once a week. You want to make sure they're moist but not moldy or deteriorating. After 45 days, check them more frequently to see if they're hatching. Do not try to hurry things along. A baby turtle has what's called an ""egg tooth"" that it uses to break open its shell and is perfectly capable of hatching on its own.


If mold does appear on your eggs, gently wipe it off with a cotton swab. Never pick the eggs up to clean them; they are particularly fragile once the babies begin developing inside.
Depending on the temperature of your incubator, turtles typically will hatch in 50 to 120 days.

, Once one turtle hatches, the others should soon follow. Give eggs that don't hatch plenty of time, but know that you may have to discard some eggs that have gone bad or simply never hatch.


An egg could have some dents but be perfectly fine. Other times, an egg will look perfect, but has been leaking out the bottom and is no good. If an egg collapses, it's bad.
At about four to six months in, examine any eggs that remain and come to a decision about discarding them.

"
"
Remove the shells.,
Relocate your hatchlings.,
Feed them.,
Be prepared for failure.",How to Breed Turtles4," Once your turtles have hatched, remove the empty pieces of shell so that they don't contaminate the container for those turtles who have yet to hatch.

, A turtle may lie in its eggshell for several days after breaking it open. During this time, it's absorbing the last of the egg yolk sack attached to its belly. Place your hatched turtles on a moist paper towel in a new container outside the incubator. Keep them here for several days until they've fully absorbed the yolk sack. Once they have, move them to a vivarium or give them a home in a pan of shallow water.

, Feed young turtles at least once a day. Hatchlings are mostly carnivorous but be sure to offer them some fruits and vegetables. People have successfully raised baby turtles on and almost exclusive diet of the commercially available food Reptomin.


An excess of protein in a baby turtle's diet will cause its shell to deform. If you make this mistake, catch and correct it as soon as possible, and your young turtle will be fine. Unfortunately, once your turtle gets bigger, the deformity will be permanent and cause the turtle a lot of discomfort.

, Even with the very best of care, a significant number of captive-bred hatchlings also will not survive their first year. In nature, many young turtles don't survive, and the same is true for turtles bred in captivity. Enjoy the process, and, if you've done your best, don't blame yourself if eggs don't hatch or babies die.

Determine if seizures were inherited in your gerbil.,
Decide if your gerbil is the correct age for seizures.,
Recognize the triggers for a seizure.",How to Know if Your Gerbil Is Having a Seizure2," Epilepsy is a common disease that affects 20 to 40% of gerbils. The disease is inherited from the parents. Gerbils who are bred from parents that have seizures are pretty much guaranteed to have seizures as well. If you can, figure out if your gerbil is an at-risk breed or from parents who have epilepsy.If your gerbil has seizures, reconsider breeding them so you don’t pass on the gene., Gerbils experience seizures during a certain time in their lives. Generally, seizures start when the gerbil is around two months old. They sometimes increase in intensity until the gerbil is six months old.Often, a gerbil will stop having seizures after six months of age.

, Gerbils can have seizures if they are triggered by extremely stressful situations. Too much handling or inappropriate handling can be a trigger. They may also be triggered if something changes in their environment.For example, a gerbil may have a seizure if you change their living space or even put a new toy in their cage.
Loud noises or too much stimuli in the room can cause seizures. Consider keeping your gerbil in a low-traffic, quiet room if they have seizures.

"
"
Move the gerbil to a stress-free environment.,
Know that there is not standard treatment for seizures.,
Take your gerbil to the vet if there are any problems.",How to Know if Your Gerbil Is Having a Seizure3," There is nothing you can do for gerbils during a seizure. Most gerbils seize for a very short amount of time and then recover quickly. However, during or after the seizure, you should move your gerbil to a quiet, dark, stress-free environment.You can move the cage to a bedroom or another room that doesn’t get used often. This helps reduce the stressors that can induce seizures.

, For most gerbils with seizures, there is no treatment. The seizures usually go away after six months of age, and they cause no permanent brain damage. This means there is no standard treatment for seizures. Your gerbil can live a happy, healthy life with the seizures.However, if there is a related problem to the seizures, your vet may consider giving the gerbil anticonvulsant medication to treat the seizures and related problems.

, While most gerbils that have seizures are fine and don’t need medical attention, there are some conditions that may require you to seek medical attention. If your gerbil suffers from grand mal seizures, you may want to get them checked out by your vet, just in case.You also should take your gerbil to the vet if the seizures last for a long time, like over a minute or two.

Well-established pet stores are usually safe choices, although the selection of species they offer may be limited. Private sellers and breeders are another option, but should be dealt with more cautiously. The illegal sale of wild turtles is surprisingly common. Sellers who are reluctant to provide information about their turtles' breeding should be avoided.;
, The sale and purchase of some species of wild turtles is illegal. Furthermore, wild-caught turtles are more likely to be unhealthy in captivity, and removing turtles from their natural habitat can harm wild turtle populations.


If you are purchasing a turtle from a private breeder, be sure to ask for verification that the turtle has been bred in captivity. If they can't provide you with verification, assume that the turtle is not suitable for purchase as a pet., While it may be tempting to select a turtle based on their appearance, you should pay much more attention to the care requirements (especially the temperature and food requirements) of each species.


For instance, if a turtle is native to a climate much hotter or cooler than the one in which you live, you may have a hard time maintaining the proper temperature for it to thrive. Another important consideration is the adult size of each turtle species. Some species grow to a larger size than others, and you may end up with a turtle who eventually outgrows the habitat you prepare for it.
Ask the seller for assistance and recommendations, but be sure to verify the information with credible independent sources. Misconceptions are common, even among pet dealers.

, When choosing a turtle, ensure that it has clear eyes and is responsive and reasonably active.A turtle that has swollen or cloudy eyes, or shows signs of a runny nose is probably sick.
Unless it is of a soft-shell species, it should have a firm shell (though cracks and pits are not necessarily a sign that anything is wrong).A turtle that appears to be gasping through its mouth, or makes a wheezing sound when it breathes, is probably sick.

, Especially if you are considering owning multiple turtles some day, it is important to be able to identify your turtle's sex. Otherwise, you may end up with unexpected babies. Here are some clues to look for:A male turtle typically has a slightly concave underside, while a female turtle's underside is usually flat or slightly bulging.
In many species, an adult female will be larger than a male.
In some species, such as red-eared or painted turtles, males will have slightly longer fingernails than females.
The sex of a turtle can be hard to identify. The seller may be able to help you.

, If you purchase more than one turtle at first, you may find yourself overwhelmed and unable to properly care for all of them. Once you are comfortable caring for your turtle, you can consider purchasing more. Multiple turtles kept in the same tank may not get along. They may become aggressive to each other, requiring them to be separated.Keep in mind also that two turtles will require double the space and water filtration.
If you do decide to keep multiple turtles in the same tank, ensure that they are roughly the same size. A larger turtle can hurt a smaller one if it becomes aggressive.

, Most turtle species require specific temperature, light and water conditions to be healthy. There is no one-size-fits-all approach for caring for turtles.


Consult a reputable book or website (such as http://allturtles.com/turtle-species/) to determine the specific needs of your chosen turtle species., Glass aquariums are the most popular choice for turtle habitats. As a general rule, you should provide a tank with a capacity of 10 gallons for every inch of the turtle's shell.


Be careful to use the measurement for a fully grown adult turtle of the species you select, rather than the measurement of the turtle at the time of purchase. Turtles can and will outgrow their habitat if it isn't large enough. , Turtles require daily feeding. Don't assume that a particular food is suitable for consumption by your turtle unless you have specifically verified it. The diet of your turtle will depend on its species, but common turtle diets include: Fresh fruits and vegetables
Live feed, such as crickets and mice
Turtle feed
Freeze-dried shrimp

, Turtles are cold blooded, requiring energy from the sun to function. To simulate the natural light your turtle requires to be happy and healthy, you will need to provide two sources of lighting: a UV-A basking bulb and a UV-B flourescent bulb.Both of these light sources must be on and available to the turtle all day, although you may turn them off at night.
Be sure to select bulbs which explicitly provide UV-A and UV-B light. Many generic basking lamps are insufficient for reptile care.
Your UV-A bulb should be positioned over a region of dry terrain in your turtle habitat, so that the turtle can bask in it outside of water.
You should use a ground fault circuit interrupter, a device used to prevent electrocution, to connect your lamps to the electrical outlet. This will ensure that if a lamp falls into the habitat's water it will not electrocute your turtle.

, All turtles, even those dwelling mostly on land, require access to a substantial volume of fresh, clean water to drink and swim in. The amount of water required will vary, depending on the species you choose.On the other hand, even predominately aquatic turtles require dry ground to roam around and bask on, such as a turtle dock. Be sure that your habitat accommodates both needs.

, Because turtles excrete waste in the water in which they swim, you will need to install a filtration system and pump for aquatic turtles, just as you would with a pet fish.


Because turtles can be quite messy, you should choose a system rated for an aquarium twice the volume of the habitat you've selected. , Your turtle may sometimes wish to hide itself from light, and breaking up the space inside your habitat will make it more interesting for your pet. Use rocks, pieces of wood, or aquarium decorations to provide a varied environment for your turtle.

, Many varieties of turtles naturally enter a dormant state, called hibernation, during the coldest months of the year, while others do not. If your species hibernates, you may need to prepare a suitable environment for it to do so.


Research the variety of turtle you have. Non-tropical turtles hibernate in the wild.However, many common pet species do not actually need to.If in doubt about your turtle's hibernation needs, contact your veterinarian or local turtle club.
If you do allow your turtle to hibernate, the details of the environment it needs will vary depending on the species. You should thoroughly investigate your turtle's hibernation requirements before starting this process. Generally, hibernating turtles require a cool, isolated and stable environment for between 2 and 4 months of the year.Many find it convenient to allow their turtle to hibernate in a refrigerator, or other cool, dry location.

, When non-native turtle species are allowed to enter the natural environment, they can disrupt or even destroy native turtle populations. Releasing your turtle into the wild is therefore irresponsible and dangerous.


If you decide that you can no longer care for your pet turtle, contact your local animal shelter or humane society to donate it for adoption, or return it to its original seller., Despite the popular perception that turtles are easy to care for, they in fact require specialized, daily care to survive and thrive.


Your turtle may live 25 years or longer, depending on the species, so you should be prepared for a long-term commitment. Many turtles require live food, such as mice or insects, to thrive. If you are uncomfortable feeding your turtle live animals, you may wish to reconsider your choice.

, A small aquarium or plastic habitat will not be sufficient for most turtles. Due to their specialized needs, setting up a proper environment for a turtle is likely to cost you between $500 and $1200, depending on the species.


You will also need to provide adequate clean water (and space) for them to swim in, as well as enough dry ground for them to roam about and bask on. Specialized lighting and water filtration equipment will also be a requirement., Turtles can carry salmonella, a bacteria which can cause infection and illness, especially in children and elderly people. This is a serious health concern, and if any at-risk individuals are present in your home you should strongly reconsider purchasing a turtle. Remember that you do not need to touch a turtle to contract salmonella from it. Mere proximity to the turtle may be enough to risk infection.

, Turtles are shy, quiet animals. They will withdraw into their shells if startled and may remain like this for some time. They can, however, learn to recognize their owners and will often swim to the surface or near the glass when you enter the room.Turtles will also learn when it is feeding time, and may become especially active at the appointed hour.
Turtles are not social creatures. They will not display affectionate or playful behavior. It is normal for them to sit still a lot. If you are looking for an active, affectionate pet, turtles may not be for you."

If your gerbil is having an allergic reaction, you may have to change the bedding in your cage.Keep in mind that a gerbil's mucus is red. Therefore, a runny nose can be mistaken for a bleeding nose. If your gerbil appears to have a reddish nose, its nose is likely running and it may need treatment for an allergic reaction or respiratory issue.

, A change in bowel movements can be an indication a gerbil is sick. If you clean your gerbil's cage regularly, you should have a sense of what's normal for your gerbil. If your gerbil is suddenly eliminating less or more, it may be sick. Diarrhea in particular is generally a warning sign something is wrong., Seizure disorders are very common in gerbils. For the most part, seizures are not life threatening or dangerous. They can be concerning, however, and should be evaluated by a vet to make sure your gerbil is otherwise healthy.Seizures usually begin a gerbil when a gerbil is 2 to 3 months old. You may notice your gerbil twitches, goes into a mild trance, or has some muscle convulsions. Usually, seizures last several minutes.
Seizures are fairly common. About 20% of gerbils will develop seizures. They can be scary, but are usually not a sign of another illness.

, A sudden loss of appetite can be a sign of sickness. If you suddenly notice you're filling your gerbil's bowl less often, this can be an indicator your gerbil is sick. A healthy gerbil will have a good appetite., Lethargy is a common early sign of sickness. If you notice your gerbil suddenly seems tired and disinterested in toys and activities, it may be sick. Any changes in your pet's energy level should be evaluated by a veterinarian., Allergic reactions are a common cause of illness in a gerbil. Usually, an allergic reaction is marked by a runny nose. A gerbil may also lose hair around its nose due to rubbing it vigorously.Try switching your gerbil's bedding if it appears to be having an allergic reaction. Cedar pine bedding can be particularly irritating for gerbils. Try removing all your current bedding and swapping it with another kind. You may notice symptoms change.
If your gerbil remains sick after a change of bedding, take it to the vet. Your gerbil's health issues may not have been caused by allergies.

, Respiratory infections are a common affliction in gerbils. Respiratory problems can also be caused by bedding, particularly cedar pine bedding. If your gerbil's coat is rumpled and it makes a clicking noise and lacks energy, it may have a respiratory infection.In addition to changing the bedding, take your gerbil to the vet if it has a respiratory infection. Gerbils are small and their health can decline quickly if they're ill. A respiratory infection should be addressed by a vet.

, If you just got your gerbil from a pet store, it may have parasites. These are a common health concern that require veterinary treatment. Some parasites may not cause symptoms, and therefore a new gerbil's droppings should be tested by a vet. Other types of parasites can cause diarrhea and dehydration.Take your gerbil to the vet to get specific instructions on treatment if you suspect your gerbil has a parasite.
Clean and disinfect your gerbil's cage thoroughly. If you suspect an infestation of bugs like cockroaches or fleas may have caused the parasites, you should make an effort to eliminate these pests.

, Gerbils can easily die from illness if it's left untreated. Any unusual signs or symptoms warrant a trip to your vet's office."
"
Place your gerbil in a quiet place.,
Monitor your gerbil during the seizure.,
Wait as your gerbil recovers.",How to Treat Gerbils Prone to Seizure1," While your gerbil has a seizure, or right after they have a seizure, you can take them to a quiet, dark room. Removing outside stimuli can help the gerbil recover after the seizure.Check on the gerbil periodically after the seizure to make sure they are okay. They should recover quickly after the seizure.;
, If you want, you can monitor the gerbil during the seizure. There is nothing you can do for the gerbil while they undergo the seizure. The gerbil may have a hypnotic seizure or a grand mal seizure where they have muscle contractions. Seizures won’t cause any damage to your gerbil.Check how long the seizure lasts. A normal seizure in gerbils lasts for less than a minute, but may last up to two minutes. If the seizure lasts longer than normal, you should take your gerbil to the vet because something more serious could be wrong.

, After the short seizure, your gerbil will need to recover. This can take around ten minutes. After ten minutes, the gerbil should be acting normal and able to perform as they did before the seizure.Your gerbil may become more energetic for the few days after the seizure.

Take your gerbil to the vet.,
Use medication when the seizures are severe.,
Recognize the symptoms of a seizure.,
Know when seizures are most common.",How to Treat Gerbils Prone to Seizure2," If your gerbil displays abnormal behavior with their seizures, you should take them to the vet. Seizures are common in gerbils. However, seizures that last longer than one to two minutes or that occur frequently or in clusters may indicate a more serious condition.The vet will perform an exam based any outward symptoms. They will rule out other conditions that may be related to epilepsy. You will be asked to give a medical history about your gerbil, detailing symptoms during a seizure, their frequency, and when they started.

, For most gerbils who experience seizures, no treatment is needed. The seizures won’t cause damage and they taper off after six months of age. However, if your gerbil has severe seizures which cause intense, frequent, or damaging seizures, then they may need medication.Your vet may prescribe a muscle relaxant to help control the intensity and frequency of severe seizures.

, Gerbils can have two different types of seizures. A mild seizure may cause the gerbil to be catatonic. They may lay unmoving on the ground with their ears or nose twitching. The gerbil may be limp when picked up.


Severe, or grand mal, seizures result in convulsions and rigid muscles. These are usually very short, around 30 seconds.

, Seizures are a common condition in gerbils. They afflict 20 to 40% of gerbils starting around age two months. Seizures continue until around six months of age. As the gerbil ages, the seizures become less frequent."
"
Reduce the triggers of seizures.,
House the gerbil in a quiet environment.,
Reduce the frequency of seizures.",How to Treat Gerbils Prone to Seizure3," A few outside stimuli trigger seizures in gerbils. A gerbil may experience a seizure if they experience a sudden stress or scare, if they are handled improperly, or if they are introduced into a new environment.If you have small children, teach them how to handle gerbils. Being too rough may cause the gerbil to have a seizure.
If the gerbil has inherited the seizures, they may have a seizure for no reason.

, If you are handling your gerbil and they go limp, start twitching, become rigid, or start convulsing, they are probably having a seizure. Immediately place the gerbil back into the cage. Don’t try to hold the gerbil through the seizure or try to sooth them.Move the gerbil to a dark, quiet room free from stressors or external stimuli. Don’t house your gerbil in a room that has loud pets or a lot of traffic.
Don’t change your gerbil’s living quarters too often. Keep things familiar and stress-free for them., If you have a type of gerbil that is prone to seizures, you can try to reduce the likelihood they will have seizures. During the first three weeks of life, handle the gerbil frequently. This can lead to less seizures as they mature."

Don't use soap.",How to Bathe a Tortoise," The container should be small enough on the sides that your tortoise should be able to climb out of it. Add lukewarm water to it. Make sure the tortoise's head pokes above the water when he's in it, but it should be about chin deep., The tortoise will spend time in the water, using it to rehydrate his body. Tortoises use water to rehydrate their bodies. They absorb it through a vent in the tail know as the cloaca., The tortoise needs to soak for at least 20 minutes, but he will generally let you know when he's done by trying to climb out., Once the tortoise has soaked, you can take the water out. Discard the water in the toilet to avoid spreading any germs.You can also take the tortoise from his cage to put him in a basin and simply take him out when he's done.

, Use a towel to gently sponge him off. Start with the shell, gently rubbing the water off. Also, pat off the head, arms, and legs, being sure to get in all the cracks.

, How much water you need to provide depends on the type of tortoise, the time of year, and whether he's inside or outside. Inside, you may need to do it as often as once a week, especially if the humidity is low.Outside in the heat, the tortoise will need it twice a week, and you can let the water dry up in between.It's especially important to provide a bath when the tortoise is coming out of hibernation, as the tortoise will need to rehydrate.When the tortoise is hibernating and inside, you may only need to provide water about once a month., Allow the tortoise time to fill up its water reserves before you try to scrub it. Give it a 20-minute soak in clean water.Tortoises need soaking more often than they need baths. You shouldn't need to actually scrub your tortoise very often.

, Next, use an old, clean toothbrush to scrub the tortoise all over. Start with the shell, being sure to get in all the cracks. Move on to the legs, arms, and head. Be sure not to scrub too hard, especially on the places without scales., Use the water to wash off the dirt you've scrubbed clean. Gently pour it over the tortoise to get the grime off.


While you're washing, make sure to look for any injuries, nicks, or an unhealthy shell. If you notice any abnormalities, it may be time to take your pet to the vet for a check up., You don't want him to be wet when he goes back to his enclosure.

, Soaps, detergents, and shell cleaners are not good for tortoises. In fact, they can be harmful, even killing your pet. Stick with plain water to clean your tortoise."

Your gerbil’s eyes may also be half closed and look dull.A healthy gerbil’s eyes would be fully open and bright with an alert-looking stare.;
, If your gerbil has a respiratory problem, it will have trouble breathing. You may see your gerbil’s chest heaving with each breath because of the struggle to breathe. Your gerbil may also breathe very rapidly and have open-mouth breathing. Open-mouth breathing is a sign that the respiratory problem is severe.The normal breathing rate for a gerbil is 90 breaths per minute.This is a rapid rate, so it may be hard for you to see if your gerbil is breathing even more rapidly.

, As you watch your gerbil breathe, listen to its breathing sounds. When a gerbil has a respiratory problem, its lungs will become moist. With each breath, the airways will briefly clear, causing a clicking noise.In addition to clicking, you may also hear wheezing., A respiratory problem can make a gerbil feel pretty lousy. If your gerbil has a respiratory problem, it probably won’t feel like grooming its fur, which is a natural gerbil activity. As a result, your gerbil’s fur will be rumpled and clumped.Its fur may also look dull., When a gerbil has a respiratory problem, it will sleep in strange positions. You might see your gerbil propping its head up on a box or its nest when sleeping. Or, your gerbil may sleep in the corner with its nose pointed up. Also, rather than sleeping lying down, your gerbil may sleep in a crouched position.Propping the nose or head up would make it a little easier for your gerbil to breathe.

, Gerbils like to explore their environments. However, if your gerbil has a respiratory problem, it won’t feel like exploring much at all.Overall, your gerbil will move around less and become much less playful.

, In addition to moving around less, your gerbil won’t feel like eating very much.You’ll notice your gerbil eating less of the food you regularly feed it. Because of the decreased appetite, your gerbil may start losing weight., A sick gerbil will want to isolate itself from other nearby gerbils.If your sick gerbil has cage mates, it will probably isolate itself by hunching in a corner away from the other gerbils., Two possible causes of respiratory problems in gerbils are viruses and bacteria. Invading viruses and bacteria can quickly overwhelm a gerbil’s immune system, making the gerbil very sick, very quickly. As soon as you notice signs of respiratory problems in your gerbil, take it to your vet., When you take your gerbil to your vet, tell them what symptoms your gerbil is having and when you first noticed them. The more information you can give your vet, the easier it will be for them to make a diagnosis.


Scented bedding, such as pine or cedar shavings, can irritate a gerbil’s airways and cause respiratory problems.In addition to describing your gerbil’s symptoms, tell your vet what kind of bedding is in your gerbil’s cage.

, To begin the examination, your vet will observe your gerbil’s appearance and behavior (e.g., breathing, activity level) in its cage. Then, your vet will take your gerbil out of its cage and continue the exam. They will look over your gerbil’s body and listen to its heart and lungs. Your vet may also take a fluid sample from your gerbil to determine what organism has caused the respiratory problem."

Bathe your turtle occasionally.,
Obtain a dedicated turtle-washing tub.,
Assemble your other supplies.,
Fill the tub with water and gently place your turtle in the tub.,
Scrub the turtle's shell.,
Inspect your turtle as you scrub it.,
Rinse your turtle and return it to its tank.,
Dispose of bathwater carefully.",How to Bathe a Turtle1," Aquatic turtles spend the majority of their lives in the water and if their tanks are kept clean, rarely need a special bath. However, your turtle might benefit from a cleaning if it starts to develop algae on its shell, or when it is shedding to help remove dead skin cells.When your turtle is shedding skin, you may notice flaky patches of skin on its neck, tail or legs. This is normal.
If your turtle sheds a lot, however, it might mean a problem with the tank or the turtle's health, and you should consult with your vet.;
, Turtles can harbor salmonella bacteria, which can make humans very ill, so it is important that you not bathe your turtle in the sink or bathtub.Salmonella is very resistant to disinfectants, so the best course of action is to buy or find a special tub for bathing your turtle, and use it only for that purpose.A plastic bucket or wash tub makes an ideal tortoise bath; just make sure it's large enough to accommodate your turtle.

, To bathe your turtle, you just need a tub, a toothbrush, and a jug or pitcher of lukewarm water, preferably de-chlorinated beforehand . You should not use any kind of soap or shampoo on your turtle, unless it was specifically recommended by your vet., The water should be room temperature water that has preferably been dechlorinated. Add at least enough water to reach the turtle's chin, more if you'd like to let it swim around a bit., Use a toothbrush and gently scrub the turtle's entire shell, paying special attention to any areas of buildup. Remember that the turtle can feel his shell, so do not scrub too hard. Then scrub the turtle's legs, tail, and neck, but be careful with these areas as they are more sensitive. Finally, scrub the turtle's plastron (belly), and be sure to remove all algae and dirt between the scutes or scales.Do not use any kind of soap or polish on your turtle, this could injure it or make it ill!

, This is the perfect time to check your turtle all over for any sign of injury or disease. If you see anything out of the ordinary, take your turtle to the veterinarian to have it checked out right away. Common signs of turtle illness include swollen eyelids or ears, other swellings on the body, skin abnormalities, and discolored or fuzzy patches on the shell that may indicate shell rot., Once your turtle is clean, you can rinse your newly shiny pet by pouring de-chlorinated water over it from a jug or pitcher before returning it to its enclosure.

, To avoid the risk of salmonella contamination, you should not pour your turtle's bathwater down the sink. Flush it down the toilet, instead, and be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water when you are done.

Some experts recommend bathing them every day when the weather is warm., Tortoises can harbor salmonella bacteria, which can make humans very ill, so it is important that you not bathe your turtle in the sink or bathtub.Salmonella is very resistant to disinfectants, so the best course of action is to buy or find a special tub for bathing your turtle, and use it only for that purpose.A plastic bucket, wash tub, or kitty litter pan makes an ideal tortoise bath; just make sure it's large enough to accommodate your tortoise.

, To bathe your tortoise, you just need a tub, a toothbrush, and a jug or pitcher of lukewarm water. You should not use any kind of soap or shampoo on your turtle, unless it was specifically recommended by your vet., The water should be room temperature. Add the water slowly until it is the depth of the tortoise's chin, or a bit shallower. Don't add more water than this, as most tortoises can't swim and could drown if their head is below water.It can also be helpful to rest the bowl on a book, so that your create a ""deep"" and a ""shallow"" end in the water. Place the chelonian with his head at the shallow end. This enables his anus to be below the water line, which is great because they drink through their anus so it's a great way of making sure he is well hydrated.


Adding the water after the tortoise is in the tub ensures that you will not accidentally make the water too deep.

, Just let your tortoise be in the water for 10 to 20 minutes. During this time the tortoise will drink water, and rehydrate further by absorbing water through its tail. It will also likely pass waste at this time.Usually it is sufficient to just let your tortoise soak and skip to the rinsing step, but once a week or so, you should give the tortoise a good scrub.

, Be sure to lift the tortoise out of the water while you pour the water out, to make sure it doesn't fall.

, Use a toothbrush and gently scrub the entire shell, paying special attention to any areas of buildup. Then scrub the tortoise's legs, tail, and neck, but be careful with these areas as they are more sensitive.

Common signs of illness include swollen eyelids or ears, other swellings on the body, skin abnormalities, and discolored or fuzzy patches on the shell that may indicate shell rot., Rinse your tortoise thoroughly using lukewarm water from your pitcher. Then place the tortoise on a towel, and wrap it up and over the tortoise to thoroughly blot the tortoise dry. You can then return your shiny, clean tortoise back to its enclosure., To avoid the risk of salmonella contamination, you should not pour soiled tortoise-water down the sink.

, You will need another container, like a cup or small watering can, for rinsing the tortoise. You should also have a soft-bristle toothbrush or nail brush and a roll of paper towels on hand., Put just enough clean, warm (not hot) water into the bottom of the pan that the water level will reach the bottom of your tortoise’s shell. Do not add any soaps, detergents, or other products to the water., Protect your tortoise by making sure your hands are clean before handling the tortoise and the bathing supplies., Gently lower the tortoise into the water. Allow your tortoise to take a few minutes to get used to being in the water. Do not hold the tortoise down forcefully., Soaking in warm water will not only hydrate your tortoise’s skin, but will also encourage the tortoise to drink and eliminate waste.Do not leave your tortoise unattended in the water. A tortoise can easily become overturned and drown, even in a small amount of water.

, Use a separate container to gently rinse your tortoise’s shell, head, and limbs. This can help rinse away dirt and hydrate the parts of the tortoise that are not submerged in the bathing pan. Allow the water to trickle through your fingers, or use a watering can to create a gentle shower., Once you have softened any stubborn dirt by sprinkling the shell with water, scrub off any remaining dirt with a soft brush. Pour a little more water over the shell to rinse away any dirt you dislodge with the brush.Be sure to give special attention to the spaces between the scutes (plate-like sections of the shell) and the underside of the carapace (upper shell), especially around the limbs, tail, and head. Dirt tends to build up in these areas.
Gently scrub the plastron (lower shell) as well as the upper shell.

, Be extra gentle while scrubbing these parts of the tortoise, especially in areas that are not densely covered in scales., Examine your tortoise for injuries, shell damage, signs of mites, or signs of Stomatitis, a common mouth infection in tortoises. If you discover any signs of disease or injury, take your tortoise to the vet.Look for red spots or cracks around the tortoise’s beak and mouth. These may be signs of stomatitis or mouth rot.
Examine the shell for cracks, discolorations, or lesions.
Check the skin and scales for wounds or blisters.
Check the folds in the tortoise’s skin around the head and limbs for mites, which will look like small red or black dots. These can be gently brushed off with your soft-bristle brush and rinsed away with water., When you are done bathing your tortoise, gently and thoroughly dry the tortoise’s head, limbs and shell with a paper towel before returning it to its habitat.Make sure the tortoise is thoroughly dry, to prevent potential issues with shell rot caused by excessive humidity.
Dispose of any paper towels immediately in a closed garbage container in order to prevent the spread of disease or parasites.

, You may wish to pour the used bath water into your toilet for sanitary reasons. Wash the bath container with mild detergent and hot water, and rinse it thoroughly.

, Tortoises can spread salmonella and other diseases. Always wash your hands thoroughly after bathing or handling your tortoise."
"
Get a large aquarium.,
Place a water heater in the tank.,
Install a UVB light and a basking light.,
Place a metal screen over the top of the tank.,
Provide a land area where your turtle can get completely out of the water.,
Keep the water the right depth.,
Use a filter to reduce how often you need to change the water.,
Aerate the water with an air pump or air stone.",How to Take Care of Baby Water Turtles1," You’ll want a rectangular or square glass aquarium that is the right sized for your turtle when full grown, which will mean plenty of room for swimming, as well as space for a rock or shelf where the turtle can get all the way out of the water.The bigger the tank the better, but be sure to meet the minimum size requirements:30 gallons minimum for turtles between 4 and 6 inches in length
55 gallons for turtles between 6 and 8 inches
75-125 gallons for adults over 8 inches
Minimum length: 3-4 times the length of the turtle
Minimum width: 2 times the turtle’s length
Minimum height: 1.5-2 times the length of the turtle, plus 8-12 inches above the highest spot it can reach in the tank;
, Turtle’s cannot regulate their own body temperature, so you will need to keep their water at the appropriate temperature for them by installing a water heater. Most baby turtles will need water between 78° and 82° F, though you should check here to find the care sheet for your turtle type.Make sure the heater covering is plastic or metal, not glass, which turtles may break.
Consider using two heaters to heat the water more uniformly and in case one malfunctions.
Check the water temperature regularly with a thermometer.
Be sure the heater is powerful enough:

75 watts for a 20 gallon tank
150 watts for 40 gallons
250 watts for 65 gallons
300 watts for 75 gallons.



, Turtle’s need UVB light to synthesize vitamin D. They need basking lights for warmth because they are cold blooded, meaning they cannot regulate their own temperature.You will need to install artificial lights to provide UVB (ultraviolet light B) as well as warmth.UVB Lamps – Come in compact and tubular. Use the 2.5% or 5% UVB lamp – aka Tropical UVB or Swamp UVB lamps. Desert lamps are too powerful. Place the lamp 12 inches from the water for a 2.5% lamp and 18 inches for a 5% lamp.
Basking light – These are normal incandescent or halogen bulbs. The type of lamp does not matter so much as making sure it is the right distance to heat the basking area properly. For baby turtles, the center of the basking area should be close to 95° F, with the edges cooler. Use a thermometer to be sure the temperature is correct.
Timer – You will need to turn off the lights 12 hours a day to mimic the natural cycle of light and day. Consider getting a light timer to do this for you.
WARNING: Never look directly into the turtle light, as this can damage your eyes. Place it at an angle such that the bulb is not visible to people sitting in the room.

, The screen will protect your turtles from things falling into the tank. It is very important, since UVB bulbs will sometimes explode, particularly if splashed with water, and the glass can hurt your turtle. Make sure the screen is metal, since UVB light cannot penetrate glass or plastic.

, This can be a log, rock, or floating turtle dock. Make sure there is a slope so your turtle can crawl out of the water onto it, and make sure it is big enough:The land area should take up about 25% of the surface area of the tank.
It should be 1.5 times the length of the turtle and it should be solid enough to not to break.
The top of the tank should be 10-12 inches above the land to prevent your turtle from escaping.

, For baby turtles, the water in the tank should be at least one inch deeper than the width of your turtle’s shell. This will allow them to swim freely.As your turtle grows, you can provide deeper water.

, Turtles are messier than fish; they pee and poop a lot. Without a water filter, you’ll need to change your turtle’s water daily to avoid disease. With a filter, you’ll still need to change some of the water every 2-5 days and replace all the water every 10-14 days.There are special turtle tank filters, but you can also use a fish tank filter so long as you make sure to get one that is rated for 3 to 4 times the volume of your tank. Otherwise, it won’t be able to keep up with your turtle’s mess.There are several types of filter:An internal aquarium filter – These filters, which usually attach to the side of the tank via suction cups, are too small to be the primary filter for tanks over 20 gallons. However, you can use them in larger tanks to help circulate the water.
A canister filter – The best filters for turtle tanks, they usually mount under the tank and provide great filtration, often using an ultraviolet light sterilizer to kill bacteria and algae. Again, you’ll want to get one rated for 3 to 4 times the volume of your tank. Check here for a review of the most common filters.
Hang-on-back (HOB) filters – These filters are designed to be set close to the water in a fish tank. Because water is lower in a turtle tank than a fish tank, you will need a filter cutout – i.e. a place where the glass is cut lower than the rest of the top of the tank – for these filters to function properly in a turtle tank. Again, you’ll need one rated for 3 to 4 times the volume of your tank.
Under gravel filters (UGFs) – Reverse flow UGFs pump water up through the gravel at the bottom of the tank, allowing bacteria in the gravel to help filter it. For maximum effectiveness, they should be used with a gravel substrate of 2 inches of rounded pea gravel. Unfortunately, they will not filter large food particles, meaning these must be netted out regularly, and cleaning them is more difficult since they are under the gravel., Keeping your water oxygenated will discourage the growth of the anaerobic bacteria that make the tank dirty and endanger your little turtle’s health."
"
Consider using artificial plants.,
Include a substrate if you are going to have live plants.,
Add plants to the aquarium.,
Create a good environment for your plants.",How to Take Care of Baby Water Turtles2," While plants do provide some benefits like removing nitrates from the water, they are mostly decorative. With artificial plants, you will not have to worry about your turtle eating them or the plant dying.

, The substrate is the sand, gravel, or soil that covers the bottom of the tank. It is not necessary, and indeed will make cleaning the tank much harder. A simple painted bottom will do. However, if you are going to add rooted plants or want a more natural look, consider these substrates:Fine sand – Use fine grained sand, like that for children’s sand boxes. It is great for softshell turtles that like to dig in it. However, many turtle owners find it hard to clean.
Aquarium gravel – A poor plant substrate, its use is mostly ornamental. Be sure to use gravel that is large enough that your turtle can’t eat it.
Fluorite – A porous clay gravel, fluorite is the best choice if you are going to add rooted plants to your tank. It will make the water muddy when you first add it. Several days of filtering should clear the water.

, Plants are not necessary, but some feel that a more natural environment makes for less stress on your baby turtle. Also, aquatic plants will help keep your tank clean by consuming pollutants and competing for the carbon dioxide that algae needs to grow. Just make sure you pick the right plants to match your turtle species:Anacharis – Grows well in low light and inhibits algae growth. Good for mud/musk turtles. Plant-eating aquatic turtles like sliders, cooters, and painted turtles will destroy it.
Java Fern – A hardy, low-light plant with tough leaves that turtles usually will not eat.
Java Moss – A hardy, low-light moss that turtles usually don’t eat.
Hornwort – A fine-leafed branching plant that grows in floating mats. It tolerates low light and grows quickly enough to survive alongside sliders, cooters, and painted turtles, though they will eat some of it.
Red Ludwigia – A tough plant that turtles don’t eat, though they may uproot it from the substrate where it is planted. Requires additional light (2 watts/gallon). Good for small turtles like mud, musk, and painted.
Anubias species – They are tough, low-light plants that turtles will not eat.
Cryptocoryne species – These plants are low light tolerant and hardy, but must be planted in substrate and do not respond well to uprooting. They work best with smaller turtles in large enclosures.
Aponogeton ulvaceus – This plant tolerates low life, is durable, and will not be eaten by turtles. It can grow in plain gravel substrate.

, Plants need nutrients, light, and (usually) a place to put down roots. To give your plants the best chance to thrive:If you use plants that need a substrate, try one of the clay gravels like laterite or fluorite. They provide plant nutrition with less mess.
Add light or choose low-light plants. Most plants need 2-3 watts per gallon of water in the tank, while most aquarium lights provide on 1 watt. You can add more artificial light, but don’t put your turtle tank in a window, as this will overheat the tank and promote algae growth.
If your plants do poorly, consider adding an aquatic plant fertilizer, which you can purchase at your pet store.

Feed your turtle daily.,
Be sure to put their food in the water.,
Consider feeding your baby turtle in a separate container of water.,
Offer a variety of foods to hatchlings.,
Expand the variety as your baby turtle grows.,
Be aware that newly hatched turtles may not eat for a week or more.,
Make sure the water in your tank is warm enough if your turtle is not eating after a few weeks.,
Leave your turtle alone to eat.",How to Take Care of Baby Water Turtles3," Baby turtles require lots of food to grow. Give them all the food they want and dispose of leftovers. They also take a lot of time to eat. Give them 30 minutes to several hours.

, Aquatic turtles must be in water to swallow., This will help keep their tank clean of food debris. If you feed your turtle in its tank, you will need to do your best to scoop out the food debris afterwards.Add just enough water to cover the turtle.
Use water from the tank so it is the same temperature and does not shock the turtle.
Give them 30 minutes to several hours to eat.
Pat the turtle dry when returning it to the main tank in order to remove any food debris.

, While turtle food contains all the necessary nutrients for your baby turtles, a well-balanced, varied diet is the best way to ensure your turtles are healthy.In addition, it may be hard to get your hatchling to eat at all, so provide variety until you find something he will eat. Foods appropriate for hatchlings include:Flake and pellet foods – You can find varieties specifically for baby turtles at your pet store. They have all the necessary vitamins and nutrients for your baby turtle.
Turtle sticks – Good for baby and adult turtles.
Live blackworms, crickets, and mealworms (especially good, as baby turtles are attracted to movement)

, Once your baby turtle is a few months old, you can expand the variety of his diet. Check here for the appropriate foods for your species of turtle. In addition to the turtle food and live insects above, appropriate foods typically include:Waxworms and small roaches
Small fish or shrimp
Cooked eggs with shells
Fruit (halved grapes, apple, melon, strawberries)
Vegetables (kale, spinach, romaine, but no iceberg lettuce or cabbage)

, They will live off the yolk from their eggs. Offer them food, but do not be overly worried if they do not eat.

, Turtles will not eat or digest their food if they are too cold. Use a water heater to bring the water to the correct temperature for your turtle., Many turtle will not eat if watched. If your turtle is not eating, leave it alone with its food."
"
Clean as you go.,
Clean or replace the filter media regularly.,
Change the water regularly.,
Test your water to make sure you are changing it often enough.,
Clean and disinfect the tank when you change out all the water.,
Gather the appropriate supplies for cleaning and disinfecting.,
Clean the tank thoroughly.",How to Take Care of Baby Water Turtles4," This will make for a healthier environment for your baby turtle and allow you to go longer between big cleans.Aquatic turtles have to eat in the water because they can’t produce saliva. Unfortunately, leftover food quickly decays and makes for a messy tank. Use a net to clean up any leftovers when your turtle is done.
Use a siphon-type aquarium vacuum to clean the substrate (i.e. the rocks or gravel at the bottom of the tank) every 4 or 5 days. Use a squeeze-bulb to start the siphon and put the hose end in a bucket below the tank. Gravity keep the water flowing from the tank to the bucket.
For added efficiency, you can use your siphoning as a partial water change. Just be sure you siphon off enough water (see below) and replace what you have removed.

, The media inside your filter is what strains out dirt, uneaten food, and poop. If it is a sponge, you’ll need to clean it weekly by rinsing it with water. Do not use soap. You can clean foam filters as well, or if you are using filter floss, polyfill stuffing, or charcoal replace it weekly. Filters are full of germs, so be sure to:Unplug your filter before working on it.
Work away from food and places where food is prepared.
Wear gloves or avoid cleaning your filter when you have cuts or scrapes on your hands.
Clean your arms and hands with soap and water after cleaning the filter.
Remove and wash any clothes that get splashed with filter water.

, Even if you have a filter, you’ll still need to change the water regularly to prevent the build-up of small particles and nitrates. Though you may need to change the water more frequently if you feel it is too dirty, here are some general guidelines:Small Tanks (30 gallons or less) – Change 20% of the water every 2 days. Replace all water every 10-12 days.
Medium to Large Tanks (30 gallons or more) – Change 50% of the water every 5 days. Replace all water every 12-14 days.
For high quality, high capacity external filters – Change 50% of the water every 7 days. Replace all water every 17-19 days.

, Especially in the early days, you’ll want to pay close attention to your turtle’s water to ensure it staying clean.A strong smell or change in water color means a full water change and tank cleaning are needed.
The water pH, which measures acidity/alkalinity, should be between 5.5 and 7. Acquire a pH testing kit at your pet store and test your water every 4 days for the first month or so to be sure you are maintaining the proper pH levels.

, You can push this to once every 45 days or so, so long as you add solutions that help to disinfect the water and are safe for your turtle (available at most pet stores). Otherwise, you’ll want to disinfect the tank more regularly to keep your turtle healthy.If you have living plants rooted in substrate, you will not be able to do a full cleaning. In this case, you will want to monitor the water quality more closely to be sure your turtle is healthy.

, You’ll want to set up your cleaning supplies in advance, and do it somewhere away from food preparation areas. Be sure to use a turtle-safe disinfectant from your pet store, or make your own from bleach, using ½ cup bleach to 1 gallon of water.Other supplies include:Sponges
Scrapers (like a putty knife)
Bowls for soapy water and for rinse water
Paper towels
Trash bags
A spray bottle or bowl of disinfectant solution and a bowl of rinse water.
A large receptacle for soaking artificial plants, rocks, and your turtle’s land area

, You will first need to remove your turtle and place him in a separate area. A bucket with enough water from his tank to cover him will work fine. You will then need to clean the tank, land area, substrate, and any other surfaces (i.e. the water heater). Use a tub or bathroom sink, not your kitchen sink, to avoid contamination.Unplug and remove all electrical devices: water heater, filter, lamp, etc.
Clean the surfaces of underwater electrical devices with soapy water and disinfectant spray. Rinse thoroughly.
Remove the land feature. Clean it with soap and water and let it soak in disinfectant for 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly afterwards.
Remove the substrate. Clean it in soapy water and let it soak in disinfectant for 10 minutes. Rinse thoroughly afterwards.
Clean the tank with soapy water and a sponge. Fill with disinfectant (1 part bleach to 9 parts water) and let it sit for 10 minutes. Empty and rinse thoroughly.
Replace everything in the tank. Make sure the water is at the correct temperature before returning your turtle to his tank.
Be sure to wear gloves or to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards to avoid contracting diseases like salmonella.

Take your gerbil to the vet.,
Feed your gerbil if they cannot feed themselves.,
Know that there is no treatment.",How to Help a Gerbil Recover After Stroke1," If your gerbil has a stroke, you should take them to the vet to get checked out. While many gerbils make a full or almost full recovery after a stroke, it is a good idea to get your gerbil seen to make sure they are okay.Taking your gerbil to the vet can help ensure there are no related problems and that your gerbil is getting the proper nutrition during the recovery.;
, You may need to feed your gerbil and help them get water if they cannot feed themselves. Give the gerbil soft food that they can eat with their tongue since they may not be able to stand and hold seeds or other foods in their paws. Put the food on a spoon and let your gerbil lick it off. If your gerbil can’t drink water, you can give them water from an eye dropper.Applesauce, sugar-free baby food, lukewarm cooked oatmeal, or mashed up soft cooked vegetables are good foods for your gerbil to eat.
If you have to, lower the water bottle so your gerbil can reach it more easily.

, There is no treatment for strokes in gerbils. Gerbils are known to recovery well from strokes, so many gerbils will make a full recovery or only have a slight disability from the paralysis. Ensuring comfort and rest right after the stroke is the most important thing you can do for your gerbil.Additionally, it is important that you make sure that your gerbil gets enough food and water until they can feed themselves again.

Any type of tortoise you choose will make a wonderful pet for your family, once you commit to caring for this particular species. Some of the more common species of tortoises include the Sulcata, Leopard, Redfoot, Yellowfoot, Greek, Russian, Hermanns, and Indian Star. Here are some things you need to know about choosing a tortoise:Though the tortoise you bring home may be small and cute initially, some species of tortoises can grow over two feet in length after 5-10 years of care. If you're really committed to having one for a long time, try not to get caught in their appearance, and consider what species best suit your lifestyle, financial income, surroundings and whether or not you're able to provide the required care of that specific species.;
, It's important to purchase your tortoise from a seller that you respect, who has a history of making a successful sale and who can promise that you have been given the tortoise under healthy conditions. Avoid getting your creature at a reptile show, because this may make it likely that you won't be able to get in touch with the seller again after buying a tortoise, so there's no way he or she can check up on how you're caring for your tortoise.


Find a seller who prides themself in customer service, whether you are going to a pet store or finding your creature online. If your seller says that he or she will be easy to contact after the sale is made, then it's more likely that you are making a solid transaction.
There are some legal restrictions on keeping or breeding some tortoises, especially Mediterranean breeds. If this is the case for the tortoise you want, then make sure the seller has a certificate from C.I.T.E.S. (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species)., If you're only around to take care of your tortoise for a year or two before you want to jump ship, then it may not be the ideal pet for you. Tortoises can live between 30~100 years, which means that your lovely pet may live longer than you. Don't let this scare you, though; just make sure you get a pet tortoise when you live in a stable environment and know you can find someone to take care of your tortoise if you have to move or leave.You don't have to be settled in one place for 50 years, but you should be prepared for many years of care for the new addition to your home.

, The type of food your tortoise eats will largely depend on the species of tortoise you've chosen. It's important to ask the source where you got the tortoise what you should make a part of its staple diet. In general, though, most tortoises eat mixed leafy greens, such as a typical ""spring mix"" you can find at any grocery store. When tortoises are babies, they need to eat softer or crispier foods, because their tiny jaws will find it hard to tear apart harder foods. Tortoises can eat most vegetables, such as broccoli, green beans, or kale, especially if you mix them in with the mixed greens, but it's important to know what your type of tortoise needs.


Your tortoise may need supplements to make sure that he or she grows healthy and strong. The supplements must have Calcium and a some Vitamin A, Vitamin D3 should be offered too if the tortoise is kept indoors without UV light.
Some tortoises prefer dandelion leaves, celery, lettuce, and sometimes fruit.

, It's important that your tortoise has enough water to stay hydrated and healthy. You can just pour some water in a shallow tray or saucer and sink it into the floor of the enclosure so that your tortoise can't flip it over. It should be shallow enough so that your tortoise can easily stand in it and can place its head in the water without being completely submerged.Replace the water daily. Your tortoise should have its own bowl of water, whether it is outdoors or indoors.

, Never drop a tortoise; if their shell breaks, they might die from an infection. Though you may be dying to hold your pet tortoise, you should try to take it easy on holding it, or letting others hold it. This can be stressful for your favorite creature.


If there are small children around, explain to them that it would be better if they would admire it through observation and contact is only necessary during care.

, Tortoises need to stay hydrated, especially when they are young. When you first bring home your tortoise, you should soak it in water a few times a week, so it feels fully hydrated, making sure to keep its head above water. Usually, after a tortoise is good and soaked, The tortoise will almost immediately begin to drink it. This will be a sign that everything is running smoothly. Remember that more isn't always more when it comes to soaking your tortoise. Every other day at most should be just fine.

, Ideally, you should provide some outdoor shelter for your tortoise. Some people believe that it's inhumane to care for a tortoise only indoors. If you're really committed to having one, you should be prepared to have some outdoor shelter for it, unless it's a smaller tortoise or a variety that is really able to just stay indoors. If you're committed to having an indoor tortoise only, then you should do your research and pick a species that can handle this.You can also mix and match, keeping your tortoise indoors for the colder months and letting it roam outdoors during the warmer months. You should be prepared for both types of housing to keep it healthy and happy.
See the sections below for learning the proper care for your tortoise, whether it is an outdoor or an indoor creature.

, If you want to house your tortoise indoors, then you have to think about what kind of an enclosure you want, whether it's a glass aquarium or a terrarium. Just keep in mind that you should have at least 3 square feet available for a baby tortoise. A 10–20 gallon (37.9–75.7 L) tank can work for a baby, but it will outgrow it pretty soon, and you'll need to make sure your creature has enough room to grow.


You can use glass, but tortoises get frustrated because they try to walk through the glass. You can tape paper to the outside of the tank to keep them from getting confused.
You can also use a plastic sweater box or a cement mixing tub for a baby tortoise. They have the bonus of having foggy sides that won't frustrate tortoises as much as glass.
The enclosure should be high enough so that the tortoise won't escape.

, If your tortoise is outdoors, then you don't need to worry about him or her having enough light. But if your favorite creature is indoors, then you'll need to make sure your tortoise gets enough light, and therefore Vitamin D, to be healthy. Here are some things to consider as you find proper lighting for your tortoise:You should either use a desk lamp, which should have at least 100W of power for heating, and another UV light for your tortoise to bask in, or even a single mercury-vapor lamp to provide your critter with both heat and UV light.
The lamp's temperature should be between 30–35 °C (86–95 °F), but this changes, depending on the species.
Make sure you position the lamp correctly so your tortoise is able to soak up the heat and cool down at separate parts of their enclosure.
Not only is providing your tortoise with heat and UV light essential to his or her health, but it's also helpful for your creature's happiness. They actually love basking in the light!

, The substrate will cover the floor of your tortoise's environment and will need to have proper composition to ensure the health and safety of your tortoise. The most important thing, whether your tortoise is outdoors or indoors, is to make sure that it is not overly moist, or your tortoise will be prone to infection if they get cuts or unhealed skin from over shedding. The substrate depends on the species of tortoise you have. Here are some things to consider:If your creature needs mid to high humidity, then your substrate needs to be able to hold moisture well. It should include things like coconut coir, sphagnum moss, or peat moss, in this case.
If your creature needs a more dry climate, then the substrate should include dry coconut coir, grass clippings.
Avoid using sand in the substrate, because tortoises may eat it and cause great harm to themselves.
When your tortoise is outdoors, the substrate doesn't matter as much, as the natural environment should be suitable. You can add some peat moss to the environment, for additional stimulation. Just make sure that anything you add to the substrate is free of chemicals or pesticides.

, Having your tortoise outdoors during normal temperatures is ideal for your creature. However, you can't just let your tortoise do whatever it wants in your yard. Instead, you'll need to have an escape-proof barrier so that the tortoise remains in the perimeter. You can use concrete bricks that are mortared together or painted or sealed wood walls.


Your tortoise might try to burrow under or dig in to the corners of their enclosure, so it should be nice and secure. If your tortoise burrows, you can add a wire mesh below the surface of the barrier to keep your tortoise safe.
Tortoises really don't do well in the cold, so unless they're kept indoors the whole time, you'll have to prepare to temporarily bring your tortoise indoors if where you live can get below 60°F/15°C during its coldest months. If you live in a very hot climate and want to keep the tortoise outside, this will be easier, but always have shade available especially over moistened areas or water source(s).

, You'll need some kind of shelter for your tortoise to make it feel safe, and to provide some shelter from the heat, the rain, or other elements that may be in the way. You want to keep your tortoise nice and warm and to keep it from overheating as well. Ideally, you should make a hut for your creature, which will be where the tortoise sleeps and weathers the climates. You can make it out of wood and cover it with a few inches of soil, as well as a heating element for the cold weather, if needed.


First, just dig a large hole. You can place a plywood barrier inside the floor.
Add a top to the hide box to shelter your tortoise.
Cover the shelter with dirt and soil.

, You should keep an adequate amount of plants around for your outdoor tortoise so that he or she can eat and feel secure throughout the day. Look into the diet of your tortoise to see which plants are and are not toxic. In general, many tortoises will eat broadleaf weeds such as dandelions, any grasses, or clover.


Live plants can also help control Ammonia and Nitrates in the soil, which reduces the frequency of substrate changes in indoor enclosures.

, Your tortoise should have an exciting environment to keep it active and busy. You can add some clump grasses to help your tortoise burrow, as well as to allow for some shade. You can add a few boulders to give your creature some privacy, as long as they aren't too steep. You can also add some small trees for shade and shelter and just for the environment to look nice.

, If you're taking care of your tortoise outdoors, then you will have to take precautions to make sure it is safe from other predators, such as cats. If you have a dog, never allow it to be near the tortoise; even the gentlest dogs have been shown to attack tortoises without warning. Though it's impossible to keep your tortoise completely safe from birds, foxes, or other predatory creatures, try to keep it as protected as you can by having lots of shelter and places for your tortoise to hide, keeping its enclosure intact, and keeping an eye on the outside environment.Some people recommend that you line a juvenile tortoise's home with wire mesh to protect it from pesky creatures.

, Many people think that something is wrong with a tortoise's eyes if it begins to keep them shut. In fact, this is rarely serious. If a tortoise keeps its eyes shut, soak it in a bit of water and cover up its shelter a bit to make the environment more moist if housed indoors. If this is a chronic problem, it could be a sign of an infection, but it's usually external, try applying a water+salt solution into its eyes 1-2 times daily until they're able to open them, then feed them small amounts of Spinach as a source of Vitamin A once every other day, the most common causes are Vitamin A deficiency and dehydration. If symptoms persist for over a week with home treatment, visit a veterinarian who specialises in reptiles.

, Though it's normal for baby tortoises to sleep for most of the day, if your critter is just completely inactive, then you have to start troubleshooting to locate the source of the problem. Here are some reasons why your creature may not be so active:


The most common reason is that your tortoise is too cold. Make sure that its enclosure is in a warm place relative to their environment.
If your tortoise is indoors, then make sure he or she get enough light in general. Brighter lights help keep it active.
Make sure your baby tortoise is getting a regular soaking throughout the day. One reason your tortoise may be inactive is because they might not be properly hydrated.
Try to minimalize handling, as stress could cause inactivity.
Make sure your tortoise is getting a balanced diet. Check to see that your mix of green veggies, and/or supplements is providing everything your tortoise needs.

, If your tortoise develops a soft shell, then it's likely because they're not getting enough light and Calcium. This is a rare condition for outdoor tortoises, but it can happen to indoor tortoises because it can be harder for them to have access to a steady light source. If your indoor tortoise has a soft shell, make sure that he or she is at least 8-10"" from the UV light source, and that the bulb is changed after at least 9 to 12 months to remain fresh and active.

Provide your gerbil with a warm spot in the cage.,
Place extra nesting materials in the cage.,
Give your gerbil a stress-free environment to recover.",How to Help a Gerbil Recover After Stroke2," Gerbils who suffer a stroke mostly need care as they recover. The most important thing is to help keep them comfortable. To help with this, provide the gerbil with a warm spot in the corner of their cage. This helps your gerbil feel secure and warm as they rest and recover.Try placing a towel over part of the cage, keeping the room warm, or giving plenty of material in the cage so the gerbil can stay warm.

, Another thing you can do is to give the gerbil some extra material so they can make a warm nest in the cage. You might want to give them a wood nest box or a toilet paper roll to give them a hiding place.The hiding place helps give them a place to go so they can feel secure and safe from perceived predators or stressors.

, Putting your gerbil in a stress-free environment can help speed their recovery. Gerbils can get startled and upset easily if there are too many stressors around them. After a stroke, move your gerbil’s cage to a quiet, low-traffic room to help reduce loud noises that may startle them.You may also consider keeping the room dark or putting a towel over one part of the tank so that the gerbil can go to rest in a dark, quiet area.

Look for paralysis.,
Identify the common age for strokes in gerbils.,
Know that gerbils can recover from strokes.",How to Help a Gerbil Recover After Stroke3," The most common sign of stroke is paralysis in your gerbil. This generally occurs along one side. The gerbil may not be able to use their paws, or their eyes or parts of their face may droop.The gerbil may have trouble feeding themselves or moving like they used to.

, Most strokes occur in gerbils when they are elderly, usually two years or older. Sometimes, younger gerbils who have other related conditions or health problems can have strokes, but this is uncommon., Elderly gerbils can recover from strokes with some minor nursing care. While they may have some paralysis, many times the gerbil will make a full recovery. Making sure the gerbil gets enough rest, along with food and water, can help ensure a full recovery.Gerbils who have experienced a stroke may be at a higher risk for strokes in the future. Sometimes, gerbils will have multiple strokes that eventually leads to death. However, with proper care and love for your gerbil, you can increase the chances of recovery after multiple strokes. A gerbil with a minor disability or paralysis from multiple strokes can still live a happy life.

Be honest, and pose the question.,
Analyze the emotionalism in the words they use.,
Understand that it could be both.",How to Distinguish Between a Friend and a Lover1," Do you want to know whether your friend has a romantic interest in you? Go ahead, and just ask. This is the easiest way to find out. When you get your answer there can be no confusion.A good movie line is always ""What am I to you?"" It may feel cheesy, but the best thing is just going with it. If they don't give you a straight answer and you stay with them, then it's probably because you don't know what you want either. A lover will just know. They won't be unsure.The bottom line: If they like you as more than a friend, when you pose the question, they will make that clear, either through words or body language. If they get really uncomfortable, try to leave, or tell you they don’t feel the same way, accept that they probably have you in the friend zone.;
, Do they use the word date? Do they use words that connote affection and emotion? If they are trying to forge intimacy with you using words – if they want to know your every secret – they are probably a lover.


""I love you.” It’s obvious, but it’s also true. Those are the magical words that indicate there’s no way you’re just a friend. That’s especially true if they say it first.
Do you find yourself talking about what the future might be like with that person? Do either one of you ever bring up the future? If so – you’re probably thinking about being lovers. Also, people who are lovers will sound more flustered or stressed. Men may raise the pitch of their voice, and women may lower theirs.Has he hinted that you’re just friends? This is where you might get a hint from him if you've accidentally overdone it. You’ve asked him to hang out, but he always brings other friends into the equation, for example. If he’s always pushing you away from one-on-one intimacy, he might be hinting that he thinks of you as a friend.

, Or a different answer at different stages of your life. The best lovers start out as friends.


Sometimes it may happen that a good friend becomes a lover and can become a very good life partner also. But, it's very important that a good lover should be a good friend first.
It might be more fruitful to ask yourself why the distinction even matters. While society has categories for varying levels of emotional/physical intimacy, they are just that: categories. Those categories can easily change or not apply to everyone.

You can ask them about the advantages of having a pet turtle, as well as the challenges. If you don't know anyone with a red slider, go to the pet store and speak to employees that are familiar with the turtles. Better yet, spend a little time interacting with a red-eared slider at the store. Make sure you're aware of what goes into caring for a turtle.;
, The average lifespan is around 20 - 30 years, with some sliders living even longer than this. Be sure your future lifestyle can adapt to include a long term turtle companion. If you're simply getting a turtle so your child can have a pet, realize that the turtle will be your pet for a long time.

, Just like any living creature, red-eared sliders start out small but grow in size as they mature. A fully grown slider needs a tank with a usable floor space at least four times the area of the adult's hard shell, so take this into account when purchasing a young turtle.


If you are getting more than one turtle, be sure you have enough tanks to separate the turtles as necessary. Male red-eared sliders tend to pester the females. This can be so extreme that the females stop eating. For this reason males and females are best kept separately.

, This includes such things as electricity to heat the aquarium, a thermostat to monitor water temperature, water pumps for aeration, a water filter designed to cope with turtle waste, and last but not least food. Even though the price of the turtle is low, they are not necessarily a cheap pet to keep.


If you're concerned about the expense of a red-eared slider, it may help to create a rough estimate of the ongoing costs before you buy the turtle. This may help you decide if you're willing to invest in the pet.

, Be aware that the turtle may harbor salmonella and not be ill itself, while still posing a risk of infection to people. The only safe way of keeping a turtle is to assume he carries salmonella and to exercise scrupulous personal hygiene before and after handling. Hand washing is essential.


Because of the risk of salmonella infection, you need to have a separate set of utensils for anything related to the turtle, which are kept washed and disinfected away from other household items.

, Red-eared sliders are not naturally sociable creatures. Wild-caught turtles can be snappy and aggressive. While some captive bred animals may learn to tolerate handling, don't assume your pet turtle will be overly friendly.

, One guide suggests having 10 gallons of capacity per inch of turtle length, plus an additional 15 percent space for a basking area. For the first year, you can get by with a 50 gallon tank for a baby, but after that you need at least 120 gallons.Save money by getting a tank large enough to begin with. Take into account:


Water depth: Turtles love to dive and chase food, so make sure the water is plenty deep enough to allow this.
Space: Turtles are territorial so make sure they have plenty of space to keep away from one another, or you may need to separate them into individual tanks.
Waste: Turtle waste is more solid than fish waste. This needs to be kept well diluted by providing a large volume of water, and /or the use of filter system designed for turtles.

, The ideal container is a large glass aquarium but these can be expensive. A cheaper alternative is a stock tank. A 100 gallon stock tank can be purchased relatively inexpensively. Avoid purchasing acrylic tanks, which are cheaper, but easily scratched by turtle claws.If you live in a warm climate and have a suitable backyard, you can dig out a pond and use a liner to provide a suitable home for a slider. While this will provide a more natural environment for your turtle, you will have less control over environmental conditions and may need to bring your turtle inside during inclement weather.

, The filter keep help prevent bacteria from flourishing in your slider's tank. You don't necessarily have to buy a filter system. You can change the water regularly, which is a highly labor intensive task, or use a filter system designed for turtles. There are different types of filter, depending on your current needs and budget:


Under-gravel filter: This needs a large surface area. It's only useful where you have one or two turtles. If it's air pump powered, it will only be useful for small turtles or hatchlings. Use a powerhead if using the filter with turtles older than hatchlings.
Internal canister filter: This filter sits inside the tank. The larger the better. This can be both affordable and effective. Look for one that allows for easy cleaning, such as the foam type.
External canister filter: This one sits outside of the tank. They tend to be expensive, but they are excellent at filtering, which reduces the number of times you need to change water. One canister filter recommended by many turtle owners is the Rena Filstar Xp3 or Xp4.

, Decorations can add diversity and interest to your turtle's habitat. Substrate, the material that lines the bottom of the tank, offers a way for the turtle to move between water and basking rocks with ease. River rocks provide a space for your turtle to bask. You could also make a basking spot from a plexiglass shelf glued to the side of the tank. Check that the glue is non-toxic.Avoid fish tank gravel as it presents a health risk––it could fatally block your turtle's intestines if swallowed. Also, carefully consider using water plants. While they can make the tank look nice and help with filtration, your turtle may be tempted to eat them. If you notice this happening, remove the plants and wash the tank.
Place a well-fitting screen over the top of the tank to prevent a daredevil escape and to catch anything accidentally dropped from above.

, The water should be 80 - 82 degrees Fahrenheit ( 26.5 - 27.5 Celsius) for a hatchling or a sick turtle, and 77 - 80 degrees F (25.5 - 26.5 C) for a healthy turtle over a year old. The basking (dry land) area should be 10 degrees F (6 degrees C ) warmer than the water to entice the turtle to warm up by basking. The air temperature in the tank needs to be around 75 - 82 degrees Fahrenheit (24 - 28 degrees Celsius)., Turtles rely on UVA and UVB lights for vitamins, as well as a heat light. UV light does not travel through glass, so it is very important that you get a 5% or more UV lamp. The bulbs should be replaced about every 6 months. The heat light keeps the basking area temperature 10 degrees higher than your water temperature.Your turtle shouldn't be able to reach the lighting, since the bulbs can burn. Screw the lights tightly out of the way of the turtle. Also, never leave a glass or plastic tank in full sunlight as it will quickly overheat.

, Never take a turtle from the wild. Not only is this cruel and unfair to the turtle, it is also illegal in most states. The kindest thing you can do is to get an adult turtle that is no longer wanted, and there are a lot of abandoned turtles that need homes.Check out availability at adoption, rehoming or turtle rescue organizations. You can also try reputable breeders to get your turtle.Beware of pet stores that keep turtles in poor conditions. A number of turtles are ill before you buy them. Look around and take note of the turtle's behavior, as well as the conditions the turtles are kept in. The water in the tank should not smell. If it does this is a sign the turtles have not been cleaned out regularly and are more likely to become sick.

, Your turtle will probably be a little shy when you bring it home. It may take a few days before your turtle feels safe enough to venture forth from the shelter of its shell.Leave it in peace to settle down and wait for it to feel more confident.

, You will not be able to determine the sex until a turtle is a mature adult, from 2 to 4 years old. Males will have longer nails and tails than females. Females will also be larger in general., A proper diet for red-eared turtles (and similar aquatic turtle species) should have the following proportions: vegetables and water plants 50 percent, commercial foods 25 percent, and live protein 25 percent. Red eared turtles are happy to store-bought food turtle food, as well as food you've foraged for them.


Good vegetable choices include: dandelions (the ones in your yard are good if you don't use pesticides), carrot tops, mustard greens, romaine lettuce, carrots, bell pepper, and squash.
The best greens are water plants like anacharis, water hyacinth, water lettuce, Frogbit, hornwort, and duckweed. While expensive in a pet store, these are easy to grow in a separate tank or pond, and they are cheap if you buy in bulk online.
Red eared turtles don't usually eat fruit in the wild, so avoid it except for an absolute treat. If giving a treat, bananas are a good choice.
For commercial food, look for something that has low protein and low fat. Dried shrimp are an absolute no-no! While turtles love the taste of dried shrimp, they offer no nutrients and turtles may refuse other foods for weeks.

, There are various conditions and diseases that can occur if the tank water is dirty, if the turtle's diet is poor or for other reasons. Some more common problems to watch for include:Eye infections: The eyes will appear closed, swollen, puffed up or discharging. You may see pieces of tissue coming off. Eye infections are caused by bacteria. The turtle should be seen by a vet and probably needs a topical antibiotic plus upgrading the tank's filtration system.

Soft shell: If your turtle's shell is softer than it's supposed to be, your slider may not be getting enough light from your overhead light. If this happens, the turtle's dock may be too small, the water may be too deep, or the turtle is too weak to get on the dock. If this happens, contact your vet or a pet store. It can also mean that it has metabolic bone disease.

Furry mouth and refusal to eat: Your turtle has a bacterial infection and should be seen by immediately by the vet for an antibiotic treatment.

Weak, wheezing, lethargic and holding head at an unusual angle: This may be a respiratory infection, such as pneumonia. Immediately take your turtle to the vet.

Wounds: Check the tank for sharp objects or a fighting mate. Remove the cause, treat the wound with povidone-iodine solution, and keep it clean. See your vet for more advice.

, You must supervise outside time, to prevent overheating. One approach is to get a kiddie pool, fill it with some water, and provide something for the turtle to bask on. Make sure to offer some shade for your turtle so it won't overheat.

, This is your pet and you'll form a bond, as with any pet, if you spend time together. Handle with care––not all turtles like being held or touched.

Some turtles love to have their shells gently scratched, just like a backscratch, or scratching behind a dog's ear. However, be careful, as not all of them enjoy it and may try to bite. Note that their shells have nerve endings in them and they can feel everything. Be gentle.

Consider the requests they make of you.,
Notice patterns in who helps whom.,
Pay attention to tone of voice and other vocal cues.,
Ask people you trust about your friendships.,
Think about how you feel during and after your time together.,
Tell them how you feel about something they did, and see how they react.,
Observe them over time.",How to Discern Friends from Foes As an Autistic Person," When people tell you to do something (e.g. singing, making disruptive noises, telling people certain things) then think. Is this the right place and time for it? Would it disturb people or make them unhappy?


If the request seems off to you, then say ""No, thank you. I'd rather not."" If they continue pressing the issue, continue saying that you don't want to.;
, Are you constantly rushing to your friend's aid? Does your friend do you favors and support you in return, or is it all one-sided? If your friend asks plenty of you without doing much in return, then (s)he is probably using you.


Actions are more honest than words. If a friend often says ""I'll make it up to you"" but never does, then you are dealing with someone who doesn't care that much about you.

, People often demonstrate sarcasm through their tone and expressions. Learn to discern when someone is being serious and supportive from when they're being sarcastic or poking fun at you.

, For example, if your mom has excellent judgment, then ask her what she thinks of your friends. If she says that something feels off, then listen to her. Outsiders may be able to notice unhealthy dynamics from a distance.

, Do you feel sad or dissatisfied with yourself? Do you tend to get stomachaches, headaches, or cramps? Do you often find yourself wishing that your friend behaved differently, or that you were somewhere else?


After spending time with a good friend, you should usually feel in a better mood than you were before. Sometimes you may feel tired or a little sad afterwards (e.g. after a long party or a disagreement), but not most of the time.

, A good friend cares about your feelings, and will listen to you and take steps not to do it again. A bully will tell you that your feelings are wrong or unimportant, and have plenty of excuses not to care about them.


Use the ""When you ____, I feel _____"" template. For example, ""When you tease me about my hair, I feel hurt.""

, People may be nice in the moment, without being reliably supportive in the long run. Try to get a sense of how people interact with you over time to figure out whether they're on your side or not. True friends will be supportive in the long haul, not just friendly on one or two occasions.

"
"
Study his or her level of eye contact.,
Pay attention to whether the person touches you and how he or she touches you.,
Determine whether their body language is open or closed to you.",How to Distinguish Between a Friend and a Lover2," This is very important. Always watch to see how the other person looks at you. If he or she is staring at you, he or she obviously finds you attractive and interesting, which is good. But if the person just glances at you, they could be showing they just want to be friends and that they aren't looking for anything else but friendship.Be aware that this is very individual to the person's personality type. For example, it's possible that a shy person likes you but doesn't make eye contact because they are nervous or even flirting. However, sustained eye contact is usually a good sign.
A person who is a friend won't look at you the same way as someone who is interested in you. A person who is interested in you basically can't take his/her eyes off you, and maybe even has a little smile on his/her face while he/she does that.
Look at them and have a small conversation. If the person really likes you, he or she will be looking at your lips. But if they finish the conversation and look away, they might think of you as just being a friend. If they stare at you for 2-3 seconds, you are an option; if they stare at you longer, they like you. Try looking into their eyes when they speak or moving yourself slightly closer to them. If they copy your movements, there's a chance they are interested in you.

, Lovers are more intimate than friends are, and the key way this is accomplished is through physical touch, even incidentally.How does the person hug you? A friend hugs you quickly and maybe talks to you while doing it. A lover hugs you for a little while, but maybe not too long because they may not want to be too obvious.
Also some might even put their hands in your hair (or play with their own). This is a way that women especially show a man they are interested.
A lover would always be a romantic, either touching/tapping you on the arm or flirting and giving out signs constantly in hope that you would listen. Lovers are closer, touching wise, sharing wise, and generally in spending time together. Lovers don't require as much personal space.
A friend may either try to cheer you up or maybe he or she will just sit with you and let you talk it out then watch a movie or two with you while eating your favorite food. A lover will do the same thing as a friend, most likely, but he or she might put an arm around you. You might think they're doing it just comfortingly, but they might mean it in a different way.

, There are many cues that will help you assess whether someone is interested in you or not.


Signs of open body language include their feet pointing toward you and not away, their body facing you or leaning toward you, not much space between you, strong eye contact, and the arms not folded across the chest. Open palms is another sign of positive or open body language.Signs of closed body language (indicating disinterest) include feet pointing away from you, body tilted away, lots of space between you, shifting eye contact, hands down, and folded arms."
"
Assess the amount of contact.,
Study how they act around other people when they are with you.,
Study the frequency of contact and whether you know his closest circle.,
See whether the relationship has a sexual component.,
Determine whether they - or you - seem jealous.,
Analyze the person's actions.,
Consider how much you – or they - are willing to give up and how much you know each other.,
Pay attention to whether you keep their focus.",How to Distinguish Between a Friend and a Lover3," Ask yourself, which of your friends is currently texting you? Which of your friends is currently calling you? Which of your friends is trying to keep steady conversation and progress a relationship with you? Who is learning about you?


If this sounds like the person you are asking about, it's because there is potential interest in you, and they want to keep exploring the possibility that you are the one.
If you see them infrequently and always with a group (and they don’t seem to be pushing for more frequent or individual contact), that’s a sign they like you as a friend.

, They will probably give away the friend or lover vibe when there are other people around.If being rude is in your friend’s personality, they may not hide that because they feel comfortable that you accept them for who they are no matter what they act like. They don’t go overboard trying to impress you. A lover may suddenly become nicer when you're around.
Some girls bite or twirl their hair, blush, giggle, and usually just try to get your attention. Boys are not that different. Guys usually try to act cool and do stuff like laugh harder, try to be the center of attention, and kind of act like jocks – if they are trying to impress you.

, He (or she) sees you several times a week, including weekends. You have met most or all his friends and coworkers. Everyone has heard about you. He makes plans for the future about you two, everything from buying a house, bed sheets, fried chicken, a ring, the brake job on the car. He talks as if you two will be together forever. He takes photos of you two and they are all around his house. He is very interested in what you do, think and where you go. He’s a lover.


How often do you think about this person? Can you ignore them or do you have to text back ASAP? Are they the first person you go to with big news (and are you)?
A lover is someone who puts you as their number one priority, and you are more likely to spend more time together and share the same lifestyle. Lovers spend most of their time with you. They are always making plans to see you.

, Don’t fall for the trap of assuming sex means you’re in the lover role. Guys who don't love you and have sex with you, do not bond with you. Women have a tendency to bond more with guys when they have sex. However, sexuality is a component of most relationships that move from friend to lover.


Another piece of this puzzle is the lumping together of love and sex- historically, this was not always the case. If you had one-time, unplanned, casual sex with a friend, just be friends. If you date and have repeated good, exciting, and emotional sex with someone, they are a lover.
Sexual chemistry is a strong hint that he likes you for more. A friend is someone with whom we have fun and can share our deepest secrets with if we're really close with them; they are someone we go to the movies with or watch a sports game together. A lover is often just the same, only with an added sexual layer to the relationship, and an overall greater intensity. You think about them more, you feel excited and nervous in their presence etc., Jealousy can mean that a person cares in a way a friend doesn’t. Friends aren’t jealous if they are real friends because they want you to be happy. However, if you are jealous it could also be a sign that the love is unrequited or not returned.When your friend acts rude to a new friend whom you like, or always seems to put down the person you like, it's possible that they like you. They might be jealous and worried that person is going to take you away from them.
Do you get annoyed or feel irritated when he/she checks another person out or says anything good about their attractiveness in front of you? If you do, he or she is probably a lover.

, Does this certain someone try to spend time with you alone? They may be a potential crush. But if they only speak to you with a bigger group of mutual friends, or are already taken, chances are, they're just a really good friend.


With a friend, they won't ever really act flustered around you. If you've ever been to a pool party and have that one friend who always sees you and gets flustered, that's one way to tell.
Consider whether he or she chases you. If you don't have to do anything to chase this person because they’re always around or trying to get you to hang out, they’re probably interested. If you have to make any effort, they are probably not that interested.
Consider whether your mood changes when you see this person. The feelings you get near a lover are not the same as a friend; they are closer and deeper. For example, you may feel happy around a certain friend, but with the person you love you feel as if your day has gone better by just having seen them.
When you are around them, do you get butterflies or do you just wave and chat? When you sit near or next to them at the lunch table do you think about holding hands or do you think about lunch? When you see them out of school do you blush and smile or do you calmly walk over to them and start a conversation? Do you find yourself dreaming about them when in or out of school? If so, you are in love with that person.

, True love is all about a continuous sacrifice. It never ends. Your friends may not always be around, especially when your tough times start to become their tough times. But your lover will, and you may have to sacrifice a job, your health, money, time, and other things for them.


A lover knows you more than you know yourself. A lover would argue with you but wouldn’t stay mad at you because they just care too much. A lover would know your past...all the wrongs you’ve done but he/she would look past it, and they wouldn’t use it against you.
A lover would care for you when you’re down. That means that they bring you pizza and they would always imagine their future with you. If they want to travel to live in another country or find a new place to live in, they would always picture you with them. A lover would love you for who you are, even with your flaws.

, This is the bottom line. Someone who considers you a lover will be more invested in you, more available to you, and they will make you a priority in their life.


How do they talk to you? Friends will start talking to someone else even though they were just talking to you and yell a 'hi' or 'hey' to someone they are friends with while talking to you. A lover is completely focused on you. Even if someone else says hi to them or tries to talk to them, they might not even notice unless you point it out or the other person does something like snap in their face to get their attention.
When your friend always seems to care more than they should, or they always tend to be worried if you’re okay, they most likely like you as more than a friend (or wish you liked them as more).

Take a moment to reflect over your friendship.,
Taking all of your feelings into account, decide how you feel about attempting to salvage the friendship.",How to Detox a Friendship1," If the friendship feels toxic where once it felt fantastic, try to pinpoint what doesn't feel right about it anymore. Some indicators of emotional ""toxicity"" in a friendship include:


Feeling down or even depressed when your friend is about.No longer getting excited to see your friend, seeing them has become something you feel obliged to endure.
You feel that your friend always talks about themselves, even when it's clear you need a shoulder to cry on.Your friend's set of values and their ambitions seem to have changed a great deal from yours, to the extent where you don't see eye to eye on most things anymore.
Have you discovered that your friend gave you bad advice on purpose?It can be just as bad if your friend is always agreeing with you without caring about the consequences because he or she cannot be bothered to set you straight.
It seems that your friend only ""needs"" you when he or she has bad news to share.It feels as if your friend is using you as a means to make herself or himself feel better by belittling you.Your friend has taken to criticizing you all the time or being judgmental about your choices and decisions without cause.

Rumors started by your friend (confirmed by others) have reached your ears.
Your friend has taken to dropping you in a mess at the last moment, hindering your progress, or has become really unreliable and won't follow through on promises made to you, time and again.You feel manipulated, demeaned, poisoned, or downplayed by your friend.Consider what other behaviors or attitudes have lead you to feeling sour about your friendship together.;
, It is important to reach a decision as to whether or not you're comfortable trying to detox the friendship, or whether a better bet would be let it go. Even if you do give detoxing a chance, the end result might be that you still need to let go, so be prepared for this possibility in all events. When considering the worth of trying to detox your friendship, the following things are worth keeping in mind:


The duration of your friendship together and all the good times you've shared.
Whether you have to continue seeing your friend in a work or social context.
The openness of your friend to discussing feelings, behavior and to accepting that he or she isn't right all the time. Some people remain adamant that they are right, no matter what you say, that they can prove to be impossible when it comes to opening your heart or reasoning with them.
Other issues going on in your friend's life that may have affected his or her outlook on life.

Get over the worry of hurting your friendship.",How to Deal With Your Friend's Boyfriend Hitting on You," Before reacting to flirting prematurely, make sure he's really flirting and not just being friendly. Does he have a flirty personality or is he just being overly friendly? Notice if he's like this around all women or just you. Notice if it only happens in the context of alcohol, or when you are alone., Let your friend's boyfriend know early on, as soon as possible, that his flirting behavior is unacceptable. By doing so, you'll be sending a message that his behavior won't be tolerated and cannot continue. This will hopefully keep the flirting from escalating.


For example, if he flirts with you while you're at a party with all of your friends, you can simply say, ""Please stop touching my hands,"" or, ""Please stop commenting on how I look."" You can follow that with: ""I don't like it and your girlfriend is right over there.""

, Chances are, your friend has noticed what's happening or has heard about it from other friends. Talk to her early on so that she doesn't get the wrong idea about who's to blame for the flirting. After he flirts with you, you can just mention it to her in passing to let her know you feel uncomfortable or put off by it. Try to make her feel at ease and to have it not be too serious of a conversation, especially if he hasn't flirted with you that often.


You can say, ""Hey, I was really uncomfortable with your boyfriend was just flirting with me at the party. I'm sorry to mention it, but maybe he was just nervous or drinking too much?""

, If he makes a habit of continuing to flirt with you, try setting boundaries with him. You can do this on your own or by verbally setting the boundary with him. For example, you could:


Make sure you’re not alone with him.
Schedule a girls’ night only time with your friend.
Walk away when he tries to flirt with you.
Say, ""I am asking you to stop touching me. It makes me uncomfortable.""
Tell him, ""Do not call or text me anymore. If you continue, I'm going to block your number and show the texts to your girlfriend.""

, Hopefully once you’ve mentioned it to both of them and tried setting boundaries, the flirting behavior will stop. Keep an eye on what he does the next few times he's around you, but hopefully he listened or your friend will take care of the situation herself. If the following circumstances occur, you’ll definitely want to confront him and your friend again about his behavior:He starts acting more flirty or inappropriate with you, even after you told him to stop.
He stops flirting with you, but starts up with another friend in your group.
He tries to blame the flirting on you.

, If you’ve tried enforcing your boundaries, told him to stop in the moment, and talked with your friend, but his flirting continues to make you uncomfortable, confront him directly. He genuinely might not mean to offend you, but the bottom line is that you still feel uncomfortable and don’t want your friend to get hurt. Be clear and direct about what specific behavior you find inappropriate. Let him know he can expect you to talk to your friend about it if he does not stop — and follow through with this consequence.You can say, “You’ve been flirting with me, touching me inappropriately, and making sexualized comments. I am uncomfortable with that and I want you to stop.”

, Once you’ve confronted him directly, he could react in any number of ways. No matter what he says or how he reacts, it’s important to be firm with him and repeat that you’re uncomfortable with his flirting and want it to stop. Try not to comfort him or argue with him, just take note of what his emotional response is. You can likely expect some of the following reactions from him:Denial that he’s been flirting.
Blaming you for flirting with him first or leading him on.
Anger or fear that you’ll tell on him.
Embarrassment or shame for his behavior.

, You’ll have to be gentle, honest, and careful of what you say, but you need to tell her the flirting has continued. Find some time to sit down with her one-on-one and give her an account of her boyfriend’s actions, how you responded or told him to stop, and how it’s made you feel uncomfortable.You can say, “I really care about you and our friendship, but I need to talk to you about Dan again. When you’re not around, he’s been touching my hair, flirting with me, and making sexually inappropriate comments. I tried to let it go, but he kept doing it, so I decided to talk to him about it. I’ve told him to stop several times and have tried to stay away from him, but he keeps doing it and I’m really uncomfortable. I’m sorry if this hurts you, but I just wanted you to know.”
Avoid saying anything judgmental, like: “Your boyfriend is creepy,” or, “Your boyfriend is such a jerk.”, After hearing about her boyfriend’s behavior toward you (and possibly others), give your friend some time to process. She might be a little upset or angry at you at first. She might even try to blame you or take his side. Give her time to collect her thoughts and deal with her boyfriend on her own.Keep in mind that if she’s a good friend, she’ll realize you weren’t at fault and just had her best interests at heart.

, Your friend may decide to stay with her boyfriend and/or she may decide to keep some distance from you. Either way, you need to respect her decision and allow her to deal with her relationship on her own; however, you’ll need to make your own decision about if you can be around the both of them. If she decides to stay with him, consider:


Keeping a dialogue open between you and her if his flirting continues.
Spending less time with your friend when her boyfriend is with her.
Having an exit plan for parties or events when you’re with both of them.
Communicating with them right away if he violates your boundaries.
Leaving the friendship if his behavior escalates to something physical.

, Notice and mentally keep track of instances when he’s flirted with you (or even write it down if you need to). It may help to reflect on exactly how things happened and what your response was in case you've confronted him and he does nothing.Some questions to ask yourself include:


Where and when has he flirted with you?
What is he saying? Is he making sexually inappropriate comments, or just complimenting you?
Was he intoxicated during the flirting?
Has he attempted to or actually touched you/kissed you?
Has the flirting occurred in front of your friend or behind her back?
Has he been flirting with other friends or other people too?
How did you respond to him when he flirted with you?

, Think about if you find him attractive. If so, you could have unintentionally flirted with him and encouraged him to flirt with you. Reflect on your interactions with him and examine if you sent him mixed signals or actively flirted with him yourself. Some flirty behavior you might want to avoid includes:Smiling at him excessively.
Winking at him.
Touching him, particularly grabbing or rubbing his arms, hands, or knees.
Laughing at all of his jokes.

, Seek support from other friends who know your friend and her boyfriend. It could be they have been experiencing the same behavior from him and have been too embarrassed to talk about it. Even if not, they will be able to help support you and figure out what to do next. Practice what you’d like to say to the boyfriend with your other friends — this will give you a confidence boost and will help keep you focused and strong when it comes time to confront him., You need to get over the worry of hurting your friendship, hurting your friend’s feelings, and/or hurting her relationship with her boyfriend. Put yourself in your friend’s shoes and think about if you’d want to know if your boyfriend was acting that way toward others. You’d likely want to know about the character of a boyfriend and how he was treating your friends, so do her the same favor.If she doesn't believe you, she may not be a good friend to keep.

Invite your friend to join the group.,
Help boost your friend’s confidence.,
Let them know there’s no need to feel threatened.,
Choose an activity that will be comfortable for them.,
Be yourself when combining friend groups.,
Remind your friend that you value them and your other friends.",How to Deal With Your Friend Who Is Being Jealous of Your Other Friends1," This might feel hard if your friend has made occasions with your other friends uncomfortable in the past. However, stay positive. If your friend knows they’re wanted in a situation, they may be less likely to act out of jealousy.Don’t remind your friend of times they may have made social situations uncomfortable in the past. This may make them feel more insecure about re-entering a situation like that.
Emphasize that it’s their choice. They don’t need to feel obligated to hang out if the idea makes them uncomfortable.
If your friend has been cruel or manipulative to your other friends in the past, inviting them to join the group may do more harm than good.;
, Jealousy is usually a sign that someone feels insecure. Helping your friend build self-esteem may help some of their jealous feelings subside.Tell your friend things you appreciate about them. It’s great if you can emphasize reasons you value spending time with them.
You can say something like, “You’re so funny. That’s part of why it’s so fun to spend time with you.” Or, you can offer something like, “You always have such good ideas of where to go to eat.”

, A friend who is jealous of your other friends may think that your other friends are more valuable to you. Let your friend know that you’re not planning to replace them with other friends.Even if your friend hasn’t said it, they may be afraid you’re going to forget them or abandon the friendship. Make it clear that this isn’t true.
You can say something like, “I really like hanging out with my other friends, but it’s always more fun when you’re around.” You can also say, “I really hope you’ll want to hang out with all of us. I miss you when you’re not around.”

, If you truly want to include your friend, make sure you invite them to do something that they would enjoy. Otherwise, you could end up fueling their feelings of insecurity and jealousy.

Choose a place that’s easy for your friend to get to, and where they feel comfortable. For example, don’t choose somewhere that is close to you and your other friends but a long bus ride from where your friend lives.
Pick something that you already know they enjoy. For example, don’t invite them over to play a game that your other friends know but your one friend doesn’t. If you’re going to go out to eat, you can ask your one friend to pick the restaurant.
You want your friend to feel comfortable, but you don't want them to have all of the control. Make sure you're not being manipulated into simply doing whatever this one friend wants to do.

, If you haven’t spent much time with your one friend and the rest of your friends together, you might feel a little uncomfortable at first. Stay true to yourself. Don’t worry about how your friends may expect you to behave.If you have inside jokes with a certain friend, you can acknowledge them without excluding the others. You can simply say, “I’m sorry. That was just a reference to something funny that happened to us last week.” Or, if it makes sense, you could take the time to explain the joke.
If a friend accuses you of not acting genuinely, you can explain yourself. For example, if a friend says, “I thought you didn’t like those kinds of movies,” you can explain that, “I actually have started watching movies like that recently and I do like them. I guess I just haven’t talked to you about it.”

, The great thing about friendship is that you can have multiple friends. Let your friend know that it’s important to you to have friendships that don’t threaten each other.

Always make sure your friend knows what you value about them. If they are a reliable, helpful friend, tell them and thank them for that.
You can also gently let them know what you like about your other friends. You can say, “I really enjoy the intellectual conversations I have with that person. I don’t need to do that all the time, but I like getting to engage that way occasionally.”

Raise the problems in your friendship with your friend.,
Listen.,
Agree to disagree.,
Validate the friendship.,
Keep the discussion short and to the point.,
Think of and then suggest some great ways forward for your friendship.,
Review your friendship.",How to Detox a Friendship2," Once you have decided that it is worth investing your time and effort in detoxing your friendship, it's time to bring attention to your friend's behavior to see whether it's possible to resolve the challenges. This isn't going to be easy but avoiding it will not help you either; nothing will change if you don't tackle it. Be sensitive and gentle in the way that you approach this conversation – you will be treading a fine line between on the one hand, your friend feeling that he or she is being criticized, blamed, or that you're just being unfair and on the other hand, your friend being relieved that the grievance is out in the open, ready for proper discussion. Some ways to approach this could include saying:


""I feel that we haven't been very close lately and that our friendship is suffering as a result. I was hoping you might have the time to talk about ways we could take stock and boost our friendship again.""
""I've missed the closeness we used to experience as friends. I don't know if you're feeling this too, but I'd really like to talk about the ways we might be able to restore that closeness we used to have.""
""I felt upset when I overheard you telling Mr X that I wasn't much of a friend to you and it made me wonder where we're headed. Have you got a moment to talk about this?""

, Be ready to listen attentively and kindly to what your friend says. There may be some things you don't like hearing but you must remain open-minded and ready to acknowledge your own mistakes as well. It's quite possible that you're unaware of how you might be contributing to their behavior.

, If there is something that neither of you can see eye-to-eye on, just agree to disagree about it but not to let that get in the way of what ought to be a fine friendship. Or, try a little humor. One tactic that can work really well with friends who have a sense of inferiority is to disarm their toxic rebukes with humor that sort of agrees with their statement. For example:


Friend: ""Oh where on Earth did you get that dress from? It makes you look frumpy!"" You: ""Oh yeah, I felt like frumping it tonight, can't have my husband thinking I'm flirting while he's away!""

, Avoid blaming and accusing; instead, keep validating the friendship in everything that you say, explaining how much you value your friend and your friendship together, so that it's clear that this isn't about throwing away what really matters.

, Don't labor it. And always end the conversation positively, whether it's promising to do something for your friend, or arranging to do something together, or simply telling them what a wonderful person you think they are.


If your friend throws a ""tantrum"", or argues fiercely with you, politely let them know you're taking your leave and you'll continue this discussion later. There is no need for an argument over your feelings.

, If your friend has responded favorably to your concerns and is at least willing to give things another go, it can be helpful to have some ideas of things that might help to get your friendship back on track. Some ideas to consider include:


A ban on gossiping about one another. This goes without saying but if it has been a problem, it's best to have a laugh about it and get it out into the open as a taboo activity.
A willingness and commitment to spending more time together, just the two of you, sharing a common interest that you both enjoy.
Having a secret signal to let one another when the advice and support is crossing the line into being bossy, criticizing, or pushy. At the first sign of this signal, either one of you will know it's time to call a halt to whatever behavior is causing the problem.
Reaching an agreement that it's OK to deal with upsets as they occur rather than leaving misunderstandings to fester.
Sharing a mutual appreciation space. It could be a photo board, an online privately shared site, a weekly chat. Whatever you decide, make room for celebrating one another and each other's achievements. Friends are supporters, not detractors, and both of you should feel safe in communicating your wins and losses in life.

, After having your heart-to-heart, consider how your friendship stands now.


Does it feel like the two of you have reached a good understanding, as if you've been through the wars but now you are stronger for it?
Do you feel that your friend is ready to be there for you, to enable you to be the best you can be, and you're willing to reciprocate one hundred percent?

"
"
Reread through the indicators of a toxic personality as outlined in the first section above.,
Detach yourself.,
Delete their details from your life.",How to Detox a Friendship3," Did you find yourself agreeing to many of the signals? Did the list enlighten your sense of loss about your friendship? If so, and if you feel that it isn't worth trying anymore, it's time to cut the ties.

, It's time to accept that you've outgrown this friendship, in the same way that you outgrow other aspects of your life. If you hear that voice some people enjoy trotting out that ""you've just got to keep trying"", then ignore it. By now, it's clear you've already tried more than enough and your friend crosses the line of forbearance when he or she continues to manipulate, demean, or gossip about you. It is just as important to know when to let someone go as it is to know when to keep trying, and at this point, detaching yourself is healthy and a stage of maturation in your life.

, Remove your friend from Facebook, your cell phone, your address book, etc. Dr Ray Pahl, a friendship expert, explains that too many friends in your life can be stressful and unfulfilling anyway,so it's important to leave your guilt aside too.

Be friendly and kind when you can't avoid coming into contact with a former friend.,
Don't ever be caught saying a bad word about your former friend.,
Be polite.,
Keep conversations short and sweet.,
Put your efforts into the remaining friendships.",How to Detox a Friendship4," If you have parted ways with a toxic friend but you are still in his or her daily circles for work or social reasons, there's no need to do the cold stonewalling act. Keep communicating in a friendly, caring way that still maintains your distance. Say ""hello"" when you see your former friend - it doesn't have to be more than this - but at least keep greetings civil and ongoing. Acknowledging your former friend's worth as a human being still matters. This can be a delicate balance as you do not want to convey the idea that you are still friends.

, If anyone tries to draw you on, this simply say ""Yes, we were friends once but it didn't work out. She's still a good person, we're just not suited as friends now.""

, Whenever your paths cross, if all else fails you, at least smile. If your friend doesn't reciprocate, don't worry - just keep doing this and other people will notice who is the person with the chip on their shoulder.

, If you are in a situation where you still need to talk to one another, stick to simple things and excuse yourself as soon as it is polite to do so. If you need to talk through things to do with work and find yourself disagreeing, keep it civil, professional, and stick to the facts.

, Your real friends are a source of support and re-energizing. Rely on them for improving your outlook on friendship!

Choose a time to talk to them.,
Let your friend know that their jealousy is hurtful for you.,
Let them know you appreciate their strengths.,
Tell them that you need them to trust your friendship.,
Continue to show them that you’re still invested in the friendship.",How to Deal With Your Friend Who Is Being Jealous of Your Other Friends2," Make sure they know that you’d like to have an important conversation. You don’t want them to feel caught off guard. Ask them when would be a good time. Make sure you’ll have enough time to have the conversation without it feeling rushed.
Choose a place where you can speak privately and comfortably.

, Be honest without being accusatory. You don’t have to place judgements on their behavior; you can simply talk about how you feel.Use ""I"" Statements. Instead of saying, “You make situations with my other friends unpleasant,” you can say, “I feel awkward when we’re with my other friends and you comment on their clothes.” Instead of saying, “You’re too needy,” you can say, “I don’t feel like the energy I give to this friendship is satisfying to you.”
Mention specific examples, if you can. You can say something like, “When you suggested that I skip my friend’s birthday party, I felt that you didn’t want me to socialize with people who are important to me.”

, Your friend may be feeling particularly vulnerable at this point. Make sure they know that you value their friendship because of their wonderful qualities.Remind your friend of things you share in common, especially if it’s something unique. You could say something like, “You’re one of the only people I can share my passion for rugby with.”
Show them that you appreciate their positive qualities. Say something like, “I’ve always valued how great you are at problem solving. I really appreciate that about you.”

, It’s great that you’re making these efforts to restore your friendship. However, your friend needs to do some of that work too. Let them know that they need to have faith in your friendship in order to meet you halfway.If your friend can’t work on their own jealousy, the friendship may not last much longer. You can gently say something like, “I have a hard time dealing with this jealousy. I hope you can work on it, so that we can continue being good friends.”
Be assertive. Let them know that trust is important in a friendship, and that it’s a two-way street.

, At the end of the conversation, make plans to spend time together again soon. This will let your friend know that you don’t plan to end the friendship.Ask your friend how they’d like to spend time with you. This shows that you want them to be getting something out of the relationship.
Send a text or e-mail later that day thanking them for the conversation. Reiterate that you are grateful for their friendship.

Consider if you definitely want to end the friendship.,
Practice what you will say to your friend.,
Emphasize your responsibility for the decision.,
Be honest, but gentle.",How to Deal With Your Friend Who Is Being Jealous of Your Other Friends3," Ending a friendship can be as difficult as ending a romantic relationship. Don’t take the decision lightly. Before you decide to end a friendship, consider if there are any alternatives.You may just need to limit the time you spend with this person.Even if a friendship is difficult, it may be worth preserving if you have many mutual friends, or if you work together. Otherwise, ending the friendship could cause ongoing tension that you can’t get away from.
You can try taking some space away from this friend to see how your social life feels without that relationship. You can tell your friend you plan to take some time away from them, or simply do so without mentioning it.

, Breaking up is a delicate business. Prepare yourself by knowing exactly what you plan to say. You can even write out a script for yourself to practice from.If you do write out a script, don’t bring it with you to the conversation.
If an in-person conversation feels too scary, you can write a thoughtful letter or e-mail to your friend explaining your position. You can decide whether to ask for some space temporarily, or to let them know that the friendship is over.

, Your friend will likely feel saddened and rejected by this turn of events. Don’t make it worse by blaming them for your decision. Emphasize that this is something that you need to do for your own well-being.Use “I” statements to avoid blame. You can say, “I really need to feel comfortable having multiple friendships, so this is a decision I need to make.”
You can also express your feelings about the decision. You can say, “I feel sad that we can’t be as close as we used to be, but I don’t think spending so much time together is healthy for me.”

, Remember that this is someone you’ve been close to. You don’t want to hurt their feelings needlessly. Besides, if they’ve been acting jealous, chances are that they’re already feeling insecure.You can say something like, “This is a really difficult thing for me to do, but I know that our relationship isn’t a healthy one.”
If you’re asked for an explanation or examples, offer them. It may be helpful for your friend to hear concrete reasons that the friendship needs to change.

Realize what a tough world it can be for the sensitive persons you mingle with.,
Know what not to say around a sensitive person.,
Be careful with what you say around your sensitive person.,
Be gentle.,
Be a calm influence around the sensitive person.,
Get to know the sensitive person.,
Encourage your sensitive person.,
Deal with your own sense of annoyance.",How to Deal with Sensitive People," People who are extremely sensitive often lead really hard lives. They pick up on nuances where others see merely discussions; they hear, see and smell things in greater volume or intensity than others, which can make activities or experiences overwhelming for them on many occasions; and they can observe the deeper patterns that move human society and can be easily frustrated at the injustices they perceive in many places. This can lead such persons to leave the party early, to decline to attend events, to cry at the drop of a word and to close down on anyone they perceive as attacking anything they deeply care about. Sensitive people can experience headaches, dizziness, weakness and nausea when over-exposed to noise, busyness, brightness or crowds and this can make life hard for them, especially in urban environments. As such, have a heart and at least understand that the daily tasks that you find regular and bearable may, at times, feel like draining torture to a sensitive person.


Be accepting that the sensitive person is made that way. They are not manipulative, they are not trying to make anyone else's life more difficult and they are not broken.;
, It is important to take care not to be dismissive of sensitive persons. Where cultural norms favor competitive, opinionated and outspoken approaches to work and social life, such promoted values can cause the ""normal"" to be interpreted as being these ways, while anything that is quiet, cooperative and sensitive by nature can be viewed as ""not normal"". For the sensitive person, it can result in hearing some of the most dreaded comments, such as:


""Why are you so sensitive?"" – the presumption here is that there is a level of ""toughness"" to meet. In actual fact, this is often stated when the speaker is comparing the sensitive person's behavior to his or her own sense of what's a normal way to do something/be and it excludes the sensitive person's perspective entirely.
""You're too sensitive"" – this comment is often made as a dismissive retort when the speaker isn't getting his or her own way and is annoyed by or angry with the sensitive person's reluctance to conform to their wants or is overwhelmed and needs to withdraw to recover. It's a stinging rebuke that can be remembered for long after the occasion. It is also often said when the speaker is about to do or say something that he or she doesn't wish to be held responsible for.
""Get over yourself"" – this may be said when the speaker has reached the end of their willingness to understand the sensitive person, and it makes the assumption that the sensitive person is ""putting it on"". This failure to understand that the sensitive person is likely feeling deep pain, confusion or disturbance of one kind or another and is simply doing their best to cope can make the interaction even more disturbing for them, made all the worse by the implication that the sensitive person is trying to be manipulative, when that is not at all the case.
""You need therapy to fix this problem"" – the presumption here is that sensitivity is a disease in need of a cure. The speaker fails to realize that sensitivity is innate, it comes with the person in the same way as green eyes, blond hair and flat feet come with a person. While it may be reasonable to help the sensitive person learn how to better cope with relating to others, it is wrong to presume that there is something broken about them.


Upon hearing such comments, a barb enters the soul and wounds the sensitive person because they're being told that they're somehow not normal. Stop yourself before ever uttering these dismissive and unkind phrases. After all, the reason behind saying these statements is manipulative or dismissive, and both those motivations are not genuine ways to relate to others.







, Do not say anything that you feel will offend this person from what you know about them. This isn't about curtailing your ""rights"" to speak as you think; it's about showing respect for another person's dignity and about getting along harmoniously in your relationships.


Avoid any discussion about needing to ""fix"" the sensitivity. This is about as realistic as trying to fix someone's naturally outgoing personality or their natural sporting ability. Sensitivity is a personality trait of equal value and is not a sign of being broken!

, A sensitive person responds to being spoken to in a calm, gentle and persuasive tone of voice. Acting tough and being impatient or aggressive will scare a sensitive person and cause them to react defensively immediately. If you want to encourage a sensitive person to do something, be somewhere or achieve something, be calmly encouraging and supportive. You can be absolutely certain that every single word you say to a sensitive person has been heard and is being digested for its meaning, both the obvious and the unsaid, so there is no need to shout it out or hammer it home. Speak gently and show that you have faith in this person to acquiesce to your request and your message is understood.

, Keep yourself nice and cool when you're with them. This will help them relax when you're around and know that they can rely on you when they have problems. As an added bonus, you'll like how you feel when you're calm and relating to someone at that level too––it's a pleasure to know that every word you say has import, is being taken seriously and that you don't have to huff and puff to be heard.

, What is it that they're sensitive about, and why? Knowing your sensitive person will help you to understand why they feel like they do. Perhaps they are passionate about ""saving"" something––sensitive people are often idealistic and in love with a cause. This can be extremely helpful if it's a cause you happen to be involved in too, as you've a firm ally for life there. Even if you're not able to see eye-to-eye with the cause or mission the sensitive person is pursuing in life, it is important to admire their passion and commitment to it, and to acknowledge that what they value is important too.

, Let them know that you don't mind that they are the way they are. Make it clear that you think the way they are is just as normal as any other person's way of being. In fact, don't even make a big deal about it; be supportive, especially when others don't understand. Equally, don't inflate it to some weird sort of condition that needs mollycoddling. It's enough to have the sensitivity respected and valued.


Appreciate the sensitive person as a sounding board for theories or as help to ignite creativity in your workplace. If you are truly prepared to listen to a sensitive person, you'll learn much from their ability to read between the lines and perceive the imperceptible. Just be sure to not crowd them or put them on the spot.
Note that sensitive persons are often found to be the best performers in the modern technologically driven and automated workplace.This is due to the fact they bring forth higher sensory perception, empathy and intuitive approaches into workplaces in which many are held sway to the technological solutions. Their input can be vital in helping a workplace thrive and even survive amid the emotionless competitiveness.If your workplace is sensitive-phobic, consider leading the charge to change this around. Reward the sensitive people for their compassion, deeper thinking and empathy. Help to root out bullying that thrives on ousting the persons who are non-confrontational and therefore make easy targets.Most of all, make it clear that sensitivity is to be valued as a contributor to the whole of what makes the organization successful.

, There will be times when you think ""Why do I have to tiptoe around their feelings?"" Realize that this is a form of wanting to enforce your ""normal"" onto them, and lacks an understanding that every single day, sensitive persons are doing everything they can to ""fit in"" amid a loud, rushing and critical world that buffets them about, drains them and often hurts them. If they have the courage to be able to cope with this despite the toll it takes on their well-being, then you can find the courage too to overcome any sense of petty annoyance. After all, it's simply yet another part of showing respect for people from all walks of life and for every person, highly sensitive or not, this is our daily obligation."

Consider the person's age.,
Identify emotionally mature and immature reactions.,
Understand why a person might be emotionally immature.,
Acknowledge potential mental health issues.",How to Deal With an Overly Immature Person1," The word immature means “not fully developed.” By nature, the person may not understand how to respond to typical situations. The younger the person is, the more cognition may be difficult.Be more understanding of immaturity in younger people.


An young boy might, for instance, show immaturity by joking about boobs and penises, farting on his friends, picking his nose, and generally acting like a child.While obnoxious, this may simply be normal behavior for someone his age, and should probably just be ignored. Allow younger people space to grow up and mature before you get too angry.
On the other hand, a grown person who otherwise seems mature (i.e. someone who has moved beyond fart jokes) may still lack emotional maturity — she may be inconsiderate, unable to accept blame for her mistakes, or try to make you jealous or angry on purpose.;
, Extreme situations can sometimes trigger emotionally immature reactions, something called age regression, which can blur the lines between adult and childish emotions. React more thoughtfully when you recognize someone is reacting maturely. There are a variety of ways to glean whether the reaction is an adult or childish/immature emotion.A person who is emotionally immature will: be reactive; see himself as a victim; act out his emotions (intense or gut reactions, like explosive anger, sudden crying, etc.); be self-centered and concerned with self-protection; appear to always be justifying his actions to himself or others; be manipulative; be motivated by fear or a feeling that he ""has to"" do something,"" as well as a need to avoid failure, discomfort, and rejection.A person who is showing emotional maturity will: be open to hearing others' perspectives; be proactive; be motivated by growth and act with a vision or purpose; act because he chooses to, not because he feels he must; act with integrity, meaning his actions will align with his values., People who are emotionally immature find it difficult to cope with their emotions, and often experience a learned helplessness, or feeling that she cannot change her situation or improve her life.This may be because she never learned how to face and handle difficult emotions. While her immature behavior is not appropriate, it may help you to be more understanding if you realize that she is acting from a place of fear, feeling that she must protect herself from these uncomfortable emotions.

, The person you’re dealing with may be dealing with ADHD or a personality disorder. Some disorders of this type may appear to be immaturity, and can manifest in various ways.A person with ADHD may appear to be simply ""immature"", but she actually has a neurodevelopmental disorder. She may have trouble paying attention and talk excessively, may appear bossy or interrupt conversations, become verbally aggressive when frustrated, or have difficulty controlling her emotions, leading to outbursts of anger or tears.Borderline personality disorder is typically accompanied by major mood swings.
People with antisocial personality disorder are often unkind, and lack the ability to respect your feelings.Those with histrionic personality disorder can be very emotional in order to garner attention, and display uneasiness when not the focal point.Narcissistic personality disorder shows itself in people who have an exaggerated view of their worth, diminished empathy towards others, and results in a vulnerability that could cause outbursts."

Understand that you can't force someone to change.,
Try to limit your contact with the person.,
Communicate assertively.,
Talk to the person.",How to Deal With an Overly Immature Person2," The truth is, this isn't your battle to fight — if the person is not willing to recognize his behavior and take steps to change it, there is little you can do. It may be particularly difficult for an emotionally immature person to realize he needs to change, as a hallmark of emotional immaturity is blaming other people or circumstances for one's bad behavior.The only thing you can control is your behavior — how you react to the person, and how much time you spend with him.

, Depending on the severity of the person's immaturity and her willingness to change, you may need to cut her out of your life. If the immature person is your significant other, you may need to end the relationship if she is not willing to change. If the person is someone you can't remove from your life, such as a boss, coworker, or family member, then try to limit your contact as much as possible.


Keep your interactions as brief as possible. Excuse yourself from conversations firmly but politely, saying something like, ""I'm sorry to cut this short, but I'm in the middle of a huge project and I really need to get back to it.""
In a social setting, do your best to simply avoid her, talking to your other friends or relatives.

, An emotionally immature person can be manipulative and self-centered, so if you must communicate with him, try to do so clearly and assertively. Assertive does not mean aggressive — it means being clear, respectful, and stating what you need, while at the same time being respectful of other people's needs, feelings, and wants.In short, you state what you need, and let go of the outcome.


Understand that even if you maturely communicate your needs, the immature person may not respond maturely.
Learn more about being assertive by reading this wikiHow article: How To Be Assertive.

, If you think the person is open to hearing feedback, and she is someone you want to keep in your life, then you may want to try and talk to her about her behavior. Prepare yourself for her to become defensive,which may interfere with getting your message across. You might even suggest she talk to a counselor or someone who can help her learn how to communicate maturely.


Name the behavior that is immature and what effects it has on you. For instance, ""I feel overwhelmed when you don't take on more responsibility in the house. Would you please help me out every week?"" Then give the person specific things she can do every day to help out.
You might remind her that change can be extremely difficult, but you want to be there with her and help her grow and mature, if she's willing.

Ignore the person and disengage.,
Ask the person to leave you alone.,
Inform the person of her actions.,
Resist the urge to fight fire with fire.,
Get help.",How to Deal With an Overly Immature Person3," It's the easiest way and simplest reaction when the immature person is trying to get your attention or a reaction. By responding to the behavior, you're giving in to what she wants and reinforcing her immature actions. Ignoring her will likely make her frustrated with her unsuccessful attack on you, and cause her to give up.


If the immature person is losing her temper or trying to pick an argument, it's important for you to disengage from her efforts to upset you.
Look away from her. Turn your head or avert your eyes. Just don’t acknowledge her presence.
Turn your back to her. Even if she circles to face you, turn around again.
Walk away. Move with a purpose, avoiding her as quickly as possible until she stops following.
Try an e-ignore approach. Talking to someone or bothering someone who is constantly on their phone or tablet is very difficult. You’ll be so engaged you won’t notice them.

, If the person won’t see reason or won't go away, you may need to be slightly confrontational and tell him that you cannot engage with him any further. Gather up all your courage and politely ask him to leave you alone, while simultaneously removing yourself from the caustic environment. Try one of the following approaches:


Let him off easy by deflecting, “Please leave me alone right now. I’m not in a good mood.”
Get to the point and tell him what you’d like, “Leave me alone.”
Try a forward approach, “I'm not arguing with you. This conversation is over.”
Use the broken record technique. Simply repeat your refusal to engage over and over, ""This conversation is over."" Remain calm while employing this technique and try to walk away.

, It is possible the person doesn't realize she is being immature. Part of maturing is learning to deal with younger and/or less mature people. Confronting the immature person bothering you and letting her know her actions are inappropriate may cause them to avoid you.


Being straight-forward could help, “I do not appreciate your behavior. Please stop.”
Simply inform her of her behavior, “You’re being very immature. Stop bugging me.”
Form your reply as a question, “Do you realize how immature you’re acting right now?”

, While you may be tempted to respond to the person immaturely as well, giving him a taste of his own medicine, this could seriously backfire. If you are interacting with this person in a work situation, your immature behavior could get you in trouble. In addition, it might actually be dangerous to egg on an immature person who is also aggressive or has a temper. When you feel tempted to react to the person, be the mature one and disengage and walk away from him.

, If the person is aggressive and won't stop bothering you, consult with a lawyer or the police. No one is allowed to harass or touch you. These people need outside influences to stop bothering you, and they probably won't until someone is able to exert influence they can't deny. There are a few possible options:


Use your social support network. If contact with the person is unavoidable, find a friend, family member, teacher or school administrator, boss, or anyone you trust, and ask for help.
Tell the person you’re going to call the police. The threat of authorities may intimidate him enough to stop bothering you.
Call the police. If you fear for your safety and/or the person is harassing you, threatening you, stalking you, or has been violent, the police may be able to intervene, or you may be able to file a police report. Make sure you take detailed notes about each incident so you have a record of the harassment and how long it has been going on.
Harassment includes threats; repeated telephone calls, texts, email, leaving notes or other contact; following someone; blackmail; slashing car tires.Consider filing a harassment restraining order. Laws very by state, but you can talk to the police or a lawyer about your options when it comes to filing for a restraining order.

Think about what you have learned from the experience.",How to Deal With Friends Who Stab You in the Back1," Avoid wishing that your friend had behaved in a different way. Allowing yourself to constantly think things like, “Wow, I can’t believe that she did that” will only increase the resentment.


Ruminating over your friend’s actions will only make you feel worse. Make the decision to accept what has happened so that you can move on.;
, Try reprogramming your negative thoughts toward this person by saying affirmations out loud as often as possible. Keep saying them until the anger begins to lessen.


Affirmations will help you tell yourself a different storyYou want to use your words to create a different mindset. The affirmations can be as simple as saying, “I forgive Amy for spreading rumors about me.”

, Remind yourself that the anger is actually hurting you more than the other person because it’s impacting your emotional and perhaps even physical health. Then intentionally choose to focus on something that feels better. Notice that the bad feelings are not helping you but are actually making you feel worse.


Gratitude can also help to reduce overall anger. When you feel yourself starting to get angry about the betrayal, choose instead to make a list of all of the things that you have to be grateful for.

, When you are angry, your body automatically goes into fight-or-flight mode.However, because your mind and body are connected, when you allow your physical body to relax you can think more clearly and release anger. Deep breathing is an effective and reliable way to quickly go into a relaxed state. Here's how to do it:Sit in a chair with your spine straight. You’ll probably be most comfortable with the back of the chair supporting your back. You can also lie down straight on a flat comfortable surface.
Close your eyes and put one hand on your stomach and the other on your chest.
Take a slow deep breath. Feel the breath start in your diaphragm and work its way up to your head. You should see the hand on your chest raise.
Then slowly exhale. The hand on your stomach should raise as the air moves out.
Repeat this process for five minutes to seven minutes or until you feel calmer.

, Remind yourself that every situation is an opportunity to learn and grow. When you’re able to see the silver lining, then it’s easier to release the anger and forgive.Remind yourself that you can either be bitter about the situation or you can find an opportunity to grow from the experience. Ask yourself the question, “What have I learned from this experience?” Then take a few minutes to explore what comes to mind. For example, did you learn to be more selective about what you share with others?

Decide if you're reading too much into the situation.,
Watch the person's social interactions.,
Send positive signals.,
Open the door for a date.,
Address the issue directly.",How to Deal With Mixed Signals1," Sometimes, if you're just flirting with a person, you may read the situation as more flirtatious than it is. Studies have shown that men, especially, are guilty of this problem. That is, men are more likely to read an innocent gesture as sexual or flirtatious than women.It may be the person isn't giving you mixed signals at all. It may be that the person is simply being nice or friendly, and you are reading more into it than you should.;
, If you're not sure whether the person is flirting with you or not, pay attention to how that person interacts with other people. If he or she is treating everyone else the same way, then they're likely not flirting with you. However, if you seem to be getting special attention, they may be flirting with you., If you're not the type to address something head-on, you can try giving your own positive signals. That way, if the person is sending mixed signals because they're not sure that you're into them, you can reassure their fears. That is, laugh at the person's jokes, touch his or her arm when you're talking, touch your hair, and look into the person's eyes. Use body language to indicate to the person that you're interested, and they may reciprocate., If your flirting with someone but you don't want to ask them out, try using an indirect method. That way, you give them an opening, but you're not setting yourself up for major rejection.For instance, you could casually mention your plans for the weekend, such as ""I'm excited about this weekend. I'm going to see this really great independent film downtown on Saturday."" If the person is interested, he or she might ask to tag along.
If you want to open the door a bit more, you could add, ""What are your plans?"" or ""Do you want to tag along?""

, You can also just bring it up directly instead of beating around the bush. That way, you get it out in the open. If the person rejects the idea, you can both move on with your lives. If the person says that they like you, you can consider going on a date.If you're trying to see if someone likes you, you could say, ""I noticed you seem to flirt when I'm around. How would you feel about going on a date?""
However, be careful doing this step at work. Most workplaces frown on inter-office dating, and you could be making a very awkward situation that could cause trouble for you later.

Prepare to have a conversation with your friend.,
Set a time for the conversation.,
State the problem calmly and clearly.,
Allow the other person to speak.,
Suggest solutions to resolve the problem.,
Celebrate the solutions.,
Make new friends.,
Seek help when necessary.",How to Deal With Friends Who Stab You in the Back2," Good communication is important in order to resolve any type of conflict. Therefore, it’s important to know exactly what it is that you want to discuss. Before beginning any conversation, reflect on what it is that is bothering you and what you want to get from the conversation. Try asking yourself these questions:“What do I want to get from this conversation?”
“What exactly is bothering me?”
“What do I want the other person to do or not to do?”
“What are my goals for this conversation?”

, Try to set a time to meet as soon as possible but make sure that the time is convenient for both of you.Setting a specific time to talk rather than springing it on her without warning is important. If she isn’t expecting it, then she may feel that she is being attacked which means that conversation will not go very well.

, Start the conversation by sharing with your friend the facts of the situation. Only after you have finished sharing the facts should you share how you feel about what happened.For example, you could start by stating the facts, “I was told that you shared a personal secret about me to Maria.”
Then you could share how you feel by saying, “I am very upset and feel betrayed.”
Be sure to stick to “I” statements rather than “You” statements. For example, you should say “I feel upset and betrayed” instead of saying, “You betrayed me.”

, This conversation should be focused on finding a resolution to the problem. This means that both of you should have the opportunity to speak. Listen to your friend without interrupting and try to hear her perspective.


For example, you could ask your friend, ""How do you see the situation?"" or ""What do you think about what happened?""
Then allow your friend to speak without interrupting her. Try really hard to focus on what she is saying and not what is running through your own mind.

, Tell your friend what you think needs to happen in order to salvage the friendship.Also, be open to hearing what your friend has to say. This is the time to set boundaries to make sure that the situation does not recur. Also, do not be afraid to ask for an apology if you think that you deserve it.


Be sure to explain why you are making the suggestions and how that would benefit your friendship. For example, you could say, “From now on, let’s agree to not discuss what we have shared with each other with other friends unless we have received permission from the other person.”
Your friend may decide that she does not want to offer an apology. Be prepared to accept her decision if that happens. If she refuses to apologize, you will need to decide if you want to continue to reconcile the friendship.

, Once you have finished the conversation and things are amicable again, celebrate the success of the meeting.Remember, the goal is not to win, the goal is to resolve the conflict.


If things have not been resolved then schedule another time to revisit the conversation. Alternatively, you could decide that reconciliation may not be the best option right now.

, If your friend continues to act in a hurtful manner toward you even after you've tried to resolve the conflict, then it's probably time to make new friends. You deserve to be respected and treated well. Therefore, if the conflict goes on for an extended period of time or if you find that your friend keeps doing the same thing over and over again, then it's time to start looking for new people to spend your time with. Here are some great places to meet new friends:


Extracurricular activities
Hobbies
Work
Church
Classes
Online forums

You should not go to meet anyone in person that you don't know unless you are not an adult or accompanied by a Guardian. Also, be sure to go during the day to a pace where there are plenty of people.



, Sometimes resolving the conflict with your friend can be harder than you thought it would be. When this happens, it could easily escalate into a situation of bullying. Be sure to know the signs of bullying so that you can seek help from a trusted adult if you feel that you are being bullied. Here's what bullying looks like:Physical or verbal aggression that happens repeatedly or has the potential to happen repeatedly
Making threats offline or on social media
Spreading rumors offline or on social media
Purposely excluding you from the group

Think about the benefits of forgiveness.,
View the situation from the other person’s perspective.,
Focus on compassion.,
Make the decision to forgive.,
Let go of the grudge.,
Establish new boundaries.Boundaries will help you rebuild a sense of safety with your friend.",How to Deal With Friends Who Stab You in the Back3," It can be very hard to forgive someone who has stabbed you in the back. However, there are many emotional and physical benefits that occur when you forgive someone who has wronged you. When you are consciously aware that your own well-being will actually improve when you forgive your friend, you may be more motivated to do so. Here are some of the benefits of forgiving others: Decreased depression and lessened anxiety
Greater overall psychological well-being
Reduced levels of stress
Greater spiritual connection
Strengthened immune system
Lower blood pressure and improved heart health
Better interpersonal relationships
Increased self-esteem

, Sometimes unintentional betrayal happens because of a misunderstanding. Therefore, it’s important to consider the other person’s perspective. Taking time to reflect on the intention behind the behavior can really help you begin the process of forgiving her.

, Showing compassion when someone betrays you is difficult but it is essential to the forgiveness process. The most effective way to demonstrate compassion is to consider how the other person may actually be feeling right now and try to empathize. However, there are multiple ways that you can cultivate greater compassion:Remind yourself that everyone is ultimately doing the best that they can. It’s helpful to keep in mind that everyone misses the mark sometimes. Think back to a time when you may have unintentionally betrayed a friend. For instance, have you ever believed gossip about a friend or talked about your friend to someone else?
See the individual as a person and not as “the person who stabbed you in the back.” When you see her as a person who has flaws and sometimes makes mistakes, you may be more willing to forgive her.
Look for things that you have in common with the person. Do you have similar hobbies or do you have the same parenting style? When you see yourself as being similar to a person, you tend to have more compassion for her.
If you’re spiritual, it may be helpful to rely on the religious teachings of unity and grace.

, Forgiveness is making a shift in your thinking so that you no longer have the desire to seek revenge or ill will toward the person that you feel has wronged you.Keep in mind that forgiving a person is not the same thing as condoning their actions. Forgiveness is the conscious decision to release your negative thoughts toward the other person so that your own well-being can improve. Remember, you can forgive and still take action to protect yourself from future betrayal.

, Decide whether you want to tell the person directly that you have forgiven her or whether you’d prefer to privately release the grudge.Your decision will probably depend on the specifics of the situations and your own individual comfort level. Here are ways that you can let go of the grudge publically or privately:


Call the person up or ask to meet with her in person. Tell her directly that you forgive her. You can say something like, “I was upset that you said those things behind my back. However, I have decided to forgive you and not let that impact out friendship.”
If you decide to release the grudge in private, you can simply say out loud to yourself, “I forgive Kim for hurting me.” Say as much as you feel compelled to say about the situation. You could also write a letter and then discard it. The point is to give yourself the opportunity to actually release the grudge, even if it is in private.

, They can really help to prevent similar situations from reoccurring again. The boundaries may adjust again as time elapses, but in the beginning it is a very important component of rebuilding trust.


For example, let’s say that you found out that your best friend was gossiping about you. One of the boundaries that you might implement is to limit the amount of time that you spend around her for a while; until the trust is rebuilt.

Give the person space.,
Approach the subject head-on.,
State what you're feeling.,
End the relationship.",How to Deal With Mixed Signals2," One option is to just back off a bit to let the person figure out his or her feelings. If you back off, the person may realize one of two things. First, the person may miss you, making them decide that they really want to be with you. The second option is the person may not miss you, and they may find it easy to move on. Either way, you've got an answer., If you're getting mixed signals from your boyfriend or girlfriend or even someone you just may like but haven't approached, the best way to deal with it is to bring it up with him or her. The person may not even realize they're giving off mixed signals.Consider how far along you are in the relationship. If you've only been on a couple of dates, having a serious commitment talk is going to scare the other person off. In that case, you can still bring it up, just keep it more lighthearted.
Similarly, if you're just trying to see if someone likes you, you're going to approach the conversation a bit differently, by feeling out whether the person is into you or not.

, Start by bringing up the conversation. Use ""I"" statements to describe what you've been feeling, rather than ""you"" statements. ""You"" statements can come across as accusatory, making the other person feel defensive, while ""I"" statements focus on the problem and what you're feeling.For instance, you don't want to say, ""You are so wishy-washy. You should make up your mind.""
Instead, you could say, ""I feel like I've been getting mixed signals from you lately. I can't tell if you really want to be with me or not.""
If you're still new to a relationship, you could say something like, ""I know we've only been on a few dates, but I like you a lot. I'm just curious if we're on the same page.""

, Another option is to simply end the relationship. If you feel like the other person is playing with you, it's entirely appropriate to move on. You deserve to have someone who wants to be with you and will tell you that openly and without reservation."

Learn the emotions behind giving mixed signals.,
Realize that it may stem from other issues.,
Make sure you're not giving mixed signals.,
Decide whether you want to be with the person or not.",How to Deal With Mixed Signals3," Some people, including yourself, don't give mixed signals on purpose. Rather, mixed signals are a sign of a deeper problem, usually a conflict between opposing values in relationships.For instance, some people always want what's on the other side. When not in a relationship, they want the connection of being in a relationship. When in a relationship, they want the independence outside of a relationship. Once they get one, the other value seems much better, so they move towards that instead. Therefore, as they get too close to someone, they instantly start moving away.
Some other pairs include control and spontaneity, freedom and responsibility, and novelty and stability. Each time the person gets one, the other becomes automatically more appealing.

, A person sending mixed signals may have nothing to do with you at all. In fact, it could be the person is insecure or has had problems in past relationships. In that case, they may have a tendency to hold you at arm's length, even when they want to be with you.If you suspect this is the problem, start a dialogue about it. You could say, ""I sense that you really like me, but I feel like you want to keep me at arm's length. Is there a reason you have a tendency to do that?""

, Sometimes, a person will turn cold on you if they feel like you're doing it to them. Make sure you aren't guilty of doing the thing you're accusing the other person of.Try to think. Do you hold the person at arm's length? Are you warm one day but push the person away the next?
Do you cancel dates even when you don't have a good reason to?

, You may have been focused on the other person and their indecisiveness, but you might not have stopped to consider whether you want to be with that person or not. Check in with yourself to make sure you actually enjoy that person's company to see whether or not the person is worth fighting for.Do you like spending time with the person? Do you constantly want to spend more time with the person?
Are you interested in what the person thinks and feels?
Do you value their thoughts and opinions? The answers to these questions can help you decide whether you want to be with the person or not.

Watch for a control freak.,
See if the person wants to spend time with you.,
Make sure the person shows an interest you.,
See if the person laughs at your jokes.,
Watch out for perfectionists.,
Look at how the person treats other people.,
Pay attention to physical closeness.",How to Deal With Mixed Signals4," If you're dating someone, you want to know ahead of time if that person is going to want to control every single aspect of your relationship. One way you can check for this trait is to watch for someone who will not vary their schedule or routine at all. Try changing a date to another time to see if the person can roll with it.This symptom can also be a sign that the person is not willing to compromise, another bad sign.
Either way, you probably want to get out of this relationship.

, Someone who loves you, or at least likes you, will want to spend time with you without you feeling the need to beg. That person will make time for you because they enjoy your company and want to develop a relationship.Pay attention to whether or not the person actively makes space for you in their lives. Do they say yes to plans? To they call you to ask you out? Do you see them at least once a week, most of the time?

, Of course, everything isn't about you all the time. However, the person you're with should show an interest in you, asking you about your day and what's going on in your life. They should ask your opinion, meaning they will at least hear your side of the story without trying to shut you down., While it may seem silly, if someone is attracted to you, they will usually laugh at your jokes. Now of course, not every joke will get a belly laugh, but most of the time, they should at least crack a smile., Many people have a perfectionist streak, and that's not a problem. However, if that person turns that streak on you, it can be a problem. In other words, if the other person is always critical of you, always looking for your flaws, that can be a sign that they don't want to commit. Usually, it's not about you at all, but rather, the fact that they're not ready for intimacy.The opposite of this person is one who constantly tries to build you up. They actively want to make you feel good about yourself, and look for ways to compliment you and your achievements.One way to recognize what type of person you're with is to see how they react when someone else criticizes you. Does your boyfriend or girlfriend defend you or stay silent?

, At the beginning of the relationship, the person may be treating you just fine, while he or she treats waiters and other people they see as ""below"" them with rudeness and contempt. This red flag tells you that they can easily turn that meanness on you, and that they're not a very good person to begin with., A person who likes you will generally show that affection physically. That doesn't have to mean sex or even kissing, depending on your relationship. However, it can mean the person will reach out and touch your arm while talking or put an arm around you when you're next to each other. These small signs of physical touching can mean the person likes you.The opposite is sometimes true, though not always. In other words, a person who doesn't seem to want to touch you could mean the person's not attracted to you. However, it could also mean that the person has had some trauma in their past and therefore, has trouble with physical intimacy.

Turn them away.,
Request some notice.,
Embrace time limits.,
Designate policies.,
Establish consequences.",How to Deal with Friends Who Invite Themselves over Without Asking1," One easy way to set limits when a friend shows up unannounced is to turn them away and then explain later that you cannot usually hang out unless you know ahead of time because you are so busy. The next time a friend drops by unannounced, say something like, “I’m sorry, but I am getting ready to leave so I can’t hang out right now. I’ll call you later, okay?”

Then, later on, call or text and say something like, ""Things have been so hectic lately, I generally can't hang out unless we arrange it ahead of time."";
, If the act of showing up announced bothers you more than the person’s company, say something. It can be as simple as, “It’s nice to see you, but I’d appreciate a phone call next time” or, “I’m happy to get together with you, but I’d like to know earlier in the day if you plan to stop by.” If it’s an enduring problem, make it very clear to the person you’d like some notice before they show up.


For a more direct response, say, “I know you enjoy coming over here and I enjoy seeing you, but I dislike you dropping in. In the future, I’d like it if you called ahead of time to see if I am available.”

, If someone invites themselves to stay with you for an indefinite amount of time, beware. Ask for specific dates. If the person needs some time to get on their feet or wants to stay until they find their own place, set some firm limits on how long you are willing to host them. You don’t want them to wear out their welcome, so make sure you can enjoy them while they are there and not begin to resent them.If you know someone plans to come stay with you, you can say ""Here's what we were thinking. You could come in on Monday, we can do XYZ activities, and then you can head out on Wednesday before we have to do (insert activity). How does that sound?"" You setting up the timeline will prevent you from having to tell them no.
Some say three days is the perfect limit for houseguests. Others extend their welcome to one week. Choose a limit that feels good to you that you know you can live with.

, If lots of friends invite themselves over or use your house as a place to crash, you might want to make some sweeping changes to what is and is not allowed.For example, if people want to use your home as a party center, make it clear that you are not okay with that and will not tolerate it. Make a policy that you are not open to host friends of friends. If people do stay at your place, say that you are not available to drive them or show them around town.


Whatever policies you decide on, communicate them clearly to your friends. Say, “There have been lots of people over recently, and I find it really draining. I need to set some limits on what I can handle in terms of people coming over, including who comes over and what I’m willing to do.”

, Make consequences clear to someone who doesn’t see how they are affecting you. For example, if someone is at your door and you have asked them to leave yet they refuse, know what you will do or say to enforce yourself. You can say, “I’ve asked you to leave, yet you are still here. You won’t be welcome to come over if this continues to happen.”


If the person is a nuisance, say, “If you do not leave within 5 minutes, I will call the police on you.”

Be specific about the friend’s creepy behavior.,
Voice your concerns.,
Talk about conflicts.,
Don’t create ultimatums.,
Ask your partner to talk to them.,
Request to look over invite lists.",How to Deal with Your Partner's Creepy Friend1," Being able to refer to a few specific examples or types of behavior will help you express your concerns more fully and clearly to your partner. Try to determine exactly which types of behavior you find creepy, and address those behaviors directly.

For example, instead of just telling your partner, “Jordan acts creepy with me sometimes,” say, “Jordan isn’t very respectful of my personal space. Sometimes he touches me in ways that make me uncomfortable.”;
, While it’s normal to have opinions about your partner’s friends, you shouldn’t feel uneasy around them. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable, let your partner know. You don’t have to be mean or judgmental, just express how you feel and say what’s been said or done that’s creeped you out.For example, say, “Regan makes me feel uncomfortable, especially when you leave the room. There have been times what he’s said has crossed the line.”

, If the creepy friend is affecting your relationship with your partner, talk about it. Friendships can cause tension in relationships, so be honest and talk openly about what is bothering you about their friend. Talk about how the friend is affecting your relationship and come up with some potential solutions or compromises.For example, you can say, “Our differences are causing us problems because we can’t see eye to eye on your friend. I know he’s important to you. If you hang out with him, can it be someplace outside of our house?”

, It’s unfair to say things such as, “You can choose to hang out with your friend or you can choose to be my partner.” Your partner may be unwilling to part with a friend or disrupt the social group. Don’t expect your partner to immediately comply with your demands. Instead, focus on coming to a reasonable compromise that respects both of you.For example, say, “I can’t tell you who your friends are, but I’d appreciate it if you let me know ahead of time when your friend is coming over.”

, If your partner wants to remain friends with someone who makes you feel uneasy, ask your partner to talk to them about their behavior. It might feel less threatening for your partner to speak than for you to speak to them. Raise your concerns with your partner and let them know what you want to be said.


For example, your partner can pull them aside and say, “My girlfriend doesn’t like it when you make comments about her body. Please stop doing that.”

, If your partner is inviting people over, ask to look at who they’re planning to invite. Especially if you share a place together, contribute some input to the list. If there are people you’d feel more comfortable not inviting, let your partner know. You should feel comfortable in your own home.


If you’re planning a trip, request that the person who is creepy not be invited, as you’d rather not spend extended periods of time with them.

Have a discussion.,
Be direct.,
Be polite.,
Set limits.,
Evaluate the friendship.",How to Deal with Friends Who Invite Themselves over Without Asking2," If someone invites themselves over frequently, don’t expect them to magically go away without you saying something. If you’re uncomfortable with the frequent drop-ins or unexpected visits, it’s up to you to put a stop to it. Especially if you’ve been silent, your friend may think you’re happy to see them when they drop over. It’s time to confront the behavior and make some changes.


Choose when to have the discussion. You may want to write an email, make a phone call, or talk to the person face-to-face. It’s up to you how you want to discuss it.

, Subtlety may not be the best approach in dealing with a friend who’s constantly over. If you say, “I’m really busy right now” or, “I have to rush off to something” and your friend doesn’t seem to get the hint, it’s likely you need to be more clear and direct.If you’re feeling crowded by someone, let them know in a clear and direct way.


For example, say, “I need more time to myself, so I won’t be able to hang out as much for a while. Let’s plan to get together once a week from now on.” Be sure to make this discussion about you and your needs, not about them and not wanting them around.

, There’s no need to argue or show anger toward someone who doesn’t realize they are intruding. Don’t wait until you can’t take it anymore and explode on the unsuspecting person. You can be polite and courteous yet still get your point across. Start with a positive statement then state your needs.For example, you can say, “I enjoy seeing you, but having you over all the time takes a toll on my body. Perhaps we can find time to meet in other places besides my home.”

, Whether you don’t want your friend coming over to your home at all or whether you’d like the visits shortened or less frequent, set some limits and be clear about your desires and expectations. If the person is showing up once each week, ask them to come once a month. If the person comes over and then stays for hours, shorten visits to one hour or less. Talk about your expectations.For example, you can say, “I like speaking with you, but I need our visits to be shorter. There are things I like and need to do that I can’t do while you’re over.”

, If this person causes you more headache than harmony, it might be time to evaluate your friendship. Think about whether you want to continue being friends with this person or whether it may be time to say goodbye. Some people are toxic and can negatively affect your life. If this person helps you out and is there for you, you may want to continue being friends. Yet, if they are not and instead take more than they give, you may want to reconsider the friendship.Why do you continue to be friends with this person? Are they responsive to any of your requests?
If you’ve had enough of this person and want to discontinue the friendship, say, “I’ve asked you many times not to show up unannounced and without asking. This friendship is not good for me and it’s best we say goodbye.”

Check with your body.,
Notice what energizes and drains you.,
Prioritize your needs.,
Tolerate others’ reactions.",How to Deal with Friends Who Invite Themselves over Without Asking3," If you generally say yes to most requests, you may lose touch with how you actually feel about having someone in your house. If someone shows up at your door and says, “Can I come in?” or, “Can I stay over?” take a moment and tune into your body. If you’re genuinely happy to see them, let them in. However, if you don’t want to get up to open the door, your first reaction is a groan, or you feel knots in your stomach after they ask, it’s clear that the person is not welcome.If you get a “no” answer from your body, tell your friend, “This isn’t a good time. I’m sorry.”
Sometimes it can be helpful to talk through how you are feeling with your partner or a trusted friend to get to the bottom of how you really feel.

, There may be some situations that excite you and some that deplete you depending on whether you are an introvert or extrovert. Introverts prefer to spend most of their time alone, while extroverts prefer to spend most of their time with other people. If you are not sure which type you are, then you can take the Myers & Briggs test to find out.For example, you may feel excited when an old friend shows up unannounced, yet feel depleted after they stay for more than a few hours. Are there situations that feel good and others that feel bad? Are there certain people you can tolerate and others you cannot? Begin to notice what situations energize you and which ones drain you. This can help you to become clearer on what limits you can set and how you might enforce them.For example, you might like the person who drops in, but hate that they come to unload all of their negativity onto you.

, If you’re constantly bending your own needs to accommodate others, you may lose sleep, feel angry or upset, lose money, or overextend yourself. If you know that having someone over will drain you or affect you negatively, say something.You can say, “I’m really stressed and I need some alone time right now” or, “I’m working on a project and I need to concentrate by myself.”
If you notoriously neglect your own needs, get into a routine of taking some time for relaxation. Join a yoga class, talk a daily walk, or meditate on a regular basis. This can help you deal with stress and not let things compound over time.If you are an introverted personality type, then it is especially important to regularly schedule in time for isolation and quiet. This will help keep you charged for social interaction.

, You might say yes to everything to avoid making others upset, yet this can lead you to feel unhappy or taken advantage of. If you fear someone’s disappointment, remember that a lack of boundaries can lead to long-term resentment or bitterness over time. If something makes you unhappy or resentful, that’s not fair to you. It’s okay to say no, even if the other person doesn’t like it.If someone becomes upset, say, “I understand this isn’t what you expected, but I’m afraid I can’t help you this time. I’m sorry you’re disappointed.”

Deal with your triggers.,
Give the person the benefit of the doubt.,
Try to understand where they are coming from.,
Find some redeeming qualities.,
Be polite.,
Limit your time with them.,
Put yourself in safe environments.,
Assert yourself.",How to Deal with Your Partner's Creepy Friend2," Perhaps this person reminds you of another person who hurt you before. They might look like that person, act like that person, or have similar hobbies as that person. If you feel like you’re reminded of someone who’s hurt you through your partner’s creepy friend, recognize that this may have more to do with you than them. Cope with your triggers around the friend by relaxing, detaching, and taking a few deep breaths to calm down.If you’ve been traumatized and have not dealt with the trauma, consider working with a therapist. Through therapy, you can gain self-awareness, and learn to develop skills to cope and move past the trauma. Even if you don’t like your partner’s friend, you can begin to be around them without feeling threatened or scared.

, If the person says something you dislike, ask yourself if you’re taking their words personally. Perhaps you can put a positive spin on something you originally interpreted as weird or inappropriate. Putting a positive spin on something makes you more likely to cope better with the words or actions.For example, if the person comments negatively about something you’ve expressed positively, write it off as them sharing their opinion, even if it felt inappropriate. Reassure yourself that it’s okay for others to share their opinions.

, It’s possible that the person is unaware that their behavior is making you uncomfortable, or that your discomfort stems from a cultural misunderstanding. If you are in doubt about their motives, try talking to them in order to get a better understanding of their point of view.

At the same time, stand your ground. Try to understand their perspective, but be firm about setting boundaries.

, You may be quick to come up with things you do not like about this person, but try to earnestly think of some things that you might grow to like about them. Find if there is anything you have in common which can bring you together on one point. Finding something in common can make them feel less threatening.For example, you might both enjoy dogs and find a way to connect over having a dog.

, If you just can’t seem to connect with this person, commit to at least treating the person with respect and politeness. You may not get along, but this person is your partner’s friend, so make an effort not to start something that might affect the person and your relationship.If you find yourself needing to speak to them, keep it polite, cordial, and simple. Keep your interactions brief and pleasant.

, If this person makes you truly uncomfortable, opt to not spend time with them. If your partner invites them over, get out of the house. If they are at an event, don’t go out of your way to speak with them. Do your best to keep interactions brief or non-existent.Ask your partner to let you know when this person will be around. Then, make an effort to do something else or go somewhere on your own.

, If the person makes you feel physically uncomfortable, find safety. For example, if you find the two of you alone together, move to a location with other people. If they are physically too close to you and you feel violated, move away to a place you feel safe or have more space.Seek out your partner or other friends nearby to connect with people who make you feel safe.

, If your partner’s friend speaks inappropriately to you or touches you in a way that feels invasive, speak up. Let them know that you feel uncomfortable. Set firm boundaries so that they know what behavior is unacceptable. If you need to speak up to stop feeling uncomfortable, do so.For example, say, “Please do not touch me, it makes me feel uncomfortable.”
If the person says inappropriate things to you or around you, say, “I don’t like when you speak that way and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Please don’t say those things around me.”

Expect the last night to be the hardest.,
Be supportive:


If they met the 50,00 word count, congratulate them!",How to Deal with Your Friend Doing NaNoWriMo," Really. Just be nice to them. Writing a novel in a month is tough, so be the first to understand and help others to do the same.

, Writing a novel in a month is hard enough without someone asking ""Why is there a ninja in medieval Europe?"" They're probably just trying to generate words. Chances are it's going to be edited out later. Either that or they are writing the most awesome historical fiction/historical fantasy ever. Whichever one it is, they're doing their best.


This might also be the one time where you don't want to offer constructive criticism. You might be able to if asked, but avoid it at all necessary costs. NaNoWriMo is meant for frantically writing a whole lot of words and motivating you to write. Nano authors don't have time to edit! The ones that do edit usually don't meet the word count on time. They just need to write and get out each and every idea for whatever it is that they're writing. Then, if they're so inclined, they'll edit it after November is over and turn it into something amazing. Only then may you offer constructive criticism... but still wait for permission.

, If your friend does not have earphones, you might want to prepare yourself for hearing the same playlist, or playlists, played repeatedly throughout the rest of the month. Chances are, your friend has at least one playlist or artist that they listen to while writing. You've probably heard it before. Perhaps use your own earphones to block it out when/if you get tired of it.

, Unless it's of the utmost urgency, it's best to leave them alone while they write. Writers don't usually appreciate being interrupted while they're in the zone, and they are definitely going to be in the zone several times this month. So, unless they tell you that it's okay to interrupt them for something that isn't urgent, don't do it. Just don't. Even if they do tell you that, think before you try to talk to them.

, For now their story is probably making a lot of sense. This is a good time. It's safer to ask them how the writing is going, and they may be willing to go out to the town or take a tea break or something. This is good. It's very, very good. This is also the safest time to ask them if you can read it, if they've ever let you read their writing before. This is not a certain thing, though, so unless if you have been allowed to read their work before, don't ask. In some cases you would have to pry the book from their cold, dead fingers to be able to read it before they're done.;
, They will appreciate it, and maybe remember it later in the month.

, Don't let it lead you into a false sense of security and think that it's going to be like this all night long. It won't be. If there is something that you can be completely sure of, it's that it is going to get harder.

, The first week will not necessarily be easy all the way through. Writer's block comes without warning, at any time it wants to, and your writer friend is always in danger of it. If they get writer's block in the first week, it's still better than if they get it in later weeks, though.


Let them bounce ideas off you.
Talk to them about ideas and their stories, if they want to.
Do what you can to help them get their muse back. For all you know, you might become their next muse. This is a scary responsibility, but it also means you are an extremely important person to them. So be afraid, be very afraid, but take it in stride and be happy.

, Continue being nice and leaving them to their writing when you see them typing or handwriting away. For now, it's still kind of all right. There's a possibility that they might be behind in their word count, but so far they can still convince themselves that they're fine, and they will be fine.

, Perhaps even have some parts already done, though this depends on the drink.

, It is getting closer to the end, and things are beginning to get more stressful. Depending on the writer, you can either just continue acting like it's week two, or you might have to start following the week four steps already.

, This is not an easy time for your writer friend. They might be done, they might be close to being done, or they might not. If they are behind on their word count, they may actually be insane and typing whatever they can to get the count.

, If it's coffee, have a big jug of coffee that you can just pour into a cup and zap in the microwave (and add anything else they like in their coffee). If it's tea, have a line-up of cups with bags of their favorite tea (or teas) and anything they like in their tea ready, and have the teapot constantly full. If it's some type of alcohol, have lots of bottles of it and a bottle opener, or if it's something that's mixed just have a fridge full of it.

, You should know not to disturb them by this time, but other people might not. On that note, don't disturb them unless if it is truly urgent.

, On the off chance that they don't go insane and actually say yes, they will not be very talkative. You might see them writing on napkins, popcorn buckets, etc. If this does happen, just let them do it.

, When the last day/night rolls around, if they aren't yet done, they might be insane. You might see them typing the same word over and over about ten or twenty times just to reach the word count in time. This will be edited out later if they plan to edit their nano novel. They might be seen nailing their door shut to avoid any disturbances. Remove the nails if you are so inclined, but do it quietly so they don't catch you in the act. Perhaps just stand outside of their door holding a cup of their favorite drink for when they need it.

, Let there be hugs and snacks and maybe a celebratory party, if they aren't too tired.
If they didn't, console them. They might be depressed for a while, so just support them. Encourage them to keep writing it anyway. Remind them that they can edit now if they want to. They will be just as proud if they meet the word count the week after, or in the middle of December.
They might start editing soon, or they might not. When they do, though, be more ready than ever to let them bounce ideas off of you, if that's what they want. They might be less stressed, but that isn't guaranteed. Just remember: Be nice. Critique, don't criticise. Don't read their work without permission.

Lessen contact with fake friends without terminating the relationship.",How to Deal with Fake Friends," It's not always realistic to give a fake friend a lot of your time and energy. Be aware of how much you can tolerate this person and manage your time with them accordingly.Give carefully in your relationships. You should not give someone a heavy amount of time or consideration if they consistently violate your boundaries, blow you off, or otherwise disrespect you. Fake friends tend to engage in these behaviors.
You are not required to respect someone who does not respect you. If a fake friend is difficult to make plans or spend time with, it's okay to disengage. You can still be around this person, especially if you have to in groups, but it's okay to stop reaching out on a one-to-one level or engaging this friend's drama. You should focus your emotional energy on true friends.;
, Fake friends are unlikely to change their behavior, and in some cases may eventually turn into outright bullies. Therefore, manage your expectations carefully when interacting with a fake friend. Keep in mind this interaction may very likely be negative. Preparing yourself for bad behavior can help you feel less stung or confused when it occurs.If your friend Samantha consistently gives backhanded compliments or subtly puts you down, expect as much when you're getting drinks with her. Say to yourself, ""This is just how Samantha is.""
Try not to want too much from this person. If you were invested in the relationship, and it turned out to be fake, this can be a major letdown. However, it's important you accept you cannot rely on this person for your emotional fulfillment or wellbeing.

, Fake friendships can take an ugly turn at times, and may be difficult to manage longterm. Consistently take stock of a fake friend's behavior. Watch for signs that the behavior is becoming worse, to the point it borders on bullying.You should periodically take stock of a fake friend's behavior. Ask yourself if their behavior has made you more uncomfortable or stressed lately. Has this friend been getting increasingly difficult to deal with? Is this person creating more drama for you and your other friends?
Friendships do change over time. It's possible a fake friend will change over a long period of time. Fake friends can turn into true friends over time. It's important to take stock of any changes in your relationship. If you feel someone is becoming a better friend, you may be able to continue to have this person in your life.

, When dealing with fake friends, it's easier to put your needs and wants on hold. You may find yourself bending over backwards to accommodate someone who is difficult to please. If you're having more bad times with a person than good times, make sure to put your emotional needs first. It's okay to temporarily disengage altogether, or simply give this person slightly less time and energy, if the relationship is becoming too exhausting for you., You should not engage with people who treat you in a manner you find personally unacceptable. When coping with fake friends, work on identifying what behaviors you will not tolerate. If your fake friends behave in these ways, disengage with them right away. You can identify unacceptable behaviors by the way they make you feel.If you continually experience arguments with this person that are not resolved, they may be seriously violating your boundaries. A fake friend may negate how you feel regarding their treatment, and insist you're being hypersensitive.
You should also not tolerate any behavior that makes you feel tense, anxious, or uncomfortable. Behaviors that hurt your self esteem or sense of self worth are also unacceptable.

, Fake friends can sometimes cross the line from frenemies or competitive friends to outright bullies. If a relationship has become bullying in nature, it's important you strongly consider ending it. Learn and watch for the signs of bullying in a friendship.Bullies tend to have very low self-esteem. Therefore, they seek out people to dump their insecurities and frustrations on. If a friend is becoming a bully, he or she will be increasingly critical of you. He or she may also become temperamental and consistently say and do things that hurt your feelings.
It can be hard to tell when someone has crossed the line into bullying, but it's important to be vigilant. Bullies can do great damage to self-esteem over time. Pay attention to how someone treats you. If they repetitively violate your boundaries, and do not offer an apology, this person is probably bullying you. These kinds of relationships are usually best severed.

, You want to identify true friends so you can better identify the poor behavioral patterns of fake friends. True friends are genuinely caring and supportive. They can help you identify how you deserve to be treated.A friend should make you feel consistently happy. Friends should be exciting to be around and should always be kind and respectful of your boundaries. Unlike fake friends, friends value you simply for being the person you are. They do not expect you to be anyone you're not.
Friends may offer constructive feedback on occasion, or let you know when they're worried or concerned about your behavior. Unlike fake friends, however, friends do not actively want you to feel bad. They just want what's best for you and always speak out of genuine concern for your wellbeing.

, Fake friends are often co-dependent people. They may be manipulative emotionally. They crave friendships for their own sense of stability and do not understand how to truly value others. You may not notice someone is a fake friend as codependency can often be masked as love or concern, and is rarely aggressive. If you're in a codependent, somewhat fake friendship, you need to take steps to address the issue.A codependent friend will rarely be directly assertive. In fact, they may often agree to do what you want to do. However, later on there will be consequences for their compliance. They may complain later about disliking you did together, and may begin to make increasingly unreasonable demands during social events.
A codependent friend will have difficulty accepting responsibility for their actions. They may lash out at you or deny culpability if you call them out on the ways they hurt you.
If you're in a codependent relationship, you need to strongly consider whether this relationship is worth your time. Codependent relationships can be exhausting and, in the long run, damaging.

, Fake friends will often engage in behaviors known as emotional blackmail. It's very important to tune out this kind of behavior and focus on your own sense of happiness and security. Emotional blackmail is a form of manipulation in which someone uses anger, rage, or shame to get you to behave the way they want.Fake friends can be particularly savvy at emotional blackmail, as they may hide negative comments under the guise of compliments. For example, you may do something your friend dislikes and he or she may say, ""I really thought you were better than that. I can't believe you of all people would engage in that kind of behavior.""
Emotional blackmailers may also threaten you with anger or warnings if you don't behave the way they want. For example, your friend may say something like, ""I don't know what I'll do if you don't come to this party with me. Your rejection may sting so much I'll end up drinking too much."" Emotional blackmailers try to make you feel like you are responsible for their behavior.
If someone is blackmailing you emotionally, do not engage. End conversations that are manipulative in nature and refuse to return texts or emails attempting to blackmail you.

, The first step to setting healthy boundaries is being aware of your own needs in a relationship. Everyone has certain rights going into a relationship or friendship. Identify what your rights are so you can decide whether or not a fake friend is worth your time.


What makes you feel comfortable in a relationship? What do you look for when seeking out a friend? Is it shared interests, kindness, compassion? Does this person meet those qualities?
Does this person violate your boundaries? Are they not concerned with you and your emotional wellbeing? You may need someone in your life capable of more compassion than a fake friend.

, It's not always worth it to keep up with a fake friendship. It's okay to walk away if someone's behavior is becoming increasingly troublesome for you.Think about the effect this relationship has had on your self esteem. Do you feel worse about yourself when you're around this person? Have you internalized some of their criticisms and complaints about you?
Do you ever actually want to see this person anymore? You may be hanging out due to a sense of obligation. You may also find yourself feeling tense going into meetings with this person. If this is the case, this may be a fake friendship.

, If you've determined this friendship is not worth keeping, find a graceful way to end it. You should let this person know directly you no longer want him or her in your life.While it may feel cold, it may be easier to send a text or email. This can be especially helpful if the person in question is stressful to be around. You do not have to be caustic or lay out a list of grievances. A simple email should be sufficient. Try saying something like, ""I'm sorry, but I don't think this friendship is really working for either one of us.""
Keep your emotions in check. Even if you're right to feel you were being treated poorly, blaming can escalate the situation. You want to get out with as clean a break as possible and avoid unnecessary drama and animosity.

, You may not need to end every fake friendship. If this is someone you have to see on occasion, cutting ties may not be realistic. You may have mutual friends, for example, or you may work together. Simply accept this is not someone you will see frequently one-on-one. Do not invite the person out to hang out with just you, or to attend smaller get togethers. Keep him or her on the periphery of your life."

Recognize the signs.,
Assess whether you’re the problem.,
Determine whether the friendship is toxic.,
Avoid enabling friendships.",How to Stop Being Friends With Someone1," Recognize what experts call a “friendshift” by paying careful attention to your feelings when you see photos of your friend on social media or get a call from her/him.


Realize everyone has moments in their lives when their friendship network is shifting. You only have a small amount of time and energy to devote to friendships.
Consider whether your friend makes you feel positive or negative about yourself. For example, does your friend always make passive-aggressive comments about your job or appearance? Are you more insecure after conversing with your friend? If so, it’s probably time to end the friendship.
True friends build you up positively, they don't make you doubt yourself..;
, Maybe the issues in the friendship really are issues inside of you. If that’s the case, work on the friendship or on yourself before making the decision to end it completely.


If your friend has betrayed you or broken your trust, you may need to end the friendship.
Sharing confidences and trying to undermine you at work or in a relationship are examples of betrayals that may warrant the ending the friendship. If you're the person doing those things, then you should work on yourself first.
If your reasons aren’t good ones – simple jealousy when the friend didn’t do anything to you, comes to mind – maybe you should work on yourself before you end the friendship. , Toxic friendships can actually be harmful to your health. One study found that people who had negative interactions with friends had higher level of proteins related to inflammation in their bodies that were linked to chronic conditions like depression and heart disease.


A toxic friendship is one in which the friend is always talking about negative topics, even if they are things happening to the friend. You should consider whether the negativity is situational. If the friend is just going through a hard time, the friendship might be worth saving. However, if it’s become a pattern of constant negativity, it might be time for a change – for your own sake. Researchers have found three kinds of toxic friends: Friends who are too competitive with you, friends who pick fights with you, and friends who cling to you and demand too much of your energy.
Before ending a friendship, ask yourself whether you trust the other person, whether they bring out the best in you (and you in them), and whether you think they care about you and respect you.

, These are friendships where you were brought together by a behavior that you are now trying to stop. It’s best to end a friendship like this if it’s enabling you to be a person you don't want to be.


Examples of enabling friendships are friendships based around drinking, infidelity, partying, or shopping addiction. If the glue of your friendship is a behavior that you want to change about yourself, you might have to let the friendship go for your own future.
Sometimes friendships are created through mutual crisis, such as two friends who unite because they are both having marital problems. If one friend works out the relationship and the other doesn’t, the common ground can be gone.

Choose the best time and place.,
Be honest and brief.,
Express appreciation.,
Avoid blaming and shaming.,
Let them respond.,
Show empathy.,
Stay positive.",How to Tell Someone You Don't Want to Be Their Friend Without Hurting Their Feelings1," How you decide to meet with your friend and talk about ending the friendship depends on the length of your friendship, how close you are, and how you both usually talk. Make sure you choose a time, place, and method of talking that best fits the needs of your friendship, not the one that’s just easiest or least awkward for you.If you’ve been good friends for a long time, meet in-person. See if you can meet at a place where you can have some privacy. Give them a heads up that you want to meet to talk about something important, so that they’ll set aside enough time for you.
If you’ve been friends for a short time, or you usually communicate online or on the phone, send them an email or call them.;
, You don’t have to list all of your friend’s faults, but be clear and to the point about what’s been bothering you. Getting into too much detail may be hurtful. Think of what you’d like to stay beforehand and practice it in your head or with someone you trust.If you have a new friend who is spending time with someone you don’t like, you can say, ""I enjoy spending time with you, but not Becky. I know you are very close with her, but I can’t be around her. I think for now it might be better if you and I didn't try to take our friendship further.""
If you just met a friend who has a different lifestyle than you, you can say, ""You know, I'm really flattered that you'd like to be my friend, but I’m just not into parties and I need to focus on school. The other friends you have seem to be into that, and that’s okay, but I think it would be too tempting to me to party too much. I don’t want that right now.”
If you have a good friend who has difficulty accepting your religion, you can say, ""I enjoy spending time with you, but I've been feeling insulted by you, your other friends, and your parents about my commitment to my faith. I just do not want to be around it.""

, Let your friend know you liked and cared for them. Say “thank you” for the experiences you shared. Tell them what you liked about them as a person, which will balance out and soften the blow of why you want to end the friendship.Do not be excessively flattering or generous. If you try to sweeten things with dishonest compliments, flattery, presents, or snacks, you might send them mixed messages.
Avoid giving them false hope that the friendship could continue.
You can say, ""I appreciate all the experiences we've shared during our summers together. I like that you're always trying to make sure everyone has fun.""

, Do not tell your friend it’s their fault or that something is wrong with them as a person. Instead, focus on the behavior or actions you don’t like. Do not accuse them or shame them for who they are.


For example, if you have a good friend who has started to get involved in questionable activities, you can say, ""I’ve noticed you’re spending time with people who smoke and drink more. Your friendship has meant a lot to me, but I am not comfortable around those things. That's not how I want to have fun.”

, Even if you’re very nice and respectful, this is still an emotional and uncomfortable conversation. Give your friend time and space to react. They may be angry, sad, defensive, or try to tell you you’re wrong.Stay true to your feelings. Don’t let them change your mind.
If they don’t want to listen or try to convince you to stay friends, be firm. Keep repeating a phrase like “This isn’t working out.”

, Acknowledge their feelings and express understanding of how they may be feeling. Be kind and considerate to the fact that they may be hurting. Avoid leaving right away because you’re uncomfortable. You might say:“I know you must be feeling hurt right now.”
“I’m sorry if I have hurt you.”
“I bet you’re feeling really shocked right now.”

, End the conversation by expressing gratitude and appreciation for who they are as a person, even if you no longer wish to be close with them. Encourage them and remind them of their value as a friend. You can say:“I’m so glad I got to know you.”
“I appreciate all the good times we shared together.”
“I wish you happiness and joy in your other friendships.”

Schedule a time to meet in person.,

Don't talk about anything your ex-friend has done.,
Move on.,
Practice self-care.",How to Tell Someone You Do Not Want to Be Friends1," Send her a text or an email to ask her to meet you in a neutral location. If you live in the same town, this is the best way to have the conversation about not being friends.If she asks you what you want to talk about, say something vague. For example, you might say, ""I just want to share some recent decisions with you."" If she persists, remind her that you'd rather talk about it in person.
If your friend lives out of town, send an email or text to schedule a time to talk on the phone. Obviously, in person is best, but if you live in different parts of the country this may not be an option.
Be aware that written words can easily be misinterpreted. This is one reason why talking directly to the other person, even though it's hard, is best.;
, You may have been wanting to free yourself from this friendship for a while, but when you meet with your friend, you'll need to be clear on the reasons why you're ending the friendship.If you need to tell them what they've done that's contributed to your decision, think about how you can phrase this as kindly and gently as possible.
You might not want them to know why you're ending things, and that's fine. It's okay to be vague, or to use phrases like, ""Things have changed for me...""
Don't feel like you have to justify your decision, or defend it.

, She may be upset or angry when she hears your news. Or, she may want to try to repair the friendship. You should decide ahead of time whether you'll be open to working on the friendship, or whether your decision is final.If she gets angry, you'll need to be prepared to take care of yourself. You don't need to make a scene - it's fine to simply walk away.
Unless you've decided that you're open to repairing the friendship, keep it short. You don't have to help take care of her until she feels better. Simply state what you've decided, and tell her it's time for you both to move on.
Don't get involved in debating whether or not you're right or wrong.

, If you've been friends a long time, chances are you share other friends with each other. These friends may be forced to ""choose sides"" between you and your former friend.Avoid the temptation to tell all your friends what your ex-friend did that caused you to end the friendship.
Try not to feel like you have to defend your decision to your friends, because it will only further the bad situation.

, Explain that it was just your decision. Your good friends may understand your reasons without additional explanation.Your mutual friends may also try to make you return to the friendship. If this is the case, redirect the conversation. Remind your friends that you're just trying to move on.
Don't try to turn anyone against your ex-friend. If you lose friends because of your decision, they probably weren't good friends anyway.

, Don't dwell on the decision to end your friendship - what's done is done. You made the best decision you could, if you were thoughtful. Now you don't have to think about it anymore. Rehashing the choices you made, or defending your decision (even if only to yourself!) only extends the process.It might feel strange to not have your friend in your life anymore, but you will survive.
Make sure to spend time with other friends. Try doing new things, and going new places with your other friends.

, Eat well, get enough rest, and do things you enjoy.Treat yourself with kindness and compassion, and remember that ending a friendship might involve some grief.Focusing on the positive parts of your life - the things you enjoy about the way your life is now - can help keep you from feeling sad about your lost friendship.
If you find yourself falling into negative thoughts, practice turning your thoughts to something more positive.

Consider taking over-the-counter pain medication.,
Seek therapy.",How to Deal With Exclusion," Exclusion is not your fault, and a friendship breakup does not mean that you’re a failure or that you’re doomed to never have friends again. The good thing about the high emotionality of exclusion is that it is a relatively temporary condition.This means that once you accept your feelings of exclusion they will evaporate shortly, leaving you with a clear mind to act in response.


Acknowledge feeling of anger and hurt toward whoever excluded you, but try not to dwell on them for too long. To help acceptance, remind yourself that these feelings are not permanent, but that they are teaching you something meaningful about the social world.
The pain of exclusion temporarily interferes with your ability to connect well with others, so the sooner you let yourself feel the full range of your exclusion feelings, the sooner you can get safely back in the game to do something about them.
However, the sting of rejection should not be ignored. Even though it is painful, it can send you a strong push to look elsewhere for connection or tell you that you should give up on a particular person or prospect.;
, Sometimes events can truly clue you in to parts of your behavior that are problematic for other people. Usually though, we take rejection much too personally. Upsets like not getting the job you want or being rejected by someone you want to date actually has very little to do with the unchanging parts of your personality.


Don’t make the experience into a catastrophe. Even if you have experienced exclusion or rejection before, understand that exclusion is not a negative judgment of your character. In reality, it's a sign of perceived incompatibility.
If reflection tells you that you really did do something to merit the exclusion you experienced, try apologizing. Giving a simple apology for your behavior is a good fix that can help you heal more quickly. It works well because you'll feel as though you've done something social that also addresses the issue.

, After the initial pain of rejection, most people move into an “appraisal stage,” in which they take stock and formulate their next steps.Acting to relieve this pain is natural, so what can you do to feel more included? Exclusion actually makes you more sensitive to potential signs of connection, more attentive to social cues, and more willing to please.Take advantage of this special moment of sensitivity to new connections! Ask yourself the following to see if you really want to make it work with the people who excluded you:


Was this a ""fluke"" incident where I felt excluded even despite my friends' best efforts to include me?
Are these excluders people with whom I am certain that I have a true, fulfilling connection?
Would it help me get over what happened to have a talk about it? If so, would others be willing to explain their perspectives?

, Another temptation that arises when dealing with exclusion is the urge to become angry and aggressive toward your excluders. Some people try to force others to pay attention to them in attempts to reassert a sense of control over the situation.Try learning techniques to control anger to use if these impulses creep up. When you're around people who trigger the pain of the exclusion, monitor your body for signs of anger and take steps to release it without hurting or snapping at others.
Responding by lashing out can begin a vicious cycle. People who act aggressively tend to have an even harder time gaining social acceptance.

, Whatever you decide about your excluders, it is always good to have different groups of friends to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. People often respond to rejection by seeking inclusion elsewhere to recharge self-esteem.Consider the people in your life who make you feel included. Gaining confidence through connection is important for getting back on your feet, even if you still hope to branch out and eventually continue to make new friends, too.
For example, even though your family cannot replace your social life, try spending some concentrated time with a loving parent or relative.

, If you find that the exclusion was not severe enough to stop trying to socialize with the person or people, make an effort to regain feelings of inclusion with them. You can do this without forcing it by organizing a fun day out or inviting them somewhere that you know you will feel comfortable and able to socialize (like your home or a cafe that you frequent).

, If you are being excluded over and over again by the same person (or group of people), it may count as bullying. Bullying is a serious offense that can escalate quickly, so it's important to reach out to your teachers, parents, or counselors who will address the problem with you. Look for signs that the exclusion is a form of bullying, and seek help if it is:The exclusion involves other malicious acts like making threats, spreading rumors, and launching physical or verbal attacks.
This behavior happens on an ongoing basis and shows no signs of letting up.
The excluder(s) is dangerous to you by having significantly more physical strength, popularity, or access to information that would harm you if it spread.

, Exclusion is not just embarrassing or stigmatizing, but actually quite painful. The pain of exclusion triggers the same part of your brain that physical pain does, meaning that ostracism is not just a blow to your ego. Understand that you will feel uncomfortable feelings and that letting yourself grieve in this situation is as important as keeping a broken arm in a sling. You wouldn't be out the very next day pitching a baseball game, would you?


Try taking a day to yourself to process what happened. Don't be afraid to burst out sobbing, listen to sad music that matches your mood, or yell into a pillow if you feel angry and frustrated. These feelings will pass if you express them.

, For example, try finding a confidant--someone who you can trust to listen and be understanding when you need to talk about serious personal issues (and vice versa). This way, even if you venture out and take some risks socially, you know that you will never be left without anyone to turn to.

, Some of the pain of rejection comes from the fact that many of us have rigid standards and ""shoulds"" for what a social life should look like. Remember that it's not always realistic to expect to be a social butterfly with tons of different groups clamoring for your time. Satisfying social lives come in many forms, and it is the quality of relationships, not how many you have, that makes you feel connected and included


For many people, having one or two deep friendships with lots of care and time involved is more fulfilling than having many friends who are hard to connect with one-on-one., When you are confident in yourself, fewer and fewer social encounters really feel like exclusions (even if you get just as many invites as you did before developing your confidence!) Confidence is a state of mind that involves understanding that regardless of how you feel now, there will always be a place for you and all of the unique gifts that you bring to the table. Trust in the fact that the cards fall the way they do in order to teach you something meaningful. The hard part is dropping your expectations and beliefs about how things ""should"" turn out.Focus on past successes and the qualities that you have that contributed to that success. Use these qualities to improve other parts of your life, like making new friends.
One common reaction to exclusion is to play the role of the victim by pouting and moping in excess. But, being a victim signals to other people that you expect to be befriended. This is typically not an attitude that draws people in, and it can make you put less effort into making friends without you even realizing it.

, Of course, this can't be done completely--nor should you dedicate too much energy to escaping the memory. Just make efforts not to engage with specific people or return to the scenes of exclusion when possible.


Since exclusion is such an emotional event, memory triggers can still bring painful feelings well after you make peace with what happened.
For example, if your excluders are your peers at school you might not be able to avoid them in class. However, try to have as little face time as possible at lunch and after classes.

, The endorphins that are released during cardiovascular exercise are notoriously helpful for elevating mood.Especially if feeling excluded is contained to one event, this can help you deal with the immediate emotional aftermath. Try to integrate brisk walks into your routine, at the minimum, or try activities like running, cycling, swimming, and high intensity yoga.

, You may want to consider taking the suggested dose of acetaminophen (like Tylenol) at night when you go to sleep and in the morning waking up. Doing this can help diminish the hurt feelings that usually arise with social rejection because it lowers the sensitivity of our neural censors for pain.OTC medications such as acetaminophen have a risk of side effects. You should check with your doctor before taking any medication, especially if you plan to use acetaminophen for an ""off label"" purpose (off label meaning that you are taking the drug for reasons other than what the FDA has approved it for treatment of a condition, the conditions that are listed on the label)., When exclusion occurs frequently or one instance stays on your mind for a long period of time, you can feel seriously devastated. Since depression, substance abuse, and suicide are common for people dealing with long-term ostracism, take steps to get a handle on your feelings as soon as possible.Psychologists can help you talk through these feelings and make behavioral modifications that will be more likely to bring about success socially.

Communicate the reasons.,
Do it in person.,
Do it kindly.,
Recognize the positives and the negatives of the formal approach.,
Pick the right occasion and situation.",How to Stop Being Friends With Someone2," You should think long and hard about why you really want to end the friendship. Before you communicate this to the other person – and you should – you should understand yourself why you don’t want to be the person’s friend anymore.


Be very clear. It’s important that you provide clarity. However, you don’t need to revisit every single past problem or negative detail. But if you aren’t clear (and firm), the person may keep trying. However, do come prepared with specific reasons. If the friend has truly done something to warrant the break – or if you’ve just grown in different directions – they deserve to know, clearly, the reason why. But you should say it in a kind way. Instead of saying, “you are interested in frivolous things while I’ve developed an interest in more intellectual pursuits” you could say “as we’ve gotten older, we just seem to have less in common.” In other words, frame it positively.
Be honest with the other person – and with yourself. Is there a hidden reason that is really bothering you that even you are avoiding?

, It will lessen the hurt if you explain the break in person. So ask the person you don’t want to be friends with anymore to coffee. Ending a friendship over text message or email will ensure the hardest of feelings.


Be aware the friend may try to bargain with you and save the relationship. If this is not something you’re willing to entertain, stay extremely firm in the conversation.
Start your sentences by explaining how you feel rather than castigating the friend for what he or she has done to you. This will make the conversation feel less like an attack to the other person. You could say something like, “I feel like my life has moved in another direction, and this is what’s best for me.”
You don’t need to stay around for very long at this meeting. They are either going to get angry probably or try to get you to change your mind. So it’s best to give them your reasons and make your statement, and then excuse yourself nicely and say you have to go. , Ending a friendship is bound to cause negative feelings in the other person, such as hurt, confusion, and anger. Whatever your grievances, you should recognize this, and show empathy and kindness.


Don’t gossip about your former friend after you end the friendship. Your grievances against the friend are no one else’s business, and gossip is just not nice.
Show some sympathy and patience. Let the friend explain how he or she feels and acknowledge that their feelings are hurt. Explain that you are sorry about causing them bad feelings. This can go a long way.
Find a way to allow your friend to preserve his or her dignity. Instead of saying, “I don’t want to be your friend,” you could say something like, “I can’t be the friend you want me to be.” This puts more of the responsibility on your own shoulders and will make it easier for the former friend to accept. Try to avoid assigning blame. It’s not really necessary and will make the confrontation worse (unless there was a deep betrayal. Then, it’s probably a good idea to articulate that). But if your friend just annoys you or you don’t find them interesting anymore, why hurt their feelings by saying so?

, There are going to be pros and cons when it comes to any method you choose for ending a friendship. It’s not an easy thing to do. That’s true of the formal method too.


One of the negatives to the formal method is it’s uncomfortable and awkward. There are bound to be hard feelings in this meeting, and you will probably dread it.
If you’ve known a friend for a very long time, though, this approach is probably the best. It’s basically giving them the courtesy of a formal ending. If the friend is not as close of a friend and you’ve known them a short time, there’s less need to go this route.
This approach will end the friendship the most quickly. It provides clarity and is more considerate to your former friend in the long run, even though they may not recognize that at the time.

, You will increase the chances that the formal ending will go badly if you don’t choose the right time to confront your soon-to-be-former friend. Timing is everything.


Calling the friend when they are at work, are going through a crisis, or are in a public situation may not work very well. A public place, like a restaurant or coffee shop, is probably a better idea. It allows for some airing of grievances but will likely prevent the worst kind of reaction, such as screaming or excessive tears.

Let it fade out.,
Let go of guilt.,
Recognizing the pros and cons of passive rejection.,
Don’t ghost.",How to Stop Being Friends With Someone3," One way to end a friendship is to let it fade instead of cutting it off in a dramatic showdown. Maybe the friendship just seems like it has run its course.


Slowly contact the person less. For example, if you were talking four times a week, reduce it to one time per week. Sometimes people using the fade out method will keep the person on their social media friend lists, but just contact them less. This is basically a way to downgrade a friendship but avoid dramatic confrontation. You could suggest a cooling-off period in the hopes that the person will start forging other friendships and start fading away from you when it ends.
Don’t be available when she (or he) wants to meet. After enough such excuses, the friend may just move on to asking other people to go, naturally reducing the friendship. , It’s normal for people to change friends over the course of a lifetime and to go through different life cycles, in which their interests change.


If the former friend has really done something grievous to you, such as a clear betrayal, you are actually doing something empowering by ending the relationship. You shouldn’t feel guilty about standing up for yourself or weeding out negative influences.
For example, the people you had things in common with in college might not make the best of friends anymore if your life goes in a different direction from theirs both in terms of family or career.

, Passive rejection is the term given to friendships you just allow to fade out. It means you avoid direct confrontation with the person you are rejecting.


One benefit of this kind of rejection is that it can minimize angry feelings because the person being rejected might not realize it, and there is not a showdown with negative words shared. One negative of this kind of rejection is that it can take a long time and requires a certain dishonesty. You’re not leveling with the person about what you’re really doing.
If you’re extremely close to the friend and have known them for a very long time, the fade out approach may not work. They will perceive the change too dramatically, and they will probably call you out on it.

, “Ghosting” is a term that recently became popular when Charlize Theron broke up with Sean Penn. Whether applied to a romantic relationship or a friendship, it means you just vanish on the other person completely and stop talking to them all at once without telling them why.


This method is cruel to the person who used to be your friend. They will spend weeks wondering what they did wrong, and they will probably contact you again to seek answers. Thus, this method of ending a friendship won’t cause the other person to stop contact; it will make them try to contact you more.
Ghosting removes the possibility of closure for the other person. It’s never a good idea to end a friendship by causing hurt in another person. Furthermore, without the possibility of closure, the other person won’t feel like the friendship is completely over.
Ghosting has been called the “ultimate silent treatment.” It is not an honest reckoning of what went wrong in the friendship, which prevents growth in the person whose friend you don’t want to be anymore. If the other person has done something to harm your friendship, telling them will allow them to work on those things to better themselves for future friendships. "

Set boundaries.,
Avoid drama.,
Let yourself grieve.,
Learn from the experience.,
Remember that sometimes relationships end.",How to Tell Someone You Don't Want to Be Their Friend Without Hurting Their Feelings2," You may still have to see your former friend at school or work. Try to make the transition from friendship easier by avoiding them, avoiding drama, and avoiding sending mixed signals.Spend less time together or break off all contact.
Unfollow or hide each other on social media.
Avoid sitting next to each other in class or at work.
Keep other supportive people around.
Keep things light. Shift how much you rely on them or confide in them.

, Avoid insulting them or badmouthing them to others if you do have to interact with them. Even though you’re growing apart, you used to be friends or liked each other at one point. There’s no need to be mean to them in public or talk about them behind their back. , Give yourself time to cry and express your hurt, just like you would if you had broken up with a romantic interest. This grieving process is especially important if you were very close or friends for a long time. Ways you can grieve include:Talking to other friends and loved ones
Spending time at home with things that comfort you, like your pet or a favorite TV show
Getting outside and exercising
Journaling

, Once you’ve had time apart from your friend, think about how you felt in the friendship and what you learned from it. Reflect on what went well and wrong in the friendship, what qualities annoyed you about your friend, and what you’d do differently in the future.


Look at your own behavior, not just theirs.
Learn what limits you need to set with friends in the future.
Avoid friends who ask too much of you or always expect you to listen to their problems., Friendships, just like romantic relationships, have a natural life cycle. This means you might be drawn together because of things you have in common, like work, school, or hobbies, but as you get older and your interests change, you may grow apart from each other naturally. Sometimes you just outgrow people, and that’s okay."
"
Avoid them in-person.,
Avoid your phone.,
Stay busy.,
Disconnect from them on social media.",How to Tell Someone You Don't Want to Be Their Friend Without Hurting Their Feelings3," Sometimes the more direct approach of talking is too hurtful or inappropriate, particularly if you haven’t been friends with the other person for long. Try avoiding them when you see them. They’ll eventually get the hint and leave you alone, but this could take awhile.If you’re in school or work together, you could walk the other way whenever you see them.
If you have to be around them, avoid talking to them for too long. Focus your conversation and attention on others.
Keep in mind that if you were close friends, this type of avoidance may be confusing to the other person and cause conflict., Your friend/acquaintance may still try to interact with you outside of seeing you in person. Do not respond to their text messages, emails, or phone calls.


If you’re hesitant to immediately stop responding to all of their texts or calls, you can gradually stop responding to them.Especially avoid responding to text messages or calls that occur late at night or ones that try to pull you into drama. Responding to them with help will send them a mixed message that you’re available to them as a friend.
If you haven’t already given them your phone number, make sure you don’t at this point.

, Make sure to spend more time with other friends or with your family. Do not accept any invitations to spend time with this person, especially for anything one-on-one.


Give excuses. Anytime they invite you out, tell them you have a doctor’s appointment, plans with your family or another friend, or that you’re not feeling well. They’ll likely get the hint and stop inviting you to things.If they express concern or surprise at you not wanting to spend time with them, you may need to address it directly. You can say, “I know I’ve been fading out, but I just don’t have the time or energy to connect with you as often anymore. I’m sorry.”, Stop interacting with them online. Avoid commenting on or liking their pictures and posts. Adjust the privacy settings on your social media accounts so that they cannot see or comment on anything you post. Consider blocking them or hiding them from your account.

Use the ""fade out"" method.,
Decline invitations from the person.,
Excuse yourself from conversations.,
Take a more active approach to ending the friendship.",How to Tell Someone You Do Not Want to Be Friends2," Gradually seeing the person less often might be happening naturally, or you might need to consciously apply these steps. This is a good way to let someone know you don't want to be friends without verbally explaining it to them.This method is appropriate for casual friends who you don't really know very well.
If the person is a new friend, this method is less leaving a friendship than it's simply an acknowledgment that you never really became friends.
It might take a longer time to leave a friendship this way.

, One way that you can start to minimize contact with the person is by declining invitations to do things. This may require you to tell a little white lie now and then to get out of something.For example, if the person asks if you want to go see a movie sometime over the weekend, then you might say something like “That sounds cool, but I already have a ton going on this weekend, so I really can’t.”

, You may bump into the person while you are trying to build distance between the two of you, so you will need to know how to deal with those situations. Ignoring the person could lead to hurt feelings and awkwardness, so instead try to give polite excuses for why you can’t stay and talk.


For example, you could politely say hello to the person and then say something like, “Sorry I can’t stay and chat. I am already running late. Maybe some other time!”
Try to be as polite and considerate as possible. Even if you do not want to be friends with the person anymore, you never know when you might bump into each other again and keeping things civil will reduce the chance of an awkward run-in., If your attempts to politely and gradually end the friendship do not help, then you can also try telling the person that you don't want to be friends anymore. You may just have to be direct and say something like, “You are a great person, but we are just too different. I wish you all the best, but I think we should stop spending so much time together.”


Try to avoid the strategy called “ghosting.” Ghosting is when you cut off all contact with the person. For example, you would need to ignore the person’s texts and emails, stop returning phone calls, and unfriend the person on social media. Ghosting can lead to hurt feelings, anger, and concerns about your well-being, so it is not ideal."

Ask the individual to leave.",How to Uninvite Someone from a Party," If you're going to uninvite someone, you should not do it by text or email. It's an unpleasant situation, but depersonalizing it will only add to the hurt feelings. Texts, emails, and social media correspondences are best for casual communication, but uninviting someone requires a bit more tact and diplomacy.Uninvite the person during a face-to-face conversation. If that isn't possible (like if the person lives out of town), a phone call is the next best thing.
Be polite but remain firm in your convictions.
Say something like, ""I know that I had initially invited you to the party, but I feel like the situation is different now. I don't want to hurt your feelings or upset you, but I think it would be best if you didn't come."";
, The situation is difficult and it's certainly stressful for you, but putting it off will not make it any easier. You're going to have to have a frank conversation with that individual eventually, and the sooner you do it the sooner you can unwind and get back to planning for your fun party.Waiting to uninvite someone will only build tension, and it may make it more inconvenient for the uninvited guest if she has to make travel plans or arrange for a babysitter, for example.

, Consider and prepare for any questions that may come up when you uninvite the person — after all, he will probably want to know why you changed your mind or suddenly he is not welcome at the event. Understand that this may lead into a more in-depth, difficult conversation — uninviting the person may force you to talk about something like a behavior issue or an addiction. Think about why you are uninviting the person and the best way to discuss this with them before you have that conversation.

Try writing out what you want to say and your reasons for uninviting the guest. Think about the other person's point of view and how you would feel in his position. Though you may be upset, prepare to listen to his perspective with respect and compassion., Uninviting someone may hurt that individual's feelings, but lying to her about your reasons could make a tough situation even worse. If the uninvited guest finds out why she was uninvited and your story contradicts the truth, it could do more damage than the revoked invitation alone would have done.Tell the individual why you're uninviting her. If it's because of a fight, or because she recently broke up with a close friend, let the individual know that's your reason.
If you're uninviting someone but still value her friendship, let them know that it's not personal. Reiterate that you don't want to offend her but would prefer that she didn't come.
Imagine you are uninviting a friend to your daughter's birthday party. When she asks why she is no longer invited you may need to say something like, ""When you were at Jeff's birthday party last weekend, you got drunk and said some really offensive things. It made everyone really uncomfortable and upset. I want my daughter's birthday to be drama-free, and for the focus to be on her, and right now I don't feel that I can trust you to come and not make another scene."" If you want to continue being friends with this person, you may offer to help her with her drinking problem, or encourage her to make amends to the people she offended. Let her know that you want to help her, but that this party is about your daughter and making sure she has a great day.

, Not all party invitations are sent online, but many are. If you created an event for your party on a social media platform like Facebook, you can remove people from the event's list of invited people. This individual will not receive any notification that you've uninvited him; he will simply stop getting messages and notifications about the party, and it will not appear in his upcoming events list after you remove him from the list.Navigate to your party's event page.
On the right side of the page you should see a list of guests sorted by the following categories: ""going,"" ""maybe,"" and ""invited.""
Search for the individual you would like to uninvite and click the ""x"" next to that person's name.

, Whether you accidentally invited the individual through a mass online invitation or that person heard about your party through the grapevine, it may be best to be direct with the individual. Let her know that you didn't mean to invite her, and consider explaining why she is not invited.If you don't want someone at your party because she tends to insult others or get too drunk, tactfully tell this person about your reasons.
For example, you might say something like, ""I'm really sorry but I think it would be best if you didn't come to my party. You have a tendency to (drink too much/say mean things/etc.), and I don't want that happening at my party.""If you think this individual can behave himself or herself, then you may want to offer her a chance to improve her behavior. You could say something like, ""You can come if you promise not to ______ at the party.""

, If you don't want to acknowledge the person's problematic behavior but still don't want him at your party, you might try making up an excuse for why he can't come. Remember, however, that making up an excuse can be just as uncomfortable as telling the person the truth about why he is uninvited.


Try telling the individual that too many people said they are coming and that you'd rather meet with him one-on-one for coffee instead of at the already-crowded party.
If you're co-hosting the party with someone, like another friend or a significant other, you might say that the co-host asked that you uninvite a few people; however, make sure your co-host knows about this and is okay with it first.

, It may be hurtful to uninvite a single person, but uninviting a group of people could make it easier. For example, you might change your party to a gender-specific invitation group, making it an all-girls or all-boys party, or perhaps making it a couples-only event., One last option might be to cancel the event altogether. You can make up an excuse for why the event was canceled, then invite people to a new party on a different date.Just be sure that you send out invitations a little more carefully the second time to avoid being in the same situation again.

, If you're throwing a small party at home, it's not unheard of for one of your guests to invite her friend or neighbor; however, this might make you feel like your privacy is being invaded a little, or it may put an extra strain on your party budget or supplies. If you don't want any uninvited guests, let the people you do invite know that it's an invitation-only event.Whether you send out formal invitations, an email blaster, or just word-of-mouth invitations, let everyone know that you'd like to keep it small and intimate.
If you'd like to proceed on a case-by-case basis, you could always ask your guests to clear it with you first before they invite anyone else.
If you don't want anyone to bring guests, then send out an RSVP card that does not have a ""plus one"" option. Use cards that only have a ""yes"" or ""no"" option for guests to fill out.

, The best way to defuse a potentially hostile or awkward situation is to be polite and courteous. Remember that even if you did not want someone at your party, you are still the host and that individual is your guest.Treat people the way you would want to be treated. Be cordial and welcoming, even if you don't like the person or didn't want him to come.

, Over the course of your party, you may feel tempted to speak with the unwanted guest. You should carefully weigh the decision to intervene, assessing what kind of damage the individual is doing and how frequently you will have to interact with that guest in the future. If you only see the individual every few weeks or months, you may not worry as much about offending that individual. By the same token, though, if you see each other infrequently it may not be worth correcting that individual's behavior.If you know the individual will not listen to you, having a serious talk may be a waste of time.
If the individual is not causing any problems, it's generally best to bite your tongue. You can accommodate one or two additional guests, so long as they're being agreeable and getting along with everyone.If the individual is upsetting the rest of your guests, you may need to address his behavior. You should do so in private by asking to speak with that guest in another room.

, You may need to speak with the unwanted guest about her behavior if she is making other people uncomfortable, or you may simply decide to address the individual's presence at the party. Either way, you'll need to be very careful and choose your words carefully.


Address the individual's behavior, not the individual. Be clear and direct about what you would like that person to do differently.It's best to avoid being confrontational. Remember that people like being asked questions and given options instead of being given commands.Say something like, ""I really want this party to be fun for everyone, but your behavior is causing problems. You can stay if you stop ______, but if not I think you should leave.""

, If you're really having a hard time coping with the individual at your party, you may want to consider asking him to leave. This can be difficult, but it's best to be direct with the individual and let him know why you're uncomfortable with him being there.


Ask the individual to speak with you in private. Don't kick someone out in front of the other party guests.
Say something like, ""I'm really sorry, but I'm just not comfortable with you being here. I think it would be best for everyone if you left.""
If you feel comfortable with it, you can also explain to the individual why you want him to leave. Don't be rude, though; be straightforward yet polite.

Avoid introducing them to other friends.,
Get to know some of their friends.",How to Deal With a Person Who Always Takes Your Friend Away1," Before you discuss your concerns with anyone, take some time to reflect on the situation and why it bothers you. There may be reasons why this is bothering you and it is important to understand them. Some questions you might ask yourself include:

Do you feel like this person is taking your friend away from you completely? Or just reducing the time you get to spend with them?
Do you feel dependent on your friend for emotional support? If so, how has the reduced time with them affected you?
Do you feel jealous because the person is your friend’s significant other and they are spending more time alone together?;
, After you have identified your reasons for feeling upset about the situation, it is important to discuss your feelings with your friend. Your friend may be totally unaware that they have been spending so much more time with someone else. Talking with them may help to remedy the situation.


Try saying something like, “I have been feeling left out since you started spending most of your time with Tabitha. We used to spend most of our time together, and I really miss that.”
You might also want to mention specific concerns such as, “Since you started spending most of your time with Joe, I have felt really lonely. I had an awful day at school last week and I really needed to talk to you, but you were hanging out with Joey and never returned my call.”

, A person who is seeking a true friend (even if you were friends with them first) is not looking to do any you harm. In this case, it should be easy to work things out and get some more time with your friend. You might even end up being close friends with the person. On the other hand, if this person is taking your friend to hurt you, you may need to be more firm with them that their tactics are not acceptable., If the person who is taking your friend does not know you, they are likely just becoming friends with your friend. Get to know them, and you might find that you have a lot in common. This can help mend the relationship with your old friend, and lead to a new friendship., If the person is someone you know, you might not want to introduce them to your other friends. Keeping them away from other friends will help ensure that they do not take away any more of your friends. They are likely to continue their behavior by stealing your old friends, too. This kind of behavior will likely drive your friends away from the person and back to you., If this person continues to take away your friends, you could start getting to know their friends. This could also help keep you in touch with your old friends, since you’ll still be in the same social circle. It might also get the person’s attention and help them understand that what they are doing to you hurts.Rather than just using these people to hurt the friend person, make an effort to build genuine friendships.

Apply your search terms to an online search.,
Study the results of your search.",How to Search For a Long Lost Friend1," While you may be tempted to immediately log onto a search engine, slow down and write a “cheat sheet” on what you know about your long-lost friend.


Think about interesting details beyond name, occupation, and last city lived. Do they play any sports? Are they a member of any political organizations? What are their hobbies? What might they like to do online?
If you think your long-lost friend has changed their name, through marriage or otherwise, think about the potential city where the name change happened. In most states in the United States, someone seeking a name change has to publish a notice in the local newspaper stating that the action for a name change has been filed. You might want to include the name of such a newspaper on your ""cheat sheet."";
, An example would be to include the person’s first name + their favorite hobby + a city they once lived in.


Think outside the box: A highly specific interest or characteristic of your friend may elicit a favorable search even if you don’t know your long-lost friend’s last name.

, Now that you’ve developed several search variations, you can turn to the search engine, Google. Enter your terms and click search.


Chances are good that you will find a social media profile connected to your long-lost friend; in 2016, almost 80% of the U.S population has a social network profile. A social network profile for your long-lost friend may be connected to LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, or perhaps a website less popular in the United States. (Xing has a global presence, and RenRen is prominent in China.) If you don’t have luck on Google, consider using the next three most widely used search engines: Bing, Yahoo!, and Ask..

, If your search successfully elicited evidence of your long-lost friend’s existence, congratulations. If the evidence came in the form of one or more of your friend’s social media profiles, you can attempt to connect to your friend through these profiles. The easiest way would be to use a platform for which you already have your own personal profile.


On LinkedIn, click Connect and/or Send InMail.

They might be busy, or they may be struggling with a personal or family relationship. Give yourself a pep talk before contacting them again to help reduce anxiety and boost your self-esteem.

You can say to yourself, ""They're probably just really busy. I shouldn't take it personally if they can't hang out right now.""
You can even tell yourself, ""I'm a good person and a good friend, no matter what anyone else thinks."";
, If you haven’t heard from your friend in a while, give them a call or send them an email. Keep your tone casual, and don’t mention that you’re unhappy with the friendship. Just tell them that you miss them, and ask if they want to spend time together soon.You can say something like, “Hey, Anna! I haven’t heard from you in a while, and I was hoping we could catch up sometime. Are you interested in getting lunch together this week?”
If the person turns you down, wait a week or two and try one more time before you assume they aren’t interested.

, No matter how much time has separated the two of you, it can be easy to fall back into old friendship patterns when you do something you once enjoyed. Consider this an opportunity to knock out two birds with one stone, per se. Reconnect with your old pal and rediscover an old past-time.


Perhaps you and your old friend grew up near a stable. You can say, ""Hey, it's been years since I've gone horseback riding. Why don't you join me?"", A challenge is also a great way to strengthen an existing bond. Learning a new skill or hobby can help the two of you get closer. Reach out to your friend and suggest a new activity that you think you both would enjoy.For example, if both of you are relatively adventurous, you might ask, ""I heard about a trail in the area that was just renovated. Want to go for a hike on Saturday?"" This activity can also offer the two of you a chance to talk and/or sort out your differences.
Your friend might want to hang out in a different environment or do a different activity than you're used to. Be open to their suggestions, and try out their ideas.

, If you're nervous about you and this person reconnecting, others can offer a great buffer. Invite several mutual friends over to your house for a game night, or out to an event in your town. Use the group activity to chat your acquaintance and remind them how much fun you can be.A group activity lowers the pressure that can be present in a one-on-one interaction. This is a smart route to take if you're unsure about why the person is losing interest in you. You can tease out information without any unnecessary tension.

, Don’t complain to your friend or start calling them more often to make up for their lack of contact. This behavior will annoy them, and they will probably start avoiding you even more.Don’t jump to conclusions. Your friend may just be busy. Act normal and see if the situation clears itself up.
It will probably take several attempts and conversations before you can restore your friendship. Keep reaching out to them occasionally, but give them the time and space that they need.

, When you’re around the person, act friendly and cheerful. Don’t be passive-aggressive, even if you’re feeling miffed about their lack of contact. Tell them you’re glad to see them, but don’t act like your happiness depends on their attention.You may want to think of a few topics to discuss ahead of time. This will help the conversation flow naturally. For example, you might discuss new hobbies, summer plans, favorite TV shows, or family news.

, It’s easy to take things personally, but your friend’s distant behavior might not actually have anything to do with you. They might be busy with family obligations, dealing with health problems, or overloaded at work or school. Find out what’s going on before you assume they don’t like you anymore., It can be hard to maintain a friendship when the situation that brought you together changes. If you and your friend don’t have much in common anymore, they may prefer to move on, instead of trying to force a connection.For instance, if you bonded with a friend over the fact that your kids went to the same school, you might lose touch with each other once your kids are at separate colleges.
You may have to think about new ways of maintaining your relationship if the circumstances have changed. For example, you can have phone or video chat dates with each other if you live far apart.

, It’s normal for people to grow apart over time, but that doesn’t mean you have to end the friendship completely. Think about whether you can accept and enjoy this friendship for what it is, even if you wish you were closer to the other person.For instance, maybe you can stay on good terms with this person and see them a few times a year, even if you’re not best friends anymore.
Work on making some new friends to ease the sting of downgrading a close friend to an acquaintance.
It's okay to take a short break from the friendship so that you can come to terms with the change.

, If you don’t know why your friend is distancing themselves from you, ask them what’s going on. Be polite and non-confrontational. Let them know that you can handle an honest answer.Say something like, “I’ve noticed that we don’t talk much anymore, and I was wondering what changed. Do you still want to be friends?”
If the person tells you they want to end the friendship, accept it as gracefully as you can. You can’t force someone to be friends with you.
If the person says they want to keep being friends, but they continue to ignore you, it may be best for you to move on and spend more time with other people.

, Respect your friend’s decision, even if it’s painful for you. Don’t hold out hope that they’ll change their mind. It’s not possible to make someone care about you, and dwelling on the rejection will only make you feel worse.Find a close friend or family member to talk to during this process. This can help you find support and feel less lonely during this time. Find someone who is not a mutual friend of your old friend and who can provide an unbiased opinion about the situation.

, Remind yourself that friendships end for all kinds of reasons. Rejection is tough, but it doesn’t mean you’re a bad person or unworthy of making new friends. It just means that particular friendship wasn’t a good fit for the other person.If your self-esteem has taken a hit, take some time for yourself to recover. Work on personal projects or develop a new skill to rebuild your confidence. Socialize with positive people who are openly loving and warm toward you to remind you that you are worthy of friendship.

, Do not follow a former friend around or beg them to take you back. That will only irritate the person and erode your sense of self-respect. Give them their distance, and focus on moving forward with your own life., Reach out to befriend your coworkers, classmates, and other acquaintances. If you don’t know many people, consider joining a club or taking a class to meet others with similar interests as you.If you want to get to know someone better, asking them questions about themselves and inviting them to get coffee with you is a good way to start. Just don’t ask anything too personal before you know them well.

, You’re not a toy, so don’t let anyone treat you like one. It’s okay to accept the person’s friendship again if you want to, but don’t make them the center of your social circle, especially if they caused you weeks or months of pain.If you realize that your friend is only coming back to you because they lost another friend or broke up with someone, you may want to consider turning down their friendship.
Take a few months to think about the situation before deciding if that person is truly invested in the relationship again.

Find balance in friendships.,
Appreciate time with your friends.,
Give it time.",How to Deal With a Person Who Always Takes Your Friend Away2,"


Invite your friend over to your house or somewhere you both love. Make your friendship fun and interesting. It could be that your friend thinks you're both going through the motions of friendships and finds your rival more exciting. Show your friend how unique and special your friendship is.
Compliment her more. Most people appreciate compliments. Girls like getting compliments on their outfit, makeup, perfume, and shoes. Be nice in general; it's possible that some behavior of yours has driven your friend away.

, There is no perfect number of friends. That said, having too many or too few friends can create a lot of tension in your life. Focus on regularly building new friendships. This will help you spread out your energy and needs among several friends instead of counting on only one person., Obviously, it is important to spend time with your friends. What most people lose sight of, however, is that it is just as important to spend time away from your friend. This gives you each time to experience new things and spend time with other people. A few ways to maintain a healthy balance in friendships are:Have scheduled hangouts (e.g. brunch on Sunday).
Spend time with multiple friends separately.
Create regular “me time” to be alone.
Regularly spend time with your family, too.

, You and your friends will go through times where it is harder than usual to get together. During those times, it is especially important to make the most of your time together. Make a point to express to your friend that you enjoyed seeing them and want to keep the friendship strong.For example, if you haven’t gotten to spend time with your friend in a long time, you could say something like “It was great to see you! I hope that we can get together again soon.”

, If you and your friend are going through a rough patch, avoid the urge to rush to a fix. Sometimes it takes friends a very long time to grow together, and it can take them time to grow back together after the friendship weakens. Give yourself and your friend time to process how you feel about things and work out the reasons that you are spending less time together.If this doesn't work, try to make new friends. Maybe you and your friend have changed and become quite different. It's natural for friendships to fade away and be replaced with new ones. Don't struggle to keep a weakening friendship alive if it's clear your friend has moved on.

Look at the positive side.,
Focus on the present.,
Forgive your friends for social mistakes.",How to Deal With a Person Who Always Takes Your Friend Away3," Allowing your friend to spend time with another person frees up your time to do the same. You could focus on other friendships, build new ones, or give yourself time to focus on your school, work or hobbies. Make an effort to keep touch with your friend, but enjoy the time that you now have free., If your friend is no longer in your life or spending as much time with you, acknowledge the good times you had together and move on. Avoid dwelling in the past or spending all of your energy chasing this one friend. Allowing yourself to be happy will not hurt the odds of mending things with your friend, in fact, it will help you be less bitter about the whole situation.Keep yourself entertained and happy by going out to movies, social gatherings, etc. with new friends (or other old friends).

, Even though your main problem is with the person who took your friend away, you might still find that you harbor hard feelings towards your friend for allowing it to happen. After some time, your friend may feel that they made a mistake. If so, they may make an effort to rekindle the friendship. If this happens, it is okay for you to forgive your friend.If this happens, it is appropriate to discuss how the rift made you feel. Then, move on and start rebuilding your friendship.

Think about whether or not you really want to cut this person out of your life.,
Consider if you want to end the friendship over something that can be resolved, or if it’s because of a major shift of personalities.,
Look for signs that this is a toxic friendship.,
Give your friend a chance to change.",How to Politely Stop Being Friends With Someone1," Ending a friendship can have a major impact on your life (and theirs), so don’t make a rash decision when you are angry. Instead, take a quiet moment to sit down and list the reasons you are friends with this person, and then list the things that you don't like about the friendship anymore. This will give you some insight on whether or not the friendship can be saved, or if you should end things.Clearly defining the reasons you want to end the relationship will help you feel confident in your decision and communicate clearly with your friend. It will help you experience closure, a sense that you did what was best for your wellbeing.Remember that growing apart from people is okay and natural—it doesn’t make either of you bad people.;
, A simple misunderstanding may be the cause of the conflict; your friend might not even know that she’s done something to upset you. It’s also possible you both have just changed and don’t have much of a connection anymore—if you became friends in kindergarten and now you’re teenagers, you may have grown to like and value different things, and not be the most compatible people anymore.


Are you considering ending the friendship because she forgot to come to your big track meet or because she said something rude about your boyfriend? Unless this is part of a larger pattern of behavior, letting her know she hurt you may be enough to fix your friendship.
If you feel bored by the friendship or dread spending time with her, it may mean your connection has faded.If you find you have little in common—you struggle to find things to do together or even things to talk about—then the friendship may have simply run its course.Is she a compassionate, thoughtful friend who sometimes flakes on your plans or is always late? Think about whether or not your issues are things you can address with her to save the friendship.Is your friend is socially anxious, shy or inept? Do you perhaps see a pathway for being someone who can guide your friend through these troubles?

, A toxic friendship is an unhealthy relationship in which you feel you are consistently being taken advantage of. If your friend insults you, gets jealous of your other friendships, or makes you feel bad about yourself after you interact, it might be time to end the friendship.Do you only hear from her when she needs something? Does she use you as a therapist but never return the favor, or ask you to do her homework assignments for her?
Does she only focus on the negative things in life? Consider whether or not this is situational—maybe she’s just having a rough patch. But if it’s a pattern of behavior, she may be an unhealthy person to be around.Is she extremely competitive, pick fights with you, or is she clingy and too demanding? These are all signs of a toxic friendship.Is she doing things that get you into trouble? If your friend is stealing, hurting people, or generally being bad news, and you seem to get dragged into it, then it's probably not your destiny to ""fix"" things here. Look after your needs first in this instance.
Think about how you feel after you spend time with her. If, more often than not, you end up feeling bad about yourself, it’s probably not a healthy relationship., If the good in your friendship outweighs the flaws, then try talking to him about the things that upset or hurt you. The problems may be easily fixable, and you may not need to end the friendship after all. Remember, no one is perfect, and there might be some ways in which you can learn to be a better friend, too.In a private setting, let your friend know their behavior is endangering your friendship. Tell him, “It really bothers me when you flirt with my girlfriend” or “Hey, it’s really hard for me to hang out with you when you’re always really late. Can you make more of an effort to be on time?”
Ending a friendship without giving the person an opportunity to change can be very traumatic. If this person is a good friend, it’s probably worth addressing the problems before you decide to cut the cord."
"
Tell the group your decision.The most direct way to leave a group of friends is to talk to them about your choice to leave.,
Wind it down.Instead of addressing your friends directly about leaving the group, it’s sometimes best to make a slow, steady exit from a group of friends.,
Cut off all contact.This method of leaving a group of friends may seem cold and heartless, but it may be appropriate if the friendship group is abusive or harmful and you need to cut all ties with them.,
Throw a party.",How to Leave a Group of Friends1," You can tell the group all at once or on an individualized basis that you’ll be ending your friendship with them. This method of leaving a group of friends can be awkward because the group might have lots of questions.


If you are very close with all members of the group of friends, you should probably tell all of them at once.
If you’re closer with certain friends in the group than others, you might choose to tell the friends you are closest with first, then inform the rest of your decision afterwards.
Prepare carefully if you intend to address the whole group of friends about your leaving. Use note cards or a written page to help you express everything you need to.;
, Unless your friends are engaged in something dangerous or illegal, there’s usually no need to leave a group of friends all at once. If you don’t want to hurt your friends’ feelings, you could just choose to spend less time with them until eventually you’re spending no time at all with them.


Stop sharing intimate details and events in your life.
Invest the time you used to spend with the group of friends with other friends, or take up a new hobby.
Don’t answer calls and texts immediately.
Over time, your friends will become casual acquaintances, then (if you wish) disconnect from you altogether.
Be aware that your friends may have questions. They may ask why you are so distant, what is wrong, if you are okay, etc. Prepare yourself to answer these questions honestly.

, This is not a good way to leave a group of friends just because you don't want to deal with the awkwardness of being honest with them or answering questions. Parting with empathy, integrity, and honesty will be better in the long run than burning bridges in this way. Plus, you have a lingering feeling of having to ""dodge'"" people or avoid them later in life if you find them in your circle again.


Do not offer an explanation or respond to their calls, texts, or emails.
Block the group of friends from your social media accounts.

, If you’re moving away for a job or to attend university, you might be leaving a group of friends you love and who care about you. In this case, you should throw a party with your group of friends.Do something you all love — go to your favorite water park or dine at your favorite restaurant, for instance. Use the party to celebrate your shared friendship and reminisce about all the good times you’ve had together.


Use social media, texts, and emails to stay in touch with friends you really care about.
Visit them when you get the chance.
Write each friend in the group a letter telling them how much you care about them. Thank them for their friendship, and cite specific instances in which they demonstrated what a good friend they were.

Determine if gradually phasing out your friendship is appropriate, or if you need to have a frank discussion with your friend.,
Make yourself unavailable.,
Don’t share as much as you used to.,
Don’t make drastic moves on social media.",How to Politely Stop Being Friends With Someone2," If the person is a long-time or best friend, this is usually not the best tactic for ending the friendship completely. If you just want to step back a little (maybe going from besties to just friends, or friends to acquaintances), the gradual withdrawal can work. But if you want your oldest friend out of your life, you owe it to the friendship to have a conversation with her. Still, you may want to start the process by putting a little distance between you and her.If the person is in your life 24/7 (you have every class together, hang out in the same group, and involved in the same activities), you probably want to try the gradual approach. Telling her point-blank that you don’t want to be friends when she’s this entangled in your life will probably make a huge mess.If the friendship seems to be on its way out anyway (like if neither one of you seems to be able to find time for each other), just let it fade out on its own. It’s not necessary to tell her you no longer want to be friends.
Don’t cut her off completely with no explanation. Gradually withdrawing from a friendship is different from “ghosting,” which means you ignore her attempts to reach out to you and basically pretend you don’t know her. This is hurtful, confusing, and will probably lead to some drama.
Be aware that this method can still cause hurt feelings. Even if you don’t tell the person “I don’t want to be your friend anymore,” he or she will probably figure it out and feel confused and upset.

, When your friend wants to make plans, tell her you’re really busy. Homework, family, religious obligations—these are all reasons you can give for being unable to hang out. Be slow in responding to her texts and try not to talk on the phone as often. When you do talk, keep the conversations relatively short.


Remember, don’t be mean or abrupt with her. You’re not trying to hurt her feelings here, so just keep it light and say things like “I’m sorry, I’ve really got to run!”
If you’re uncomfortable pretending to be busy when your friend calls, then GET busy. Join a club or activity that interests you but not your friend. You can meet new people this way and have legitimate reasons for being too busy to hang out.
Spend time with other friends, reconnect with family, or even venture out on your own.

, If you used to tell her about ever interaction with your crush, or confide in her about family problems, start to dial that back. Keep your conversations surface level, sticking things like school work.


If she wants chat with you for hours about her boyfriend, try to find a way to avoid the conversation or keep it really short. You can tell her you're busy and can't talk, or that you only have about five minutes to talk before you have to be somewhere else.

, Immediately unfollowing and de-friending will make it pretty clear to all your mutual friends that you are severing ties with your friend, possibly before ‘’she’’ even knows that’s what happening. Removing her from all your social media makes your private decision to end this friendship public, and ruin the subtlety of fading out of her life.Instead of de-friending her, try just hiding her from your news feed.

Plan what you will say.,
Sit down with your friend and tell her what is going on.,
Let her have her say.",How to Politely Stop Being Friends With Someone3," This is going to be a hard conversation, so you may want to write out the reasons why you want to end the friendship, or even write a script.Because you are trying to minimize hurt feelings, make sure your reasons are stated tactfully and that you’re not blaming her or being accusatory.You may want to discuss what to say with another close friend, sibling, or parent. This is fine, and probably a good idea, just make sure it’s someone you trust to keep things quiet. If she hears from someone else that you don’t want to be her friend—or worse, a few other people—it’s going to be very hurtful., If this person was your very close friend, you owe it to her to have a dialogue and give her a chance to respond, instead of emailing her or texting her.Be direct (but not mean) and don’t make lame excuses so she’s left wondering what just happened.Choose someplace quiet and relatively private so she can react without embarrassment (there may be tears). The lunchroom is not the place for this discussion.
It’s much too easy to misinterpret a letter or email, so try to talk to her in person or at least over the phone. Plus, she could show your private letter to other people.
Try to be nice but stand firm. Don’t say, “Hey, you’ve turned into a bitch and our friendship is over.” Try something like, “Our friendship has become a really negative force in my life, and I think it’s best if we stop being friends.”, Your friend may have questions and grievances of her own. She may become defensive, yell, get angry, or cry. That’s okay—let her have those feelings (unless she becomes violent; then get out of there). Down the line, you’ll both feel better that you had an opportunity to say what you needed to say, even if it’s difficult in the moment.Your friend may feel terrible about how she acted and want to try to save the friendship. If you are willing, you two might be able to talk it out.If your friend tries to bait you into a fight, don’t do it. Don’t involve yourself in a big, dramatic scene. Even if she’s calling you names, don’t retaliate.Stay with her until she's okay. Your friend may take this very hard, and you may need to stay by her side until she's together enough to leave on her own."

Don't gossip if people ask you what happened.,
Be polite when you see her.,
Don’t get drawn into any drama if your mutual friends get upset.",How to Politely Stop Being Friends With Someone4," People may notice that you two aren’t friends anymore and ask you what went down. It’s okay to say something non-specific, like “we just kind of drifted apart,” but don’t get into the details. Talking trash about your former friend is mean and immature, no matter what happened to cause the friendship to fall apart.If your friend gets nasty, spreading rumors or gossiping about you on social media, try not to engage. There’s no point in dragging things out or defending yourself to someone you don’t even want to be friends with anymore.If anything, it shows that you made the right decision.

, Things might be awkward for a while, and your friend may be angry or hurt, but treat her with kindness and respect. Remember that this is someone who was once your friend—maybe even your best friend—so honor what you had.Don’t do the look-of-death thing or straight-up ignore her. Just give her a small smile or nod of acknowledgment and move along.

, Ending one friendship may cause ripples if you’re part of the same group. Mutual friends may take sides, ask you to reconcile with her, or even get angry.Try not to get upset if some of your mutual friends feel they need to take sides. This may happen, and it’s going to hurt, but those people are petty and looking for drama, and you don’t need them in your life."

Be honest.If your friends insist on an explanation as to why you’re leaving the group, be honest no matter what your reasons are.,
Be respectful of your friends’ feelings.,
Stand your ground.Friends — especially friends of long standing — will often try to pull you back into the group.",How to Leave a Group of Friends2," Do not, for instance, tell your friends that you are moving out of state just to avoid them or leave the group. Instead, be open and honest about why you want or need to leave the group of friends.


If it’s easier for you to express yourself in writing, there’s nothing wrong with sending an email or letter to a group of friends (or the ringleader of a group of friends) explaining your grievances., Sometimes the truth hurts. Try to find a way to be honest and respectful at the same time. For instance, if you’re leaving a group of friends because they no longer share your interests or if you find that they are very boring, try a diplomatic approach by explaining to them that, “I just have a hard time relating to you.” Don’t rub the fact that you’re leaving the group in their faces.


Emphasize your own feelings and point of view, and avoid accusatory “you” statements like, “You are very boring.”
Lies will only lead to more lies. It’s best to be honest about your reasons for leaving a group.
Sometimes vague answers work best, since they can be both honest and respectful. For instance, “I’m busy,” or “I’ve been traveling,” may work as explanations for friends who want to know why you aren’t spending as much time with them., Be firm in your decision to leave the group. Don’t give in to group pressure or bullying.


For instance, if someone tries to get you to remain in the group of friends, say, “I’m sorry, I am very busy.” Or “We've had some great times but I need some time apart from the group right now.”
Be calm and graceful when declining invitations to hang out with the group of friends you wish to leave (or have already left).

Discuss concerns with your group of friends.Try talking to your group of friends about the behavior(s) that you find unacceptable.,
Take a break.Sometimes you can use a long trial separation from your friends to see if you’re truly happy leaving your group of friends.,
Inspire change among your friends.While it is good to abandon friends who are engaging in negative behaviors, it is also worth trying to steer them away from their negative choices and help them see the error of their ways.",How to Leave a Group of Friends3," For instance, if your friends consistently exclude you, try talking to at least one friend in the group privately. Perhaps they were not deliberately excluding you, and when you alert them to your feelings, they will correct their behavior and include you more often.

, Use the time apart from your group of friends to see how you feel without them in your life. Look for new friends, explore your hobbies, and spend time with close family members.


If you find you are happier during the separation, you can extend it into a full break from the group of friends.
If, on the other hand, you find that you miss your friends, you should use the brief period of reflection to remind yourself why your friends aren’t so bad, and reconnect with the group when you have a chance. Tell them that you’ve missed them and can’t wait to see them again.

, Before leaving a group of friends engaged in illicit or immoral behavior, take proactive steps to help them reform.


If your friends are abusing drugs or alcohol, encourage them to join Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous and seek counseling for their addiction.
If your friends want you to join them in stealing or vandalizing property, discourage them from doing so. Remind them of the trouble they could get in if caught, and propose an alternative activity like seeing a movie.

Look out for controlling friends.If your friends are constantly trying to make the group your only social outlet, you should think about leaving the group of friends.,
Beware of friends that are a bad influence.People often do what they see others do.,
Leave groups of friends that don’t invite you out.If your friends often ignore you when arranging outings, you should think about leaving them.,
Avoid needy friends.If you have a group of friends who only want to spend time with you when they need something, they are bad friends.,
Beware of friends who try to compete with you.If your friends are always trying to one-up you, it’s time to leave that group of friends.,
Leave friend groups that drain your energy.Spending time with friends should make us feel invigorated, refreshed, and energized.",How to Leave a Group of Friends4," They might also badmouth your other friends, family, or significant other in an effort to pressure you into spending less time with them. Leave groups of friends like this as soon as possible.

, Whether for good or ill, friends are a major influence in your life. If your friends engage in negative behaviors, you should leave the group of friends before you get yourself into trouble with them. You should consider leaving your group of friends if they:


Steal goods from stores
Abuse drugs and alcohol
Vandalize public or private property
Engage in other immoral or illegal acts

, This might be an indirect form of bullying (bullying by exclusion). Friends who do this do not value your company, and are not friends at all.

, If you’re providing money, food, or a place to crash for your group of friends and your generosity is not being reciprocated, you are being taken advantage of and should leave the group., Avoid friends who try to minimize your accomplishments. They are bad friends and not worth keeping.


For example, if you tell your friends that you got a 93% on your test, and they brag that your score is not that great because they got an even higher score, they are bad friends.
Conversely, if you say that you’re having a bad day, and your friends insist that they are having even worse days, consider leaving the friend group.

,


If you find yourself making excuses to avoid your group of friends, they are probably not good for your mental health.
Friends that wear you out with their complaints, drama, or criticism should be left behind.

Try to find new group that can be possible friend material.",How to Know if Your Best Friends Are Trying to Ditch You," Are they acting as if they can't hear you when you ask them a question? Or do they ignore your remarks and comments? Or maybe disagree with everything you say? The ongoing lack of engaging with you is a sign of distancing from you.;
, Do they act weirdly when you come around, such as they all stop talking when you show up near them? Or, maybe they constantly whisper while you are around. They may also keep hugging each other in your presence but don't hug you.


Do they go in a corner without you and talk for some time which you guess is about you and then they try to avoid you? Or do they whisper to each other , then walk away?







, Do they sign off when you get on the internet? Or go offline on Messenger or WhatsApp when they see you online? These sudden disappearances signal a desire to be away from you.

, If they previously did it all the time, then you can be sure they're no longer wanting to talk to you.

, When communicating with them, have they stopped sharing personal information about themselves and started speaking about less personal and more superficial things? Do you hear silent pauses in the conversation where something should actually be said, like giving constructive criticism or some type of emotional support or agreeing or disagreeing with you? Friends share secrets with each other and give constructive criticism or support, but if they don't, they're trying to ditch you.

, If the ""leader"" hates you or says something about you, does the rest of the group think just the very same thing? If you know the leader hates you, it may be a possibility that the others think so too.

, Do they say they will meet you somewhere, then fail to show up? They may then follow this up with making an excuse like: ""I had chores"". Did they stop calling and texting you lately?

If you have a group, is everyone together always and excluding you in group meetings or outings?







, Do they continuously go the other way when you come toward them? Or, do they turn away or ignore you? These are serious signs they are trying to ditch you.

, Friends grow apart after some time. We are taught that friendships are rock solid, most flow on their own, even though it's not your mistake. Yet, this just isn't the case. There are many reasons why some people choose to let go of a friendship and few of those reasons are something you could change their minds about.

, If your so-called friends have been doing some or all of the above discussed behaviors, then they're not your real friends. They're trying to ditch you. Go ditch them and make friends with others.

, The first thing to do if they do ditch you is to figure out whether you were obnoxious enough to deserve the behavior or whether they are being unfair. Sometimes we drive people away by trying to prove too many things, becoming suffocating or being rude. Other times, people are just mean-spirited. Or, maybe you were a boring person or maybe had a fight with them. Figure out what went wrong so that you won't repeat any contributory errors from your side of things.

, Getting a new friend is the first step on getting life back on track. Don't rush things, give it time and it will sort out in the long run.

Make a friendship photo album.,
Make a friendship bracelet.,
Give your friend a care package.",How to Say Goodbye to Your Best Friend That Is Moving1," You've probably collected dozens of pictures of you and your friend together throughout the years. Putting them all together in a photo album is a wonderful way to commemorate your friendship and give your friend a keepsake to take to his or her new home.


If you have digital photos, print them out on photo paper and use a scissors to cut them out.
Pick out a photo album from the store - you can find inexpensive albums at drugstores - or make your own if you're the crafty type.
Write captions underneath the photos. You can write about what you remember from the day the photo was taken, or write down inside jokes the two of you share.
You can create an online photo album instead. That way, both of you will have a copy,;
, This is a classic way to show a friend you care. Friendship bracelets are trendy, thoughtful gifts for both boys and girls, and they're not hard to make. Go to a craft store and buy some embroidery thread, then braid or weave it in a colorful pattern. Tie the ends together and clip the excess thread.


Make matching bracelets, one for you and one for your friend, so that you'll think of each other when you look at them.
You can buy friendship bracelets or necklaces made from silver or gold if you want to go for something more expensive. Choose the classic broken heart halves (one for you, the other for your friend) or a variety of other available designs.

, Moving to a new place can be hard. Chances are your friend will need several weeks to get adjusted, and she won't feel at home for a long time. Giving her a care package filled with things that remind her of home will help her feeling comforted when she's missing you and her old town.


Choose a container for the package. You can decorate a box, use a gift bag, or repurpose a tote bag or purse.
Add a few things that represent your hometown. You could include incense or candles from your favorite shop, a book from the bookstore where you've always hung out together, or a mug from the coffee shop where you met before school.
Include some tasty comfort foods. Make your friend a batch of cookies to enjoy on the flight to her new city, or slip in an array of her favorite candy.

Let yourself cry.,
Control your emotions.",How to Overcome the Loss of a Friend1," At first, don't try to be brave or strong for anyone- allow yourself to let it all out. This may mean not leaving your bedroom for an afternoon or taking a long walk by yourself. Get your privacy and give yourself time to unload all your feelings.

, Don't stay camped out on that couch forever- there is a limit to sobbing and obsessing. Once you've allowed yourself enough time to unwind, get up and take action.

Emails allow you to have a longer conversation at almost any time or place.Try maintaining one longer conversation within an email thread.Send each other links of things you find funny or interesting to add to the conversation.;
, Texting is a great way to keep up with each other’s daily events and routines. Although you may be apart from one another, texting is a great way to get immediate access to each other's lives.


Texting can also be an opportunity to be spontaneous and take advantage of each other's separate experiences.
Sending a picture or selfie can be a great way to maintain connection., Following each other on social media will help you maintain a connection even when you are unable to have direct communication with the other person. You will be able to see moments of their life without having to drastically change or alter your schedule.


Make sure this isn’t your only form of connection and that it doesn’t become a habit. It’s a good stand in, but comes nowhere close to direct communication.

, Save the longer and deeper conversations for phone calls or video chats. Although you can still indulge in small talk, both phone calls and video chats allow for longer sustained conversations.Set aside larger chunks of time to schedule regular weekly phone calls.
Use Google Hangout or Skype to video chat.

, Sending handwritten letters is a great way to keep connected while also adding a personal and thoughtful touch. With so many opportunities and devices for communicating at our disposal, taking the time to write a letter shows your appreciation for the relationship.Develop a habit of handwriting their birthday card every year.

For example, if you are going to be going to the city where your friend lives, then you might try asking your friend to meet up for lunch or dinner. Even if you can't spend lots of time with your friend, this time to catch up and connect can help to maintain your friendship.

Address your feelings.,
Take up a hobby.,
Be more careful picking friends in the future.",How to Lose Your Friend," Sometimes, you and a friend are simply growing apart. Other times, someone is perfectly nice but you're not clicking at friends. In these situations, try lessening contact over time. The person may get the hint that you're not interested in maintaining the friendship.Avoid answering texts or just reply with some vague like, ""Cool.""
Lessen your contact on social media platforms. Do not like someone's Facebook posts as often, or favorite their Tweets.;
, If you don't want to outright tell someone you don't want to see them again, work on being vague. If a friend contacts you asking about plans, make excuses.You can say things like, ""I'm really busy right now"" or ""I would love to, but I'm so bogged down with work. Maybe another time.""
Over time, the person may realize you're simply not interested in prioritizing the friendship.

, Gradually lessening contact can work with a casual friend or acquaintance. If you're growing apart with a friend who was once close, it can be cathartic to discuss things up front. Your friend probably also realizes your relationship has dwindled, and it could be good for both of you to get closure.The conversation does not have to be an angry one. If the two of you are growing apart, your friend is probably aware of the situation as well. Meet to talk at a neutral location. You can both simply acknowledge your relationship is no longer what it used to be.
Keep in mind, friendships can always be reignited later. This does not have to be goodbye forever. Maybe circumstances will change down the road and you and your friend will find yourselves close again.

, It can be sad when a friendship ends, even if it's not due to any animosity. Try to have gratitude for the time you had. Remember, many friendships and relationships do not last forever. Just because a friend is no longer present in your life does not mean that friend did not help you grow and change as a person., With a toxic relationship, it's often necessary to be upfront. A toxic person may be controlling or angry, and may not easily take hints. Watch for signs you are in a toxic relationship with your friend.Are you giving more to the relationship than you're putting in? Do you feel drained when spending time with this person? Does this person engage in the same troublesome behaviors repetitively?
Do you feel obligated to spend time with this person due to feelings of pity? Is the friend always putting you down and making you feel bad?
These are all signs of a toxic relationship. It's best to be direct when ending one.

, You can talk to the friend face to face. This may give you closure, and allow you to have a chance to express how your friend hurt you. However, if your friend is the type to become hostile, it may be best to send a text or email.A face to face talk ends the relationship cleanly and gives your friend a chance to respond and ask questions.
You also may feel closure if you get to explain to your friend how he or she hurt you.
However, the confrontation can be awkward. If your friend tends to get hostile, you may want to avoid a face to face discussion. Sending your friend an email or text explaining why the relationship is ending may be easier.

, However you decide to do it, try to be upfront. If your friend did something to hurt you, or has been hurting you over time, you should tell him or her about it. This is good for your own emotional health, and gives your friend a chance to grow in the future., Meet with your friend in a neutral location, like a quiet coffee shop, to have the conversation. As you converse, use ""I""-statements. These are statements phrased in a way that emphasizes personal feelings over objective judgment. A person may feel less judged being on the receiving end of an ""I""-statement.


An ""I""-statement has three parts. It begins with ""I feel..."" after which you immediately state your emotion. Then, you state the action that led to that emotion. Finally, you explain why you felt the way you did.
For example, you may be inclined to say, ""I don't want to be friends with you because you tell me my problems aren't as important as yours.""
This can be rephrased using an ""I""-statement. For example, ""I feel hurt when you tell me my problems aren't important in comparison to yours because it makes me feel uncared for.""

, After breaking things off with a toxic fiend, try to interact with more positive people. It's important to remember how you deserve to be treated. Reach out to friends and family members who have always been kind, loving, and supportive to you., This is not a letter you intend to send. It's only a way to purge your feelings. A symbolic goodbye can help you move on after a friendship has ended.Express your feelings. Are you sad the friendship ended? Are you grateful for the time you spent together? Will you miss the friend?
This is a good way to get to hear yourself saying goodbye. It can help with closure.

, You may need to feel sad after losing a friend. It's okay to cry or be angry. If you're having trouble getting in touch with your feelings, find ways to bring them out.Look at old photos of you and your friend. Browse old Facebook posts and albums.
Go to places you and your friend enjoyed. Watch a movie that was personally meaningful to the two of you.

, This can help fill the void left by a lost friend. Try taking up knitting, joining a club, or starting to paint.If you have time, think about volunteering somewhere. This can help occupy your mind and also help you feel like you're helping people.

, If you broke things off with a toxic friend, see this as a learning experience. In the future, be more conscientious about the friendships you choose.Think about any warning signs you noticed. Was this person always prone to talking about his or herself? Were they always kind of mean to you?

Write down your recollection of how you met. Do you remember the first time you and your friend hit it off? Sometimes you just know when someone you meet is going to end up being a great friend.
Write down some of your favorite memories. Recall movies you saw together, concerts you attended, fun sleepovers you had.
If you want, open your heart even more. You can talk about the bad times, too, and how much the two of you have grown as friends as a result of overcoming them.

, Saying goodbye is sad, but it's something you'll both get through. Your friend will have a lot of adjustments to make, and as her BFF it's your job to cheer her up. Throw in some lighthearted stories or jokes that will make her laugh when she unfolds your letter.


Draw funny cartoon scenes of the two of you together.
Write something in code and include a decoder on the back of the letter.

, Make sure your friend knows that to you, this isn't the end of your friendship.

Ask your friend if she needs help packing. That's a good way to spend time with her and help her reduce the stress of moving.
She may be busy with her family during those last few days. If that's the case, drop by for an hour or so to say your goodbyes.

, There's no one way to say ""goodbye."" The best way to do it is to be truthful about how you feel. Even if you aren't entirely eloquent, your friend will know how much you care. The warmth and love you express will bolster her courage to move to a new place and start over.


It can be hard to directly express deep feelings to someone else, but now is the time to do it. Tell your friend you love her and will miss her.
Sometimes ""goodbye"" is too hard to say. A hug and a sincere smile will tell your friend everything she needs to know.

Maintain small talk.,
Avoid cancelling scheduled time to talk.,
Find things you can do together while apart.,
Make connection meaningful.",How to Keep in Touch With Long Distance Friend2," Maintaining small talk is key to keeping a relationship accessible. Not every conversation is centered around deep connection and emotion when face to face and neither does it have to be when facing distance. With so many devices and messaging apps there is hardly an excuse!Try and check in daily to see what they’re up to.
Ask about daily routines and activities, like their commute to work, someone they met at school, or what they had for lunch.

, This is especially important if you are living in different time zones, as they can make rescheduling even more difficult. Following through with your plans to communicate, even when inconvenient, will help strengthen your relationship and maintain your connection.There will be lapses in communication. Try and be forgiving and understanding, and do your best to move forward.

, There are many activities that can be mutually enjoyed even though you are not in the same location. Finding things to do together will help maintain a bond and can also be a form of quality time.Watch the same shows at the same time and have a conversation about them afterward.
Start reading a book together.

, Communication can easily become less meaningful by constantly having access to messaging applications and devices. Reach out and attempt to make meaningful connection rather than liking a photo or writing a small post.


Remember to try to schedule meaningful routine conversations.

Be willing to accept that change is inevitable.,
Reach out if your friend has not been in touch for a while.,
Avoid only dwelling on the past.,
Know when it’s time to say goodbye.",How to Keep in Touch With Long Distance Friend3," Relationships go through ebbs and flows. Being able to accept change and the distance between you will help reduce tension and anxiety in the relationship. Don’t avoid acknowledging when it’s difficult, but don’t dwell on those moments either.


Stating your support for each other's decisions, like relocating for school or a career opportunity, will help you avoid focusing on negativity and difficulty.
Try to focus on the positive effects of change and the possibilities it provides your growing relationship.

, Sometimes people get busy and lose touch, but it does not mean they don't want to stay connected. If it has been a while since you have spoken with your friend, try reaching out.


Try calling or texting and saying something like, ""Hi Jill! I was just thinking of you the other day and thought I would call/text. How are you?""

, Although many relationships are based on building shared memories, dwelling on these memories too often can cause tension and prevent you from forming new bonds. Take this distance as an opportunity to pursue a new kind of friendship.Avoiding focusing too much on shared memories does not necessarily mean resisting them. Instead, try and talk about a shared memory and how it has positively affected the current relationship as opposed to focusing on the negative effects of distance.

, All long distance relationships undergo change; some for the worse, some for the better. Although there are many ways to try to maintain connection and strengthen the relationship, there may come a time when it’s best to end the relationship and say goodbye.Knowing when it’s time to say goodbye can be difficult to assess, but it helps to continually check-in with yourself by asking questions like, “Am I still enjoying this relationship?”, or “Is this relationship making me happy?”
Constant and continual fighting, whether you’re unable to reconcile differences or cope with change, is a clear sign that you need to re-evaluate the relationship.Ending relationships, whether you initiate it or not, is always difficult.

Meet and spend time with new positive people.",How to Ignore People You No Longer Wish to Be Around," The easiest way to ignore a person is to avoid encountering that individual altogether. You can reduce the chances of running into someone by avoiding the places you used to hang out together or where you know that person frequently spends his/her time.


Find new restaurants, bars, and coffee shops to visit. Look for places slightly outside that individual's immediate neighborhood.
Try to go shopping at stores further away from that individual's home (if you know where he/she lives).
If a mutual friend invites you somewhere, ask that friend if the individual you're avoiding will be there. Then you can decide whether to go or not.;
, Limiting contact with someone is a good way to ignore them without necessarily cutting them out of your life. Cutting off all ties with someone can be difficult if you are related or if you go to the same place together on a regular basis. However, it can help you avoid having to interact with the individual on a regular basis, which may make you feel better.Keep conversations and interactions as short and infrequent as possible by giving brief, unemotional responses without expanding on the things you say. For example, you might say something like, ""I'm fine. I've got to get back to work now.""
Resist the urge to say anything mean or hurtful, as this will only make things worse.
By limiting your contact and avoiding unnecessary interactions with someone you don't want to be around, you can essentially cut ties with that person without having to close the door on polite social interactions in the future.

, Whether you work together, have mutual friends, or simply cross paths from time to time, it's important to resist the other person's attempts at drawing you into a conversation. You can do this by ignoring that person if they attempt to talk to you.Avoid eye contact with that person
Try ignoring what the person says, and resist the urge to respond.
If you're in a social situation where you absolutely must say something, try sharing your own personal thoughts/feelings on something that has nothing to do with what the other person said.
Whether you ignore what was said outright or you talk about your own interests as though you didn't hear/understand the other person, you're effectively communicating that you're not interested in what he/she has to say.

, If you can't avoid crossing paths with someone at work or at a social event, it may be helpful to have an outside friend with you. This friend can help buffer your encounter with the individual you don't want to be around. He/she will help ensure that things remain civil and can help direct the conversation to a neutral subject if the other person tries to make things unpleasant in any way.


Let your buffer know what you need him/her to do. Make sure your friend is okay with filling this role up front so that he/she doesn't feel used or confused later on.
Develop some type of nonverbal signal so that you can both excuse yourselves if you need to get away in a hurry.

, If you cannot avoid certain people, you can always try being extra polite towards those individuals.Sometimes a kind approach can curb the negative behavior in others that you wish to avoid.Resist the urge to be rude to the people you do not like.
Instead, be strong and confident. Reflect on your own positive attributes and remember that you are a capable individual who deserves to be happy.
Don't let the people you want to avoid bring you down with their negativity. Rise above it by refusing to engage.
Say something nice when you feel the urge to be mean, then simply excuse yourself and leave the room. For example, you might say, ""You did a great job at the presentation this week. I'm going to grab another coffee - please excuse me.""

, If you're trying to avoid being around someone, there's a good chance that individual is negative or otherwise unpleasant. These types of people typically try (whether consciously or not) to get under your skin. They may tell you that you're foolish for taking chances, or they may try to discourage you from having hopes and dreams at all. If you've decided to disengage with someone, it's important that you stay strong and try not to let that individual get to you or change you.Even if you don't feel secure or strong, it's important that you believe that you can be strong. This can help create a buffer between you and the negative people in your life.
Don't let the negative words and actions of others affect the way you feel about yourself or the way you live your life. Use positive affirmations and self-talk to break out of any negative thoughts the person might make you have.
Remind yourself that you're a good person and that your friends and family care about you. That must mean that you have positive attributes that the other individual simply isn't willing to see.

, If you want to cut off contact with someone you don't wish to be around, you may want to consider blocking that individual from calling or texting you. This may not be necessary if you don't have any regular contact with the individual, but it certainly won't hurt.


To block calls on an iPhone, select that individual from your contacts list and choose ""Block This Caller."" To block texts, go into your messages, choose the individual you want to block, and select ""Details,"" then ""Info,"" and then ""Block Contact.""To block calls/texts on an Android phone, go to Call Settings and select ""Call Rejection,"" which will take you to the ""Auto Reject List."" From there you'll just search for and select the number you wish to block.
To block calls/texts on a Windows phone, go to Settings and select ""Call + SMS Filter,"" then switch the ""Block Calls"" function on. Then just hold down the number you want to block, select ""Block Number,"" and hit ""OK.""
If you use a BlackBerry phone, you'll need to speak to someone from your wireless carrier to block an unwanted phone number from contacting you.

, Even if you manage to avoid someone in person, that individual may still be able to contact you via social media. If you're friends with or follow someone on a social media site, that person can find out what you're doing or where you're going, and he/she could send you threatening or harassing messages through social media as well.If you're friends/followers with the individual on social media, you can unfriend or unfollow that person. You can also block that individual so that he/she cannot see what you post and cannot contact you in any way.
If you're not friends/followers with the individual on social media, or if you've already unfriended that person, change your privacy settings within that social media site so that only your friends can see what you post.

, If the person you're trying to avoid has your email address, you may fear getting an aggressive or confrontational email from that person. You can prevent this by blocking that individual from emailing you, or by filtering out all messages from that individual (depending on which email server you use).


To filter out emails in Gmail, select a message from that individual in your inbox by marking the checkbox next to it. Click the drop-down menu, choose ""More,"" then ""Filter messages like these,"" and on the redirected page select the option ""Delete it.""To block emails in Microsoft Outlook, simply right-click a message from that individual, then click ""Junk,"" followed by ""Block Sender."", There may be times when you cannot avoid being around a person who is negative. Whether it's a colleague, relative, or neighbor, you may have to be around or (even interact with) negative people from time to time. When that happens, it's important that you recognize the things that set you off and try to be aware of those triggers to avoid getting upset.Make a list of the people, places, and things that cause you to feel unhappy, angry, or frustrated.
Consider why those people, places, and things trigger a negative reaction for you.
Think about how those triggers may come up in your day-to-day life, and plan strategies that will help you avoid or minimize these situations.

, Even though you might feel like venting your frustrations, doing so may actually end up alienating other people. They may be friends with the individual you don't like, or they may just get sick of hearing you say bad things about others. If you constantly complain about someone, the friends and colleagues that you spend time with may even end up wanting to distance themselves from you.Instead of complaining about the person you no longer wish to be around, make a point of not discussing that person in conversation with others.
Talk with others about positive things that you do enjoy. Otherwise, the person you don't like will end up consuming a lot of your time and energy.

, When you blame others for your own negative words and actions, it gives that person power over you and subtly takes away your own self control. No matter how upset someone else makes you, it's ultimately your decision to engage with that anger/frustration or to let it go. The things you say or do, even if you do them because of your frustration with someone, are still your choice and your responsibility.Your words and actions do not exist inside a bubble. You cannot blame others for the things you choose to say or do, even if you're upset with someone you don't wish to be around.
Try to change the way you think about that person. Your thoughts influence your words and actions, so catching and restraining negative thoughts can help stop you from giving meaning to those thoughts.
Once you've learned to ignore the person who upsets you, just let that person go. Stop wasting your time and energy thinking about that individual altogether, and stop yourself any time you notice yourself thinking about him/her.

, Positive people are generally drawn to other positive people. If you want to attract positive individuals into your life, it makes sense that you should let those people know that you are also positive. You can do this in subtle ways once you learn how to tune into and project your best, most desirable qualities.Think about what makes you a positive individual. Do you compliment others or go out of your way to be kind, for example?
Make a conscious effort to engage in those activities more frequently - not just so others will see you, but to cultivate a more positive lifestyle of your own.
Let your actions speak for you when it comes to what kind of person you are and what type of life you live.

, Chances are there are already some very strong, positive individuals in your life. As you distance yourself from people you no longer wish to be around, it's important to replace those individuals with the people you do want around. Generally, it's best to keep positive, caring people close to you, as they make good friends and can help influence you to better yourself.Think about the friends, family members, and coworkers who are always positive in the face of adversity. You should also think about who the kindest, most considerate/compassionate individuals are in your life.
Reach out to those people. Make an effort to spend more time together, and try inviting them to social events so you can spend as much time as possible together.

, In addition to the people already in your life, you should actively seek out new positive people to befriend. Finding new people who are positive and compassionate will help you further cement your social circle with people you admire and want to be around. This can help make you a better, more desirable friend for others.Look for new positive people at your local gym, a faith group, an outdoor club (like a hiking group), and other places kind, positive people might spend their time.
Try volunteering. You'll feel great doing it and you'll meet other people who care about a common cause (and who are generally positive, compassionate people).
Even short amounts of time together getting coffee or having lunch can boost your mood and your outlook.
Be proactive. If the positive people you meet are busy, reach out to them and schedule some time together whenever it's convenient for both of you to get together.

Consider whether you are self-absorbed.,
Consider whether you are a bad listener.,
Think about your reliability.,
Consider whether you talk about people behind their backs.,
Apologize to your friend.,
Be sincere.,
Remain mature if your friend does not forgive you.",How to Know if You Are a Bad Friend," Do you always dominate conversations with your own achievements, and not allow your friends to brag to you about their achievements? Do you have an ""it's my way or the highway"" attitude and think you can always get your way, rather than letting your friend get his or her way sometimes? Being considerate is key to a good, long-lasting relationship.;
, Do you just sit and text on your phone while your friend is trying to talk to you, rather than actively listening? Do you just sit and fantasize, and think about places you'd rather be? If you are not a good listener, your friend will probably feel as if you have no interest in what he or she is saying.

, An unreliable ""friend"" is not a real friend. Do you say that you will do something and never follow through? Do you schedule an event (such as a brunch or coffee) with your friend and arrive an hour late? Do you make promises all the time but always break them? If so, you are probably unreliable, and will need to fix that if you want to become a better friend.

, Do you gossip about your friends and think that they will never find out, without putting yourself in their shoes and thinking about how you would feel if someone gossiped about you? Does your friend feel hurt at your comments? If so, it's the perfect time to stop gossiping.

, Be the bigger person and admit that you were a bad friend; do not play the ""blame game"" and accuse your friends of their actions that started fights or made them poor friends in general.


What to say: ""I'm aware that I've been an unreliable friend. When I last scheduled a coffee, I was a half-hour late. I wholeheartedly apologize for my unreliability and will endeavor to be timely in the future.""
What not to say: ""I'm aware that I've been self-centered. For example, I ate all the crackers when you wanted me to save some for you. But, what you need to understand is that there have been some times when you were narcissistic yourself, like the time when you ate the whole cookie when I asked you to save me half of it"".

, If your friend forgives you, change your ways and be a better friend this time.

, Try to start a new friendship and be a good friend, so that you can maintain a long-lasting relationship and avoid the same problems.

Take plenty of exercise breaks.",How to Travel With a Ferret," Find out if ferrets are legal at your destination and in the areas you are travelling through. Ferrets are currently illegal in the U.S. states of California, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia. They are also forbidden in New York City and Salt Lake City.To find out if ferrets are legal at your travel destination, contact the Department of Fish and Game, or the Department of Fish and Wildlife in the area, and ask about restricted animals.


In Australia, ferrets are prohibited in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and a quarantine inspection is required in Western Australia.Ferrets brought to the UK require microchipping, treatment for ticks and tapeworms, and may be subject to quarantine if arriving from outside the EU.;
, It is important to check that your ferret is disease-free and generally healthy before traveling. It can be difficult to detect disease in ferrets, so a checkup with the veterinarian will be necessary before you leave.Make sure as well that your ferret is up-to-date on vaccines. Ferrets require a series of two initial, then annual distemper virus vaccines, and an annual rabies vaccine.Have your vaccine records on hand while you travel.


Look up the contact information for a local ferret shelter near your destination as well—they should be able to provide you with names of veterinarians who treat ferrets in the area., Since ferrets tend not to return if they escape from their home, having a microchip surgically implanted in them is a simple way to locate them in case they flee. This could be especially helpful when travelling, where frequent transfer in and out of the cage provides chances for escape. Ask your veterinarian about the procedure for having a microchip implanted.Ferrets entering the UK require a microchip, in addition to treatment for ticks and tapeworms. If arriving from outside the UK, they may also be subject to a quarantine., It is easiest to travel by car with a ferret. When driving, you can decide when to stop for food, play, and rest. You’ll also be able to control what temperatures your ferret is exposed to. If you need to travel by plane, be sure to check with your airline what their policy is on ferrets. Currently, no airlines allow ferrets to travel in the cabin, though this is subject to change. The only airline that allow ferrets to travel as checked baggage is Pet Air.Some airlines accept ferrets to fly as unaccompanied cargo, but this is not recommended because of potentially dangerous temperatures in the hold., It is not recommended that you let your ferret loose in the automobile during a road trip. But if you must, there are several potential hazards that need to be checked for and covered up, including dangerous wiring and other metal under the seats. Foam padding under the seats also needs to be covered or otherwise made inaccessible, since it may be a chewing attraction for your ferret. Finally, be sure to vacuum the car thoroughly to clean up old snack foods or other non-ingestible items that could harm your ferret., If you’ll be staying at a hotel or motel at any point during your trip, plan ahead and reserve locations that accept ferrets. If you’re unable to find a ferret-friendly hotel or motel where you’ll be staying, look up a local animal shelter to see if they accept ferrets for short-term periods.Some hotels and motels may charge a fee for allowing the ferret, and you should expect to pay for each night the ferret stays at a shelter as well.

, If you are travelling by plane, check with the airline what their requirements are for the carrier. If you are travelling by car, find a travel cage for your ferret. It needs to contain a sleep area, a place to mount a litter box, a food dish, water bottle, a deep basin (to prevent spillage), and be escape-proof. One option is to use a small dog crate and drill holes in it to mount a hammock, food dish, and litter pan. It's easy to mount a water bottle on the wire door of dog crates.

, You will need to bring plenty of food, toys, treats, a harness and leash, extra litter, and a first aid kit for your ferret. Also take along all medical and registration records, especially any microchip- and vaccine-related papers.Have with you a printed photograph of your ferret. If they escape during the trip, you’ll then be able to make a “missing ferret” flyer., For a couple of days before the trip, let your ferret play in the carrier and sleep in it overnight. This will allow them to get used to their new temporary living quarters, and reduce the stress they may feel while traveling.

, Make sure that the cage is well stabilized in your car, and not likely to shift around or tip over. Strapping the cage to a seat belt can keep it from falling onto the floor area.If the cage is small enough to fit in the floor areas, either in the back or front seats, try putting the cage there if it fits snugly.


Even if you’re only driving to the airport, make sure your ferret is well secured the same way you would for a long-distance trip.
If you’re having your ferret flown to a destination with Pet Air, a pickup and dropoff service is available., Keep your ferret out of direct sunlight in your car, since ferrets can overheat easily. Never leave your ferret alone in the car during summertime, since they are susceptible to heatstroke.If you feel warm in the front seat, aim some air conditioning toward the ferret to keep them cool too.If you're travelling by plane, don't allow your ferret to travel in the cargo area during summer months.


Ferrets’ health is put at serious risk if they’re exposed to temperatures greater than 85° Fahrenheit (29.4° Celsius)., You may be able to drive for twelve hours straight, but your ferret needs to get out and stretch their legs from time to time.Make a point to stop at a rest area or near a park, harness up, and walk them around for twenty to thirty minutes for every four hours of driving.

Purchase a H-style harness.,
Put the harness on your ferret indoors.,
Attach a leash to the harness.,
Hold the leash.",How to Train Your Ferret to Walk on a Leash1," Visit your local pet store and purchase a H-style harness for ferrets. Do not buy a collar or a Figure-8 style harnesses. Your ferret could easily slip out of a collar, and the Figure-8 harness is often too loose on one side and too tight on the other.The harness should be made of nylon and have plastic buckles.
Metal buckles get too hot in the sun, and Velcro closures make it too easy for your ferret to escape.;
, Place the harness on your ferret for a few minutes and give him a treat. Your ferret will probably not like the harness at first and may resist, pretend to fall, or try to run away from you.Make sure the harness fits properly and is not too loose or too tight. You should be able to fit your little finger between the harness and your ferret.
Slowly increase the amount of time your ferret wears the harness and give him a treat each time. Your ferret should be used to the harness in a few weeks.
Let your ferret play while wearing his new harness. Give him a favorite toy, treat, or play a favorite game while wearing his harness.

, Once your ferret is comfortable with the harness, attach a ferret leash. Allow him to play with the leash attached, but do not hold the leash. Give your ferret a treat to reward his good behavior.Always supervise your ferret when his leash is attached. You do not want it to get tangled around his neck or some other object.
Gradually increase the time you leave the leash on. Move on to the next step once your ferret stops negatively reacting to wearing the leash.

, Once your ferret gets used to the leash, hold the leash and let your ferret walk around. Allow your ferret to lead. Gently tug on the leash a little to teach your ferret about resistance. Always reward your ferret with a treat.After a few training sessions, begin to direct your ferret using the leash. If he moves in a direction you do not like, gently tug the leash and guide him the desired direction. Reward him with a treat for following your lead.
Never yank your ferret with the leash or pick him up by his leash.

Walk close to your home.,
Walk further from home.,
Allow your ferret to have fun.",How to Train Your Ferret to Walk on a Leash2," Your first walk should be close to home. If possible, walk in a private, fenced yard.The first walks should only last for a few minutes, and then you can build up to 15-20 minute walks.Your ferret will be the leader for the most part. It is difficult to teach them to take direction like a dog.Take treats and water with you on your walk. Ferrets can easily dehydrate.
If your ferret is too scared to go outside, sit outside and allow your ferret to stay inside. Continue to hold the leash and be patient. Your ferret should be open to going outside after a few attempts.

, Once your ferret is comfortable in your yard, you can take him for a walk in your neighborhood. He may feel more comfortable walking next to hedge lines.Stay away from places where a lot of other animals are. You do not want your ferret to pick up any illnesses.Your ferret will want to explore, but do not let him drink from any ponds or puddles.
Don’t let other people touch your ferret when you are out.

, Your ferret will enjoy playing in a pile of leaves, dirt, or freshly cut grass. If your ferret is staying in your yard, you can set up some of these fun things for your ferret to get into. Your ferret will not walk in a straight line as you go down the sidewalk.Try to only use the leash to keep your ferret from getting into danger such as going down drainpipes or engaging with other animals.
Pick up your ferret immediately if a dog approaches.

Avoid extreme temperatures.,
Apply bug spray.,
Check his feet.,
Vaccinate for distemper.,
Stay away from fertilizers.",How to Train Your Ferret to Walk on a Leash3," Your ferret will not do well if the temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If it is warm outside, try to stay in the shade. Take a water bottle with some ice in it so your ferret has something cool to drink. You can also fill a spray bottle with cold water and spray your ferret down.Consider the temperature of the walking surface. Asphalt and cement heat up on warm days and bother his feet.
Neither extreme cold nor extreme heat are good for your ferret. Keep him inside instead.
If the temperature is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, your ferret may get cold. If he begins to shiver, place him in your jacket and go home.

, Spray your ferret with a ferret safe flea and tick spray. These bugs carry diseases and/or parasites that are harmful for your ferret. Spray his entire body, and use a cotton swab to apply the spray to his ears and under his chin. Avoid spraying his eyes and nose.Check your ferret for bugs before you bring him back inside.
If you notice any bites, treat them with antibiotic cream or ointment.
If your ferret has any swelling or redness from the bites, call your veterinarian.

, At the end of each walk, check his feet for any pebbles, stones, splinters, or broken toe nails.Wash his feet after the walk if you need to. You can also carry alcohol wipes with you on your walk so you can immediately clean his feet if necessary.Be extra careful if your ferret walks on gravel. There may be sharp stones or glass mixed in with the gravel.

, Distemper is a fatal, airborne virus. Your ferret is much more likely to get distemper by going outside. He can pick it up from grass, weeds, trees, other animals, shrubs,and even you.After the initial shot, your ferret will need to get an annual booster.
You may also want to give your ferret the rabies vaccine. Talk to your veterinarian about the proper vaccines for your pet.

, Fertilizers and weed killers are poisonous to your ferret. Do not take your ferret in any lawns that have signs from commercial lawn care companies. You will not always know if a lawn has been treated with fertilizers, but try to avoid them as much as you can.Fertilizers are usually safe after drying for 24 hours.
Also avoid any leaking car fluids such as oil, antifreeze, and windshield washer fluid.

Attend events for the LGBT community.,
Join bisexual or LGBT clubs.,
Go to popular LBGT spots.",How to Meet Other Bisexual People2," Many communities have LGBT events year round, from community gatherings to local Gay Pride Festivals. Look for your community’s Pride website or LGBT organization website to find events celebrating the LGBT community.


For example, the DC Center for the LGBT Community offers monthly events connecting people, such as coffee meetings and clubs., There may be clubs for LGBT people in your community. You can find them at local universities, community centers, even churches. Look online at your local university to see if their LGBT clubs are open to community members. Ask any LGBT friends you have if they attend clubs in your area that you can join.

Notice body language.,
Watch the behavior of others.,
Talk to people.,
Avoid stereotypes.",How to Meet Other Bisexual People3," Before directly asking if someone is bisexual, pay attention to signals that indicate their sexual orientation, such as body language. Does the person you are watching show a lot of affection to the same sex? Watching body language can tell you a lot about a person.


Watch their eyes for signs of attraction to both same-sex people and those of the opposite sex.For example, their pupils will dilate if they are attracted to you.

, Watch someone you suspect is bisexual and see how much affection they show. Are they open to hugging both sexes? Do they talk about liking both sexes? For example, a bisexual person might claim to be straight but go out of their way to meet with members of the same sex.


Sometimes women will be bisexual and not realize it. Studies show that about 60% of women are attracted to the same sex, and that women become more bicurious when they age., When you walk into a social situation where you are looking for bisexual people, you should talk to people in order to determine if they are also bisexual. You might share information about what you are interested in so that the other person feels comfortable sharing their sexual orientation.

, Be sure not to make any assumptions about someone else's sexuality. For instance, don't assume that someone is bisexual just because they hug someone of both genders at a party. To be certain someone is bisexual, you should talk to them about this with sensitivity and tact.


You could start a conversation about this by saying, ""I heard you say something that made me think you might like the same things I do. Do you want to chat?""

It is a common myth that scruffing can teach a ferret not to bite.",How to Train a Ferret2," Scruffing is when you grab the fur on their neck (Be careful not to grab the ferret's actual neck. Their scruff almost feels like an extra flab of skin behind the neck.) Some say to then forcefully say ""NO!"" but this is WRONG. Ferrets do NOT know what no means. Scruffing and/or saying no will not stop biting but instead could make it worse due to the fact the ferret feels it needs to defend itself. Instead use positive reinforcement to reliably train your ferret and build a better relationship with them. You can stop biting by calmly and gently removing your hand or what the ferret is biting and ignoring the ferret until he or she is calm. NEVER physically punish your ferret they will learn not to trust you and will bite harder next time because they feel threatened and will defend themselves. You can then play with your ferret and treat them. If they bite again simply repeat the process. It will take a few repetitions before your ferret gets it. Your ferret then learns that when they bite the fun stops and if they don't bite fun continues. With consistency this easily teaches a ferret not to bite and does so without damaging your relationship.

, Put a bit of ferret poop in the boxes and place your ferret in the box the first time so that he knows where it is. Ferrets will usually potty in the same corner, so it helps if you know what corner of the room or cage they like, and put the litter box in that corner.

,, Ferrets do not like to poo where they sleep.

, It is not only physically harmful, but mentally as well. It is important to note that ferrets can only be about 90% potty trained. They will have accidents, especially if their boxes are not cleaned on a regular basis. Also, do not use cat litter for training; carefresh bedding works the best since ferrets do not usually eat this and are not allergic to it. Make sure to NEVER use sand/powder/clumping, clay, or wood based litter. They will cause respiratory problems and can shorten your ferrets lifespan. They can also make a mess as ferrets like to dig in them. But allowing the to dig in there should be avoided also. A great ferret litter is Yesterday's News cat litter, but make sure to buy the unscented. NEVER buy scented litter as this is not good for your ferrets lungs.

Look at the ferret and say, ""No!"" in a loud and firm voice.Your ferret will probably struggle and try to move around. Don't be alarmed. You are not hurting the ferret.
If your ferret has a defiant attitude, you can drag the ferret on its back across the floor after you have finished scruffing.This will reinforce that you are in charge.;
, If scruffing does not work, put your ferret in time out. Put the ferret in a travel carrier or cage for 5 minutes or less. This method works best for baby ferrets (i.e. kits) because they are very playful and do not like being alone. Time out will help your ferret associate biting with something bad.Your ferret may go to sleep if you leave it in the cage for too long during time out. Your ferret needs to associate the cage with punishment not with nap time., Kits often get overly excited when they play and will begin to bite. If your ferret bites you during play time, give the ferret a toy to bite instead. This teaches your ferret that it is acceptable to bite a toy but not to bite people.There is no need to make a big deal about biting using this method.

, You should never hurt your ferret as part of the training process. Do not flick their nose, throw them, or hit them.Never scream or yell at them either. You do not want your ferret to be afraid of you. Your ferret may actually bite you more if it is afraid of you.Think of your ferret as a child that you love but are trying to discipline. You want to be seen as a loving, caring authority figure.

, Ferrets hate the taste of Bitter Apple and Bitter Lime and Fooey. You can buy any of these at your local pet store or online. Spray a small amount on your hands, toes, ankles, and anywhere else your ferret likes to bite.This will help the ferret associate biting with a nasty taste.


Never directly spray your ferret.
You can also put some of the spray on a Q-tip and put it in the ferret's mouth when it starts to bite.Bitter Apple also comes in a paste. This is helpful if your ferret likes to bite cords or their cage bars. Apply the paste to the item to deter the ferret from biting.

,
Follow your instructions.,
Tell anyone that may be expecting you to speak.,
Get friends to participate.,
Break the Silence.,
Remember that participating in the Day of Silence can be a very emotional and exhausting event for people.,
Examine what you gained by the experience - for yourself and for others.",How to Observe the Day of Silence," Think hard about whether you want to participate in the Day of Silence.;
, Go to the Day of Silence website and confirm the date. Be sure that if you are committing to it, you have no obstacles to fully participating, such as if you are the lead in your school play.

,, You will probably have to remain silent during the day and maybe carry a sign around with the story of a victim of homophobic bullying.

, If you're a student, you may want to talk to your teachers in advance about what you will be doing and why.


Some schools give you passes, making it even easier to participate. If a teacher or other authority figure is involved, ask them about educating the rest of the faculty about Day of Silence and/or giving the participating students passes.

, It will be easier to resist the temptation of talking when you have a coalition of friends participating with you.

, Plan an event to Break the Silence. A Breaking the Silence Event is an opportunity for participants in the Day of Silence to finally speak out about their experience of the Day. Breaking the Silence means something different everywhere you go. In many cases, Breaking the Silence is the first moment that any of the participants speak on the Day of Silence. In some places, it is a celebration of the events of the day and the successes of individuals. It can also be a wonderful combination of both. It may look like a big rally, or like a small meeting but a Breaking the Silence event is always a great way to end your Day of Silence activities. What does a Breaking the Silence event look like? Participants from previous years have used lots of ways to break the silence:


""New Year's Eve"" Model: Participants assemble at the end of the day, there's a silent countdown to the designated finish time, and when the clock strikes, everyone screams, hollers, sings, rings bells, blow whistles, beats drums, shakes noisemakers, and so on.
""Daybreak"" Model: Participants assemble at the end of the day, there's a silent countdown to the designated finish time, and when the clock strikes, people begin slowly to make noise or speak as the feeling comes to them.
“One Voice” Model: Participants assemble at the end of the day, and when the clock strikes, participants take turns going up to the microphones and speaking to the entire group.

One powerful approach is to have participants describe how it felt to remain silent for nine hours, and the responses they received throughout the day.
The important thing is to decide ahead of time which type of Breaking the Silence Event suits you best. You won't be able to discuss it on the Day of Silence, so choosing early insures that everyone respects the Silence Breaking that everyone has decided on.



, Expect various types of conversations to ensue.

, Bullying will not be stopped by the Day of Silence. It will be stopped by people like you who stand up to bullying and don't just stand by as a bystander. You can make a big difference in someone's life.

Treat kits differently than adults.,
Build trust with adult ferrets.,
Deal with a fear biter.,
Stop a play biter.,
Pick up on communication signals.",How to Train a Ferret Not to Bite2," Kits bite because they do not know any better,but are easier to train than adult ferrets. If you are consistent, you can train a kit to stop biting in a few weeks.Kits usually bite for attention, to play, or to be put down. To break the kit from biting to be put down:Hold the ferret so it is unable to bite you.
Keep holding it even if it squirms.
Put the kit down once it stops squirming.
Praise the kit and tell it how good it has been.

, Adult ferrets bite because they were not trained properly when they were younger and/or they have problems trusting humans. They will need direct skin to fur contact when you handle them. It will take a few months to train them to stop biting, but you need to be consistent, firm, and gentle with them.Adult ferrets bite much harder than kits, but still try to provide as much skin to fur contact as possible.
Adult ferrets may be suspicious and nervous when being handled.

, If a ferret was handled roughly as a kit or lacks confidence, it may be a fear biter. Punishing a fear biter may actually reinforce the idea that they should be afraid of people. You should be more gentle with a ferret that bites out of fear. Acclimate the ferret to being touched by you before you pick it up on a regular basis.Feed your ferret out of your hands and reward calm behavior.
Once your ferret is used to eating out of your hands, you can start picking the ferret up.
Keep your training sessions short at first. Progressively lengthen the time of your sessions as the ferret becomes more comfortable with you.

, Some ferrets bite to let you know that they want to play. If your ferret does this, remove your hand and walk away from the ferret. Your ferret may chase you after you walk away because it wants to play. By ignoring the ferret, you are teaching it that biting is not an appropriate way to initiate play time.Reward calm behavior with treats and kind words.If the ferret begins to bite during play, stop playing.

, Some ferrets bite as a way to communicate with you. By the time the ferret is biting, you may have missed other signals. Nuzzling or coming to you and waiting are signs that your ferret wants your attention. Notice if your ferret does these things, and then respond to your ferret immediately. If you wait too long to respond, your ferret learns that biting is the quickest way to get your attention.If your ferret bites to get your attention, ignore the ferret.
If your ferret bites you when it is ready to put it down, hold the ferret for a few seconds longer before you put it down. Putting down the ferret right after it bites you will reinforce the behavior.Some ferrets do not like being held for long periods of time, pay attention how your ferret responds.

Exercise regularly.,

See a physician regularly.",How to Look Great As a Gay Man1," Staying fit will make you look and feel great. You don't have to fit the perfect body-image obsessed stereotypes to hit the gym.All men are recommended to strength train all major muscle groups at least twice a week. Strength training not only builds aesthetically-pleasing muscle, but it also burns calories more efficiently than most other exercises. Be sure to also get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity aerobic activity each week.Many men are attracted to trim, muscular physiques. However, others prefer skinny or burly bodies. Don't feel pressured to conform to a certain standard of beauty.;
, Make sure you're not taking in more calories than you're burning, which will vary depending on your weight and activity level. Green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits, whole grains, and lean protein like fish should make up the bulk of your diet.

Practice good hygiene.,
Maintain facial hair properly.,
Take care of your skin.",How to Look Great As a Gay Man2," While some things will vary depending on your body type and personal style, you'll need to stick to some basics to avoid scaring most men away.


Wear deodorant. Some men are lucky enough to have fewer sweat glands and may not need to use deodorant on a daily basis. However, most do. Reapply deodorant as needed, especially in warm weather or after exercise.
Shower at least once a day. Use soap and water to rinse away dirt, dead skin, and bacterial buildup. Some people with fine or oily hair may need to shampoo daily, but most only need to wash their hair a few times a week or even less. Just don't go more than 14 days without a shampoo.Keep your nails clean and free from dirt. Your nails can be any length, shape, or color you prefer. If your nails are longer, buff out breaks with a nail file to keep them from snagging on hair and clothing.

, Facial hair grows at different rates between men. However, most men who shave do so each morning.


Even if you sport a full beard, you will need to shape it to look sharp. Shave or pluck away stray hairs on your face or below your neckline.
While stubble is currently popular, avoid growing it out too far to avoid looking unkempt., Smooth, healthy skin has universal appeal. Keep yours looking its best. This doesn't mean you have to go overboard with lotions and creams. There are, however, some basics you should cover.


Moisturize after you shower. Hydrated skin reduces the appearance of wrinkles.Protect your skin from the sun. Sun damage can cause premature aging in your skin. Wear a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or above."
"
Wear clothing that fits.,
Dress for the occasion.,
Keep your clothes in good condition.",How to Look Great As a Gay Man3," This is probably the only universal rule of fashion. Wearing perfectly fitted clothing makes you appear more put together and mature, even if you're just wearing a T-shirt and jeans. If you have unique proportions that make shopping difficult, try bringing your clothes to a tailor for alterations., Wearing clothing inappropriate for a situation may make you appear unprepared or foolish. You may not be the type of guy who wears a suit every day; just make sure you own one for when you're expected to wear it.


For more formal occasions like a job interview or wedding, stick to a dark matching suit. Your dress shirt and tie can be colorful as long as they don't clash or look tacky.Business casual is a happy medium for when you want to look sharp without overdoing it. Wear a collared shirt, slacks, and dress shoes. Pair with a blazer for a smarter look or a sweater. Ties are optional. This is a good look for networking events, evening parties, and first dates.Casual wear covers just about everything else, such as the classic T-shirt and jeans look. This can be your day-to-day style.
Cities with warmer climates may be more lax with dress codes. Nobody wants to wear a dark suit and jacket in extreme weather.
If you aren't sure what to wear to an event, ask other men who will be there what they plan on wearing. If you're going to a restaurant or venue, try figuring out what's expected by looking up photos of the establishment online.

, No matter how much or how little you spend on your wardrobe, taking care of your clothing will keep them looking better for longer.

Maintain good posture.,
Remember that other men may be just as nervous as you are.,
Make and hold eye contact longer.,
Love and accept yourself for who you are.",How to Look Great As a Gay Man4," Sit and stand with your back straight. Keep your shoulders back.


Good posture conveys poise and confidence. Even when you don't feel confident, projecting confidence to the world makes you more attractive.
Some studies show that good posture can act as a positive feedback loop when it comes to confidence. Maintaining good posture can actually boost your mood and build confidence on its own., Keep this in mind if you have a lot of anxiety and feel intimidated by a potential partner. Even the most confident people can hide insecurity. Reminding yourself that it's ok to feel nervous will help you to keep it from showing through., If your confidence is low, it may be difficult to make proper eye contact with others. Holding your gaze for the appropriate amount of time will make you appear more confident, likeable, and attractive to the other person.


When you're speaking with someone one-on-one, make eye contact for 7-10 seconds before looking elsewhere. If you're in a group, this should be 3-5 seconds.When breaking contact, look to the side or up slightly to appear confident and self-assured. Looking down at your shoes makes you seem anxious or submissive.Don’t make eye contact for too long. When you ""stare,"" you can come off as intimidating or creepy., The more comfortable you are with yourself, the easier building confidence will be. Even if great self-esteem doesn’t come naturally to you, there are many ways of cultivating it on your own.


Exercise mindfulness and positive self-talk. This can be as simple as telling yourself a few affirmations every morning in the mirror. Avoid admonishing yourself when you make a mistake and instead simply resolve to do better next time.Write down a list of things you like about yourself. Read it every time you need to cheer up.
Set realistic goals. Pick things that you know you can do with some effort. (For example, ""learn how to mountain climb"" rather than ""climb Mount Everest."") Celebrate each step on your way to fulfill that goal.

"
Come out when you feel ready.,
If you're getting teased about it, each and every time say: ""You can't judge me for it since it is just part of what makes me who I am.,
Make sure you have confidence and do not care what people say about you.,
Work on your true image, and be true to it.,
If you want to ""experiment"" but are in a relationship, be honest with yourself and your partner.,
Know that your sexuality or gender preference may change over time.",How to Love Being Bisexual," If you realize that you are not bisexual after coming out as one, do not worry. Not everyone can definitely know, and things can change. If you're really not sure and do not want to make a mistake, then you can just try to keep it a secret until you are 100% sure. But remember that it is really your choice when it comes to when you want to come out.;
, My love is genderless, and I can love and adore everyone and anyone I want. And why do you care if I'm bisexual or not?"" Or you can say something like, ""Why should it matter if I'm bisexual. Some people like both blond and brown hair, so why should it be different with sexuality?"" Try not to be rude about it. Stay calm and say what you want to say casually. No point in starting a fight or whatever just because you got a little to defensive.

, Both straight and gay people may call you ""fence sitter"", or they may think you are ""in a phase"" which is a clear example of biphobia. Homo- and biphobia is wrong, and you can either ignore it, or try educate people. Keep in mind that you really can't force someone into accepting it. You can try to slowly guide them into accepting your sexuality, but it is truly their decision.

, Be yourself at all times, and try not to change for people. If people don't believe you are bisexual, then just let it be! After all, sexuality and personality are completely different things! If someone doesn't believe you, it is probably either because they do not want to believe it or they are stubborn. They may come around in the future though.

, Experimenting on the side is being dishonest to the person you are with and will only hurt you both. If your partner is OK with it then mutually decide how you will explore this side of yourself - with or without your partner. When you are experimenting, at least try not to do so while you are in a relationship with someone else. That could potentially ruin your current relationship and cause it to end, even when you realize that you are not attracted to the other person and/or gender you were experimenting with earlier. One relationship at a time. Take the steady route.

, At times you may feel more attracted to one gender or the other. This is normal. That should not affect your entire point of view on your sexuality. It's just a matter of opinion. Just because you are attracted to a certain gender slightly more than another does not mean you are not bisexual. You could have a stronger interest in males than females, but that does not mean that you are not attracted to females as well.

"
Understand that the best first step to knowing someone's sexual orientation is to ask them.,
Make sure you ask respectfully and avoid slurs that can be considered rude.,
Understand that not everyone chooses to label their sexual orientation.,
If you're not in the position to ask someone about their orientation, look at their past relationships if at all possible.,
Consider prior knowledge about someone to be a gateway to ask them about whether or not they are pansexual.",How to Identify a Pansexual," This is true when you want to know anyone's sexual orientation, not just if they are pansexual. But also understand how many times particular individuals have probably had to tell others about their sexual orientation. Respect that they may not want to tell you and understand that it's perfectly okay for them not to want to share it with you. Don't assume that they are or are not pansexual based on them rejecting your request to tell you their orientation. There are plenty of other sexual orientations that they could identify as. Assumptions are never a solution.;
, This includes abbreviations such as pan. You should always use the full word ""pansexual"" when asking about orientation. The same rules apply to when asking someone about any orientation. bi, homo, and other abbreviations can appear offensive and should be avoided. Jokes are never okay. Puns off of the double meaning in ""pan"" are quite common and offensive. Ask politely- Your sense of humor is never appreciated when it is used to make fun of another person's sexual orientation or the way they were born.

, As a label may make someone's sexual orientation easier for others to understand, some people see their orientation as a much more fluid subject. Therefore, if someone chooses not to label themselves as pansexual despite having been involved with men, women, transgender people, and gender queer people, you shouldn't go out of your way to consider them pansexual. Respect their identity, or lack thereof.

, See the variety of genders of people they've dated in the past and make an educated judgement. Keep step three in mind, however. Although an educated guess is okay, don't begin calling someone pansexual simply because you believe they are based on their pasts.

, If you know someone has dated someone that you know to be transgender or gender queer, then you may be in the position to ask them about their orientation. For example, ""I heard you were in a relationship with xyz. I was curious, and I hope you don't mind me asking, but are you pansexual?"" or, ""Feel free not to answer if this is personal, but what is your sexual orientation?"" However, be careful when doing something like this and know how to read the conversation. If said without true, factual prior knowledge about someone, your asking could appear to be a quickly designed assumption and read to be very aggressive and offensive.

"
Try not to worry.,
Determine whether you feel attracted to people of the opposite gender.,
Figure out whether you feel comfortable dating someone of the opposite gender.,
Use your imagination.,
Imagine yourself with different sexual identities.",How to Know if You Are Heterosexual1," Remember that it can take a long time to work out your sexual identity, and that your feelings may change over time. There’s no need to rush into giving yourself a label. Just relax, allow your feelings to develop naturally, and think about how you feel without judging yourself., Even if you have never had a romantic or sexual relationship with another person, you may have had feelings of sexual or romantic attraction toward other people. Think about people you have been attracted to, whether they are people you know personally, celebrities, or even fictional characters.If you find that all or most of the people you are/have been attracted to are of a different gender from you, there is a good chance you are straight.

, Think about your close relationships with others, whether they are platonic (just friends), romantic, or sexual. Take a moment to ask yourself how you feel about those relationships, without judging or over-analyzing those feelings. Consider which relationships have felt most comfortable (safe, fulfilling, happy) to you.Do you feel any romantic or sexual attraction toward your close friends of the opposite gender? If so, ask yourself how you would feel about dating any of those people.
How do you feel about any romantic and sexual experiences you have had with people of the opposite gender, or with people of the same gender, if you’ve had them? Did you enjoy them and feel fulfilled by them? Make note of which relationships you feel the most positive about, and ask yourself how much the gender of the other person had to do with that feeling.

, Picture yourself in romantic or sexual situations with people of different genders. Let your mind take you where it wants to go without overthinking things or judging yourself. Think about how you feel when you imagine these situations:If you mainly enjoy imagining yourself with people of a different gender from yourself, you may be heterosexual.
If you feel happy and excited when you imagine yourself exclusively in straight relationships or situations, then this may also be a sign that you are heterosexual.

, Sexual orientation is not black and white. You may be straight, gay, or somewhere in the middle (bisexual or bicurious).Some people think of themselves as straight even if they occasionally feel attracted to (or have even had relationships with) people of the same gender, and some people consider themselves gay even if they have felt some attraction to/had relationships with people of another gender. Others are not interested in sexual or romantic relationships at all, with people of any gender. These people may consider themselves asexual or aromantic.What’s most important is how you think of yourself.Try writing down, or saying to yourself out loud, “I am heterosexual,” or “I am straight.” How do you feel when you refer to yourself this way? Does it feel comfortable to you?

Talk to a close friend about your sexual orientation.,
Find a forum where you can talk about sexual identity issues.,
Talk to a counselor.",How to Know if You Are Heterosexual2," Sometimes it can help to talk things over with someone who may be going through the same things and asking the same questions as you. Tell a friend you trust about the questions you have, and ask them about their own experiences, if they feel comfortable talking about it.


If you know your friend is comfortable talking about their sexuality, try asking something like, “When did you first figure out that you are straight/gay/bisexual? How did you know?”

, Look for a moderated forum where you can talk (anonymously, if you prefer) with other people who are also looking for answers about their sexuality. If you’d rather not join the discussion, just reading other people’s conversations about the topic can be helpful. Try starting with the Sexual and Gender Issues forum at PsychCentral: https://forums.psychcentral.com/sexual-gender-issues/

, If your questions about your sexual identity are causing you a lot of anxiety and stress, consider making an appointment with a mental health specialist (psychologist, clinical social worker, or counselor). They may be able to help you understand your sexuality better, or point you in the direction of some helpful resources."

You should be able to go to the website of your local DNR (Department of Natural Resources) to see images; this will help you identify the unique markings of garter snakes in your area and avoid those which may be more dangerous.;
, Technically, the garter snake's bite is venomous (their venom is a neurotoxin which slows down or paralyzes its prey), but the venom is not dangerous to humans.Even so, you may be worried about mistaking a dangerous venomous snake for a harmless garter snake. There's no one venomous snake that the garter snake mimics in appearance, and because it can look so different from region to region, and because the population of dangerous snakes also varies across the country, your best bet will be to research all of the snakes found in your area before you go out in the field.
You should visit the website of your DNR or purchase a field guide for your area to be able to view pictures of both the common garter snakes and the more dangerous snake species in your area.

, There are various reasons for deciding to catch a garter snake, of course. You may be thinking about catching one for a science project, to observe for a day or two, or perhaps even to add to an indoors tank (to become your “pet” of sorts). Many people, though, think that if they see garter snakes in their garden or yard, they must catch them to be rid of them (to either relocate them or kill them).


While there's no doubt stumbling upon a sunning garter snake as you reach for a ripe tomato will give you quite the scare, there's absolutely no need to run for the hoe or to set out traps with an eye to ridding your garden of snakes.
Indeed, snakes are a great addition to your garden's ecosystem, and can help you in your crusade against pesky rodents and crop destroying insects., You may be surprised to learn that many gardeners go to great lengths to try to attract garter snakes! You can try to entice them by providing them with hiding places (stacked rocks, sheets of plywood, or stumps) and fresh water sources (such as shallow fountains or ground-level birdbaths)., If you are intent on catching a garter snake for observational purposes or to keep as a pet (please think twice before catching one to use as part of a prank!), you should spend some time scoping out the areas where snakes are most likely to be found.


Generally speaking, garter snakes migrate around moist areas with still water sources; you may be able to find them in these areas when they are on the hunt for their various prey (insects, frogs, and small mammals).As reptiles, garter snakes are “ectotherms,” which means that they must obtain their heat from external (outside) sources. Consequently, these “cold-blooded” creatures can often be found basking on rocks on cooler days in an effort to warm up, and resting in shady spots when it is warmer.

, Garter snakes also spend a good amount of time in their dens. They tend to create their dens under large rocks or stable structures. Thus, good places to look for them are around or under piles of building materials, along the foundations of buildings, under steps, or tucked away in log piles or stone walls., Luckily, you don't need any special equipment to catch garter snakes. Because they are not harmful to humans, you don't need to worry about expensive protective gear (though you should take care to not get bitten in order to avoid a possible secondary infection—plus, it probably won't feel too great to be bitten, even if the bite won't cause lasting damage!).


Some materials that you may find helpful are a soft net, bag and/or pillowcase and a forked stick.We'll explain how you will use these materials in subsequent steps.
Alternatively, you can bring a large bucket along with your forked stick. Make sure that the bucket has a lid with ventilation.

, Garter snakes will usually attempt to flee when they feel threatened, but they can become aggressively defensive, especially if they feel trapped or are captured. They may bite, and they may also secrete strong smelling anal secretions.Because the garter snake's venom is not dangerous to humans, you don't need to worry about expensive protective gear. Even so, the bites can become infected, and some people experience swelling and/or get a rash after being bitten.Thus, it's a good idea to bring (and wear) protective gloves when you head out. Gardening gloves (or slightly heavier work gloves) should be thick enough to protect you but still allow you to grab and handle the snake with relative ease.

, You'll have better luck catching a garter snake if you can be prepared in the early morning as the snake leaves it den and sets off in search of its breakfast.


The snakes are more likely to be a bit sluggish in the morning than they will be later in the day.Taking advantage of this will improve your chances that you'll be able to snag one of these slippery creatures.

, Garter snakes are excellent at sensing both their prey and their predators (you!), so you'll want to take precautions to not scare them off as you advance.


Because garter snakes can sense vibrations in the ground, you'll want to be as quiet as possible. Wear soft-soled shoes, tread lightly, and if possible, limit the size of your “hunting” party., Garter snakes can also “smell” the air around them and will quickly identify any foreign odors. If the snake is downwind from you, your scent will have reached it far before you arrive, alerting it to your advance.Thus, you should avoid wearing any strong scents, colognes or perfumes, and travel into the wind if at all possible.

, Once you've spotted a snake, continue to move as quietly as possible. Approach the snake from behind and stay as low to the ground as possible., So long as you are certain that the snake before you is a garter snake, you needn't take extreme precautions as you would with a more dangerous snake. Of course, if there's any chance that the snake may be a more dangerous type, you should put a halt to your outing until you are able to verify that the snake is not a threat.


If you brought along a forked stick, you can now use it to help you pin down the snake. This will make it easier for you to be able to grab it or scoop it into your net, and can also help prevent it from biting you.
Try to place the forked end of the stick as close behind the snake's head as possible. If you place it lower down on the body, the snake may be able to twist around and bite you., If you are certain that the snake you are attempting to catch is a harmless garter snake, then you can scoop it up in almost any manner that you like (or are able to). This means that you can grab it by the tail and attempt to drop it into an open net, pillowcase or bucket (drop the lid on top as soon as the snake is in—they can move quickly!).


To be on the safer side though, do your best to grab the snake behind the head so that it won't be able to swing back and bite you., If you forgot your gloves, or if the snake manages to bite through the material, you do not need to worry about being in immediate danger. If you are bitten, you need to carefully clean your wound and keep a close eye on it.


Puncture wounds caused by the snakes fangs may appear to heal quickly, but if you haven't thoroughly cleaned the wound, dirt and bacteria could be trapped under your skin and lead to a potentially dangerous infection.Don't hesitate to seek medical attention if your wound doesn't heal soon or if you experience significant swelling or a rash.

, If you only plan on keeping your garter snake for a day's observation, it should be fine kept in a deep, lidded bucket (with ventilation holes) with a bit of grass and a misting of water.


If you decide to keep your garter snake, you will need to transfer it to a more suitable home and learn about its dietary needs. Be sure to read our our wikiHow on how to take care of your garter snake.

Consider the risk of letting her know.,
Set boundaries.,
Spend time with other friends!,
Try learning/doing something new.,
Beware of becoming the ""anti-you""!,
Boost your confidence!,
Love your best friend.,
Be happy for her.,
Realize that this friendship is worth the effort.,
Give.",How to Get over Your Lesbian Crush on a Straight Best Friend," Before you act hastily, this is a good question to think about. Think: if she doesn't already know or sense that you have feelings for her, telling her may make her feel your relationship is ""unbalanced."" She may feel a burden knowing that you feel something for her that she doesn't return. If she's uncomfortable knowing, it may make your friendship impossible. Another thing you should probably do, is check if she's homophobic, or uncomfortable with homosexuality. You should also take into account whether or not she knows your sexual orientation. So there's a risk involved in making your feelings known to her; consider carefully if you want to take that risk.;
, Making sure you have clear guidelines in place for avoiding ""bittersweet moments"" will be key to getting over your feelings for your bestie. Having lots of chats about her love life, her feelings, etc., can really melt your heart - you listen to her problems and sigh thinking, ""If only she felt that way about me."" Does it make you feel more protective of her? Probably. Is it a good idea to have lots of sleepovers while having those ""sensitive chats""? Probably not. More contact, more time together, especially in more intimate settings, means more chances that you will not be able to control your feelings. If you lose control, you may lose your friend. Stay in control by setting those boundaries.


Example: Your Boundary: When you're feeling more for her, you will try to put a little space between you. The Situation: She invites you to sleep over, but you realize that lately you're struggling to keep your feelings of jealousy and longing under control. Instead of automatically agreeing to the sleepover, tell her that you can't this time (you don't even need to give a reason, but if pressed, just say your mom has laid down the law and wants you home this weekend), but that you'll do it soon. This way, you're not saying you will never sleep over, you're just giving yourself a chance to tone your feelings down.

, It's hard to get over someone when she is the only person you ever hang out with! Spread your time among others - chances are you've neglected your other friends since you and your bestie have been spending so much (too much, maybe?) time together (and maybe you have some apologizing to do...).

, Pick something that you and your best friend haven't done together, and that she doesn't do by herself. Pick something completely untouched by her, and try to keep it that way. (But don't push her away from it if she asks... just don't invite her if she does!) It will be good for you to do something that doesn't remind you of her (most likely, everything else will). Maybe you want to try to listen to a new type of music or try out a new restaurant.

, Trying new things, meeting new people, and moving ahead with life does not mean you stop being the person you have always been. Don't do things simply because your bestie doesn't do them - when trying new things, pick things that you genuinely do enjoy and/or are open to!

, It can be a real ego-killer trying to subconsciously impress a girl that you know you can never be with. Go work out! Go after that goal of yours that has been on the back burner for so long! Volunteer at a local food bank or homeless shelter, or at Habitat for Humanity ! Feel good about yourself! Really, exercise will do you wonders! Not only will you look better, feel better, but you can finally fall asleep without spending hours of obsessing over your crush.

, Just because you are getting over your crush on her does NOT mean you should stop loving your best friend. Love comes in many forms. Remember that just because your best friend might not feel the same way about you romantically, it does not mean that she doesn't care for you at all! Not only is she your best friend, but you are hers. Cherish the fact and be glad for what you do have.

, You will need to rejoice when she rejoices... even if that's upon her finding her true love. Resist the temptation to spend all your time with her moping because she's found someone to love. Don't try to sabotage or talk trash about him. These things will only drive a wedge between you If you need some space, simply take it by being less available. Don't say things like, ""It's just too hard for me to see you with him."" ... Awkward.

, And also know that things get better in the end. Be grateful you have such an amazing best friend though! (Really though, SHE is awfully lucky, too - YOU ARE AMAZING for going through such hardship for her!)

, You know what the best thing is about forgetting about the girl you can never be with? It is YOU GIVING! Give of yourself - try to make someone else happy. Stop thinking so much about what you are (or aren't) getting, and think about what you can give. Go volunteer, get a pet, take care of something! Invest in something that needs you! There are so many causes/projects/people out there that need you - NEED you. Go find one!

Do some research.,
Look for a reputable breeder or a very good pet store.,
Ask to hold the snake of your choice.,
Ask the pet store owner lots of questions.,
Buy all equipment.,
Set up all equipment properly and make sure everything is working and the lid or doors shut properly and lock securely.,
Purchase your snake on a day that you just have to yourself.,
A baby snake will need a pinkie mouse every 5-7 days, and an adult will need a mouse every 7-14 days.

,
Water must be changed regularly as the often defecate in it.

,
Change vivarium at least once a month and scrub it thoroughly in hot water.

,
Feed your snake separate from the tank, in a box.,
To pick him up, reach in slowly without hesitation and grab the middle and slowly lift him up and out, supporting him fully with your arms and hands.

,
Don't pick your snake up if he is in his hiding spot, that means he needs time out and won't be too happy if you disturb him.

,
Have fun with your new pet!

",How to Care for Snakes," Find out everything you possibly can about your snake, take into account the lifespan, size of tank and housing requirements very carefully. Be realistic about these, if you realize that you actually can't do this, you are not a failure and are in fact saving an animal from what would have been a stressful life.;
, Just because a pet store is small doesn't mean that they are bad.

, It should feel muscular and strong, with no signs of mites. You should not be able to see the spine, as this will indicate a seriously underweight snake. There should also be clear eyes nose and mouth, as this can lead to a respiratory infection.

, Can you guarantee that this is a purebred *Snake breed*? Can you give me accurate records of shedding? How much does he eat, how often and on what days? Has he been interacted with and properly tamed? Where do you get your stock from?

, Equipment includes a vivarium, water bowl, substrate, something for the snake to climb, heat mat (Only covering half the vivarium), a light (Optional), thermometer, hydrometer and two hides, one in the cold side and one in the hot. You can get very good bargains at pet stores on equipment.

, Fit any wires and decorations, and attach the heat mat. allow at least 3 days for the temperature to regulate.

, Make sure nobody will be in the room that it is being taken care of in.

,,,, That way, if you reach in to hold him, he won't think ""FOOD!""

Before you get started, familiarize yourself with your ferrets paw.,
Place a towel across your lap.,
Use a sharp pair of nail trimmers and clip off the excess nail, cutting at the correct angle so that the new flat tip of the toenail will be parallel to the floor when the ferret is standing.,
Alternative to ferretone (this may not work with a very squirmy or fat ferret): Place your hand on the back of the neck of your ferret.,
Finished.

",How to Trim a Ferret's Toenails," You will notice that the nails of the ferret have blood vessels within them; this is called the 'quick'. When trimming a ferrets nails, it's especially important to avoid cutting into the quick as it will hurt your ferret and will bleed. It's a good idea to have styptic powder to stop bleeding.

, Position your ferret in your lap on his back. Place two drops of Ferretone on his belly and rub them in. He'll be so busy trying to lick all of the treat, you will have plenty of time to trim all of his nails.
, Do this slowly and carefully as not to damage your ferret or cut into the quick of the nail. Be sure to leave a half centimeter or so of nail past the quick.
. There's no need to do all the nails at once, if your ferret gets too restless put them down and do some a bit later., Gently grasp the skin with the entire palm of your hand and pick your ferret up being careful not to pull any of your ferrets fur. Picking your ferret up like this is called 'scruffing' your ferret. This is how they are carried by their mothers after birth, the same as a cat or dog carries their offspring. Pick your ferret up slowly, and do not squeeze too hard, but be sure not to drop him! If you do this right your ferret will relax and may yawn. This is an instinct from being carried around by their mothers as 'kits' (babies). After trimming a few nails, set your ferret down for a moment. This gives your arm and your ferret a chance to rest for a moment. After a brief rest, trim a few more and rest again until your ferret is groomed.

Allow yourself to let the feelings come at appropriate times.,
Talk to a friend or other loved one.,
Hold onto yourself.,
Don't allow yourself to wallow.,
Dig deep.,
Don't make it about your orientation.,
Let go of bad memories, keep good ones.,
Take your time.",How to Get over Your First Love (LGBT)," Don't try to pretend it didn't happen, or that it didn't hurt. Allow yourself to feel all the hurt and pain, and if there's anger, that, too. The only problem with doing this is that you have these feelings all the time - getting emotional at work or school is not a good thing. Suppress the emotions as best you can to get through your days. After work or school, allow yourself to feel the pain, cry it out, get some help from your friends and loved ones.;
, The first step in getting over your first love is talking to someone about it. Write in a journal or diary. Get it off your chest. Express those emotions in words, out loud to someone you trust, and in writing. Sometimes writing is a very useful and personal way to express emotions, because you can be even freer when writing than when talking to another person. In any case, getting some support from a friend or relative can really help to relieve you of your burden, allow someone to comfort you, even if you can't be totally consoled.


Be careful about expressing your feelings to your current romantic partner, if you have one. Your partner may become worried that they're a rebound relationship, or that if your first love comes back, you'll leave your partner for your first love.

, You may feel as if you don't know who you are without your love - you might feel like, ""Without her/him, I'm nobody."" That's not true. You were yourself before this relationship. You are yourself now. You have friends that were your friends before. You have a family. Remember who you are. You are the eldest/middle/youngest child of your parents. You have the love and respect of your family and friends - with or without your love. Hold onto those you love, and who love you.

, Although you want to feel and express those feelings, don't just wallow in sorrow. That's not healthy.

, Allowing yourself to feel sad, lonely, and lost is okay - but you will also need to dig deep inside yourself and find a place where you aren't broken. Grab onto that, and hold onto it. It's the way we hold ourselves together when we're shattered. Nobody will tell you it isn't hard. But it is necessary.

, So this was your first LGBT love. It can feel so much harder - you may have discovered that you were gay or bisexual because of your love for this person, or became fully able to accept your gender identity because of them. You might feel betrayed or completely lost now because this person was your rudder, kind of your lighthouse. You discovered the LGBT world through your relationship. That world still exists, and that world is all about acceptance. You will find sympathy and acceptance from friends in the LGBT community.

, Don't obsess over the bad times. At the same time, don't over-romanticize the good parts. Remember that there were problems, you had fights. Still, you learned a lot and had some very good times, and those are not to be forgotten.

, No one can tell you how long to grieve over your lost love. One step at a time, one day at a time. It can feel like you're made of lead, and that every step you take is heavy and difficult. But the more you force yourself to act like life is normal, the more it will actually become normal. You may feel sad for a long time, but eventually, time will heal you, if you will let it.

Define your own beliefs.,
Know what you're looking for.,
Search the web.,
Find out what religion the church practices.,
Ask a staff member.,
Remember that not all churchgoers anywhere will be supportive.",How to Know if a Church Is Accepting of LGBT People," Knowing what you believe is important, because churches don't always publish their beliefs on LGBT issues. What is important to you, what doesn't matter much, and what is a deal breaker? This will help narrow the list of churches to investigate. For example.


Communion
Pro-Life or Pro-Choice (Abortion, Euthanasia, Capital Punishment, War, Situational Homicide)
Literal interpretation of the Bible or other religious book;
, Remember that many churches, while believing in loving and supporting gay people (or paying lip service to this), do not believe in same sex marriage. For example the Catholic Church orders that ""They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity.""Whether or not you personally support same sex marriage should be considered.


Some churches are unable to hold ceremonies for same sex marriage, but are accepting and will respect LGBT+ people.

, The church website should tell you about their beliefs both on LGBT issues and whatever else drives you to join a particular church.

, Some churches won't have much on their website if their religion has lots of material on the web. Older faiths like Catholics and Lutherans might have almost none, considering they have a huge web presence and have been around for other people to write about for about 2,000 and 500 years respectively.

, Most churches have a minister who can be contacted (find contact information through websites) or a secretary (information also found through websites). If you ask straight up, ""What does your church believe about LGBT issues?"" they will most likely answer honestly. If you don't want to be ""out"" to this person, imply that you're doing a survey.


Most people will not admit ""This is an unsafe space."" If you start feeling uncomfortable or attacked during the person's response, then you or your loved one will probably not be met with unconditional respect.
Try to ask more than one person in the church. It could be that Gary the altar boy has very different views from the rest of the church.

, No matter where you go, there will always be people who may stare or ask ""Is she gay?"" or ""Is he transgender?"". Still, there is no reason why you should exclude yourself from church services. Go for one Sunday and see how the people are and how the environment makes you feel. The best way to learn is through experience.

Brush the fur.,
Feed a hairball preventative to your ferret.,
Feed the ferret a proper diet.,
Add taurine.,
Mix an arachidonic acid supplement into your ferret’s diet.",How to Keep Your Ferret's Hair Healthy1," Use a rubber brush or a grooming brush intended for kittens or cats. Hold the ferret in one hand or have a helper do this. Use quick gentle strokes, and make sure you eventually brush all areas of the ferret’s fur.Ferrets tend to fidget when brushed so you may want to do frequent short sessions instead of longer attempts;
, Laxatone is the usual preventative hairball treatment given to ferrets. Administer laxatone by putting it on the ferret’s nose or paws for them to taste and ingest. These are orally administered medicines to smooth passage of hair in the ferret’s digestive tract.Laxatone works by allowing the hair to slide through the ferret's gastrointestinal tract, and out of the body without a hairball ever forming. Laxatone is available in many pet stores.

, Feed the ferret every 3-4 hours. A standard ferret diet should maintain good coat and skin health. The ideal ferret diet should be 30-35 percent meat protein, and 15-30 percent fat.Ferret’s need a diet high in protein, high in fat, low in fiber, and low in carbohydrates. Ferrets have a high metabolism so think about leaving some food out all of the time. Whole prey (such as a live mouse) is ideal for a ferret’s diet, but may not be practical for most pet owners. Ferret-specific foods are available in many pet stores. Cat food can sometimes be substituted, but ask your veterinarian.

, You can either find a ferret food with this already in it or add it in artificially. The taurine comes often in “FerretVite.” FerretVite should be added to the water in liquid form 1 teaspoon daily.FerretVite is a multivitamin that will help with overall nutritional health including coat and skin health. It also comes in the form of an edible paste.

, The usual supplement given for ferret’s for arachidonic acid is “FerreTone.” Mix 3/4 teaspoon (3.75 ml) of the supplement into the ferret’s food daily for adults or 1.5 teaspoons (7.5 ml) for kits, pregnant, and nursing ferrets.This is not normally necessary when feeding your ferret a normal diet, but may help with maintaining skin and coat health. Arachidonic acid helps with fur health, neurological health, and skeletal health.

Whatever container you use needs to be just full enough of water so the ferret’s head is just above the water when it stands up.A ferret’s normal body temperature is 102 degrees Fahrenheit.

, You’ll need to purchase a shampoo specifically designed for ferrets from a pet store, or ask your veterinarian. Hold the ferret in one hand or have a helper do this. Work the shampoo into the ferret’s fur gently with the warm water into a lather. You may want to use a grooming brush to do this. Use long soft strokes. Avoid the ferret’s eyes, ears, and mouth.These shampoos are set to a special pH (acidity) balance for a ferret’s skin. Kitten or tearless baby shampoos may also work.
Consult your veterinarian if you need a special type of shampoo such as for a flea condition.

, Use warm water and be thorough. Run the warm water over all areas of the fur.Ensure no shampoo or soap residue remains or you risk drying out the skin.

, Avoid letting the ferret get chilly or near cold air drafts while damp. Use a towel to pad down the ferret’s fur until it’s only damp. Lay the ferret on one or more bunched up towels to allow the ferret to dry themselves by rolling around.Don’t dry the ferret so roughly that you scrape their skin.

, Set the blow dryer to its minimum setting. Hold the blow dryer at least one foot from the ferret. Activate the blow dryer and use it until the ferret is dry.This is an alternative to towel drying your ferret
If you are worried about over-drying then you should use the blow dryer just until the ferret is damp and let them burrow into towels to complete the drying process.

You can trap venomous snakes on your own, but you should take extreme caution when doing so. If you have kids and pets around and are worried that someone might get bitten, you can always call animal control to come and catch the snake for you.


There are four types of venomous snakes in North America: rattlesnakes (common in the Western states and identifiable by their rattles), copperheads (copper and black-striped) water moccasins (found in rivers and streams in the Southeastern US) and coral snakes (extremely rare snakes with a brightly-colored coral pattern).Rattlesnakes, copperheads and water moccasins are all pit vipers, and they share a few characteristics: they have thick bodies, triangular heads that are larger than their necks, and vertical pupils instead of round ones.
Most snakes you'll encounter in the backyard or basement are nonvenomous and completely harmless. Finding a 5-foot king snake in the basement will almost certainly be alarming, but they pose no danger to humans or pets. Nonvenomous snakes do not have rattles, and they have round pupils. Common nonvenomous snakes you might encounter in a home environment include king snakes, rat snakes, garter snakes, gopher snakes, milk snakes and corn snakes.;
, This is the most common type of trap used to catch snakes, and it's both effective and humane. Traps come in small or large sizes, and they generally look like boxes that you set up where you commonly see the snake you're trying to trap. Snake traps usually come with bait already installed to lure the snake inside. When the snake crawls in, it will get stuck to the glue lining the floor of the trap. When a snake is caught, you open the trap and pour oil over the snake so it can get loose and glide away.You should be able to find a glue snake trap in your local home and garden supply store. Make sure to pick out a trap that's big enough to contain the snake.
There are several different glue trap brands, but they all work essentially the same way. The trap itself might be made of either heavy duty cardboard or plastic. Some traps are reusable, while others are single-use. Some let you release the snake, while others are designed to let you throw the snake away without opening the trap.

, This is a good alternative if you have a lot of snakes to deal with and you don't want to have to purchase new glue inserts for a glue trap. Minnow traps are made of wire mesh and are cylindrical in shape, with holes at either end that invert inside the trap.Just put a few eggs inside to use as bait. The snake will crawl into one of the holes to get the eggs, but it won't be able to find its way out.


Minnow traps are pretty inexpensive and easy to come by. Look for one at your local fishing supply store.
The only drawback to using a minnow trap is that you have to bait it yourself, and it's a little more difficult to deal with the snake once you catch it, since the snake can crawl away as soon as you open up the trap. For this reason a minnow trap is probably best used to catch nonvenomous snakes.

, Whichever trap you use, set it up in an area where you've seen snakes before. Common places to set up traps include garden areas, the basement, the attic, or the chicken coop. There's no need to camouflage the trap - just set it up in an area that's highly trafficked by snakes.


Make sure the trap is firmly closed when you set it. If you're using a glue trap, be sure the latch that closes the box is clasped.
If you're using a minnow trap, set it up so that the cylinder is resting on its side, and place the eggs in the center of the trap.

, Once you catch a snake, you'll want to deal with it as soon as possible. Don't let it die in the trap. This is both inhumane and unsanitary, since the snake will quickly begin to rot. Check the trap every day to see if you've caught something.


If you're using a glue trap, you might be able to open the top of the box to see if there's a snake inside. Be very careful when you're undoing the latch. You can also tell by lifting the trap to see how heavy it is.
If you're using a minnow trap, the snake will likely be in plain view, coiled around the eggs, patiently waiting for you to release it.

, If you're really familiar with snakes, and you know that what you've caught is a garter snake or another nonvenomous snake, you might be able to get away with touching it. But if you're at all unsure what type of snake you've caught, don't take the chance. Wild snakes don't much like to be handled, anyway. Gently carry the entire trap to your vehicle and put it in the trunk or another enclosed area so you can transport it.


Don't shake the trap or poke at the snake. Handle it with care.
You might want to keep small children and pets away from the trap while you're handling it, just to be on the safe side.

, If you let the snake go too close to your house, it will find its way back to its home territory. Release the snake at least a mile from your home if you want to make sure it doesn't come back. However, if you trapped the snake in your house and you don't mind if it lives outdoors in the yard, you can just walk outside to release it there.

, The snake will have the best chance at surviving without disturbing other people if you release it in a natural area. Go to a state park or another area without a lot of people living close by to release the snake. This way it won't end up in someone else's garden.

, Freeing a snake is not usually dangerous; in most cases, the snake will be happy to slither away and leave you alone. But just in case, wear long pants and gloves when you're freeing the snake. Watch the snake carefully and be ready to move out of the way if it decides to strike. Depending on which kind of trap you used, there are two different ways to free a snake:


If you used a reusable glue trap, unlatch the lid of the box and open it up. Pour vegetable oil over the snake's body, making sure to cover the entire are that's attached to the glue. The trap is designed so that the snake will be able to wiggle free from the glue once the oil gets between the snake's skin and the bottom of the trap. By this time you should be standing a fair distance from the trap so you aren't blocking the snake as it leaves the scene.
If you're using a minnow trap, put on a pair of heavy gloves, since you'll have to get a bit closer to the snake (though you still won't have to touch it). Carefully open the two sides of the trap to separate them at the middle. Leave just enough space for the snake to crawl out. Move away so you aren't in the snake's path when it crawls out.

, All snakes, even venomous snakes, play an important role in their ecosystems and should be released if possible.But if the snake is venomous and you're concerned that someone could get harmed by it, you killing it might be the answer.


If you used a cardboard glue trap, you can just put the whole thing in a garbage bag and seal it up.
If you use a minnow trap, you can place the entire trap underwater for a few hours before opening it., While it can be surprising to encounter a snake while weeding your garden or walking around your yard, having a snake around isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, you should be proud - a good snake population in an area is a sign that the ecosystem there is healthy. In addition, snakes play an important role in keeping other pests, like mice and rats, from taking over. So if a snake isn't eating your chicken's eggs or otherwise being a bother, consider sharing your yard with it instead of trapping it and moving it elsewhere.


Rat snakes and gopher snakes are especially beneficial to have around. They're as good as cats for keeping the rodent population down.King snakes go one step further and eat rattlesnakes. In fact, if you get rid of a king snake, the rattlesnakes are more likely to move in - and then you'll have a much more serious problem on your hands.

, If you don't like snakes, a great way to keep them away is to make your yard less snake-friendly. Snakes hang out in areas that are a little unkempt and wild. They like tall grass, brush piles, wood piles, and other sources of shelter. To make your yard less inviting, do the following:


Mow the lawn regularly.
Get rid of piles of rocks, leaves, brush, bricks, or anything else that a snake could use as shelter.
Keep your rodent population down by cleaning up acorns, sealing your trash, and removing other sources of food for rodents.

, If you've been finding snakes in your attic or basement, look for cracks and holes that might be letting them in. Make sure the doors and windows are sealed around the edges. Screen the chimney, vents, and any other spots that could serve as an entryway for a snake.

, Snake experts seem to agree that most repellents aren't effective, but they might be worth a try if you've exhausted other ideas.Try putting one of the following substances in your garden, chicken coop or wherever you have a snake problem:


Spray a solution made with fox urine around the perimeter of your property. Some say that snakes are deterred by the smell of their predators' urine. You can find this solution in home and garden stores.
Try putting rags soaked in ammonia around the yard. This substance is said to repel snakes and other animals.
Put human hair clippings around your garden. The smell of the hair is said to keep snakes away.

"
"
Brush their teeth once to twice a month.,
Begin by putting a tiny bit of some specially made ferret toothpaste onto an extra soft baby brush.,
Have someone scruff the ferret for you so you can brush their teeth more accurately.

,
Gently open the ferret’s mouth using your finger (make sure your finger is clean!),
Make sure you get the back teeth too because this is mostly where they chew their food.,
Once you are done, give them some water so the taste of the toothpaste goes away and you may give them a treat too.

",How to Groom a Ferret1," First of all, you need a toothbrush. One for a toddler is the best.;
, Not only do ferrets love the flavor of this toothpaste, but it also helps break down the plaque on their teeth. If you can't find ferret toothpaste at your pet store, it can be ordered from online pet stores or amazon. If you cannot find ferret toothpaste at your pet store , or are to busy to go to the hassle of ordering online , then cat or kitten toothpaste Is a somewhat, albeit not completely safe, alternative to special ferret toothpastes (WARNING: all human toothpastes including toddler, are extremely toxic to ferrets as well as dog pastes.) The amount of toothpaste you should squeeze onto the brush should be about half the size of a green pea.

,, and take the toothbrush with the toothpaste on it and gently brush their teeth using swirly motions.

, If you brush too hard, their gums may bleed so be very careful!

Understand when to bathe ferrets.,
Choose the right supplies.,
Make sure the water temperature is okay.",How to Bathe a Ferret1," Many ferret owners love their pets but get frustrated by their smell, which can be quite strong. Bathing ferrets can be a good way to combat odor, but only if it's done following proper protocol.


Bathing a ferret too often can actually make the smell worse. Bathing strips oils from a ferret's skin and oil glands go into overdrive to replace what's been lost. This result in added stink. Ferrets should not be bathed more than once a month.Ferret smells are actually more often related to a ferret's bedding, cage, and blankets than to the ferret itself. Try washing these items before bathing your ferret to rule them out as the primary cause of smell.Ferrets become itchy and uncomfortable when bathed too often. If your ferret is itching frequently and appears otherwise distressed, you might want to cut back on how often you're bathing him.;
, All your supplies should be ready before you bring your ferret to the tub or sink. To bathe a ferret, you will need:


Shampoo. Choose a shampoo specifically made for ferrets. Shampoos made for other animals can easily dry out a ferrets skin and cause him discomfort. Depending on your ferret's needs, choose a shampoo right for him. If he's not well behaved during bathing, for example, get tearless shampoo in case shampoo gets in his eyes. If he has fleas, special shampoos that kill flees are available. Ferret shampoo can be purchased online or from a pet store.If you want, you get conditioner for your ferret. This replenishes the oils lost in bathing. Once again, be sure to select a conditioner specifically made for ferrets.A towel should be available to dry the ferret after the bath. Ferrets get cold quickly, so you may want to put the towel in the dryer before the bath so it's warm to the touch afterwards.

, A ferret's normal body temperature is between 101 and 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Water that feels lukewarm to you is cold for a ferret. Fill the tub or sink with water that is warm to the touch but not boiling. Go for the water temperature you would want when taking a hot bath."
"
Run water in the bathtub.,
Have your soap/shampoo ready.,
Put the ferret carefully in the tub.,
Rub shampoo on the ferret's body thoroughly, not on the head.,
Wash the shampoo off quickly, rub it off well.

,
Remove the ferret from the tub and dry it quickly.,
If the ferret has been good, reward them with a treat.

",How to Wash a Ferret," Make sure the water is not too hot, not too cold. Ferrets hate extreme temperatures.;
, Use only ferret shampoo, although baby shampoo may be used if ferret shampoo is not readily available. Other shampoos may cause illnesses or cause eye irritation.

, Avoid getting it's face wet; especially the ears and eyes. Ears can get infected if water gets in them.

, Take a damp cloth and go over the ferrets head, don't use shampoo on it.

,, Let it run outside to dry off, use a towel, or get a toy specific for drying them off. (Yes, they do have those.)

,"
"
Get some ferret nail clippers.,
Either have lots of treats so you can trim them or some Ferretone to put on their bellies while you trim them.,
Before you begin cutting, scruff your ferret and look at their nails.,
Start with the front paws and work your way to the back.,
Be very careful!,
If you do slip and the ferret starts bleeding, have some baking soda in a little bowl.,
Once you are done give your ferret a big hug and some water.",How to Groom a Ferret2," Human nail clippers are more likely to cut them too high and make them bleed.

, Ferretone is recommended, but it’s up to you. If you don’t want to, put your ferret on a counter (or another flat surface) and place 4-5 treats on the counter. It’s better if someone holds the treats because if the treats fall off the counter your ferret will want to go after them and you may cut them if they move.

, Depending on the length, you should see a little red line at about the middle of the nail. You cannot cut above that or they will bleed! Once your ferret begins eating the treats, begin trimming. {Gulp!}

, If the treats run out before you are done, stop trimming until the person holding the treats can add more.

, Make sure you know where the red line is before starting on the next nail.

, Stick the nail that is bleeding into the bowl and cover the nail with the baking soda. The bleeding should stop within 3-5 minutes. If it doesn’t, wrap some tissue around it. Do NOT keep cutting. Wait at least a week or until the ferret’s nail heals before cutting the rest just in case you cut another one.

, (They may be thirsty from all the treats.)

"
"
Begin by filling your bathtub up with some hot water.,
Put your ferret in.,
Take some ferret shampoo (about the size of a quarter) and rub onto the fur.,
Do not put the shampoo on their head.,
Once you have lather rinse it with some clean water.,
After that is done, you can either put a towel on the floor or in the bathtub.",How to Groom a Ferret3," Ferrets normal body temperature is 103 Degrees so they need water just a little warmer than we would like.

, The water should come up just above her legs. Making them swim is cruel so please don’t fill it up too high. Most of them can’t swim.

, If your ferret freaks, gently put your hand on the ferret in the bath so they feel secure.

, You could get some in their eyes.

, Empty all the water and then rinse your ferret one more time with some clean water.

, Now you can watch the fun! Your ferret will rub all over the towel (and the floor too) to try to get the water off. They will do this for about 5 minutes and then you can give them a treat.

"
"
Begin by taking a Q-tip.

,
Scruff the ferret and gently put the swab into your ferret’s ear.

,
Gently clean it.,
Once you are done, give your ferret a treat.

",How to Groom a Ferret4,",, When you are done, you should have some gunk on the Q-tip.


If the gunk is brown, it’s normal.
If it is black, your ferret could have fleas and you may need to have it checked out by a vet.

,"
"
Just take a brush, specially designed for ferrets, and brush the fur down.,
Be sure you hold your ferret over the trash or you will have to vacuum after you’re done.

,
When you’re done, give your ferret a treat.

",How to Groom a Ferret5," You only need to do this every other week. You can do it every other day when they are shedding (winter and summer).

,,"
"
Keep the ferret comfortable.,
Shampoo the ferret.,
Rinse you ferret thoroughly.",How to Bathe a Ferret2," Before lowering your ferret into the tub or sink, make sure he is comfortable. This way, he'll be less nervous during the actual bath.


Any time you hold your ferret, support his body completely. Make sure his feet are resting on the floor and, if they're not, make sure your hands are supporting his feet.Make sure the water is not too deep. Hold the ferret up above water if he seems distressed and let the water drain some until he is relaxed. Ideally, your ferret should only be submerged up to his chest.Your ferret's feet may slip on the floor of a bath or sink. Consider a rubber matt to make sure he can stand steady and therefore feel safe.Having some of your ferrets favorite toys in the water can help him relax during bath time., After getting your ferret in the water, you can begin the process of shampooing the ferret.


First, get your ferret thoroughly wet. You can do this by gently splashing water on his sides, running the faucet over him, or using a measure cup to pour water of his back, head, and tail.
Run the shampoo bottle under warm water before applying it to your ferret's skin. Ferrets get cold easily and you want to make sure the shampoo is slightly hotter than room temperature.
Apply a thin line of shampoo down your ferret's back and massage the shampoo deep into the ferret's coat. Be particularly diligent about washing his tail and abdomen, as these are areas where oils build up and increase odor.Be careful to not get soap in the ferret's eyes or mouth. Only use your fingertips when washing around the head to reduce the likelihood of this happening.Keep one hand on your ferret while you wash him to make sure he doesn't move around too much, which can cause injury to you via biting and scratching.
If you're choosing to condition the ferret's coat, repeat this process with conditioner after rinsing the shampoo from the ferret's coat.

, Leaving shampoo in can cause your ferret's skin to dry out. Make sure to get all the shampoo out before letting your ferret out of the bath.


If you're bathing your ferret in standing water, drain the tub before beginning the rinsing process. The water is likely diluted with shampoo, hair, and debris and it's counterintuitive to use it to rinse the ferret.Refill the tub with fresh water, once again making sure it's hot to the touch. Use this water to work shampoo out of your ferret's coat.
Rinse the head carefully with your hand. Do not pour water directly on his head as you do not want soap to run into his eyes.
If possible, use a faucet during the rinsing process as this can help work shampoo out of the ferret's fur.Do not take the ferret out of the bath until no soap residue surfaces when water is being poured over his coat.

"
"
Use a towel to begin drying the ferret.,
Allow ferrets to dry themselves.,
Make sure the ferret's cage and litter are clean.",How to Bathe a Ferret3," Ferrets are often aggravated after a bath and desperate to get dry. As you don't want a sopping wet ferret running around, begin the drying process with a clean towel.


Wrap the ferret in a towel and attempt to rub his fur. Be gentle. Your ferret is probably aggravated, so be gentle and do not attempt to dry him for too long.Expect that your ferret will not tolerate too much drying. Ferrets crave space after a bath. If the ferret is being particularly difficult and resisting being dried, let him go. You do not need to get him completely dry. Just make sure he is not sopping., After the bath, ferrets will want to try to dry themselves by rubbing their fur on warm, dry surfaces.


Pick a designated drying space for your ferret, and lay down clean towels and blankets for him to use.You should keep the ferret in a contained area during the drying process. He might roll or rub on a dirty surface, meaning he'll need another bath.Do not be alarmed. Many ferret owners are surprised by the erratic movements of a ferret after a bath, but this is normal ferret behavior and not a cause for concern., Bathing ferrets provides a good opportunity to clean their blankets and cages. Make sure clean linen is available right after a bath, and make sure your ferrets litter box is clean. Ferrets often want to relieve themselves right after a bath, and might be wary to do so in a dirty litter box."

Check to make sure the snake is healthy.,
Have a very basic enclosure ready.,
Provide 'bedding'.,
Provide the snake with two hides.,
Be sure to have heating for your snake.,
Add lighting.,
Have a water dish.,
Provide food for your snake.,
Clean out the environment.,
Make it possible for your snake to shed.,
Introduce your new snake carefully.,
Introduce another buddy or mate milk snake with care.",How to Care for a Milk Snake," Allow the snake to run through your fingers. If you feel any lumps, they may be impacted food or broken ribs. Check the vent for swelling, redness or feces, these are signs of internal parasites. Check your hands for blood smears, they may be mites. Finally check the mouth and the eyes, the eyes should be clear and alert and the mouth fluid with no mucus and not gasping for air, signs of respiratory infection or dehydration.;
, Enclosures can be brought or made using MDF board or strong wood (not cedar as it is toxic to your snake and preferably do not use pine). Aquariums are suitable for housing snakes. Ensure it is escape proof. Snakes can escape through the smallest gaps imaginable, as a rule if a pencil can get through the hole, a snake can, but this does not apply to hatchlings. A mesh top is a good idea for milk snakes which do not require high humidity. If shedding problems do occur, during shedding perhaps cover half the ventilation and add a larger water dish.

, Substrate can include wood chippings (not cedar which is toxic to snakes and avoid pine which is as yet not researched enough) orchid bark is good for maintaining high humidity but milk snakes do not require it. Aspen bedding has became a recent favourite among hobbyists because of its availability. Also newspaper is very widely used as it is cheap and easily changed and snakes do not seem to mind its hazardous appearance. It should be something a snake can bury into. Do not use sand (it's irritating to most snakes) or aquarium gravel.

, Semi circular cork bark does well and is quite attractive. otherwise commercial hides are readily available or a flower pot on its side is fine too. Place one hide in the cooler side of the enclosure and the other on the warmer side. This allows for thermoregulation when digesting. Not providing a hide will stress your snake and it will likely stop eating, especially milk snakes which are timid and spend much time hiding.

, Heating should be a ceramic bulb above which the snake cannot curl around or touch at least 12"" from the snake. All heating must be coupled with a thermostat. Too much heat will very quickly cause your snake to desiccate, stop heating or become temporarily neurologically damaged. About 25 degrees centigrade is good for milksnakes with a nighttime drop of about 5-7 degrees. A basking area which reaches 28-30 degrees should be provided. Watch your snake, if it spends more time on one side than the other and does not appear to thermoregulate, adjust the temperatures, for example, if your snake ""hugs"" the heat source, increase the heat by 2-3 degrees.

, Lighting is not strictly necessary but looks attractive and encourages natural routine and appetite. Aiding in calcium processing is not known in snakes but UVB does in most reptiles. The bulb does not need to be more than 2.0 in strength and at least 12"" from your snake or it may damage the eyes.

, A water dish needs to be large enough that the snake can curl completely into to soak. Ensure water is clean and fresh, change the water when fouled or every 2-3 days.

, Milk snakes will readily feed on thawed mice at all ages, feed hatchlings every 7-10 days, adults 10-14 or when they appear to be hunting. if possible, live food should not be offered as it can harm your snake.

, Substrate should be changed every month and poo scooped out whenever done, ensure substrate does not become soiled or damp, this can cause scale rot and RIs.


Water dishes should be cleaned with fairy liquid and thoroughly rinsed when fouled or every week. Structures should be disinfected and cleaned when fouled or once a month. (Cork bark can be put in the microwave or the oven to disinfect it, times vary on size of artifact and oven used). equally the enclosure should be cleaned with soapy water once a month.

, Milk snakes shed their skin, it should come off in one clean go, check the skin to see that the eye caps have shed and the snake as sometimes the tail tip fails to shed and this causes loss of circulation. Young milk snakes can shed 12+ times a year, adults much less but it varies and adults will shed frequently if the skin is damaged.If any areas have failed to shed gently remove the failed shed with a towel or tweezers.

, Quarantine new snakes in this basic low-tech set-up for 4-6 weeks. Watch for strange behaviour, including falling off stuff, stargazing, falling to one side and any other worrying or unnatural behaviours. Have a stool sent to the vets for testing to ensure there are no endo parasites. After this time, other decorations such as climbing structures or live plants may be added to enrich the life of your snake and the beauty of the enclosure.

, Make sure the new buddies like one another, or they'll need to be separated. Be sure to add twice as much food, to avoid competition for the food. Ultimately, they should behave in a sociable manner, otherwise the purpose of having a buddy or mate is pointless."

Learn the signs your snake is about to shed.,
Create a moist shedding box.,
Mist the cage with lukewarm water.,
Manage the cage's humidity.,
Place a basin of warm water in your snake's aquarium.,
Add coarse materials to the snake's container.,
Put your snake between several layers of paper towels.,
Clean the cage after shedding.,
Provide extra water.,
See a vet in the event of an incomplete shedding.,
Foster a stress free environment.,
Make sure to see your vet regularly.",How to Care for a Shedding Snake," You want to start preparing for the shedding process before it even begins. To do so, you'll have to keep an eye on your snake and watch for the signs that it is about to shed. When you start noticing signs, begin to prepare.Watch your snake's eyes. They will have a dull, blueish white appearance just before the snake begins to shed.
You should also take note of the snake's current skin. The skin will begin to dull just before shedding.;
, Snakes need a lot of humidity to shed properly. One way you can increase the humidity in your snake's environment is with a shedding box. Take a box, like a shoebox, and make sure it is well ventilated by poking holes throughout. Place damp paper towels within the box, allowing the snake a damp place to shed., You can also try misting the cage lightly to increase humidity. Take a spray bottle and fill it with lukewarm water. You can also mist your snake with water just before shedding, if your snake will allow this., Monitor the humidity in your snake's environment. You can get a device at a pet store, or a department store, that measures humidity in your snake's cage. During the shedding process, snakes need a cage that is between 50 and 70% humidity.If the humidity in your snake's cage is below this level, there are several steps you can take to improve humidity.Add a large water dish to the cage.
Cover the top of the cage. If you have a screen top on the cage, you can safely cover half the top to increase humidity.
Try using orchid bark substrate, which refers to the bedding that lines the bottom of the cage. Orchid bark tends to hold more humidity than other products.

, When your snake begins shedding, you'll notice flakes of skin beginning to come off. During this time, add a warm basin of water to your snake's cage. You can help your snake shed by placing a basin of warm water inside its enclosure. Your snake will be able to bath in the water, allowing its skin to come off more easily.Pick a basin that is big enough to hold your snake's entire body.
Add enough water that your snake can get its entire body wet. However, do not add so much water that your snake will be submerged under water when it enters the basin.

, Snakes can also rub skin off by crawling over coarse material. Uneven materials, like tree branches and stones, can be very helpful to shedding snakes. You can also use patches of tree bark, pine cones, and other coarse materials you find outside.If your snake is rubbing its nose against objects in the cage, it is trying to get its skin off during the shedding process. If you notice your snake doing this, it is particularly important that you add coarse materials to your snake's cage.

, If your snake is struggling to shed on its own, you may have to assist. Get several layers of paper towels damp. Then, remove your snake from its shed and place it between the towels. Allow your snake to crawl and squirm between the towels. The combination of humidity and friction should help remove excess skin., After your snake completes shedding, you will notice excess skin throughout the cage. Skin may appear in small, crumpled piles. It may also be in dry and tube like sections throughout the cage. Remove any excess skin from the cage after your snake finishes shedding.Snakes frequently defecate after the shedding process. Use gloves when cleaning the cage, as you may have to pick up fecal matter as well.

, Snakes often consume large quantities of water after shedding. Keep an eye on your snake's water dish. Make sure you refill it frequently after your snake finishes shedding. It is not unusual that you will find yourself refilling the water dish more than usual in the days following a shed., Despite your best efforts, your snake may not shed completely. If your snake does not finish shedding within one to two weeks, see a vet. A veterinarian can help remove the remaining skin and examine your snake. Usually, shedding problems are caused by a lack of humidity, but you'll want an exam to rule out any possible underlying health problems.Never try to peel off excess skin yourself, especially not skin around a snake's eyes or mouth.

, Stress is a possible cause for improper shedding. If your snake did not shed correctly, work on improving your snake's stress level. Make sure the snake has a quality environment, and limit handling your snake.Keep the humidity level comfortable. You should also make sure your snake has a lot of hiding places in its cage. Snakes are solitary pets, and crave alone time. Keep boxes and enclosures in your snake's cage so it can get alone time.
Do not handle your snake too frequently. Snakes may dislike being handled and, if handled too much, a snake may learn to think of you as a predator. Do not handle your snake for more than 30 minutes at a time, and only do so a few times per week.

, Regular veterinary visits can help a snake shed smoothly in the future. In rare cases, difficulty shedding is caused by a medical concern. If you take your snake in for regular checkups, a vet can diagnose and correct issues before they lead to problems shedding. "
"
Be careful about what you give them and also consider the size, as there have been reports of ferrets having blockages from something as innocent as a piece of carrot which got stuck in their gut.

,
Remember: too much can make a ferret sick, so if you give them some raisins or something else small, make it 3 max only about 2 times a week.

,
If your ferrets live in the house with you and you also own other animals, you have to come up with some creative thinking on how to allow your ferrets access to their food without it getting snaffled up by the dog or cats.

,
If you want to give your ferret a piece of fruit, make sure it’s no bigger than the nail on your little finger!

,
Only give fruit and raising in small doses.,
Never give them chocolate, for whatever reason.,
Don't give your ferret cow's milk (like the stuff we drink) as they are lactose intolerant and the milk would cause them to have diarrhea.,
Try insects.",How to Groom a Ferret6,",,,, Many ferrets turn their noses up at anything sweet. Occasional fruit is all right but should not form the main part of their diet.

, Theobromine, which is in chocolate, is dangerous to most pets.

, Do not feed them bread and milk. Some people actually think bread and milk is the right diet for ferrets. They are carnivores and cannot eat bread and milk as a total diet.

, Some ferrets love crunching on insects - if you wanted to give your ferrets insects as a treat, then you can probably find cans of them at pet stores which also supply food for reptiles.

Be sure to give a ferret the right toys.,
Avoid giving your ferret these toys:


Anything that has buttons or beads on it is a no-no.",How to Groom a Ferret7," Use:


Paper bags
Empty toilet paper rolls

Dampen the tip of a cotton swab with some sweet oil.,
Slowly rub the damp cotton swab over the visible surface of the ear.

,
Put the swab a little deeper into the ear.,
Repeat for the other ear.

",How to Clean a Ferret's Ears," Do not saturate it. Ferrets' ears connect to their throat and they will be able to taste it, and they don't like it very much at all.;
,, Just enough to where you cannot see the moist part of the swab anymore. Gently move the swab around to collect filth.

Get an aquarium.,
Layer the bottom of the aquarium with substrate.,
Add a hide away.,
Have some things for the snake to climb upon.,
For the benefit of the snake when you first bring it home, put a cover, or a large towel (not a thick one, or it will run out of oxygen) around or over the tank.,
Buy a thermometer.,
Get some heat.,
Ensure that the humidity is accurate.,
Get a water bowl.,
Change the water weekly, if not more often.,
Feed the snake.,
When feeding it, do not sling the snake's food at it.,
If you choose to feed the snake food that is alive, (food that it hunts and kills), create hiding spots.,
Clean the cage regularly.,
To clean the cage, hose it down with a few squeezes of mild soap and scrub it with a sponge or rag, then rinse twice.,
Don't give the garter too much room, as they will become nervous and stressed.,
Handle with care.",How to Take Care of a Garter Snake," A baby garter snake should do well with a 5 gallon (18.9 L) tank, while a large adult would do a lot better in a 15 gallon (56.8 L) tank. Don't make it too small since garter snakes are very active creatures, but they will also be extremely nervous in a large tank.;
, You can safely use cypress mulch, bark nuggets, and wood shavings (Aspen is best, Pine is probably all right, but never use cedar). Paper towels and newspaper are not good substrate, because many snakes prefer to burrow, and if they try to get under paper towels, they can become trapped and die. Also, paper towels are very thin and if you use a heat pad, the snake can become overheated and severely injured.

, A snake always needs a place to hide. It should be pretty small, the snake should be able to curl up tightly. It is even better if the snake can touch the the sides of the hide away when curled up. Make sure the hiding place can not fall onto your snake this can kill or injure your snake

, You will find that garter snakes like to climb. Try a twisty tree climbing addition, but make sure it doesn't touch the top of the cage. Garters are escape artists.

, This helps it to de-stress, and feel a bit more safe, since the cover helps it to feel that it's not being hunted.

, A stick on thermometer is not terribly accurate, but gives you the general idea. It should be around 72 degrees at the cool end and 75 at the heated end. If your cage is higher than 80 on the cool side your cage is too hot.

, You can use heating pads/strips under one side of the enclosure as well as light bulb above it. Heating pads/strips should cover one third to one half of the enclosure. There should be a warm end of the enclosure and a cool end. When using a light bulb, never use more than 15 watts, they could be burned. Never use hot rocks. Garter snakes have been burned and killed by hot rocks. Also, never put them in direct sunlight, they can also be killed that way.

, The humidity should be 50 to 60 percent.

, It should be plastic, and big enough for the snake to bathe in. Don't make it too big, just large enough for the snake to fit inside, as they enjoy swimming, and hunt their prey this way. One of the most common mistakes with garter snakes is that they are semi aquatic. They are not aquatic, not even semi aquatic, it is their prey that is aquatic. If you keep it too moist, your snake could end up with a hard to treat blister disease.

, Clean it out every three days to one week and clean and sterilize it every two-three months.

, A garter snake is a carnivore and hunts prey, so you need to choose something for it to eat. It may surprise you that frozen pinkie mice are the best option by far. If you are uncomfortable with feeding your snake rodents you can feed them a mix of live or frozen fish, leeches, slugs, or worms. Buy them from a store, and they will provide all the nutrients garter snakes need, and will not have any parasites or bacteria that could hurt your snake (notice that frozen means dead mice).


If your snake won't eat mice, It can eat a mixture of fish, worms, and maybe vitamin preservatives.
Slugs can be a treat to be given sometimes, but they can be hard to get.
Baby snakes can eat parts of a pinkie mouse twice a week, and adults can eat the appropriate sized mouse once a week. The mouse should be about as big as the largest part of the snake.
A fish eater should eat every 5 to 6 days, and a worm eater twice a week. You need to avoid fish with thiaminase, like goldfish. Ask the person you buy the fish from about the fish.

, That will probably scare it. Leave its food in the middle. Remember, they don't like jerky movements. Be slow, but you can close the lid immediately after putting the food in.

, Spread leaves and other things for the snake to hide behind, so it can ambush its prey. Uneaten killed food should be removed within 24 hours, to prevent the growth of bacteria.

, Cleaning the cage is not the most fun task in the world. But to clean the cage, catch your garter snake and put it in another container a bit larger than its cage, (with holes in the top) and take out all of the things that are in the cage. If you choose to use a type of wood shaving, just dump it out and replace it. Never use soil, as it can carry parasites.


Spot clean fecal matter when it is seen.

, The cage should be cleaned once monthly for young snakes, and every two weeks for adults, or when ever it starts to smell.

, Snakes are not very active in the way of slithering around, they prefer to bask in one spot, among lots of thick decoration. A bare cage makes for a scared snake.

, Handling can be hard, but is a blast when done correctly. To handle the snake, approach it slowly from the side. Let it slither on to your hand, or scoop it up with gloves. Then, just make slow movements with it. Be careful and always support the snake's head and body.


Do not handle the snake for one hour after it has shed its skin. The delay in handling will give the snake's new skin time to get used to the air and temperature, and your body salts and oils will damage its skin if held within the first hour.
Your garter snake should be protected from your cat, as the cat may kill it.

Call animal control if you fear the snake may be venomous.,
Leave the snake alone and let it find a way outside.,
Brush a nonvenomous snake into a large trashcan.,
Catch the snake with an indoor trap.",How to Get Rid of Snakes1," If you’re uncomfortable handling a snake, even if you don’t believe it to be venomous, there’s no reason you should deal with it yourself. Call animal control to trap it and take it away. Snakes with venomous bites should always be handled by professionals, such as animal control employees or a wildlife trapper.Try to enclose the snake in one room. If you see it in the laundry room, for example, shut the door and wedge a towel underneath it to prevent the snake from escaping.
Keep children and pets away from the area until animal control has come to capture the snake.;
, Most snakes will leave your house on their own if given time and opportunity. If you find a snake in your garage or in a room leading to the outside, shut the inside doors and open the door leading outside so the snake can crawl out.








The snake should leave fairly quickly. This is a simpler and more reliable method than a more aggressive hands-on approach, which may frighten the snake and cause it to hide in a hard-to-reach location in your home.

, If you feel comfortable taking care of the snake on your own, try this common removal method: first, set a large trashcan on its side in the same room as the snake. Then use a push-broom to shoo the snake into the trash can. Once the snake is tin the trash can, tip the can upright and place a lid firmly on top.








Once the snake is securely inside of the trashcan, take the snake to the woods or another area away from your house. Set the can on its side, gently remove the lid, and give the snake time to slither out.

, If you suspect there may be a snake in your attic, garage, basement or elsewhere in your house, lay out traps along the walls in these areas. Snakes will crawl over or into the traps and get stuck. You—or animal control—can then safely remove the trapped snake and place it outside.If you catch a nonvenomous snake, place the trap in a bucket and take it outside or to an area where you’d like to release it. Pour vegetable oil over the snake to loosen it from the trap and allow it to crawl away.
Check the traps every day to see if you’ve caught a snake. If you wait too long, the snake will die of starvation.

Let the snake leave on its own.,
Spray the snake with water from a hose.,
Remove a snake from water with a pool skimmer.,
Set outdoor snake traps.",How to Get Rid of Snakes2," If you’re dealing with a non-venomous snake, the simplest removal method is to let the snake leave your property on its own. Outdoor snakes pose no serious problem, and will wander off on their own time. However, if you have children or pets, keep them away from the snake. Even nonvenomous snakes can have painful bites.








If you frequently notice snakes near your house, your concern should be preventative maintenance rather than individual snake removal.

, If you see a nonvenomous snake hanging out near your house and you’d like it to go somewhere else, sometimes all it needs is a little nudge to be on its way. Use a garden hose to lightly spray the snake until it moves away from your house and out of your yard.








Garter snakes and other snakes that you know not to be dangerous are fine candidates for this removal method.

, If you find a snake in your pool, you can safely lift it out using a pool skimmer or other kind of meshed net.Small, nonvenomous snakes can also be plucked from the patio or grass with a pool skimmer. Try not to grip them too tightly, so you don’t damage their ribs.









Take the snake to the back of your yard or to a nearby wooded area and set them free.

, Outdoor snake traps are usually plastic boxes baited with a substance or aroma that lures snakes inside. Once snakes enter the trap, the shape of the box prevents them from getting out. Set them around your property in areas where you’ve seen snakes spending time.When you trap a snake, drive it to a wooded area and set it free.

Trim backyard vegetation.,
Remove snakes’ food sources.,
Seal your house.,
Apply snake repellent around your house and yard.",How to Get Rid of Snakes3," Snakes’ typical habitats contain tall grass and bushes, so regularly cutting your grass and trimming bushes and shrubs will make your yard less enticing for snakes. Mow your lawn and remove any downed tree trunks, hollow stumps, or other places where snakes could live.Take these measures to make sure your yard isn’t full of potential snake dens:









Store lumber and woodpiles at least 2 feet (0.6 m) off the ground, and keep compost and mulch piles away from your house.
Consider removing bushes and other tall vegetation that seems to be a regular habitat for snakes.

, Snakes eat mice, crickets, and other insects. If you take measures to keep the populations of these creatures low, snakes will look elsewhere for food. Use soil and rocks to block up any rodent holes in your backyard.Keep your yard free of birdseed, berries, and nuts that have fallen from trees, and stray bits of waste from the compost pile. These are all food sources for mice and insects.


Consider removing mice and insects from your property by setting traps or using other removal methods. See How to Get Rid of Mice and How to Get Rid of Crickets for more ideas.

, Prevent snakes from entering your home by checking its foundation for cracks and holes. Seal any that you find with caulk or expanding foam. Make sure that your doors and windows are sealed, too. Place screens on your chimney, vents, and other places where snakes might be able to get in.








The grid of the screens should not have openings larger than ¼ inch (0.6 cm), in order to effectively block all snakes.

, Snake repellents are typically sold as either a liquid, which you can spray on the external walls of your house, or a powder, which you can sprinkle throughout your yard. These repellents are environmentally friendly and will not harm your pets or lawn.Various types of commercial snake repellents should be sold at your local hardware store or garden center. You can also find snake repellents online through major retailers.

Wash your hands before handling your snake.,
Get the snake accustomed to your presence.,
Talk to the snake to announce your presence.,
Move slowly and predictably to avoid surprising your snake.,
Avoid picking up a hissing snake.,
Handle your snake when it looks a bit tired.,
Put on your protective gloves and boots.,
Use a snake hook if your snake is moving around the cage.,
Use both hands to hold the snake.,
Pick up the snake from the mid-body area.,
Let the snake adjust.,
Stay attentive to the snake’s experience and safety.,
Return your snake to its cage by lowering it in.,
Wash your hands again.",How to Hold a Snake," If you have a scent on your hands, the snake may mistake it for food. They could nip or bite. Snakes rely heavily on their sense of smell. Washing your hands also reduces the risk of harmful bacteria or parasites being transferred to your snake., If you recently purchased a snake as a pet, you will need to spend some time training your snake to accommodate your presence. Twice per day, let your hand rest inside your snake’s cage for two or three minutes. Over time, your snake will get used to your scent and learn that it is not something threatening.Your snake will eventually come out to investigate.
Since your snake is just getting used to your presence at this time, you should remain cautious.
Remember to wash your hands prior to putting them in the snake’s cage. If you forget this step, your snake could easily mistake your hands for prey., Gently talk to the snake and make sure the snake is aware that you are there. Snakes and other reptiles experience basic emotions, so it can’t hurt to express some positive feelings. At the very least, it will help you avoid surprising the snake., Whenever you are around your snake, you want to avoid fast movements. Move slowly when you are around your snake’s cage, and avoid surprising your snake from a strange angle.Try to approach your snake from the side rather than from above.

, If your snake is feeling fearful or aggressive, it may hiss. If you hear your snake hissing, it is not a good time to handle them.


If you force yourself on the snake at this time, they may attack you.

, You want to handle your snake when it is feeling tired but remains awake. You should avoid handling your snake after it has eaten. Similarly, don’t hold your snake when it is about to shed., Slip on your safety gloves, which are especially important for non-venomous but snappy snakes.Sturdy boots can also be a good idea, since there is always some risk involved in handling a snake.For instance, if the snake gets onto the ground and becomes fearful or aggressive, it could bite your feet.

, If your snake is cruising around the cage, you can use a snake hook to get a hold of it. After you have lifted it up, you can then hold it with your hands or continue holding it with the hook.If you feed your snake in the same cage that it lives in, you may want to use a snake hook. The snake hook can be a way of telling the snake that it is holding time rather than eating time.

, Hold one hand a third of the way down the body and the other hand under the last quarter, so that you are supporting the whole body. Support the snake with both hands.If the snake is moving when you are picking it up, it may crawl away from you while you are holding it.

, You want to avoid approaching the snake’s head, as well as the tail. Instead, you want to pick up the middle of the snake’s body. Be gentle and try to support the full weight of your snake.If you try to pick it up from the tail, the snake could hurt itself trying to escape your grasp.
If you try to pick it up from the head, the snake will likely bite you. Snakes are sensitive in the head area., The snake may wrap around one of your hands to stabilize itself. Let it adjust into a comfortable position.If it's a constricting snake, it's likely wrap its tail around your wrist and forearm, which is fine.

, Snakes are emotional creatures so you want to attend to their experience. Young snakes may display some fear when getting used to being held. Some snakes like being held more than others. It is best to stay confident and calm, which should help your snake get used to the experience of being held.Stay calm while holding your snake.

, You can place it on the substrate or let it move out of your hands to a branch or the cage floor on its own. Secure the lid when you are done, since snakes are great escape artists.

, Reptiles can carry germs that are not safe for humans, like salmonella. Immediately wash your hands when you are done handling your snake.

Make a list of the materials you need to buy.,
Buy these materials from the right sources.,
Get your enclosure fully set up before purchasing a Kenyan Sand boa.,
Provide proper heating.,
Provide a hide.,
Provide substrate.,
Include a water bowl.,
Find a local pet shop or reptile expo.,
Make sure to get it inside your enclosure as quickly as possible to avoid the snake from getting stressed out.,
Know when to feed:

Baby boas should be fed one mouse every 5-7 days.,
Know what to feed.,
Know how to feed.,
Be sure to use a feeding enclosure.,Wash your hands before and after handling them to prevent the spread of germs and viruses.,
Handle them often.,
Don't panic if they bite you.",How to Care for a Kenyan Sand Boa," Your list should consist of the following:

Enclosure (tank or tub)
Substrate (bedding)
Hide
Water bowl
Heat source (heat lamp, UTH, or heat tape)
Frozen mice
Tongs
Feeding enclosure (preferably just a plastic tub)
Thermometer;
, All of the materials can be found at a pet store; however, it is recommended to avoid purchasing anything from a corporate pet store, because many of these corporations are notorious for being very abusive to the reptiles they sell. Here are a few areas you should consider buying your materials from:

Online (reputable websites only)
Local pet store (not a corporate chain)
Department stores (for tongs, makeshift hides, etc.)

, Any enclosure for a snake should be fully escape-proof, allow for air-circulation and be large enough for the snake to fully stretch its body inside the enclosure.There are two ways of going about housing a snake in an enclosure; a glass terrarium or a plastic tub.


Tub - You must drill holes all around the plastic tub in order to allow air-circulation in it. Plastic tubs are great if you plan to have multiple snakes if you want to save money. Make sure to put weight on top of the tub like books so that there is absolutely no chance of escape.
Tank - A more aesthetic enclosure than the tub but more expensive. You can decorate your tank with fake plants and rocks to make it look more natural. Tanks are great if you plan to own a small number of snakes.

, Three common tools used to heat a reptile’s enclosure are under-tank heaters (UTH), heat tapes and/or heat lamps. UTHs or heat tape are preferred for heating snake enclosures, since snakes do not require UV light to survive.


Make sure your enclosure is at the correct temperature before purchasing the Kenyan Sand boa. The warm side of the enclosure should be at about 95 degrees Fahrenheit, and the cool side should be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
If you’re using a plastic tub, you will not be able to use a heat lamp as it won’t fit inside the tub and may melt the plastic of the tub.
Heat tape and UTHs are more energy efficient and do a great job at heating a plastic tub enclosure without melting it. Make sure to place them outside of the enclosure.

, A sterile log, rock or cave can serve as a hide for your Kenyan Sand Boa. New and clean paper bowls can be turned into excellent hides as well. Anything that you place in the enclosure must be sterile in order to protect the snake from viruses, bacteria and parasites.


Snakes love to hide. It makes them feel safe and comfortable. Provide your Kenyan Sand Boa with a place to hide in its enclosure.
Hides should be placed on the warm side of the enclosure. That way the snake will be able to stay warm and hide simultaneously.
Do not purchase a large and heavy hide, since it may burrow underneath it and get crushed.

, Aspen snake bedding or sterile play sand can be used as substrate for a Kenyan Sand Boa. These two types of substrates are most commonly used and are inexpensive.


Kenyan Sand Boas love to burrow underground in the wild, and play sand or aspen will allow it to do just that!
Make sure the enclosure has enough substrate in it to allow your Kenyan Sand Boa to fully submerge itself under it.

, Make sure there is a water bowl with fresh, clean and dechlorinated water present inside the enclosure at all times.

, Ask the owner of the snake if you could handle it before purchasing it. Also, ask the owner when the snake was last fed, so you will know when to feed it its next meal. While handling the snake you should notice a few things. The snake should:

Have bright and open eyes
Be active and moving
Lack any injuries or deformities
Be clean

, Once inside the enclosure, leave it alone for a few days before handling it. Make sure the enclosure has fresh water and a heat source at all times.

,
Adult boas should be fed every 7-10 days.

, The size of the mouse should be no larger than the widest portion of the snake’s body., Thaw the frozen mice out in warm water for 10-15 minutes before feeding them to your snake. If your Kenyan Sand Boa swallows a partially frozen mouse, it may die!


Using your tongs, pick up the mouse and wiggle it around in front of the Kenyan Sand Boa. This is too imitate what a live mouse would do. Eventually, the Kenyan Sand Boa should strike the mouse, constrict it and swallow it.
Sometimes the snake will simply swallow it without constricting it and this is fine, however if you wish to stimulate the things it would be doing in the wild, you should attempt to make it constrict its meals by wiggling the mouse around, with tongs, while it’s in the snake’s mouth.







, Kenyan Sand Boas should be fed in a separate area from the enclosure in which it resides, such as a separate tub. If it is fed in the enclosure it lives in, the Kenyan Sand Boa will probably end up swallowing some substrate along with its meal. This can lead to health issues or even death for the snake.,, Kenyan Sand Boas have are usually mild mannered. They should be handled every day or every other day so they stay mild mannered., They may bite only if they think your hand is food. Besides, there is a much higher chance of the snake getting injured than you.

Coax the snake into a net.,
Use a garbage can and broom.,
Pin the snake down.,
Use items around your house to catch a snake.",How to Catch a Snake1," You can catch a snake using a long slender object like a badminton or tennis racket, or a long broom handle attached to a mosquito net. When you see the snake, you'll want to get quickly to the scene. Place your net in front the snake's head and coax the snake into the net. The long slender object you attach to the net should be long enough to keep your body a safe distance from the snake, while attempting to net it. Once the snake enters the net, lift up the net immediately to prevent the snake from getting out. Make sure your net is large enough for the snake you're aiming to catch.
The net in front of the snake's head is effective because the snake will interpret it as a place of safety and willingly enter it.
Approach the snake carefully and quietly. If you run over to the snake loudly you will provoke it to move away quickly, or worse, bite.;
, This is a simple way to catch a snake without having to directly handle it. Take a large garbage can and lay it on its side. Coax the snake, using the broom, into the garbage can. You can then move the garbage can to where you would like to release the snake.

, Do this by placing a forked stick directly behind its head and applying pressure. The amount of pressure you will need to apply all depends on the size of the snake but it should be enough to keep it from moving its head without hurting the animal.


There are special snake forks that can do this more effectively than a common stick.

, If a snake gets into your house and you want to quickly remove it, you may have to act quickly with the items at hand. Use an old shirt, and a pillow case. Toss the rumpled up tee shirt over the snakes head and upper body. The snake will generally be afraid and coil up under the cloth.


Without delay, place the pillowcase down over the shirt. Slide the edge firmly along the floor, scooping up the shirt and snake together. This can be done with a lingerie bag if it is large enough and you are not squeamish and know the snake is not venomous.

Cut the wood to size.,
Dig out a groove for the glass.,
Assemble the enclosure.,
Attach the opening panel.,
Lay down a substrate.,
Include vegetation.,
Provide food and water dishes.,
Introduce your snake to the enclosure.",How to Build a Snake Cage," You'll want to make sure you have everything you need before you begin. In addition to the actual building materials, you'll also need several tools, including a power drill, a router, measuring tape, screws, hinges, and one or two hook-and-eye latches for the enclosure's opening.Wood is the primary structural material. You'll be using it to assemble most of the enclosure.
High-pressure particleboard with a laminate coating, pre-built shelving, or high-quality plywood are all ideal types of wood for the enclosure.
Be sure you stain the wood before beginning.
You'll also need to choose between glass or thermoplastic for the panels of your enclosure. Glass and plastic both help retain heat inside the enclosure, though plastic may be more effective.;
, Before you measure and cut any pieces, you'll need to decide how large your enclosure should be. This will be determined by the size of your snake. If your snake is still growing, size your enclosure to its estimated adult size, which a breeder or snake expert at your local pet store should be able to tell you.


Generally speaking, most snakes need at least enough space to stretch out across the cage.Smaller sized snakes like garter and grass snakes can be kept in smaller enclosures, so long as they have enough room.Medium- to large-sized snakes, including king snakes, rat snakes, milk snakes, and gopher snakes, require larger enclosures.
Be aware that climbing snakes will do better in a taller enclosure, while burrowing snakes will do better in a longer enclosure.

, Generally speaking, if your snake is venomous or is capable of moving particularly fast, it's best to put the opening on top of the enclosure. This will help prevent escape attempts while the enclosure is open for feeding or cleaning. If your snake is not venomous and does not move quickly, you can put the opening on the side of the enclosure. Having a side-opening enclosure allows you to stack your snake's habitat between other enclosures (if you have more than one). You will not have this option if you put the opening on the top of the enclosure.
If your snake will need an artificial heat source, it may be easiest to put the opening on top of the enclosure. If you're using a glass panel, you may be able to simply place the heat lamp directly on the glass.

, Before you can actually build the enclosure, you'll need to measure its components. It's important to be as precise as possible with your measurements since a gap in the enclosure could make it easy for your snake to escape.


Smaller snakes can be kept in a 10- or 20-gallon tank.This measures out to either 20 inches by 10 inches by 12 inches (51 by 25 by 30.5 centimeters), or up to 24 inches by 12 inches by 16 inches (61 by 30.5 by 40.5 centimeters)Medium-to-large sized snakes typically need between 30- and 55-gallon tanks. This measures out to 36 inches by 12 inches by 16 inches (91.5 by 30.5 by 40.5 centimeters) or up to 48 inches by 13 inches by 20 inches (122 by 33 by 51 centimeters).
The glass or plastic panel you use as a window for the front of the enclosure should measure a few tenths of an inch (less than a centimeter) shorter than the back wooden panel. This will allow a more precise fit in the grooves that you'll dig out.

, Over time, the wood in your enclosure may begin to rot. It will also get dirty and may be difficult to clean if you do not stain the wood first. Staining will help protect the wood to ensure a longer life for your enclosure., Once you've assessed the size needs of your snake and determined the final dimensions, you'll be ready to cut your wood. It can be helpful to mark the sizes in chalk or pencil before cutting so that you have precise measurements and straight lines to cut along.


Make sure you wear personal protective equipment (PPE) while working with wood. This includes safety glasses, gloves, earplugs, a respirator, and a padded kickback apron.Cut each piece as a solid rectangle. You only need to cut the sides, back, top, and bottom.
The front face will be a glass or plastic panel held in place by the top, bottom, and sides.

, Before you can complete the enclosure's assembly, you'll need to make room for the glass or plastic panel and insert it into place. This will be done using a router to gouge out the wood.Dig the groove 0.5 inches (1.25 centimeters) from the face of what will be the outside wall of the enclosure.
You'll need to cut grooves in the front face of the top and bottom pieces as well as down the sides.
Slide the glass or plastic panel into each groove to ensure that it fits snugly in place.

, Use a power drill to bore holes in the sides, back, and bottom of the enclosure, then screw them into place. If your cage will open from the side, attach the back, bottom, top, and one side of the panel, leaving the opening side unattached.Make sure the grooves for the glass or plastic panel line up evenly.
Before you attach the top, slide the glass or plastic panel into place so that your enclosure is complete. If you are making a side-opening enclosure, wait before attaching your chosen side's panel.
Make sure there are no gaps around the glass or plastic panel.
Use an adhesive that's approved for use around pets to seal up any gaps where the panel fits into your wooden frame. You can find these products at your local hardware store or through an online retailer.

, If you're building an enclosure that opens from the top, then you'll be attaching the top panel with hinges. If your enclosure opens from the side, then your chosen side's panel will be the opening that you affix with hinges.Measure where you will need to attach the hinges onto the opening panel (either the top or one side). Then measure where the hinges will attach to the back panel.
Use a power drill to bore holes for the hinges, then screw the hinges into place.
Attach hook-and-eye latches to each corner of the opening panel. It's typically a good idea to use multiple latches instead of just one since some snakes are strong enough to break through weak doors.
Drill several small holes for ventilation in the opening panel (either the top or the side of your enclosure).

, Your snake will feel most comfortable if there is some type of substrate at the bottom of the enclosure. The materials you use, though, will depend on your snake and its traditional habitat in the wild.


Snakes that naturally live in the desert will need fine-grain sand for a substrate.For other snakes, unprinted paper (such as unprinted newspaper pages or butcher's paper) can be laid down in shredded layers.
Still other snakes will prefer clean leaf litter as a substrate.Talk to a veterinarian or a snake expert at your local pet store to determine what type of substrate would work best for your snake.

, Most snakes like some type of vegetative cover since they're typically used to having this in the wild. Different snake species are used to different habitats, and the types of plants you provide should reflect what your snake would live with in nature. However, once you've identified the best type of vegetation, you will need to choose between live plants and artificial plants.Chinese evergreen, ferns, small palms, philodendron, bromeliads, and begonias are all plants that are commonly used in snake enclosures.
Live plants can be difficult to maintain and frequently carry pests or diseases. For this reason, many experts advise against using live plants and advocate for artificial plants instead., All snakes need a constant supply of fresh drinking water. Snakes will need food as well. All snakes are predatory carnivores, which means that your snake will need live, frozen, or recently-killed organisms in order to survive.


Try to provide a water dish that is large enough for your snake to immerse itself in.Be sure the water dish you purchase is heavy enough that it will not get tipped over as your snake climbs in or out.
The food you feed your snake will depend on the diet of that species. Most pet snake species eat mice, rats, gerbils, or hamsters, though smaller snakes may eat insects, frogs, or amphibians.Ask your veterinarian or a snake expert at your local pet store about what type of diet is best for your snake.

, Once you've got everything set up, you'll be ready to introduce your pet snake to its new home. Give your snake time to adjust to its new surroundings before you attempt to handle the snake or remove it from the enclosure, as it may be frightened or confused after being transferred to its new home.

Use a glue trap.,
Make your own snake trap.,
Use a minnow trap.",How to Catch a Snake2," This is a common and inexpensive trap available at most hardware stores. The trap will be a box with glue on the bottom. The box will have bait and lure the snake into the box where the glue will prevent it from leaving. For bait you can use frozen mice available at pet stores or common eggs from the grocery store. Make sure to check the glue trap regularly. The snake will still be alive and immobile and after a few days could run the risk of dying of starvation.
Choose a trap big enough for the snake you want to catch. If the trap is too small, the snake still may be able to get away, dragging the glue trap along. This will also likely kill the snake.
Use a vegetable or olive oil to remove the snake from the glue trap. Pour olive or vegetable oil on the snake in an area you want it released. This will remove the stickiness of the glue and allow the snake to slither away unharmed.

, You can do this using a plastic bottle, such as an empty two-liter, bait, and scissors. Clean the bottle so there are no smells that would scare a snake away. Cut a small hole, big enough for the snake to enter, in the bottle. Once the snake feeds on the bait it will be too large to leave back through the same hole it entered through.

, Wired traps used for catching minnows are great. Put some eggs in the trap to lure the snake in. They will be able to find their way in but will be unable to get out once they eat the eggs. "

Make sure the snake is safe for handling.,
Grab a snake with caution.,
Use gloves to handle snakes.",How to Catch a Snake3," All snakes may bite if provoked, but some pack more of a punch and are venomous. It can be hard for someone without an expertise in snakes to tell from only looking at a snake, so proceed with caution. If you suspect that a snake is venomous, do not try to catch it with your hands. Some of the most common U.S. based venomous snakes are:


Copperhead snakes. These are found most commonly in the eastern and mid-southern states. They get their name from unique copper colored scales on their head that slowly fade throughout the rest of their body.Their markings are often triangular in shape. Cottonmouth snake.These are usually four to seven feet in length. They are generally a dark shade of brown or a dull black. They have pupils that are shaped like slits and have a bulky body. They are found predominantly in the southern U.S., throughout Florida and the Mississippi River region. Diamondback Rattlesnake. These can grow up ten feet long. They are recognized by their distinctive black or brown diamond patterns down their bodies outlined in a light shade of yellow. They are a rattlesnake, and as that name implies, they have a series of hollow segments on the end of their tale that create a rattle sound when its shook. They live in the southern and south western parts of the U.S. and some of Mexico. Coral snake. These snakes can be difficult to recognize since it resembles other similar species. They are found in the eastern, southwestern, and southeastern portions of the U.S. They can grow to be around thirty inches. They are universally a red-yellow-black-yellow pattern with black heads. They are venomous, so you should be very careful if you think you spot one., Catching a snake by hand is a little trickier, and should be done with caution. However, if you do not have any tools or nets handy, you can catch a snake using your hands. Use an object to distract the snake's head, like a stick. Firmly grasp its tail and lift the snake upwards, leaving the front part of its body on the ground, but keeping your legs and body as far away as possible. Place the snake in a pillow case or sack immediately. If you know how to safely approach a snake, you can also grab the snake by the back of head to neutralize its chances of biting you. However, getting so close to the snake's head can be risky. If you use this method, it may be best to have a tool, such as a snake fork, that can pin the head down before you reach for it.

, Besides the risk of biting, snakes can also carry harmful bacteria. Make sure to use gloves to prevent your risk of catching a bacterial infection from the snake.


If you do not have gloves, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after touching the snake. Do not handle food or touch anyone else before you have washed your hands thoroughly.

Research local laws.,
Discuss it with your housemates or family.,
Research different varieties of snakes.,
Purchase insurance.,
Collect emergency contact information.,
Prepare the snake's tank.,
Bring your snake home.",How to Look After a Venomous Snake1," Before giving serious consideration to bringing home a venomous snake, go online and see what state and local laws are in effect in your area. Follow all laws regarding the possession of these animals.In some states, only certain species of venomous snakes may be kept.
In some states, venomous snakes may not be kept by private citizens.
Some states allow keeping venomous snakes, but place restrictions on how they can be obtained.
If you have trouble finding or understanding the laws in your area, contact your local Department of Natural Resources or Department of Fish and Game, or an attorney.;
, Before deciding to bring home a venomous animal, discuss this with anyone else you live with. Be certain they are in full understanding of the risks and dangers, and agree to having a hot snake live in the home.It's also a good idea to alert friends who come to the home regularly, and nearby neighbors who could be at risk if the snake should escape.

, Next, spend some time learning about different varieties of snakes that are permitted in your area to decide which species you might be interested in bringing home.Be aware that different species of snakes have different requirements in terms of care and feeding, space, temperature, light, and so forth.Pick a species of snake that you are going to be able to care for adequately.
Different types of snakes also have different dispositions, with some being more aggressive, others more reclusive, and so on. Spend some time online or visit your local library or bookstore and pick up a book on snakes to learn more.

, It is irresponsible to own a venomous snake without having the proper insurance. Accidents are common and can cost a lot of money. If you can't afford insurance, you can't afford to keep one of these snakes.You and everyone in your home should have adequate health insurance. Medical treatment for a snake bite can cost thousands of dollars.
You should also have liability insurance. If your snake bites someone else, you will be legally responsible for any costs that result, including medical bills and the possibility of lawsuits resulting from injury or death.

, Before bringing a snake home, collect emergency contact information for hospitals in the area that keep anti-venom on hand that would counteract the venom of your snake. Keep the information in multiple places.Keep this list by your snake's cage, in your phone, and in other prominent places around the home. Be sure your family or housemates know where this information is.

, Before purchasing a snake, prepare an adequate and secure home for it. The size requirements will vary depending on the variety. The cage or tank must be sturdy and secure.Purchase a snake tank (like reinforced fish tank) or make a cage from plywood, at least a half inch thick.
Do not use any cage with mesh sides.
Any opening large enough for a snake to stick its snout in up to its eyes is a big enough opening for it to escape.
The tank must have a secured lid. Ideally, it should lock., Find a reputable vendor to buy a snake from and purchase your snake. Then bring it home and release it into the cage.


To find a reputable vendor, read some online reviews, or better yet, talk to others within the snake community to get a recommendation.Ask the vendor questions such as who he or she uses as a vet, how long the business has existed, and where the snakes come from. A reputable vendor should have clear, straightforward answers to all these questions. It is also a good idea to ask for references.If you live somewhere where venomous snakes live in the wild, you may be tempted to try to catch one yourself. Before undertaking such a task, be aware that this is very dangerous if you don't know what you are doing, and is also illegal in some states."
"
Keep the snake's area secured.,
Maintain proper heat and humidity.,
Keep the tank clean.,
Feed according the needs of the species.,
Watch for signs of disease.",How to Look After a Venomous Snake2," Any time you do not need to access your snake, keep its cage or tank closed and locked. The room that you keep the cage in should also be sealed.Be certain there are no places where the snake could get into the walls or building structure. Be sure there are no openings large enough for the snake to escape the room, should it get out of it's cage.
Keep the room free of clutter to make the snake easier to find, should it get out of its tank.
Make sure there is a light right by the door of the room so you never have to cross the room in darkness. Keep your handling tools by the door as well.
Keep all other pets out of the area at all times., Different snakes have different requirements regarding heat and humidity. Depending on the breed of your snake, you may need to purchase heat lamps, space heaters, or humidifiers to make sure your snake is healthy and comfortable.

Gaboon vipers, for example, must be kept at temperatures ranging from the mid 70s to the high 80s, Fahrenheit. Their enclosures should be sprayed regularly to create proper humidity.Some snakes, like the Banded Rock Rattlesnake, require an annual hibernation period, during which the temperature in the room must be lowered into the 50s and lighting must be reduced.Make sure you are equipped to care for the needs of your snake by creating a healthy environment.

, Like any animal that lives in a cage, a venomous snake will need its home cleaned periodically. This is most easily achieved by moving it temporarily to a separate tank or cage so you can clean without disturbing or provoking it.Depending on the type of snake, a thorough cleaning is usually needed at least three or four times a year, but keep an eye on cage conditions and make this determination for yourself.

, All venomous snakes are carnivores. Most should be fed live food, such as mice, rats, insects, or amphibians, depending on the variety of snake.Research the specific species you have purchased to determine how much to feed it and how often.


Never feed a snake by hand. Lower the food in using tongs.Some snakes are fed as seldom as every two weeks.Make sure your snake has access to water at all times. The water should be changed regularly (i.e. every two or three days)., Different varieties of snakes are susceptible to different diseases. When you research your snake, make sure to pay attention to which diseases are common and how you can detect them.


Reduced appetite and slower than normal movements are often a sign your snake is ill."
"
Stay sharp.,
Dress protectively.,
Use the right tools.,
Move slowly.,
Handle the snake no more than necessary.",How to Look After a Venomous Snake3," Whenever you are going to remove the snake from its home, change its water, or otherwise come into contact with the snake, stay alert. Snakes can strike rapidly and in any direction.


Never handle your snake when intoxicated, exhausted, or otherwise impaired., When handling a snake always wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and thick leather gloves. NEVER handle a venomous snake with your bare hands., Some experienced handlers will pick up a snake with their hands when they need to move it. This is not recommended, however.A better choice is to use a metal snake hook or tongs.Snake hooks and tongs can be purchased online.
Snake hooks are made of stainless steel and allow you to pick up and move a snake without getting it close enough to your body that it can strike you.
Never pick up a snake by the neck using tongs. You can accidentally strangle your snake.
It's a good idea to practice using hooks and tongs with a toy snake first, and then ideally with a non-venomous snake before attempting to move a poisonous animal with these tools.

, When you handle a venomous snake, avoid big and sudden motions. Move slowly and keep your movements as minimal as possible. This will reduce the risk of startling the snake and thus of it striking out at you.It's also a good idea to hang out in the room with the snake for 15 minutes or more before moving it, so the snake can get comfortable with your presence.
Get the snake into a container as soon as you can.

, The more you handle your snake, the more opportunities it has to bite you or escape. Only handle it when necessary.


Furthermore, some snakes are prone to stress related diseases, which can be brought on by excessive handling.Never take your snake out of its tank or cage when inexperienced persons are around."
"
Move away from the snake.,
Call for help.,
Remove tight clothing or jewelry around the bite.,
Loosely apply a clean bandage over the wound.This prevents infection and reduces blood loss.,
Keep the wound below the heart.,
Stay calm and still.",How to Look After a Venomous Snake4," If you are bitten by your snake, move away from it immediately. It may strike you again.Further bites mean more venom in your bloodstream and an increased risk of death.

, Immediately call 911 or one of the hospitals you have already identified as having anti-venom.Time is of the essence. You need medical assistance immediately.

, The bitten area is likely to swell. Tight clothing or jewelry around the area can be difficult to remove once this happens.,


You can gently clean the wound with a damp towel, but do not flush it with water.Do not attempt to suck the venom out of the wound or otherwise remove the venom. You can end up making matters worse. Do not use a tourniquet., Keeping the wound below the level of your heart will slow the spread of the venom. Keep the wound low, ideally while lying down.


If the snake has bitten your arm, for example, lie on a bed or couch with the bitten arm dangling over the side., Although it may be hard not to panic, you need to stay calm and still while you wait for help. Anxiety and activity will increase your heart rate, speeding the movement of the venom through your body.Do not drink alcohol or caffeine while awaiting help. Alcohol thins the blood, and caffeine raises your heart rate. Both can cause the situation to worsen more rapidly."

Check the eggs regularly.,
Adjust the conditions based on moisture level.,
Use a candling device to check the state of the eggs.,
Set up the cages for the hatchlings.",How to Take Care of Lizard Eggs," The lizard that laid the eggs and the size of the eggs will determine what size container you use. Small eggs can be placed in deli cups or plastic containers. Medium-sized eggs can be place in sandwich containers, and large eggs in larger plastic containers.Cover the container with a lid that has holes poked in it for ventilation.
Measure the container so you can choose an incubator large enough for your container.;
, Incubators are used to regulate the temperature as your eggs get ready to hatch. They should be insulated to keep a constant temperature and have clear sides or an easy way for you to watch the eggs. You can buy incubators at pet stores, farm supply stores, and online.Make sure the incubator that you buy is large enough for your container of eggs. Make sure to measure the container before choosing an incubator.
Hovabator incubators are inexpensive and used often by lizard pet owners. They work well for most species of lizard.
Buying an incubator is probably the best option, especially if you are not experienced in hatching lizard eggs.

, No matter if you have a commercial or homemade incubator, you should make sure that the thermometer works properly. You have to keep the incubator at a specific temperature, so you need to make sure it is accurate.The exact temperature you have to keep the chamber will vary depending on the species. Research the particular species of lizard you have to make sure you keep it at the proper temperature. For example, most temperate and tropical species need around 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 29 degrees Celsius).

, If you don’t have time or don’t want to buy an incubator, you can make one. To do this, get a fish tank, an aquarium heater, two bricks, and plastic wrap.


Place the bricks in the tank and fill it with water to just below the top of the bricks.
Place the egg container on top off the bricks when you are ready to incubate.
Put the aquarium heater in the water and set it to the correct temperature.
Seal the top with plastic wrap to hold in the heat and humidity.
You can also use a styrofoam cooler raised over a heating pad. Wait until the heating pad heats the styrofoam cooler to the right temperature, and then place your egg containers inside.Make sure to measure the container you are going to use for your eggs before making an incubator. You want to make sure the container will fit into the incubator.

, Once you uncover the eggs, you should not turn them. Lizard eggs begin developing almost immediately and attach to the side of the egg. Use a pencil to gently mark the side of the egg facing you when you found it. This helps you remember the top of the egg so you don’t damage the lizard inside.Moving them or rolling them to the other side can damage the embryo and kill the developing lizard.

, Some lizards will lay their eggs in a pile, which makes them stick together. If you find them early enough, you should carefully separate the eggs, trying not to damage the fragile shells. If they are stuck together, don’t force them apart.Separating the eggs help protect them. If one egg dies, mold or fungi from it can infect the healthy egg.

, The medium, or substance, that you place the eggs on inside the incubation tank is important. It should be able to retain water to help keep the incubator humid. It should be sterile or close to it, and it shouldn’t promote growth of mold or fungi.Perlite and vermiculite are common mediums that eggs can successfully incubate and hatch on. These mediums are very similar, and the choice is usually based on preference.
You can find these substances at nurseries or home improvement stores with garden centers.

, Incubation medium goes on the bottom of the container you’re placing your eggs in. Place about one to two inches (25 to 50 mm) of medium at the bottom of the container. It is important to keep the incubation medium moist while waiting for the eggs to hatch. Add water until the medium is barely clumping together. It should not be so wet that water drips out of it when it is squeezed.Keep the medium at this moisture level until the eggs hatch.

, Before you move the egg, make an indentation with your finger in the incubation medium where you want to put the egg. This gives the egg a secure place to lay so it won’t roll around and hurt the embryo. This space also allows you to bury the egg slightly. The egg should be about half covered with the medium.Place multiple eggs about a fingers width apart from each other. Place the indentations in a line.

, When you are ready to move the eggs, use great care. First, make sure your hands are clean. Don’t turn or roll the eggs around when moving them. Keep the top of the egg where you made a pencil mark facing up. Place them in the medium inside the container.Don’t let the eggs roll around when you move them.
If the eggs are stuck on a branch, remove the branch and place it in the incubator. Do not try to remove the eggs from the branch because they will break. Cut the branch as small as possible without disturbing the eggs and try to find a container big enough for the branch too.

, Close the lid on the container containing the eggs. Then, place the container in the incubator. Write down the date of when the eggs were laid and placed in the incubator, calculate when they should hatch, and mark it on your calendar.

, During the incubation process, you should make sure the temperature stays regular. Maintaining the temperature is one of the most important things you can do to ensure that your eggs don’t die.Check the thermometer to make sure the temperature is not fluctuating inside of the incubator.
Make sure to keep the medium damp if the temperature dries it out.

, Watching the eggs is important as you wait for them to hatch. Eggs may go bad and die at any point during the incubation process. Eggs may get too hot, too cold, wet, or dry and go bad.Wet eggs may begin to grow mold, while dry eggs may start to collapse.
Remove any bad eggs so they don't contaminate your healthy eggs.

, If the eggs or medium are too wet, uncover the container. Leave it uncovered for a couple of days until the extra moisture evaporates. If the eggs are dry, add water to the medium. Do this slowly so you don’t get everything too wet.Never drop water directly onto the eggs. Drip water around the egg into the medium. Try using an eyedropper or a wet rag.

, You can buy a fiber optic candling device or small white LED light to check the eggs. Shine the light close to the egg, but be careful not to press on the egg or move it. The inside of the egg will glow. Healthy eggs should be pink and red with a few blood vessels inside.If it glows yellow, either the egg is infertile, dead, or not enough time has passed to see growth yet.
Eggs that are infertile or dead will turn an off-white or yellowish color and eventually grow mold or cave in.

, While you wait for your eggs to hatch, set up an enclosure for hatchlings. Make sure you have everything you need, including food. Most lizards will need to be put in small cages lined with paper towels in the first few weeks of life.

Make sure the cage has the proper heat and humidity for babies. Babies will usually shed their first shed in 24 hours and you need to make sure it all comes off. Having the proper humidity will ensure you don't have shedding issues.
Add a small water dish or get a misting bottle ready if the species only drinks water droplets.
Some babies require less heat than adults. Research specific heat requirements for babies of the species you have.

Identify the lizard.,
Obtain the appropriate food for your lizard.,
Figure out how much and how often you should feed your lizard.",How to Feed a Lizard1," Different lizards eat different things. In order to feed your lizard properly, you need to know what type it is. Assess the physical characteristics of your lizard and write them down. Then you can use an identification guide or look up images of different types of lizards online using those characteristics. For example, you can use an online search engine to search for ""lizard green spotted tail"" and see if you find images of lizards that look like yours.Some physical characteristics you can use to determine a type of lizard include size, color, pattern, and body shape. You should also think about changes in pattern or color on different parts of your lizard's body.
You can also take your lizard to a pet store and ask an employee to help you identify it.;
, Once you figure out what type of lizard you have, you will be able to research what type of food it eats. For example, anole green lizards should be fed small to medium live insects, every 2-3 days and geckos will eat meal worms, wax worms, crickets, and roaches.


However, if you can't seem to figure out what type lizard you have, remember that most lizards eat insects and they typically prefer live ones. Try giving your lizard a few crickets, as these are widely available, and see if they go after them. If they don't eat them willingly, you will need to do further experimentation with other insects and leafy green vegetables.

, In addition to knowing what type of food to give your lizard, you need to know how much and how often to give them food. Feeding your lizard the right amount is key to keeping it healthy and happy.


Do some research online and figure out how much to feed your lizard. Internet research can give a base line of where to start with feeding and then you can adjust based on your specific lizard.

Purchase a large cage.,
Cover the bottom with cage carpet.,
Add plants to the terrarium.,
Provide a hiding place.,
Give your lizard ample light.",How to Care for a Texas Spiny Lizard1," Texas spiny lizards are active creatures that grow to about 7.5” to 12”. They need a large cage that accommodates their size and provides them with plenty of space to run around. They are also arboreal, meaning they need to climb. Get a 36 to 50 gallon cage or terrarium to make sure you’ll have room for plants, logs, and vines for your lizard to play with.Be sure the cage is enclosed so that the lizard doesn’t escape.;
, To cover the bottom of the cage, you can use either cage carpet, sand, small rocks, or powdered walnut shell. Cage carpet is generally recommended, however, as lizards might consume alternative floor types, which can lead to digestive issues.Cage carpet can be a bit trickier to clean. Make sure to give yourself some time every month to dedicate to keeping your lizard’s cage carpet in good condition.
Cage carpet can be purchased online at PetSmart or Amazon. Call your local pet store to see if they sell cage carpet.

, Plants will make your lizard feel more at home in its terrarium, and also give the lizard something to climb in. Put as many plants, vines, branches, and sticks that you can in the cage so that your lizard will have ample climbing material.While it’s okay to put live plants, vines, and branches into your lizard’s home, be sure they don’t carry too much moisture. The Texas spiny lizard prefers a drier environment. It’s best to put a mixture of live and fake climbing surfaces into the cage.If you find plants outside, make sure they are free of bugs and are not poisonous.One of the Texas spiny lizard’s hobbies is digging into decayed logs. Put a piece of an old log into the cage once every few weeks to give the lizard a nice activity.

, Lizards like to have a place to hide themselves every so often. Add a log that can accommodate the length of your lizard to the cooler side of the cage. Remember that Texas spiny lizards grow to about 12”.It’s best to get a hollowed out log so that your lizard can hide completely. You can buy a hollowed out log at most pet stores. If you’re handy, make one yourself!You’ll also want to have a part of the cage left open for the lizard to play in. Try to put this on the opposite side of the cage from the hiding spot.

, Texas spiny lizards are diurnal and like to bask in the sun, so will need full spectrum UVB cage lighting to stay healthy and happy. You’ll want the cage to be between 80-88 degrees during the day, 70–80 degrees at night, and 100-108 in the lizard’s basking spot.Make a basking platform around 12 inches from the basking light. The UVB rays aren’t strong enough to be placed any farther away from the lizard.Only put lighting on one side of the cage since your lizard needs a cool place as well.
Ask about how to properly set up cage lighting at a local pet store to ensure your lizard’s health and safety.

Provide your anole with crickets.,
Dust the crickets.,
Give your lizard different prey occasionally.,
Avoid feeding mealworms to anoles.,
Don't leave uneaten crickets in your lizard's tank.",How to Feed a Lizard2," One of the meals that anoles enjoy the most is crickets and they can provide most of the nutrients an anole needs. Thus, when caring for anoles, crickets will make up the majority of your lizard's diet.


Buy the smallest crickets offered at your pet store. If there is only ""one size"" available at a pet store, go to a different one. Anoles need to be given small crickets.

, You will need to add supplement powder to the crickets at each feeding to help ensure the anoles get enough calcium and vitamins. Anoles are missing some key nutrients and can get metabolic bone disease (MBD) and die if they are not given supplements.


If you keep crickets around in bulk, ""gut-load"" them by feeding them a vitamin rich cricket food prior to feeding them to your lizards. This way, all of the nutritious food your crickets just ate will then, in turn, be passed on to your anole.
Equally, if your crickets are starved, your anole soon will be too.

, In addition to crickets, anoles like small cockroaches or flies once in a while. This varies their diet and gives them some much needed exercise.


Anoles may also eat waxworms, fruit flies, small worms, canned crickets, or earthworms.

, Mealworms pass through anoles undigested. This wastes the lizard's energy due to unproductive eating and they will not get any energy from the food.


Additionally, the lizard will feel full when it is actually not getting any nutrition. Thus, it could cause the lizard to become malnourished.

, Unless it's feeding time, the anole's food should be kept away from it when the lizard it sleeps. This way the ""leftovers"" won't munch on your lizard while it's asleep. You may not expect it but medium to large crickets can eat the anole's extremities.


If the crickets are small enough, they probably won't bother your anole. However, some owners of anoles advise to never release or leave crickets loose in the tank with the lizard. Rather to place them in a separate container, move the anole to the container for 5–10 minutes to eat, and then move the anole back to his tank when done.

Give your geckos a diet of insects.,
Feed your gecko daily.,
Gut load crickets.,
Powder the feeding insects.",How to Feed a Lizard3," When caring for leopard geckos, you should feed them meal worms, wax worms, crickets, and roaches. These all make good food, however, most geckos' diets consist largely of crickets with other insects given occasionally.Make sure to refrigerate the mealworms, as they turn into beetles if left at room temperature.

, Place as much of the food in the tank as your gecko can eat in 15 minutes. Don't leave crickets hopping around all day, as they will feed on your gecko if left in the lizard's tank too long.The number of insects that your gecko will be able to eat in 15 minutes will vary, depending on your lizard's size, age, and appetite. Over time, as you get to know your lizard, you will learn how many insects to feed it.

, To give your lizard more nutrition, it is important to feed the crickets a lot before they are fed to your lizard. This is called ""gut-loading"" and is done by feeding your crickets nutritious foods, such as oats, fruit, and vegetables.When you feed crickets highly-nutritious foods, that nutrition is passed on to your lizard. On the other hand, when you feed your lizard crickets that have malnutrition, your lizard will not get enough nutrition.

, Once a week sprinkle the insects you are feeding to your lizard with calcium and vitamin D powder. This is very important to ensure bone health, as well as general health. If your gecko is not given calcium and vitamin D powder, it could get a painful metabolic bone disease.To coat the crickets, put them in a plastic bag with the supplement powder. Shake it up gently until the insects are completely covered. They should be totally white when sufficiently coated.

Provide your Uromastyx lizard with dark, leafy greens.,
Avoid calcium-blocking and nutrient-lacking greens.,
Feed your lizard greens once a day.,
Give your lizard pellets or seeds once a week.,
Put supplements on your lizard's food weekly.",How to Feed a Lizard4," One of the best parts about caring for Uros is that they eat foods that can be picked up from the grocery store. Adult Uros will eat a variety of dark leafy greens, including bok-choy, collard greens, dandelion greens, mustard and turnip greens, escarole, endive, and radicchio.Your lizard may have particular favorites. Give them a mixture to choose from and then see which type of greens get eaten the most.

, There are some dark leafy greens, such as kale and spinach, that block calcium absorption. They should be fed minimally. Also, do not feed Uros Romaine or iceberg lettuce.Lettuce has very little nutritional value. However, it does hydrate a lizard.

, Cut up whatever dark, leafy greens your lizard prefers and place them in a small bowl. Your lizard's food should look like a nice chopped salad.Use a bowl that is shallow enough so that the lizard can see the food if it is standing on the ground.
Remove uneaten greens daily. Also clean out the bowl before refilling it the next day.

, In addition to eating leafy greens, giving your lizard a few other foods will balance out its diet well. You can feed your lizard iguana pellets or tortoise food, whichever your lizard prefers. Uromastyx lizards also love seeds, including bird seed mixes and dried lentils.Pellets and seeds should not make up the majority of your lizard's diet.

, Sprinkle a small amount of calcium dust onto the lizard's food to supplement it. You should also put a small amount of multivitamin dust on its food as well. This will help your lizard's overall health.There are several types of calcium dusts available for purchase. If the lizard gets a lot of sunshine or UVB light, then you can use the outdoor version. If it is largely out of the sunlight and UVB, then you should use the indoor type.

Feed your lizard a mix of insects.,
Dust food with vitamin D3 and calcium powder.,
Change the water regularly.,
Mist the cage.",How to Care for a Texas Spiny Lizard2," Texas spiny lizards require a diet of live insects, and will thrive if you provide them with a variety of species. Giant mealworms, crickets, waxworms, regular mealworms, silkworms, and non-noxious caterpillars are all great choices.Feed your lizard once a day. If your lizard is active and healthy, feed them as much as they can eat over a 15-20 minute time period. If they are overweight, talk to a vet about a diet plan that will keep your lizard healthy.Be sure that the insects are relatively small in comparison to the lizard’s head. Otherwise the lizard may suffer digestive problems. Cut the insects yourself if the pieces seem too large.
If you live near fields or meadows that are not sprayed with insecticides, you can collect your own insects (known as “field plankton”) with a sweep net during warmer months.Remove any uneaten insects from the cage immediately after feeding., To ensure that your lizard is getting proper nutrients, dust its food once a week or every other week with vitamin D3 and calcium powder.You can purchase Rep-Cal Reptile Calcium Powder with D3 online at either PetSmart or Amazon.
To dust the insects, place the insects and a little bit of dusting powder in a glass jar and shake until the insects are coated with the powder. Then feed to your lizards immediately.

, Provide fresh water for your lizard in a shallow dish. Be sure to change the water every day to keep your lizard healthy.


If the water splashes around too much you’ll have to clean the substrate to keep the habitat dry., Buy a mist spray bottle and mist your lizard’s cage twice a week. Lizards like to lick water off plants, and misting the plants and vines in your cage will give them extra opportunity to hydrate. Don’t drench the cage as the habitat substrate needs to stay dry. Instead, lightly mist any surfaces that your lizard likes to climb or play on."
"
Clean the cage.,
Provide proper cage mates.,
Don’t pick up your lizard.",How to Care for a Texas Spiny Lizard3," Clean the cage thoroughly once a week. This is an involved procedure that will take some time. You will need rubber gloves, disinfectant, and hot, soapy water for cleaning. You should also check daily for spilled food, feces, or other hazardous particles. First, remove your lizard from the cage and place in a safe spot while you clean.
Remove all decorations from the cage and clean with hot, soapy water.
Clean the food and water bowls with hot, soapy water. For a homemade cleanser, mix 1 teaspoon (5 ml) dishwashing detergent (such as Palmolive® or Dawn®) and 1 ounce (30 ml) of household bleach into 1 quart of water.Clean cage surfaces with hot, soapy water. Then clean again with a disinfectant. For disinfectant, use a bleach solution containing 1 part bleach to 16 parts water.Let the cage dry before replacing decorations, food bowls, and the lizard., Texas spiny lizards are perfectly happy to be alone in a cage, but if you do decide to have more than one in a cage, make sure you pair them correctly. You should never have two male spiny lizards in the same cage. However, two females will get along well in the same space.If you put a male and female together in a cage, they will likely breed.</ref>

, Texas spiny lizards should be treated as a display species. They don’t like to be picked up and held. If you hold them for too long and try to play with them they are likely to bite. Only handle your lizard when necessary, such as during cage cleanings.If you must pick up the lizard for a cage cleaning, use your palm and fingers to cup the lizard's body from its neck to its cloaca, or neck vent. Then, gentle lift up the lizard in one fluid motion. Do not hold the lizard by its tail as the tail can break off.

Make sure to have a dish with calcium with no D3 in the tank at all times.,
Get them a variety of food.,
Make them places to hide.",How to Take Care of a Pastel Leopard Gecko," You can never know too much, so do a lot of research before you buy one.;
, A healthy leopard gecko should be alert; have clear eyes, nose, and mouth; have all toes; and finally have a nice plump tail that is wider than the width between its shoulders.

, Leos are very funny to watch, but they have important behavioral characteristics. Leos can be housed together, but, when caging together, never have more than one male in a cage. Numerous females can be housed together or with a male, but must be observed for fighting or competition for food. When housing together, make sure to have enough space for the animals: every animal should have a minimum 10 gallons (37.9 L) of space (preferably a single gecko should have a 20 gallon space).

, The housing consists of the entire environment you will set up for your leo. Aquariums should be long, not tall. Each leopard gecko should have a 20 gallon (75.7 L) long aquarium, though a leopard gecko can live in a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank. If you would like to make a custom terrarium, several companies are available.

, There are numerous substrates you could use. One that has become popular is reptile carpet or slate tile as opposed to sand, which may cause impaction (sand getting stuck in the intestines). Other substrates that are cheap and effective include paper towels or non-glossy newspaper. It doesn't look as appealing, but your geckos will not mind. Sand is another option that may look nice, but it is also the substrate that carries the most risk to the gecko's health. Sand and slate tile are the easiest to clean and reuse, while newspaper and paper towels may be used once and replaced.

, Reptiles need external heating to regulate their body temperatures. Leopard geckos need a temperature gradient in their tank from about 75 °F (24 °C) on the cool side to 95 °F (35 °C) on the warm side so they can move where they need to to get the right temperature. There are two ways to heat the tank to make the gradient. The preferred method is through a heating mat (called an undertank heater or UTH) adhered to the bottom of one side of the tank. This is the best way to heat the tank, because geckos require belly heat to digest their prey. Make sure the mat is all the way to one side of the tank in order to create a gradient of heating so that the leopard gecko can regulate their internal temperature. Another way to heat the terrarium is to use a ceramic heat emitter or a lamp with a heat bulb, but it is harder to regulate than an undertank heater. A thermometer should be used to ensure proper temperatures are maintained.

, Day lamps are not required but are recommended for the proper synthesis of vitamins D and A. Night lights should be red, not blue or black, as these can hurt the gecko's eyes. Night lights are not necessary unless the owner wants to see the gecko after dark.

, If desired (or the gecko won't drink from the dish), the tank can be misted with fresh water so the gecko can drink the drops.

, A Gatorade  cap for is the perfect size for this. Food should also be dusted twice a week with calcium with D3 and once a week with a reptile vitamin supplement. This can be done by dropping feeders into a sandwich bag containing the supplement and shaking them to lightly dust them with the vitamin or calcium before feeding them to the gecko.

, Leopard geckos are able to eat several different kinds of insects. The most common foods are crickets and meal worms. Others include dubia roaches, wolf spiders, silkworms, and horn worms  . Feeders should be fed, or gut-loaded, before giving to the gecko. This can be done by feeding them fresh potato, vegetables, or a commercial insect diet for 12 hours before feeding them to the gecko. Geckos should be fed a variety of these insects to keep them healthy.


Treats. Worms such as phoenix worms, butter worms, and wax worms should be fed only occasionally because they can cause nutritional problems if fed exclusively.
Feeding. Crickets should have their rear legs removed before being fed to small or slow geckos. Mealworms can be kept in a dish in the terrarium but must be monitored to make sure the gecko is eating them. No other insects should be left with the gecko longer than an hour, as they may cause injury via biting. If the gecko is aggressive or has problems catching feeders (or if the owner just wants to hand-feed them), forceps can be used to grip insects in the middle before presenting them to the gecko. If needed, they can be wiggled in front of the gecko to catch its attention.

, Since leos are nocturnal, they require dark hides in order to feel safe during the daylight hours while they sleep. While they may be up often during the day, they still enjoy the safety and security that two or more hides offer. Place one in the warm area and one in the cool area. A humid hide should be used as well. Hides may be made out of cardboard, wood, plastic Tupperware or butter tubs with holes cut in them, or any other gecko-safe material.


Humid hide. Leos will also need a humid hide placed on the warm side. This will help aid in shedding. Humid hides should be made of plastic prepared like regular hides, but should contain moistened materials inside such as wet paper towels or moss for use with pets (which can be found at a pet store).

Know when to bathe them.,
Go to your sink and rinse the inside of it.,
Fill the sink with lukewarm water up to the lizard's upper legs.,

Once you are finished, take the lizard out of the bath and immediately wrap them in a  hand towel.,
Gently pat them down with the towel until they are dry.",How to Give a Lizard a Bath," Reasons for giving your reptile a bath:

They may be in skin shedding season- a bath will help them get rid of their skin.
They may be constipated or unwell and a bath will ease their stomach.
They may be dirty or smelly.
They may enjoy a bath.;
, Use a sink or tub for smaller lizards like small bearded dragons and geckos, and your actual bath for bigger lizards like monitor lizards and iguanas., Do not use any soap because he/she may be tempted to drink from the water!

If the lizard tries to escape the sink or make alarmed hissing noises, the water is too hot.

, Pour it gently over the lizards body, being careful to avoid his/her eyes., As the water will go cold, remember to keep adding more lukewarm water. However, don't run the water directly on top of him/her as this will annoy them., Give them a designated hand towel because lizards carry a lot of germs. Do not leave them wet because they will get cold and if you leave them for hours they could die!, Then put them back in their tank. "

Handle you skink with care.,
Make sure children know how to safely handle a skink.",How to Care for a Skink," Bigger is better when it comes to a skink's tank. Skinks need lots of room to roam to be healthy and happy. Hatchlings can be comfortable in a 10 to 20 gallon (37.9 to 75.7 L) tank. If you have a larger skink, make sure the tank is at least 30 to 40 gallons (110 to 150 L). If you have the space or money for a bigger tank, it's always nice for a skink to have extra room to roam., Substrate is the substance used to fill the bottom of a tank. It's important to use a substrate that's comfortable for your skink. At least 6 inches (15.2 cm) of a quality substrate is necessary for your skink.A mixture of soil, sand, and wood chips is usually a good option. If you have a pet store near you that sells reptiles, you may be able to find a substrate specifically for skinks there.
Make sure to keep the substrate damp. The substrate should not be soaking wet, but it should have some moisture. Skinks require a somewhat humid environment.

, Skinks require both a warm and cool end of their tank. Reptiles keep their bodies warm and cold by shifting between two different environments.One area of the tank should be slightly above room temperature. A few UV lightbulbs near the cooler end of the tank should keep it warm enough. Make sure not to place the tank anywhere in your house where it gets very cold or very hot during certain times of the day.
Another area should be around 90 degrees. You can get an under tank heating device, which you can purchase at a pet store. You can also use an overhead heating lamp. If you use both, turn the heating lamp off at night.

, The tank does not need to be extremely humid, and does not require regular misting like other reptile tanks. Damp substrate should keep the tank humid, but you also need to provide your skink with a water bowl. Get a shallow water bowl for the tank big enough for your skink to lie down in., Skinks will get bored or anxious if they don't have hiding spaces in their tank. Stop by your local pet store and get things like hidey holes and other enclosures. Place these around the tank so your skink can have a hiding place when it wants privacy.Make sure your substrate remains six inches deep. This will allow your skink to hide when it wants to.

, Skinks primarily eat insects. You can buy insects at a pet store. If there's not a pet store near you that caters to reptiles, you can see if you can purchase insects online.Feeder insects and crickets should be the main staple of your skink's diet. King worms and mealworms are appropriate to feed to your skink on occasion.
Make sure prey is live. Skinks will not eat insects they do not have to stalk.

, In addition to eating insects, skinks enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables. This can help supplement your skink's diet by adding some extra nutrients.Brussels sprouts, carrots, greens, and peas are good vegetables to serve your skink.
Fruits that skinks enjoy include blueberries, mangos, raspberries, papayas, cantaloupes, strawberries, and figs.

, Always read nutritional information before feeding your skink. Skinks should not be fed food that's treated with pesticides. You should also avoid giving your skink any food with artificial coloring. Foods that contain by-products, like chicken and and meat/bone meal, should not be given to a skink., Skinks tend to get a lot of sand and debris in their water. You should have a water bowl in your skink's cage that cannot easily tip over. As it will get contaminated frequently, replace the water in this bowl each day., For the most part, skinks will not do well with a cage mate. Stick to one skink per tank. Skinks tend to be territorial. If you introduce a cage mate, one or both skinks may end up with bite marks or missing limbs., If you have your heart set on a second skink, exercise extreme caution. Make sure the tank mate is the same size as your current skink. Skinks will attack smaller skinks.If the skinks begin fighting, you should resign yourself to keeping them in separate cages.
If you have a fire skink, these tend to be very territorial. It's a bad idea to introduce a cage mate.

, Skinks can learn to be social, but proper handling is required. When handling your skink, make sure to treat it with respect. Improper handling can cause your skink to bite and become aggressive.Never handle a skink when it's not expecting it. Do not pick up a sleeping skink. Make sure the skink knows you're there before you attempt to pet it or pick it up.
Make sure to support a skink's body weight when holding it.
Do not turn a skink upside down. This causes distress.
Avoid any abrupt movements when handling a skink.

, Talk to children about the proper rules for handling a skink. Make sure they understand to handle the skinks with care, and not to do anything that could frighten them. You may want to avoid letting very young children handle a skink, as they may not understand how to control themselves around an animal."

Provide appropriate food.,

Provide stimulation.",How to Care for Your Lizard," What type of cage you get is determined by your lizard. Be aware that lizards need to be kept within certain temperature ranges. If the ambient temperature where you live drops low in winter, then you need to provide a thermally efficient enclosed tank. This will keep your lizard warm without sending your heating budget sky high. You should be able to control the heat in the cage, as well as the humidity for some species. You'll also need to be able to provide light, as well as give the lizard as much space as it needs.Make sure that the enclosure is secure and that your lizard cannot escape from it.
One common type of cage is an aquarium with a screen on top. Small geckos do fine in this type of cage.For leopard geckos, you'll need a 20-gallon aquarium/terrarium.Plastic cages are another option. Bearded dragons do well in this type of cage, though the ideal tank is a vivarium, which is made up of heat insulating material such as wood, with a glass front. Aquariums can become too hot, or be thermally inefficient. Bearded dragons need a 55-gallon aquarium. If you choose a plastic cage, it needs to be at least 2 feet by four feet, as well as 2 feet high.A third type of cage is an all-wire cage. Chameleons prefer this type of cage, as they can climb as needed. For that reason, their cages should be taller than for other lizards.;
, Many reptiles will need a heat lamp to stay at the right temperature. However, different lamps and bulbs will put out different amounts of heat, so you need to pick one that is appropriate for what temperature your lizard needs.Ask at the pets store how much heat your lizard will need. For instance, most lizards will need an area that's somewhere between 90 degrees to 100 degrees.Lizards also need a cool area of the cage, so only put the heat on one end. The cooler end should be between 70 and 75 degrees, usually.Check temperatures. Consider how high up your lizard can get, including it's height. Make sure those areas are not too hot for your lizard by using a thermometer to check.Turn basking lamps that provide light off at night. If your lizard still needs warmth, use a ceramic heater instead., Most lizards need light to help them thrive. You'll need to use lamps that provide UVA and UVB light. Only keep it on during the day for about 12 hours.Pick a flood lamp. You need a zone for the lizard to bask in and absorb light. If you have a basking flood lamp, you can simply add another lamp for UVB light, so your lizard gets the full spectrum. The basking lamp will provide the UVA rays it needs.Place the lamp within the enclosure but out of reach of the lizard. Be careful that the lizard cannot touch the lamp as he will get burnt, but it needs to be close enough to provide effective heating. Check the lamp you buy to see what its requirements are.Create layers. That is, your lizard should have an area for basking and light, but it should also have space to get away from those sources. Keep parts of the enclosure mostly unlit.Turn the lights out at night. Your reptile needs darkness at night just like you do. If you find it hard to remember, you can set the lamps on timers., Most lizards like to hide themselves away sometimes. You need to give them a place where they can do so. Rocks and small logs work for this purpose.Try to put at least one hiding place where it's cooler in the cage.If you use any outside rocks, make sure to clean them and then sterilize them in boiling water first before adding them to the cage. You can also clean and then heat branches in the oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes to help kill off any germs.Branches are also important to some species, such as chameleons, because they allow them to climb., While it's tempting to put gravel or other types of bedding down in a cage, lizards can eat pieces of them. The lizard cannot process these bits, which can lead to problems.However, what's best does depend on your lizard.


You can use butcher paper to line the cage. Butcher paper is a good choice because it is ink-free, and ink can be harmful to your lizard. Another good choice is newspaper that hasn't been printed on, which you can find at moving companies.However, some lizards do like to burrow,in which case, brand-new playground sand is a good choice., However, different lizards will require different types of water dishes. For instance, some do best with a small bowl, while others will need a drip water system.As an example, chameleons need dripping water because they won't drink from a small bowl.You can either ask at the pet store or contact your vet to find out which is best for you pet.
Be sure to change the water everyday, especially if the lizard uses a small bowl for water.
Some lizards like to swim, so you will need to provide a large enough water area to allow them to do so., Depending on the type, your lizard will need to be misted once a day. You can use any spray bottle, as long as it's set to mist and not stream. The mist helps create the humidity needed by some lizards.For instance, bearded dragons will not need to be misted, but iguanas will., Most lizards will eat insects and prefer live ones. Crickets are a common food that can be supplemented with a reptile food supplement, and waxworms, mealworms, and roaches are also common. In fact, many owners keep a small colony of crickets or roaches to feed their pets.Some lizards are carnivores, while others are omnivores or herbivores.If you keep live crickets, one-fifth of their diet needs to be calcium carbonate, given to them at least 2 days before you feed your crickets. The other four-fifths can be cricket food.
Carnivores will eat insects, but they'll also snack on smaller lizards or frogs if they are big enough.You may also need to feed rodents, fish, shrimp, or baby chicks.For instance, leopard geckos are carnivores and do well on a diet of crickets and mealworms.You can collect insects with a sweep net from nearby fields to feed your lizards. However, you must be sure that the fields are not treated with insecticide, and you'll likely only have luck when it's warm out.Some lizards are omnivores, and they will eat plants, too, such as dandelion, clover, and other common fruits and vegetables. For instance, tomatoes, pears, apple, and lettuce are common fruits and vegetables to feed your lizards. They will also eat other small insects, such as snails and meal worms, or even dog food (with a bit of added water if dry).Bearded dragons are omnivores, and they can subsist mainly on greens (like kale and leaf lettuce) and squash with mealworms and locusts or other insects making up the other quarter of their diet.Most omnivores and carnivores will only need to be feed 2 to 3 times a week.However, smaller or younger reptiles may need to be fed more often. How much your lizard eats depends on its size.Some lizards are herbivores, meaning they will eat only vegetables. Iguanas are a good example of this type. They can eat leafy greens, as well as many fruits and vegetables, and they should be fed every day.Food should mostly be about as long as their head is wide to prevent choking. In addition, you should place foods on a small plate for consumption, especially if you have sand in the tank., You should take your pet to the vet when you first get it, to make sure it is in good health. Like other animals, you should also take your lizard to the vet once a year for a checkup.Most lizards need de-worming at some point in their lives. Ask your vet about it.

, Runny feces are a sign of poor health, at least if they last for more than 48 hours, and you need to consult a vet.Similarly, not going to the bathroom is also a problem.


Look for weight loss. Sudden weight loss can also be an issue. It may mean your lizard is not eating or drinking, and you need to talk to your vet.Keep an eye on other changes. Other changes that could be a sign your lizard is sick include a runny nose, eyes, or mouth, or it may have joints that swell up or have trouble shedding its skin. Alternatively, you may notice discolored skin or the fact that it's avoiding open spaces more., New lizards you bring into your home should be kept in a separate cage for at least a month. That way, if your new lizard has a disease, it won't give it to your other lizards.Always feed, water, and clean the cage of the quarantined lizard last to prevent infection of the other lizards.

, You should complete clean the cage once a week. However, you should check the cage every day to take out uneaten food, remove shed skin, and take out poop. You should also clean up any spills, as well as clean the food and water dishes.Place your reptile in another clean cage or container while you're cleaning out the cage once a week.Put gloves on. Take everything out of the cage. Throw away any liners, sand, or bedding you may have used.Clean and sterilize the water and food bowls. Wash in hot, soapy water. Use a disinfectant afterwards, but make sure to rinse it out thoroughly and then dry it.Wash out the cage. You may find this part easiest to do outside. Use hot water and soap to scrub down the cage. You can use a clean toothbrush to help you scrub if need be. Also, wash and clean any decorations the same way.Disinfect the cage. You can use one specifically built for reptile cages to help protect your pets, but still be sure to rinse thoroughly afterwards.Put in a new liner or sand, and replace everything else. Let everything dry well. If items will not dry easily, you may need to replace them from time to time.Keep reptile cleaning items separate from other cleaning items, and make sure to wash them out thoroughly after using. Don't forget to scrub your own hands at the end., A well-stocked cage can keep most lizards entertained, such as having enough rocks, branches, hollow areas, and even plants, depending on the lizard.You can also use live prey to provide enrichment, or you can hide your lizard's food throughout the enclosure to help give it something to do."
"
Ask yourself some questions: Before getting this lizard, you need to ask yourself some questions.,
Choose your uromastyx: There are a great deal of different uromastyx, but here is just a quick overview of the most popular (It is best that you get a captive bred specimen as wild caught carry parasites, will not eat, and are very unhappy):
Egyptian Uromastyx: These are the largest uromastyx, as they can get to three feet in length.",How to Care for Uromastyx Lizards," Do I have the time, money and knowledge to fully care for these lizards? Can I make these lizards happy in an artificial environment? Do I know what to do with the lizard on vacation? If you say no to any of these do not go forward with your purchase of a uromastyx. Uromastyx are not by any means easy to take care of. They require dedication and hard work. If you can meet all of these, then read on.;
, These large lizards are mostly colorless, with very fine scales. They are notable for their friendly personalities.

Mali Uromastyx: Malis are one of the most popular uromastyx. They have fairly good temperaments, and have a rather stunning black body and neon yellow back designs which grow brighter as the get warmer. These uros get to about 14–15 inches (35.6–38.1 cm) in length.

Ornate Uromastyx: The most beautiful of the lizards described here, these are the most expensive. They are also one of the most popular, and they sport a brilliant range of colors. They look very similar to the Ocellated Uromastyx, and their only feature that sets them apart are the enlarged, tooth-like scales (denticulate scales) at the middle of the row to the front of the ear opening.







Set up your cage: Uromastyx do require a lot of space and have a few special needs that might be hard to meet.







Caging: Uromastyx range from 12 inches (Ornate Uromastyx) to two or three feet (Egyptian Uromastyx). They need large cages. You could keep one Ornate in a 50 gallon (189.3 L) aquarium with a screen top that resists heat (these are available at most pet stores). For larger species such as the Egyptian, it would be a good idea to build your own cages, as finding a suitable sized cage is very difficult.

Substrate: The best substrate, arguably, is washed play sand (make sure to wash it very well). This is much cheaper than the ""Calci-sand"" that is specially made for lizards and is generally advised against due to it being a particularly high impaction risk. The calci-sand can clump up in the uro's system. It does little good at a well-enhanced risk. Uros should still be supplemented calcium depending on their weight to prevent MBD. Note that playsand can cause impaction in lizards under 7"" in length (read warnings for further info). For hatchlings and growing lizards it would be best to use newspaper. An alternative is birdseed, though you should not put more than 1"" of substrate in, as the lizard will flounder and won't be able to get purchase in the smooth birdseed. Make sure that sunflower seeds are excluded as these are sharp and can injure your lizard internally. Sand best emulates their natural burrowing habitat, and it is best to put 5"" of the stuff in the cage.

Heating and Lighting:You should use a heat lamp, ceramic bulb heater, and a UV light. Make sure that no heat source is able to come in direct contact with the lizard. Burns are not treatable and sometimes fatal. The hot end of the tank should be 120 °F (49 °C) and the cool end should be 80 degrees F (in the winter months this should be lowered a bit, probably around 100-110 degrees or less). Use a light that emits UV-A and UV-B (read the packaging carefully). At the night, all lights should turn off, and the temperature should drop to 65–70 °F (18–21 °C). Undertank heating pads are not the best heating source, as they do not heat the tank properly. Place temperature probes at both ends of the aquarium, or at all four sides if you have a square container.(Read warnings for more info about heating and light sources.)

Placement of objects: You should place your heating equipment at one end, so that there is a temperature gradient. This way the lizard can chose which temperature zone it wants to be in. You need a ""hide"" at each end. A hide is a little hutch or covered pit where the lizard can make itself at home. For cool end hides, bricks work well. For warm end hides, patio block make nice two level ""condos"" so that your lizard can bask on the surface, and then enjoy some shade in the caverns below. You also might want embed rocks in the sand so the lizard can perch on them. Remember to bury rocks all the way as Uromastyx's do like to dig. If they can burrow under the rock they might get stuck underneath; or worse, crushed.

Humidity: In a great deal of places in the world, humidity rises to unacceptable levels for uromastyx. Systems such as Central Air will dehumidify the air, but if you don't have one of these systems, a simple dehumidifier should do the trick. Remember to place temperature and humidity probes in the tank. Do not place water dishes in the tank, Uromastyx don't need standing water, and it will raise your humidity. The humidity level should be from 10% to 40%.


Feed your lizard properly.The best part about Uros is that they eat foods that can be picked up from the grocery store. Adult uros will eat a mix of dark leafy greens such as bok-choy, and spring salad mix. Remember to take out the dark stuff in the spring salad. Do not feed Uros Romaine or iceberg lettuce! Lettuce has very little nutritional value. Sprinkle Tortoise dust onto the food to supplement it, and mix in a sprinkling of juvenile iguana pellets. Feed once a day in a small bowl (remember to rinse it out). Hatchlings require a higher dose of protein than adults, so feed them a small amount of crickets every week. If you have a wild caught lizard that doesn't eat, you will need a veterinarian to force feed it (not quite as brutal as it sounds).






Keep the cage clean. If your lizard uses the restroom, then clean it up by scooping the poo and surrounding up with a meshed scooper or paper towel. Change the sand completely every one to two weeks. Your lizard should not urinate, as it only does this when extremely frightened. This depletes its natural stores of water, and can lead to dehydration.






Handle properly. The Uro can be held. When you handle your lizard, it's a good idea to wear light gloves. Uromastyx have spiky tails and sharp claws, and they will scamper madly up your arm if scared, leaving scratches. Make sure their feet are always touching a mostly even surface, otherwise they will panic. When you pick them up out of their cage, try to nudge the lizard onto your hand. Grabbing around the middle will scare the lizard and cause it to urinate, depleting its stores of water. Make a ""treadmill"" with your hands if they start to crawl. They seldom bite, and they do not have teeth so you should not worry too much.






(NOTE#2...They do have teeth and their bite do hurt. Egyptians even though they are very calm and don't get stressed easily can be very dangerous when you make them mad. Getting whipped by their tail will make you bleed and a bite will most likely end in stitches. These herps lived and thrived in an experiment filled with lions and several other large predators.

Build or buy your vivarium.,
Glue/position any permanent fixtures.,
Add a temperature gauge.,
Add branches.,
Add other climbing items.,
Provide plenty of nests.,
Include food and water dishes.,
Give them toys!,
Substrate and bedding.,
Include plants.",How to Furnish a Vivarium for Your Exotic Rodent," If money is not an issue you can buy a vivarium that is already set up for a rodent; however, these are not as enriching or large as others and many are incorrectly marketed as suitable for rats or degus. A 4 feet (1.2 m) Vivexotic Vivarium is a good choice for African Pygmy Dormice and the cheaper Exo Terra can be good for harvest mice, provided you get the larger size. You can also check this guide to building your own.;
, Since water and food bowls on the floor are at risk of being contaminated, you may want to add wooden ledges near the top of your enclosure. If so, make sure you spray a few coats of Plasticote or similar pet-friendly substance to make cleaning easier. You may also want to add some hooks or fasteners to the side of your vivarium to aid in hanging items.

, Some rodents must be kept at a certain temperature to avoid a state of torpor. Considering vivariums are built primarily for reptiles, you must also be careful that they do not overheat.

,


Reptile logs - these can be placed sideways in your tank or attached vertically. Some may have fake plants attached.
Parrot branches - these may have fastenings for barred cages that you can either remove or bury safely in substrate.
Natural - you can get fallen wood from your local forest. This must be fallen from the tree and completely dry. It must also fit in your oven, because you will need to bake at around 200 degrees for about 20 minutes to kill off any bacteria or fungi. Some keepers recommend you also strip the bark.

,


Cargo nets such as those made for rats and ferrets are very useful.
Parrot rope toys for hanging, some of which can be bent to suit your needs.
Wooden climbing frames and ladders. Choose the appropriate size for your rodent.
Sisal rope. This is an excellent way of attaching items and if thick enough, can provide great additional climbing material.
If using a tank, then you may need to hang items from the mesh lid. Although this may make opening the tank difficult, it will provide vital enrichment for your rodent.
If using a tank, you can attach items to the side if you put suckers on the glass.

, You must have at least as many nests as animals in your habitat. Rodents like a second exit hole, so don't be alarmed if your rodent chews an additional one. Be prepared to experiment, to find what is preferred. Some good suggestions include:


Grass nests as suitable for canaries and garden birds.
Fleecy hammocks, tubes and cubes. These are often sold with the second exit hole already to minimise chewing. They will be demolished eventually, but will last a surprisingly long time providing your rodents have other things they enjoy chewing.
Hollowed-out golf balls are great as nests for harvest mice.
Hollowed coconuts. These can either be hanging or the ones with the solid base can be placed on the floor.
Reptile caves and dens. These are not ideal as the sole nest, but provide good additional hiding places.
Terracotta plant pots are a good addition, as they provide a cool, shady area that is important for summer.
If given the right materials, harvest mice will construct their own nests.

, Remember to place them either on high ledges, or concealed under an items such as wooden play-stix. You will need several dishes to contain the seed mix, a good source of protein, insect food, and any nectar substitutes your rodents may need. The diet will vary by species.


Normal ceramic dishes. African Pygmy mice can drown in normal dishes, so make sure you leave a layer of pebbles or similar to allow them to climb out.
Hanging food dishes, such as those sold for garden birds.
Live cricket feeders. These allow a secure place to add live food to be released for your rodents, to encourage natural behaviour.
Hanging foods. You can add sprays of millet and monkey nuts in strings around your cage and hang from branches and hooks.

,


A solid-based silent spinner is a great addition. The smaller size is fine for African Pygmy Dormice and harvest mice, but Zebra mice will need the medium size.
Bendy wooden play-stix. These can be curved for hiding places or as sloping ladders.
Wooden see-saws, ladders and climbing frames. Check that these are the right size for your pet, so that they will not get trapped.
Tubes. Either solid or clear, these can be hung up or on the floor of the habitat. Clear tubes are particularly good as they allow your exotic rodent to feel more secure, while still allowing you to watch them play.

,


Use no sawdust, or pine- or cedar-based chips, as this can cause serious respiratory problems in rodents.
Something like megazorb, finacard, bedexcel or carefresh is ideal.
Add a layer of hay to provide vital concealment and for good chewing material.
Cotton pods are a great way of giving chewing material and also safe bedding for your exotic rodent to release and distribute.

, Some silk-based plants are safe for rodents, but be aware that they will chew them, so will need replacing every so often. These provide good concealment for your rodent and can also help your habitat look more natural.

, Before you obtain your little pet skunk, go to a local pet shop, preferably one that handles skunks as well. Find the right kind of food, a pet bed (they usually like fluffy beds or might even prefer to sleep in bed with you. If you are short on supplies, They will be fine with a box with towel or a dog crate), some toys, a litter box, and a food and water bowl.

Clean the cage as often as possible.,
Replace substrate and bedding frequently.,
Use a water bottle instead of a dish.,
Change any water in the tank every few days.,
Use fly screens.,
Ventilate the cage properly.",How to Keep Flies out of an Indoor Pet Cage1," Depending on the type of pet you have, and the type of food you feed your pet, you may need to clean the cage as frequently as once a week, or do a partial cleaning after feeding. For instance, if your pet eats fruit, remove any scraps or uneaten fruit as soon as they are finished eating.Flies, as well as other types of unwelcome critters, will be drawn to warm, wet parts of a cage in particular.
Be especially wary of any organic matter in the cage that might decompose, especially bits of food and plant material.
Use a natural cleaner in either spray or wipe form to fully clean every surface in the tank.;
, Your substrate may include mulch, soil, shredded paper, or a number of other materials that will readily soak up moisture and eventually begin to decompose. Whatever the substrate is, it needs to be replaced frequently. The specific type of substrate you use and pet you have will dictate the specific frequency with which the substrate needs to be changed, but stay on top of a consistent schedule.When replacing the substrate, remove everything from the cage and give it a deep cleaning with a safe, non-toxic cleaner. Take care the wipe down the corners and crevices at the bottom of the tank that bits of damp substrate may have nestled into.
Whenever you notice spoiled bedding or flooring, replace it. Get in the practice of replacing these materials before waste or moisture becomes prevalent.

, Dishes will allow for greater moisture to splash out and collect in the substrate and elsewhere in the tank, as well as a much greater likelihood that the water itself becomes an attraction to flies. If the type of pet you have allows for the use of a water bottle, do so. Of course, some caged pets will require bowls to lounge in and otherwise enjoy.Get a size-specific water-bottle for almost any furry cage pet from the pet store. These will most often be suspended on the side of your tank, to be easily access by both you and your pet.

, Whatever type of water feature or dispenser you use, be sure to change the water extremely often. Stale, stagnant water, can rapidly become an insect breeding ground, especially in warm environments. Further, provide your pet fresh water daily to ensure optimal health.With reptile tanks, which will likely be generally wetter and warmer than mammal tanks, be particularly conscious of the cleanliness of both the substrate and any mini bodies of water.

, Even if you have a screen-topped tank or a cage that allows small insects in and out, fly netting will still allow adequate ventilation while cutting down on flies’ ability to access the treasure trove that is your pet’s tank. Screens of this sort are especially important to consider when raising a rabbit in a cage of any type, as fly infestations can be fatal to rabbits., The buildup of ammonia from your pet’s waste will readily attract flies. Regular cleaning of the tank and replacement of the tank’s substrate will help you prevent the buildup of ammonia, but adequate ventilation is vital, as this will allow the ammonia that is inevitably present to be largely removed by circulating air.Keep the air in the room where you keep your pets moving with a ceiling or box fan.

"
"
Keep your pet’s food away from their cage.,
Keep doors and windows that don’t have screens closed.,
Regulate the temperature of the room.,
Don’t keep garbage in the same room.",How to Keep Flies out of an Indoor Pet Cage2," Especially if your pet eats fruit or veggies – or mammals, for that matter – keep these foods and the materials your use to prepare them away from your pet’s cage. Keep fruit in your kitchen, where you’ll be able to keep it fresh longer, and dispose of any fruit that you don’t refrigerate as soon as it shows signs of age.Be careful to remove and wash dishes with which you feed your pet a short time after feeding. This is somewhat dependent on the type of food you pet eats, but fruit in particular calls for cleaning later that same day.

, Flies are out there, lurking in the wild just beyond the walls of your home, and waiting for a chance to enter. Stay diligent about keeping access points closed from disallowing the entrance of flies into you and pet’s domain. Alternatively, if you prefer to have windows and doors open, keep your pet in a room that will always be sealed from the exterior, at least via entirely undamaged screens.

, In general, the cooler and drier you keep an indoor pet cage, the fewer flies you'll get. If it's especially warm in the room where you keep your pet, consider keeping the pet in a different room or doing what you can to cool the room where they live.

, It’s a well-known fact that flies are attracted to garbage. Keep garbage receptacles in different rooms, to prevent flies that are attracted by garbage from occupying your pet’s tank as well. Relatedly, dispose of fruit in particular by either bringing it outside or putting it in a garbage disposal."
"
Make a funnel trap.,
Make a fruit fly trap.,
Use commercial fly traps.",How to Keep Flies out of an Indoor Pet Cage3," For larger flies, such as house flies, paper funnel traps are surprisingly effective. To make one, use stiff paper to make a funnel that will sit within the rim of a jar you will use as your trap. Put a ½ an inch of water with a tablespoon or two of sugar into the bottle of the jar.Cut the tip of the paper cone so there’s a hole at the bottom of the paper funnel about one inch in diameter and place it in the jar, making sure that the tip of the funnel is not submerged or nearly submerged in the sugar water.
Flies will enter the funnel, but will be unable to easily leave. Dispose of them as you wish, while leaning towards the more permanent options.

, Put about 1"" of apple cider vinegar or balsamic vinegar in the bottom of a glass or jar. Add a couple of drops of liquid dish detergent and swirl to dissolve. Place glass just outside the pet cage overnight. Dispose of the liquid and captured flies and replace the trap if live flies are still present. Remove the trap once there are no longer flies in the cage


Similarly, you can simply put a ½ inch of beer or red wine in a bottle with a tall neck. A wine bottle is actually ideal. Flies will enter the bottle but struggle to leave, perhaps in part because they’ll be drunk., If the infestation persists, you can try using commercially available traps, many of which are also natural and chemical-free. Some even use color to help attract flies, and many simply use glue. Replace these traps as they fill up, and discontinue use only once they are no longer acquiring victims."

Learn how to handle your water dragon.,
Provide a proper diet.,
Groom your water dragon.,
Schedule regular exams with a veterinarian.,
Maintain water and humidity levels.,
Purchase proper lighting.,
Create the right temperature.,
Place a good substrate in the enclosure.,
Get a big enough container.,
Add some decorations.,
Keep up with cleaning the cage.,
Understand that water dragons can get big.,
Realize that a water dragon is a long term commitment.,
Read over some common health issues.",How to Take Care of a Chinese Water Dragon," Part of the fun of having a pet is handling it and enjoying its company. Handling your water dragon can be fun for both you and your pet, if done properly. As always, be gentle whenever handling your dragon, in addition to these other steps:Handle your dragon at a young age to ensure that it's accepting of being handled as an adult.
Work slowly when trying to handle your water dragon at first. It will need to get used to your presence before trusting you.
Don't force any interaction with your water dragon. Doing so will only cause your water dragon to distrust you.
Try hand feeding your dragon first, inside the cage. Once it accepts food from your hand, you can try to remove it from its container.
Never pick up a water dragon by its tail.;
, Your water dragon will need a diet that suits its nutritional needs and matches what it would eat in the wild. The diet will consist mainly of insects, of various types, and some vegetables and fruit. This diet will help keep it healthy, strong, and happy.The main elements of the diet include crickets and mealworms. However, these tend to be low in calcium in captivity and need to be dusted with calcium powder immediately prior to feeding to the water dragon, to ensure that the dragon gets enough calcium in the diet for healthy bones.
Waxworms are also an option, however, they are high in fat and should be offered sparsely.
Dark green vegetables, such as kale, collard, mustard, and dandelion leaves can be a great addition to your dragon's diet.
Some fruits can be included as well. Try feeding your water dragon bananas, cantaloupe, or strawberries.
Large adult water dragons can eat earthworms, pinkie mice, or small feeder fish.
Young dragons should be fed daily.
Adult water dragons should be fed once every three days.

, Your water dragon won't require much grooming, however, there are some things you can do to keep your water dragon clean and happy. The two main areas of grooming that you will focus on involve the nails and bathing of your dragon.Keep an eye on your water dragons nails. If you notice the nails getting long, they can be trimmed. Keeping them short will make handling the dragon more comfortable.
Find someone who can show you how to trim your dragons nails in person, as it is difficult for a beginner to do without seriously harming the water dragon.Allow your water dragon to soak in water regularly. This can help prevent constipation as well as keep it clean.

, As with all pets, scheduling a regular exam with your veterinarian is a critical part of maintaining that pet's health. Find a local veterinarian that works with reptiles and ask them about setting up appointments to examine your Chinese water dragon.Young dragons, under the age of four, should be checked at least once annually.
Older water dragons, over four years, should be examined twice yearly.

, Water dragons need adequate levels of both standing water and humidity in its environment. Both water and humidity levels must be maintained properly to ensure the longevity and health of your water dragon.Humidity should be kept at around 80% in the water dragon's container. You can find a device to measure humidity levels at any pet store.Drip machines are available to maintain humidity. Spray bottles and waterfalls will work as well.
Water should be made available in large containers. These containers should allow your water dragon easy access. Make sure that your dragon can get out of the water containers when it wants, without trouble.

, Providing the right amount and type of lighting is important to help keep your water dragon in a good state of health and well-being. Like other reptiles, water dragons are cold blooded, and need external heat to regulate its body temperature. Water dragons are also diurnal, and need light to know if it is night or daytime.For the main, daytime lighting, use incandescent lighting. These will provide white light as well as heat.
Lights in the enclosure should be turned off at night. Make sure however, that the temperature is maintained at around 75-79°F.
Water dragons need exposure to ultraviolet light. During the day, the sun will provide this, however, UV light cannot penetrate glass. Place your water dragons in a secure mesh container to allow the UV light to reach it.
Never place a glass container in direct sunlight as this may cause deadly temperatures.
There are specialized black lights that emit the necessary band of UV light. These black lights are not the typical black light, instead, they are found in stores that specialize in reptile care. Make sure the reptile can stand withing 8 - 10 inches of the lamp in order to benefit from the UV as it doesn't transmit much further than this and the beneficial levels drop off. Change the UV bulb every 6 months as the UV emission degrades after this time.

, Lights in the cage will be the main source of heat in the enclosure, but you may add additional, more area specific, heating implements. Keeping the temperature in the cage regulated is critical to maintaining the health of your water dragon.Temperatures in the cage, during the day, should be kept at around 84-88°F. Night temperatures should be lowered down to 75-79°F
You should also provide a secondary heating source, such as a well secured basking light. The temperature under the light should reach around 90-95°F.

, You will need some organic material to cover the bottom of your water dragons enclosure. Water dragons need a specific kind of substrate that best mimics its natural environment.Ideally, you will want a substrate that is affordable and easily cleaned or replaced.
Newspaper or Astroturf are common substrates.
A mixture of sand and peat is also recommended, although difficult to clean. If you do use sand, purchase special fine grade sand marked as safe for reptile use on the packaging. Otherwise, if ingested, it can cause serious bowl blockages.
Avoid cedar shavings, wood shavings, gravel, potting soil, or cat litter if they contain vermiculite, pesticides, or fertilizer.

, The size of your water dragon's enclosure will need to be big enough to allow your water dragon to move and live in comfortably. A cage that is too small may present a health hazard for your water dragon.Generally, the enclosure should be as high as it is long. The width should be half the hight.
Water dragons can grow to a large size. For an adult water dragon you will need to have a cage of around 6' long, 6' tall, and 3' wide.

, You will want to keep your water dragons enclosure an interesting and safe place. In the wild, water dragons want to climb and explore. Recreating the natural environment will allow your water dragon to feel comfortable in its new home.Provide branches for your water dragon to climb on. Avoid any wood types that are sticky or exude sap.
Give your water dragon a safe place to hide. This can be as simple as a cardboard box. Provide many hiding spots in the enclosure.
Place plants within the water dragons environment. Make sure the plants are non-toxic to your water dragon, such as hibiscus or staghorn ferns.
Be aware of the soil that the plants are grown in as well, avoiding any that contain vermiculite, pesticides, or fertilizer.

, As with any animal kept in captivity, cleaning the enclosure and maintaining proper hygiene will help keep both you and your pet in good health. Keeping a good schedule when it comes to cleaning the cage will make it easier to remember this important task.Always wear gloves when cleaning the cage.
Remove feces, skin sheds, leftover food, and water spills daily.
Clean food and water bowls daily.
An entire cage cleaning should be done weekly.
Rocks should be cleaned and boiled for around thirty minutes.
Branches should cleaned and then heated in an oven at 200°F for around 30 minutes.

, Water dragons can grow quite large, and you should feel comfortable handling a large lizard. You will also need the right amount of space to dedicate to an enclosure that will comfortably house your new water dragon.Adult males will grow to about 3 feet in length.
Adult females will reach around 2 feet in length.

, Water dragons can live up to fifteen years in captivity. Caring for a water dragon is a commitment that you should be prepared for. Do not acquire a water dragon if you do not feel like you can commit this amount of time to caring for one., If well cared for, your water dragon should enjoy a long and healthy life. However, you should be observant for any health issues that may arise over the course of your water dragon's life. Visit with your veterinarian regularly to catch some of the more common health issues with water dragons.Lack of calcium or underexposure to UV light can cause metabolic bone disease. This will have the symptom of weakness in the legs or jaw.
Your water dragon may cause abrasions to its own face by bumping into the walls of the enclosure.
Overfeeding will cause obesity in your water dragon.
Injuries or other illnesses may occur at any time. Always monitor your water dragons behaviour to alert you to possible health issues.

Make sure to get a big cage.,
Give your degu hiding areas.,
Provide perches and ledges.,
Clean your degu's cage regularly.,
Mix guinea pig and chinchilla pellets.,
Supplement their diet with vegetables.,
Ask your vet about vitamin supplements.,
Avoid treats containing sugar.,
Allow degus to play outside their enclosure.,
Make sure your degu exercises.,
Respect your degu's personal space.,
Supervise your degu at all times.,
Keep more than one degu.",How to Keep a Degu," Degus need a lot of space to be healthy and happy. They are very active animals and will not do well in a smaller cage. Opt for the biggest and largest cage you can fit in your apartment.As degus are not a popular pet, you may not be able to find a cage specifically designed for degus. However, you can get a cage for a chinchilla or another rodent.You should also make sure the cage doesn't have any plastic parts. Degus will chew through plastic. A metal cage, or a cage made with chew-proof plastic, is best for a degu.;
, Degus are social, but they also need some privacy during the day. You should have a lot of boxes your degus can hide in if they crave privacy.You can make a hiding place using a cardboard box or a large cardboard tube. You can simply place a box or tube in the cage for your degu to hide in.
You can also buy hiding boxes and toy caves at a local pet store. Make sure, however, all the materials used are safe for animals the size of degus.

, Degus love to climb, so make sure the cage has perches and ledges to keep your degu active during the day. You can buy bird perches and ledges at a local pet store and install them in your degu's cage. You can also install hammocks, but be careful to supervise your degu when it's using the hammock. Degus will chew through rope-like materials, so remove the hammock from the cage when you're not around., In order to stay healthy, degus need their cages clean. Your degu will spend most of its life in its cage, so make sure to clean it regularly to keep the cage free of bacteria.You should clean the cage out once a week, removing any droppings, spilled food, or other debris from the bottom of the cage. You should also remove any old bedding and replace it with new bedding.
You should also wipe down things like toys and food and water bowls. If a food or water bowl is very dirty, remove it and clean it with soap and water before returning it to the cage.
You should also change the bedding when you clean the cage. A degu's cage should be lined with a layer of bedding from a pet store. You should remove all the bedding once a week and replace it with new, fresh bedding.

, You may not be able to find food specifically made for degus. You can mix guinea pig pellets and chinchilla pellets and feed this to your degu as the primary form of food.Degus cannot process sugar or carbohydrates, so make sure you choose pellets that do not contain molasses.

, Degus enjoy sweet potatoes, dandelions, and leafy vegetables. They also eat a lot of hay, so they should have a continuous supply of hay in their cages.If you feed your degu potatoes, make sure to remove the skins. Potato skin can be toxic for degus.
As degus cannot process sugar, fruit and dried fruit are not good treats for a degu., If you're worried about your degu getting the right vitamins and nutrients, talk to your vet about supplements. As you may not be able to find food specifically made for degus, supplements may be necessary to keep your degu healthy.Make sure you find a vet that knows how to treat small animals like degus.

, Degus cannot process sugar. If you give your degu sweet treats, stick to fresh fruit. Anything with sugar can be very harmful to a degu, so do not purchase treats containing sugar.You should also stay away from treats that are high in fat or contain honey.

, While degus will be in their cages for most of their lives, they are social and active animals. You need to give your degu time out of its cage on occasion to keep it happy and entertained.Degus enjoy fresh air and sunshine, so play with your degu next to a window. Avoid taking a degu directly outside, as degus can escape easily and are hard to catch.
Give your degu some time out of the cage at least once a day.

, Your degu needs the chance to exercise during the day, even when its not out of the cage. Make sure your degu has access to an exercise wheel. No degu should be kept in a cage without a wheel. The perches and ledges in a cage will also allow a degu to exercise, as they can jump and climb.A metal exercise wheel that's at least 11 to 12 inches across is best for a degu.

, Degus do like to socialize with their owners. However, degus do not like to be held or cuddled. Allow your degu to come to you, and limit the amount of time you spend holding it.If you just got your degu, give it a few days to settle in before you attempt to hold or cuddle it.

, When your degu is out of the cage, do not let it out of your site. Degus can escape easily and, due to their size, are not easy to catch. You also want to make sure your degu does not get hurt when playing outside of the cage.Keep your degu away from wooden furniture, cables, and plants.

, It's a bad idea to keep a single degu. Degus are social animals and do not do well as single pets. You should have at least two degus at a time. However, degus generally do well in larger groups. Consider adopting three to four degus instead of just one."
"
When you get pet lemmings, it is a good idea to get two of the same sex.,
It is vitally important that you get the cage for your lemmings before you get the pets themselves.,
Make sure that you have sufficient bedding and toys for your new pet lemmings to play with.,
This is the difficult bit – the pet lemming’s diet.",How to Care for Pet Lemmings," They are sociable creatures although they do tend to play fight a lot, which can be scary to watch at first but you will soon get used to them running around, fighting over which one gets to play on the toys. Two females are the better option here as two males will tend to fight more often and occasionally, it can get nasty.;
, Two lemmings will happily gnaw through the cardboard box the pet shop provides them in, in about an hour and unless you want to be searching endlessly around your home for the fast little critters, make sure that everything is ready so that you can pop them in the cage as soon as you get home. The cage itself needs to be big enough for them to run around in happily, ideally a tank with a well ventilated lid as they do need a minimum of 6 inches (15.2 cm) of a decent substrate to burrow in.

, Toilet roll tubes are great because they can munch their way through them as well as running in and out of them and this makes for cheap lemming entertainment. Small houses and rodent hammocks also provide hours of fun but they will be destroyed fairly quickly. You should provide the lemmings with a small empty, clean box for them to make a nest in but make sure that there are two exits from the box because they do have a tendency to get a bit territorial. All of that plus at least one wheel for exercise (one wheel for every two lemmings is better as they do tend to squabble over who gets to use it) and your lemmings will be more than happy.

, They are naturally sugar intolerant creatures so you cannot feed them hamster and other types of rodent food that you get from a pet store. Most large stores will be able to provide you with specific lemming food. Degu food is a very good alternative as these do not contain added sugars and, when mixed with millet and alfafa hay, it provides complete nutrition. You cannot feed your pet lemmings fruit or anything that naturally contains sugar as this will make them rather ill.

Identify whether or not you really have a chipmunk.,
Buy a small wooden platform and place it on your yard.,
Pour a generous amount of food onto the wood platform.,
Every week ""sweeten"" your pile with some fruits.,
Refresh the pile.,
Enjoy your chipmunks.",How to Attract Chipmunks to Your Yard," You might just have a mouse, rat, squirrel, or woodchuck. You may not want to feed an animal that is not a chipmunk.;
, The platform should be just large enough to pour a pile of food on it.

, A chipmunk's diet consists of seeds, nuts, grains, fruit, and buds. So a good attractant for chipmunks would be some kind of grain, seed, or nut. Start out with corn mixed with sunflower seeds and peanuts.

, Peaches, apples, and oranges are some examples on what to sweeten your pile with.

, Every time the chipmunks eat all the food or every week refill the pile. Try out different baits.

, Now chipmunks will be all over that pile of food. Watch and enjoy.

Be calm when approaching the bearded dragon.,
Avoid getting bitten.,
Don't pick up a bearded dragon when it is upset.,
Be persistent when holding the bearded dragon.,
Be gentle when setting the bearded dragon down.,
Be patient.,
Place the bearded dragon's cage in a central place in your home.,
Work on taming your bearded dragon every day.",How to Tame a Bearded Dragon," Talk in a low gentle voice. When you attempt to capture it, bring your hand in from the side, not from the top. A top hand approach will scare the dragon, as this is like a predator swooping over its head.There is no doubt that the dragon will run from you when you are trying to catch it, no matter what you do, but gently scoop it up.;
, Keep in mind that a bearded dragon has powerful jaws designed for crushing tough food. The bearded dragon will probably try to bite you, so keep its head between your fingers so it can’t turn to bite you.


You may want to keep the first few handling sessions inside the cage so you don’t accidentally drop a squirmy dragon and lose it in the house.
If you are unsure of the character of the bearded dragon you are picking up, you may want to wear gloves the first time you pick it up.
While a bearded dragon's jaws are capable of biting down to the bone of a finger, keep in mind that bearded dragons are not inherently aggressive animals. They would rather be left alone in peace than attack.

, One sign that a bearded dragon is cross is that it puffs up its beard and it turns black.Try to talk calmly to the bearded dragon until it calms down, which is indicated by the black color dissipating.


Try giving the bearded dragon a treat to calm it down. This can channel the dragon's aggression onto something other than you., You need to get your dragon used to handling, so gently holding onto it while it squirms is part of the process. Basically don’t let your bearded dragon escape when you are holding it, unless it gets very aggressive and tries to bite you. Ideally, you shouldn't let your bearded dragon down until it has stopped squirming.When you hold it, try stroking its head and talking softly to it. It will probably close its eyes and calm down.

, This is important to remember, even if it is squirming while you do. Do not drop it back into the cage. Rather put your hand on the cage bottom and let it go on the ground.


Make all your moves deliberate and calm, even when you are trying to catch your dragon.

, The taming process will take time. You need to get your bearded dragon used to you and you will also need to learn its habits and preferences.

, Don't physically isolate the bearded dragon by sticking its cage in an unused portion of the house. While you don’t want to subject the bearded dragon to too much noise and activity, having it out where it can be a part of the household buzz will get it used to having humans around.Consider placing the cage in your living room if it is not to loud or busy. If your dining room is near the action of the house, but not constantly in chaos, then that might be a good location for your bearded dragon's cage.

, Set aside half an hour or more of time every day to handle your bearded dragon. This will help it get used to being handled.


While you can break up training sessions into shorter 15 minute sections, make sure that you spend at minimum a half an hour a day handling your bearded dragon.

Consider a reptile hammock.",How to Set Up a Vivarium for a Bearded Dragon," You can buy your vivarium from a pet store. You can also check online sellers and auction sites, like eBay. There are glass, PVC, Melamine, ABS, and vision cages to choose from.


A traditional vivarium has wooden sides with a sliding glass frontage. This model is highly recommended.
Fish tanks can work, but they are far from ideal. You have to be careful with tanks that open overhead because bearded dragons can get scared if you hover above them. You will have to acclimate your pet to you by placing your hand inside the tank opposite of your bearded dragon and moving it towards the pet. They are thermally inefficient and lose heat quickly.;
, The minimum length for a vivarium is four foot. The dimensions of a typical vivarium are four feet long x three feet high x two feet deep.


Bearded dragons are largely ground dwelling but love to climb over low branches, so a long vivarium offers the dragon a chance to wander around and climb over branches provided as part of the vivarium furniture.Though some sources may say that juvenile bearded dragons may get lost in large, four feet vivariums, most people believe this is false since they are not limited to small habitats in the wild., Keep the vivarium out of direct sunlight. Too much sunlight can make controlling the temperatures in the vivarium hard. The vivarium also needs to be in a quiet place.Loud noises may cause stress on your bearded dragon.

, You need to get the temperature and lighting correct before putting your bearded dragon into the vivarium. The temperatures need to stabilize before you put the bearded dragon inside. If you don’t get the heat and lighting correct, you could hurt your pet. Set up the vivarium about a week before you plan to place the bearded dragon into his habitat., You will need two lights, a long tube light with UVA and UVB and a basking light. The first light will be full spectrum and provide your pet with UVA and UVB rays. This bulb will span most of the tank, but make sure to leave enough room on the other end for a basking light. On one end, install a bulb for basking. Your bearded dragon needs light for 12 to 14 hours a day.Bearded dragons must have a good source of UVB light in order to metabolize calcium and reduce the risk of having weak bones as a result of metabolic bone disease (MBD). You can either choose a separate UVB light and heat source, or a combined array. The latter are more expensive, but great in a confined space. Most commercial vivariums come set up to take a separate UVB fluorescent tube, plus a heat source., UVB bulbs range from 5% – 12%, with the more powerful bulbs providing more UVB, which is preferable for adult dragons. The 5% bulbs are appropriate for juveniles.Make sure the dragon spends most of his time within a 12 inch range of the UV tube, since there is a significant drop off in penetration after this distance, and the dragon receives limited benefit.Also, the UVB emission degrades after about six months of use, so either change the bulbs every six months, or take the bulb to a reptile specialist center with a device capable of reading the UVB output to make sure the lamp is still effective., The vivarium should have two heat sources: a basking spot heat lamp that provides the vivarium's general heat along with the hot spot to bask in, plus a low-level heater to provide heat at the cool end or at night in places where the ambient temperature drops below 75 °F (23.9 °C).The heat lamp should be mounted at one end of the vivarium, out of reach of the dragon, and provide a basking spot temperature of around 95 °F (35 °C). The ambient heat should be placed at the cool end and only needs to have moderate heat output sufficient to prevent the cool end falling below 85 °F (29.4 °C).This heat could either be a wall mounted heat pad or a black ceramic light.
To mount the lights, you can purchase lamp fittings or brackets from a pet store or an online store.

, To monitor the temperatures and the gradient in the vivarium, you need two thermometers, one at either end. The most basic thermometers are simple circular dials that point to the temperature.


For an optimum environment, it helps to put both the heat lamp and the auxiliary heater on separate thermostats (set to 95 °F or 35 °C at the warm end and 75 °F or 23.9 °C at the cool end) so the heaters automatically click on and off to maintain a steady environmental temperature.To install the thermometer, you can purchase fittings or brackets from a pet store or an online store.

, The vivarium needs to have low humidity because bearded dragons are from low humidity climates. Make sure there is a screen somewhere that allows airflow, and that will help keep the humidity from getting too high.To install the humidity gauge, you can purchase fittings or brackets from a pet store or an online store. Follow the included instructions for installation.

, There are many products available to put in the bottom of the vivarium, but for various reasons many of those products labeled as suitable for vivarium are not actually safe. The risks are mainly those of gut impaction (if the bearded dragon scoops up some of the substrate when eating, and swallows it, it can form a blockage in the bowel), and toxicity (some of the products, especially wood shavings, contain oils that are potentially toxic to bearded dragons.) Don’t use any sand-based substrates. These are not digestible so when swallowed are likely to form a plug in the gut, which could prove fatal. Also avoid any pine or cedar shavings as the natural oils in these can be toxic.

, For young bearded dragons, you can use reptile carpet, paper towels, newspaper, butcher paper, or non-smooth tile. The tile should not be smooth but have some grip so the bearded dragon can run across and not slide. When the bearded dragon becomes an adult, you can leave those things in the floor, or you can use silicone-free play sand that has been sifted.You can also use Repti-carpet, which is a tough type of felt-carpeting designed for use in vivarium. This is washable, so when the dragon soils it, you can remove the whole carpet and put in a spare. This does mean you need at least two pieces for an adult that poops once a week. However, this may not be practical for a juvenile which may poop a couple of times a day., A different flooring you can use is aspen shavings. These are a natural product and free from toxic oils. This is visually more appealing than newspaper, and lets the dragon dig if he wants to. However, you need to be careful the aspen doesn't get moist from spilt water, as the high temperature in the vivarium can encourage mold growths that are unhealthy for the dragon., Hides are commonly ceramic and made to resemble a rock, cork, or bark. These have the ability to absorb some of the vivarium heat, which makes it a cozy retreat for the dragon. The hide should be big enough for the adult dragon to fit comfortably inside and be able to turn around., You need to provide a basking spot, which is a place the dragon can climb up to get closer to the heat source when he wants to warm up quickly. This could be something as simple as placing the warm end hide under the heat lamp, so the dragon can climb on top to bask if he wishes.You can also arrange tree branches in a position to allow the dragon to climb up to be near the heat source.
Always make sure the dragon is at least six inches from the heat source. Direct contact will cause serious burns. In addition, if the heat lamp bulb is exposed within the vivarium, enclose it in a safety cage so the dragon is not able to directly contact the hot bulb., Your pet needs to be able to eat and drink comfortably in his vivarium. Put in a large, ceramic water bowl with a low lip so the dragon can drink if he chooses. Also get a large ceramic bowl in which to place vegetables or live food as appropriate for your dragon.

, You can add extra things in the vivarium to improve your dragon's quality of life. Other furniture you can add to the vivarium includes sturdy sand-blasted and sterilized branches. This means they are free from parasites and bacteria which could potentially grow in the warmth of the vivarium. Arrange the branches so they are on a gentle upward incline, to allow the dragon to climb if he wants., Plastic imitation plants give the illusion of greenery to the vivarium. Don’t put live plants in the vivarium; keeping them is very difficult. Live plants will wilt because of the heat, and watering the plants increases the humidity, which encourages mold. Plastic imitation plants look great and are easy to deal with.

, In addition to plants, the hide, and a branch, you can place additional logs, bamboo shoots, and rocks in the tank. You can even build a rock structure. This will give him more things to walk through and make it nicer for you to look at., If you have a glass tank, get a tank background to place on the back of the tank. It helps make your pet feel more secure than a blank spot. Plus, it will be nice to look at for you and your family., You can buy reptile hammocks for your bearded dragon. Dragons seem to really like hammocks. This will give him a place to lay and enjoy himself."

Place a water bowl in the cage.,
Add juice to the bowl.,
Repeat the process until your dragon drinks.,
Replace the juice and water mixture with water.",How to Teach a Bearded Dragon to Drink from a Water Bowl1," You can buy a water bowl from your local pet store or make one yourself. Bearded dragons sometimes like to take baths in their water bowls, so make sure that it’s large enough for that.The water bowl should have sides that are low enough for the bearded dragon to be able to get into and out of the the water dish.
If making your own bowl, you can use the plastic container from a frozen dinner, which is the perfect size.;
, Once you’ve filled the bowl with water, add something that will entice the dragon to drink from it. Good choices are natural fruit juices, such as apple or pear juice. Add just enough juice to flavor the water and make it tasty.Make sure the juice is 100% juice and doesn’t have added sugars or artificial ingredients.
You can experiment with different juices if the dragon doesn’t seem to like your first choice.

, The sweet smell of the juice should lure the dragon to the water bowl. If it doesn’t, you can try adding a bit more juice to make the smell stronger.Make sure to replace the water and juice regularly, as dragons may defecate into the water even if they haven’t drunk from it.
Replace with a juice and water mixture after cleaning the water dish if the dragon still hasn’t drank from it.

, Once the dragon has realized that it can satisfy its thirst with the bowl, it will know to go there when it’s thirsty. From now on you can fill the bowl up with only water.Keep an eye on your dragon to make sure that it is in fact drinking.
Bearded dragons don’t need very much water, so it may be hard to catch them drinking.
A bearded dragon's water dish needs to be cleaned everyday, since they will often defecate in their bowls.

Give your dragon a water bowl.,
Fill a spray bottle with water.,
Spray the mist on the dragon’s bowl.,
Repeat until the dragon will drink on its own.",How to Teach a Bearded Dragon to Drink from a Water Bowl2," Water bowls are available from local pet stores and reptile shops. You can also make one yourself from a recycled plastic container, if you want. Fill the water bowl with water up to the dragon's elbow height.Bearded dragons often like to bathe in their water bowls. Make sure the sides are low enough that the dragon can get in and out of it.
Frozen dinner containers make great water bowls for bearded dragons.

, This can be any kind of plastic spray bottle. Fill it up with water that is room temperature. It should not be hot or cold to the touch.Make sure the water bottle is completely clean and doesn’t have residue from anything else, such as cleaning solutions. This can be dangerous for the dragon.

, Reach into the cage and spray a mist directly over the bowl. This will create a sort of rain effect. The dragon will see that it is raining into a pool.Humidity is important for the dragon for proper shedding, especially in the winter.
Use the mist function on the spray bottle, rather than the narrow stream.

, Do this each day until you have noticed the dragon drinking water on its own. Once the dragon understands that the water bowl is for drinking, it will now go there without you needing to spray water on it.Bearded dragons may defecate in their water bowls, so it's very important to clean their bowls everyday so they don't get sick."

Make sure your water bowl is the right size.,
Pick up your dragon.,
Place the dragon in the bowl.,
Sprinkle water on the dragon if necessary.,
Clean your dragon if necessary.",How to Teach a Bearded Dragon to Drink from a Water Bowl3," This is extremely important. If the dragon’s water bowl is not big enough, it will not recognize the bowl as something that it can bathe in. Make sure the bowl is full of fresh, clean water.A dish from a frozen dinner is the perfect size for a bearded dragon to bathe in. It's also easy for the dragon to get in and out of.
You can buy special reptile water bowls at your local pet store.
Fill the bowl with water up to the dragons elbows.

, To pick up your dragon, place your hand under its abdomen and simply scoop it up. Curve your fingers around its abdomen so that it feels secure.Be gentle and move slowly, remembering that you’re much larger than your dragon.

, Slowly place the dragon into the bowl of water. It should be willing to lie in the water and enjoy the feeling of getting a bath.Make sure the water is not hot or cold to the touch.
You can put a piece of cloth on the bottom of the bowl for traction. This can comfort dragons who are uneasy about baths.

, Your dragon may still not understand that the bath water is also for drinking. Splash a little bit of water from the pool onto its nose and head. The dragon may drink some of this water if it’s thirsty.Repeat this step if necessary. Ideally, the dragon will see the water being splashed from the bowl and will associate the moving water with the pool.

, If your dragon is dirty or has feces on its body, let the dragon soak for 10-15 minutes and then scrub it gently with a soft bristled tooth brush.Dry the dragon off thoroughly after the bath.
Clean the water bowl very well each day. Many dragons will defecate in standing water, and drinking from this dirty water can be bad for their health."

Give your lizard time to acclimate to its surroundings.,
Feed the lizard by hand.,
Interact with the lizard regularly.,
Limit your expectations.,
Wait for the lizard to approach you.,
Use gentle handling.,
Watch for signs of comfort.,
Wash your hands after handling.",How to Tame a Green Anole," When you get a new green anole, you should not try to handle it right away. Give it a few weeks to get used to its new surroundings before attempting to pick it up.Allowing your lizard to get used to its surroundings will minimize the animal's stress and fear when you do try to pick it up.;
, In order to get a green anole lizard used to you, begin feeding it by hand. Provide crickets, meal worms, or store-bought maggots and roaches to the lizard. You can even feed it grasshoppers or other wild insects that you catch yourself. This will show the lizard that you are not to be feared and that you will supply it with the food that it needs.It may take some time for the lizard to take the food directly from your hands. Offer it, and if the lizard doesn't take it, release the food into your lizard's tank for it to eat on its own.

, Spend time interacting with your green anole daily so it can get to know you. This will make it feel safer and more willing to be handled. After a period of normal interactions, such as feedings and cleaning its tank, your green anole should get used to you and allow you to touch it.Try to pet the lizard gently on the head to check if it approaches you. Be warned, however, that the green anole may try to bite you when you first start interacting with it.

, Most green anoles can typically become comfortable enough with a person to be fed by hand or held. However, it is very rare that they can be taught to do tricks or follow commands. Getting it to sit on your hand or shoulder will be a great achievement.Focus on increasing your lizard's general comfort with you, instead of trying to get it to follow your commands or to do tricks.

, Because green anoles are delicate lizards that can be injured by rough handling, it's important that you let it come to you instead of grabbing it up roughly. This can take some time, as the lizard may be fearful of you.Make sure your anole is in a friendly mood when you try to pick it up. If you have a friendly, loving anole, then you can interact with it often. If not, leave it alone.

, If you want to get a firm hold on the lizard without it getting injured, put your thumb on its stomach and your pointer finger on its back. It will likely wiggle, but don't hold the lizard to firmly. A firm hold can injure the lizard greatly.Because green anoles are delicate lizards, you should supervise children who handle them. Without supervision, a child could inadvertently injure your lizard.

, The anole's eyes will begin to close if it is comfortable on your hand. If it is a male, its throat flap will fold back up and it's mouth will close. This is a sign that it's a good time for you to hold it without it biting you.


A male anole that it puffing up its throat may be showing you that it thinks you are a threat. If your lizard it doing this, don't try to pick it up., Lizards can carry a bacteria, viruses, or fungus on their skin, such as salmonella. This can be hazardous to humans, so it is important to wash your hands after handling them. Use antibacterial soap and hot water to make sure that your hands are thoroughly cleaned.You can also wear gloves when handling a green anole to protect your hands and to keep germs off of you.

Pinpoint the room it’s in.,
Narrow down and close off the escape routes.,
Approach your lizard silently and slowly.,
Spray the lizard with a mist of cold water to slow it down.",How to Catch a Lizard without Using Your Hands1," If the little critter is an unwanted guest in your house, knowing the room you see it in most often will help you catch it. Hopefully it’s the same room every time. As they’re creatures of habit, you could even get lucky enough to spot it in the same part of the room each time.


Scope out the room for the cracks/crevices it could be coming in and out of. Catching it could require closing those while it’s loose in the room.;
, Then you need to get yourself a bucket (or box) and a long stick – at least 3 feet long. Make sure the stick is not pointed.Use multiple buckets (or boxes). Set up a blanket or three to block the escape routes between your buckets. Increasing the odds can only help your cause.
Place the bucket(s) where you want the lizard to escape. Your best bet is to put them where the lizard has been previously escaping.
Draw or paint a crack on the bottom of the bucket. As lizards love to hide in cracks, if it thinks it sees one it will be more likely to head there. Use a Sharpie or paint if you choose to draw/paint one.
Be sure to dry the ink/paint. You want all chemical smells to dissipate as much as possible. You can even give it a light washing to help make it safer and less likely to cause the lizard to run away from it.

, If you scare it, the whole process can get infinitely harder.


Wear only socks. This way there’s no danger of a squeaky shoe, the click of a heel, etc.

, Now use your stick to gently guide it into the bucket.


Do not touch the lizard with your stick. You not only don’t want to hurt the little critter but it also won’t take much to get him running.
Adjust to your lizard’s behavior. If it’s still not moving after you spray it with cold water, you can also gently place a bucket over it. Use a Manila envelope and slide it gently under the bucket to seal it. Then slowly turn the bucket over, keeping the Manila envelope securely over the bucket’s opening.
Use your stick to tip the bucket upright. If your lizard runs quickly into a bucket, don’t waste time getting to the bucket to use your hand. This could be the difference between a captured lizard and a lizard once again on the loose.

Build a cricket sanctuary.,
Gut-load live prey.,
Dust the prey.,
Feed an anole daily or every other day.,
Serve meals during the day.,
Set the crickets loose.,
Place worms in shallow saucers.,
Keep an eye on the prey.",How to Feed an Anole Green Lizard," Anoles are insectivores, and crickets and other insects make up a large portion of an anole’s diet. Crickets are the most common meal for an anole, but it is important to provide a variety of live prey, including small mealworms, small roaches, fruit files, and other small insects to ensure that your green friend has a well-rounded diet.Visit your local pet store or order online to stock your anole’s food pantry.


Wild-caught, pesticide-free insects can be fed to your anole as well.
Avoid feeding your anole superworms or king worms. The mandibles in these worms can cause injury to an anole.;
, Be sure that the insects are no larger than the anole’s head so they are easy for the anole to catch and digest., Using a spray bottle, mist the inside walls and the plants in the anole’s terrarium. Anoles often lap up dew on plant leaves. Some will lap up water in a shallow dish.

If you place a water dish in the enclosure, be sure that it is shallow dish and that a plant stem or branch is placed in the water so the anole can escape from the dish if need be., Crickets are the most common lizard meal. Since anoles eat live prey, it is necessary to care for the crickets and provide them with a healthy habitat. House the crickets in a plastic, well-ventilated container and place an empty egg crate or paper towel rolls in the container so that the crickets do not smother one other.Keep the cricket container in a dry place and be sure that it is in darkness for at least 8 hours per day.Place eggs crates or paper towel rolls vertically in the enclosure so that the crickets have tall structures to climb.
Remove dead crickets as soon as possible. Crickets will, at times, eat the dead, which can lead to disease., You are what you eat, and the same is true for anoles! Gut-loading describes the process of feeding your crickets and other live prey foods rich in protein, vitamins, and other nutrients so your pet will reap the benefits.

Dry foods such as oats, mixed seeds and nuts, wheat bran, alfalfa, and fish food are great staples for a cricket’s diet.
Be sure to provide chopped fresh greens and finely chopped potatoes and carrots to ensure a healthy cricket diet.
Apples and oranges are great for hydration. Place a few chopped pieces of these fruits to avoid dehydration and cricket cannibalism., To guarantee that the anoles are getting the proper nutrients, dust live prey with a supplement powder that contains calcium and vitamin D3. This will help prevent metabolic bone disease, which is a serious bone degradation disease.Like gut-loading, dusting the prey with these extra supplements will benefit your anole’s overall health., Young anoles should be given 2-3 food items each day. Adult anoles should be given 2-3 food items every other day., Anoles are diurnal, which means they are most active during the daytime. This is the ideal time for them to hunt their prey effectively and get some exercise., When feeding your anole, place the prey in the anole’s enclosure by gently dropping them from a food cup or by gently releasing the prey individually with feeder forceps onto the branches and leaves of the enclosure's vegetation., When feeding worms to your anole, it is important to put them in a shallow dish so the anole can reach the prey. This also prevents the prey from escaping., If the anole does not eat the prey right away, place some food for the prey in the enclosure. Without food of their own, the prey may try to eat the only thing it can find—your anole! "

Place the box where lizards hang out in your yard.,
Put a tarp beneath your lizard trap.,
Come back periodically and see if you caught any lizards.",How to Catch a Lizard without Using Your Hands2," Bad smells can keep the lizards away you’re your trap. Using cellophane, thoroughly cover the open end and secure it around the sides with odor-free tape.

, Make sure it’s in the middle of the cellophane covering and be certain that it isn’t much bigger than your lizards will be. If it’s too big other critters you don’t want in there with the lizards could get in (e.g. bigger snakes).You can also use a glass pet terrarium if you have one and don’t mind cutting a hole in the screen top. This will also give you a 360-degree view of the inside of the box from a distance.

, This will tell you what your lizard likes to eat. Drop a few bugs from the pet shop inside.Choose food carefully. For example, the western long tail lizards near Las Vegas feed on insects and spiders. You may not find the right type of spiders in the pet shop so relocating a spider from around the house to your trap could work. You could also try putting some fruit inside to attract flies and fruit flies that will also be enticing.

, If there is a ledge nearby, use it to your advantage. Lizards love the climb walls so this could be an extra-attractive location.

, If there’s moisture on the ground, this will help keep it dry.

, If not, make sure you still have live bait inside. If you have…enjoy!

Watch your yard.,
Go online and research the types of lizards in your neighborhood.,
Build a realistic habitat.,
Find a container larger than your wall/structure.,
Spring your trap.",How to Catch a Lizard without Using Your Hands3," If you see the little reptile you’d like to see up close and personal hanging out, keep track of where and when you see it. This will be important come hunting time. Just like the guys on the nature shows, you need to understand your quarry’s habits.

, This will undoubtedly give you information on their favorite habitats, places to hide, etc. Then you can locate the spot the place in your yard most likely to attract one.


Around Las Vegas, for example, the western long tailed lizard (WLTL) is abundant. A quick Internet search will give you a lot of vital, useful information.
The WLTL likes to hide in the trees and exposed roots of the Creosote bush. Utilizing either a bush in or nearby your yard or even trying to get scrap Creosote bush roots to create a shelter in your yard is a great idea.
WLTL also feed on insects and spiders, so relocating a spider to your Creosote trap or putting some fruit there to attract flies and fruit flies will also be enticing.
If you live in Riverside or San Diego Counties in California the banded rock lizard (BRL) is a common site. The BRL eats ants, beetles flies, caterpillars, spiders, flower buds and blossoms.
Being a flat lizard that likes to hide in and under boulders and rocks, creating a trap with these while providing abundant food is a great way to bring one of these guys into your yard or a convenient area nearby.

, You want to attract a lizard to the spot in your yard you’ve chosen. From your research you will find that small lizards like to hide in cracks. So get yourself some spare wood and build a miniature wall of sorts that has a good-sized gap in it for a lizard to hide in. You can also use cement and a mold if you have the materials more readily available.Strictly follow your research here. Build the right kind of lizard trap and you’ll probably catch a lizard.

, Place the lid on the ground, interior facing up (exterior of lid facing down) and put your wall/structure on top of it. Secure your wall/structure to the lid (nails or screws are best as you can make them mostly chemical and odor free by boiling them in water).


This may be difficult if you pile the wood or rocks to create openings to hide in (depending on your research). You will have to improvise with some glue, some nails, etc. Lizards like body-sized openings so as long as you can create these you have a great chance of catching one., Once you see the lizard has taken a liking to your structure, wait until he is inside the crack and put the bottom of the container over everything and affix it to the upside-down lid. Now you have yourself a lizard.


A clear/transparent container works best. You can also buy a cheap opaque container at any hardware store and cut the bottom out of it. Be careful: if your wall is tall enough to be close to the height of the box, cutting out the bottom could allow your lizard to jump out.

Determine the length of your anole.,
Look for a stripe.,
Check the throat.,
Check the tail.,
Look for aggressive behavior.,
Watch for courtship behavior.,
Catch them in the act.",How to Determine the Sex of a Green Anole," Female anoles are generally smaller than males. Adult females (12 months old and up) usually measure around five inches long, while males can grow to be up to eight inches long. Both larger females and smaller males are possible, however, so you will need more information to you’re your determination., Adult female anoles often have a white stripe running down the middle of the back. Not all females have the stripe, and juveniles of both sexes can have a stripe that eventually fades, so you will need to look for other signs to be certain of the sex of your lizard., Male anoles have a pink or red dewlap, or flap of skin hanging in an arc from the neck region, which they can inflate during courtship and aggression displays. Of course, some female anoles also have this dewlap, although it is often lighter in color.While most anoles with a prominent dewlap are males, remember that this is still not a 100% guarantee that your anole is male.


Many people find it surprising that female anoles can also use their dewlaps in displays of aggression or during mating, just as males do., Carefully pick up your anole and look underneath its tale. Male anoles develop 2 larger scales, called postanal scales, at the base of the tail. This is one trait that female anoles never mimic, so if you spot these scales, you can be certain that your anole is a male.


Spotting the postanal scales on a young lizard can be difficult. You may need to wait until the anole is fully mature at around 12 months to know for sure.

, Male anoles will often fight each other, especially if there is a female around to fight over. When male anoles fight, they display their dewlaps and open their mouths, bob their heads, and eventually lunge at one another. If they are extremely agitated, black spots will form behind their eyes.The anoles will then bite and wrestle, and can fight until one submits.


If your anoles begin fighting like this, you will likely need to separate them to prevent serious injury.Female anoles will occasionally fight one another, especially if they are overcrowded, but it is less common and generally less intense., If conditions are right in the anoles' habitat, they will breed in captivity between April and September. If a female is present, male anoles will often make courtship displays that include bobbing their heads rapidly up and down and flaring their dewlaps. Males will also aggressively charge females and try to catch them by the scruff of the neck. Courtship and aggression displays begin in a similar fashion, but usually end very differently. If you see this kind of behavior in your anoles, observe them closely to see which is happening. If they are fighting, you will likely need to separate them.

, Catching your anoles in the act of mating is a pretty decisive way to determine the sex of your lizards. Should you spot them twined together mating, the one on top is the male, and the one on the bottom is the female.Observing an anole lay an egg is also a clear sign that your lizard is a female!

Prepare the artificial environment before purchasing the green anole.,
Provide a suitable temperature range for the anoles.,
Decide on how many anoles you will keep.,
Purchase an anole.,
Feed and water the anoles.,
Keep the vivarium or tank cleaned regularly.,
Keep a watch out for health problems and be active about averting any potential concerns.,
Handle with care.,
If you want to hold your anole and it bites you, don't panic and don't jerk or you will break its jaw!

",How to Care for Green Anole Lizards," The size of the container used will be dependent on whether you're keeping one anole or a community of anoles. A typical container will be a tall vivarium or a tank. Inside the vivarium, be sure to supply plenty of plants (either real or artificial, or a mixture of both) and basking items such as branches or smooth rocks.


For a community consisting of one male and four females (known as a ""harem""), the size of the container should be approximately 36 x 24 x 12 inches or 90 x 60 x 30cm. The height of the container is important, to allow for climbing around.
Fill the vivarium or tank evenly one or more inches or 2.5-5 centimeters with sterilized reptile bark big enough that it cannot fit in the anole's mouth. Never use unsterilized bark or floor covering you're not sure about; ask the pet store or your vet for advice if you're unsure.
Always use a tank cover. Other pets (like cats) like to 'play' with anoles and this usually means death for an escaped anole.;
, Anoles need to be in a daily temperature range of approximately 75-86ºF / 24–30ºC. Use full spectrum lighting to ensure the healthy development of both anoles and the live plants. The nighttime temperature can drop to 68ºF / 20ºC but no lower.


A fluorescent 40 watt bulb will create the right temperature during the day but must be turned off at night and replaced with a black light.
Like people, anoles can fall asleep in the sun for longer than they intended to. While they like long days, you should still put a timer on their grow light so that it is on for 12 hours a day, so they can get 12 hours of darkness but there needs to be a black light on during the night as they will freeze if no warmth is added.
High humidity levels are important too, achieved through regular misting and perhaps a dripper or a water feature. Also be sure to supply adequate fresh air.

, It's easiest to keep one anole and if you want more than one, you will need to be careful to only have one male in the one vivarium at any time as males fight. Moreover, unless you want to start breeding, avoid a male and female combination; opting for two females is likely to be the best; usually females do fine together, and may ""snuggle"" up to one another occasionally. If you're breeding anoles, the harem is ideal with four females and one male.


When younger, it is sometimes difficult to determine the sex of your lizards. Males always have a throat fan (or dewlap) underneath their throat that inflates into a red frill for mating/territory display on occasion. When older, males are typically larger and have longer snouts than females. Males also will have two large ""scales"" on their stomach at the base of their tail. Males have two bumps on the bottom base of the tail and females have only one or none. Males also tend to be more colorful than females.
Be aware that not everyone agrees that anoles are sociable enough to live in a close vivarium or tank community where they can't get away from each other. Some people believe that anoles should be kept separate from one another in different tanks or containers. This type of setup is more comfortable for the individuals inhabiting the tanks, and not as unnatural, therefore, it is less stressful and more healthy for the anoles. However, if you do keep them in the one vivarium, always provide many basking spots so as to avoid competition. And be aware, that unless it's breeding season, opposite sex anoles may be very stressed if kept in a single container; talk to your vet if you have any concerns.

, Choose a reputable place to buy the anole from and be sure that you can check the anole before purchase. When buying an anole, make sure to check for parasites, sluggishness, and their body weight. This latter can be ascertained by looking for obvious ribs showing. An unhealthy anole will have sunken-in cheek areas and will look much like a skeleton with skin. Make sure that your anole is in a tank of it's own when you buy it, or check the others for signs of stress, parasites, loose droppings, missing tails, and coloration. A green colored anole is less stressed out, and therefore a healthier specimen. (Slow anoles may just be cold, or it may be too hot. It all depends on their surroundings.)



Use common sense when choosing a new pet. Don't pick the smallest, skinniest anole because you ""feel bad for him."" Chances are you'll feel worse for him when you have to bury him in a shoe box in your garden.

, Anoles are insectivores and the size of insects they'll eat ranges from small to medium. Anoles need a minimum of twice weekly feeding and preferably every 2 to 3 days, or ask for advice from your vet. If you have more than one anole, it is vital that you keep an eye to see that each anole gets several insects every feeding. The food must be live – canned foods will not be eaten since it is lifeless and won't compete with your anole – so here are some suggestions on what to feed:


Feed crickets. One meal anoles enjoy is cricket; buy the smallest cricket offered, and if there is only ""one size"" at a pet store, go to a different one. Dust the crickets with a supplement powder at each feeding to help ensure the anoles get enough calcium and vitamins (anoles missing the key nutrients can get metabolic bone disease (MBD) and die). If you keep crickets around in bulk, ""gut-load"" them by feeding them a vitamin rich cricket food prior to feeding them to your lizards. This way, all of the nutritious food your crickets just ate will then, in turn, be passed on to your anole. Equally, if your crickets are starved, your anole soon will be too. Baby anoles (should you be breeding them) require micro crickets or tiny fruit flies.
Occasional fast prey like small cockroaches or flies will give your lizards some much needed exercise.
Anoles may also eat waxworms, fruit flies, small worms, canned crickets, small spiders, or earthworms.
Avoid feeding anoles with mealworms. These pass through them undigested, wasting energy in eating and not getting any energy from the food.
Anoles prefer to get their water in the form of droplets off plants. As such, daily misting is an essential activity in the vivarium. Mist both the anoles and the plants for 10 seconds 2 to 3 times a day. If you can't remember to do this or don't want to, have an automated mister or drip system installed.
Green anoles like to have their food in separate quarters than their homes unless it's feeding time. This way the ""leftovers"" won't munch on your lizard while he's asleep and medium to large crickets can eat the anole's extremities. If you place the crickets in a low feeding dish, make sure the crickets you put in the container aren't hiding under food bowls and such and your anole will be thankful that they aren't ganging up on him in the night! If they're small enough, they probably won't bother your anole but some owners of anoles advise to never release or leave crickets loose in the tank with the lizard but rather to place them in a separate container, move the anole to the container for 5–10 minutes to eat and then move the anole back to his tank when done.
The anole must have proper vitamins and calcium; since it eats feeder insects all of the lizards extra nutrients must be contained in those insects. Give the lizard UVB light (full spectrum) so the anole can regulate its vitamin balance. Make sure it's rated for the tank size and the anole. (Replace these special bulbs every few months even if they are still producing light. After a while they will stop making UVA and UVB.)

, Reptiles in captivity are susceptible to germs and debris that builds up over time in their containers. It is important to maintain and clean their home regularly, at least weekly. And leftover, uneaten food should always be removed after mealtime.


To make tank cleaning easier, try putting a sheet of plastic down before you put in the substrate.

, Some anoles will get infections on their snout along the mouth. This can be cleaned by gingerly and delicately wiping the snout with a cotton swab barely wetted in either hydrogen peroxide or Neosporin® (an antibiotic ointment) or ask your vet for a reptile-suitable product. Do not do this more than once a day and not for more than a few days. Don't force the treatment on them though; if they try to dodge you, let them, as it is likely that the stress of this procedure will harm them more. Instead, try keeping the container cleaner, and maybe drier if it happens to be too moist.


Kill any red spider mites that you see in the tank. An insecticidal soap can be made out of ivory soap shavings, tepid water, and vegetable oil shaken in a spray bottle. They are to anoles what ticks are to us.
Make sure to get rid of any mold growth the second you see it! Don't hesitate by ""waiting to see what happens"" because your anole will suffer and probably die.

, It is possible to handle an anole and even have it eat from your hand. The anole may learn to sit on your hand in exchange for a treat but don't put the anole there. Instead, allow it to crawl onto your hand of its own volition, as this is much less stressful for it. Also bear in mind that anoles move very fast and are very agile, so don't handle it anywhere it might escape from. On the whole though, an anole is much more of a pet for watching than for holding, so keep handling to a minimum.


If you need to move an anole (and this may be for feeding and cleaning purposes at the very least), be very gentle. Grip firmly but very gently and move him without delay.
Always wash your hands after handling the green anole, as with any reptile or pet. In addition, wash your hands after handling any bedding or tank decorations to prevent the spread of salmonella. While this disease won't usually show on a reptile (more often the aquatic species like turtles will carry salmonella) and you are usually safe when dealing with arboreal ""live off the ground"" creatures like the green anole, better safe than sorry.

Get a vivarium.,
Add plants and branches.,
Provide a basking area.,
Create hiding areas.,
Get the right temperature.,
Provide UVB light.,
Control the humidity with water.",How to Create a Green Anole Habitat," The first thing you will need to get hold of to create a great habitat to help you care for your lizard is an appropriately sized vivarium. This is a container, similar to an aquarium, that has a vented lid. This kind of container is ideal for lizards because it enables you to maintain the heat and the humidity your lizard will need to stay healthy. The size of vivarium you need will depend on the number of green anoles you get.


Anoles can be kept alone or in groups of one male and a number of females
A ten-gallon vivarium is big enough for two anoles. If you have two or more male anoles they may fight.If you have one male and two or three females you should get a 20 gallon vivarium or tank. This would be approximately 48"" x 13"" x 20"".;
, Once you have your tank you need to equip it with all the items your lizard needs for a stimulating and healthy habitat. Start by laying around two inches of sterile potting soil on the base of the tank and cover this with some bark mulch. Then place several potted plants in the tanks. The plants give your lizard opportunities to climb as well as contributing to the humidity.Make sure you only include reptile safe plants. Pothos, spider plants, philodendrons, dracaena, and ficus are all good choices.
You should add some extra branches propped up against the side of the tank. These are great for climbing on. You can buy prepared branches in your pet store.
Be wary of bringing in branches from outside as these may have parasites., You should provide an area within the tank that is kept at a higher temperature than the rest of the tank during the day. This is the basking area where your anole will relax during the day. You should keep this area at around 85-90 Fahrenheit.You will need a secondary heat source for this area. This heat source should not cover more than around 25% of the total space of the habitat.


You could use a 50-75 watt incandescent bulb which you have secured in a ceramic base. The lizard should not be able to reach or touch the bulb itself.
There are also specialist basking lights available from your pet store.
Never use hot rocks as heat sources for anoles., Your lizard will want plenty of places where he can hide away, under logs as well as behind plants and branches. You can create a special hiding house for your lizard just by placing appropriate bits of wood or bark in the tank. It's a good idea to have hiding places in the basking area. You can also buy special hiding houses from your pet store to place into your tank., Anoles are natives of warm regions of the south-east US, and places like Cuba, and the Caribbean. If you have anoles as pets you need to make sure the habitat you construct recreates the kind of temperatures that the lizards would enjoy in the wild. You should try to maintain a temperature of around 75-86ºF / 24–30ºC during the day. At night the temperature should drop to around 65-75 Fahrenheit.You can use heating lamps and thermometers to control and monitor the temperature inside the vivarium.
At night, you can use specialist nocturnal incandescent light bulbs which produce heat, but not much light. These can be expensive.
An alternative is a heating pad which you can place underneath the tank., Your lizard needs exposure to UVB light so he can synthesize vitamin D3 and metabolize calcium. Your lizard needs free access to 8-12 hours of UVB light a day. Insufficient exposure to UVB will lead to mineral deficiencies and physical problems for your green anole. Your lizard will decide when to bask in the light and when to sit in the shade, but you need to make the light available for him.The sun is the best source of ultraviolet light. If this is not practical arrange a combination of visible light from fluorescent or incandescent lights and UVB light from a reptile black light.
UV light will not penetrate glass, so if you are using overhead UVB light sources, the top of the tank will need to be mesh so the light can get through., Anoles will like a habitat that is humid, but not the kind of humidity you would expect from a wet rainforest environment. Aim for a humidity of around 60-70%. You can do this quite simply by ensuring that water is going into the air in the container. You can purchase a water dripper or a mister system which will do this automatically. Be sure to monitor it regularly to check it is working effectively.


An alternative to this is to spray the leaves of the plants in the container with purified water a few times a day.
Lizards are used to drinking water from leaves, so this is also a good way to provide drinking water.
Not all lizards will learn to drink from a bowl so you should ensure that your lizards have another way to access to drinking water, such as the dew on leaves."

, Before you go out and handle a lizard, make sure you know which ones could be hazard to your health.Some lizards, such as bearded dragons and leopard geckos are not only safe to handle but are also the recommended breed of lizard to keep as pets., In the United States, there are laws restricting the ownership and possession of lizards. Make sure you research your local, state, and national laws before bringing home a lizard as a pet.Your national government should have information about lizard possession on their website.

, Handling lizards can sometimes cause diseases. Be careful when handling any wild animal, especially lizards, to avoid getting sick with illnesses like salmonella.Salmonella can be harmful for small children. If you have kids in your home, consider their safety when bringing home or catching a lizard for a pet.

Grow specific plants to attract wildlife.",How to Catch a Wild Lizard and Hold It2," Lizards like to have spaces to hide. They also need places to live, to sleep, and to relax. You can attract lizards to your yard if you place natural or man-made structures in your yard.


Place rocks in your yard for shade and shelter.
Plant shrubs or leafy vegetation.

, To lure lizards to your property, you should attract what they eat. If you have a organic and an “untidy” yard or garden, you can attract bugs and moths. The more food you entice, the happier local lizards may be., Plant shrubs, grasses, and trees to create a more organic yard. Making your backyard a wild habitat will attract wild lizards and keep them happy.

Make a glass lizard trap.,
Make a lizard fishing pole.,
Catch a lizard by hand.",How to Catch a Wild Lizard and Hold It3," An easy way to catch a wild lizard is to use a glass lizard trap. You can do this in a few easy steps:


Clean and prepare a glass box. You want a box large enough to catch the native lizards in your area.
Cover the top of the box with plastic wrap. You want the lizard to be able to walk on the top of the box.
Slice a small slit in the top of the plastic wrap. Lizards like to crawl into holes and if a lizard is well fed, it will be more likely to look for a place to rest.
Locate a lizard habitat. Place the box in your backyard if you’ve noticed a lot of lizards in the area. The more lizards in the area, the better the placement for the trap.
Put insects or other lizard food on top of the top, near the slit in the plastic wrap. This will entice the lizard to check out the trap.
Check your trap frequently. Make sure you do not leave a trapped lizard enclosed too long without food and water.

, This is also known as using a lizard “noose.""Use a long stick. You want the stick long enough to serve as a handle.
Attach a piece of string or waxed dental floss to the end to the stick. This is will help to not scare the lizard when you try to catch it.
Tie the end of the string into a slip knot. This knot will be able capture the lizard safely without hurting it.
Slip the noose around the lizard’s head and pull. This will tighten the knot and capture the lizard.
Gently remove the noose from the lizard’s head. Grasp the lizard in your hand and remove the nose from around the head. Be very careful if the lizard has sharp teeth!

, If you know if you have safe lizards in the wild, you may be able to catch them by hand.


Know that lizards move very quickly! This is especially true in long grass. Take some time to observe the habits of lizards before you try and catch it.
Try and entice lizards closer to your hand by placing lizard food (insects) by your hand.

Determine the size you need.,
Make sure the cage walls are made of closely-spaced sturdy wire.,
Make sure the door is big enough for a litter pan to fit.,
Get a cage with a strong, escape-proof latch.,
Know that ferrets paws are not designed for wire floors.,
Make sure the cage has distinct sleeping, eating, and toilet areas.,
Don't buy a cage that uses painted or pressure-treated woods or metals containing toxins such as lead or zinc.

",How to Choose a Cage for a Ferret," The size of the cage depends on the number of ferrets you plan to own. A single ferret needs a cage that will allow space for one bed, one litter box, a food dish, and room to play. More ferrets will need room for more beds, food dishes, and play space. A good cage should be at least 30 to 60 inches (76 to 91 cm) long, 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) wide and a minimum of 20 inches (51 cm) high.;
, Wire walls allow air to flow through the cage. Ferrets need good ventilation; never house ferrets in aquariums, no matter how big the aquarium is, they are unsanitary and can lead to serious health problems. Aquariums are for fish, not ferrets.

, For ease of cleaning and maintenance.

, Ferrets are very clever and if it is at all possible, they will figure out how to escape. Be careful of spring latches and small gaps. If your ferret tries to squeeze out, he could get stuck and suffocate.

, If the cage you choose has wire floors cover them with a piece of fitted linoleum, which is a breeze to clean.

, Also make sure that you can secure the litter box and food dish to the cage. If they're not secured, they will be tipped over and used as toys.

Take your ferret to your veterinarian.,
Give your ferret tapeworm-killing medicine.,
Bathe your ferret.,
Clean your ferret’s bedding.,
Clean your ferret’s cage.,
Vacuum frequently.,
Apply a topical flea preventative to your ferret’s skin.",How to Treat Tapeworms in Ferrets," Your ferret can get tapeworms by swallowing infected fleas.If your ferret is scratching, comb through his fur with a fine-toothed flea comb,which is available at your local pet store.


Focus on the area between his shoulder blades—this is a popular ‘flea’ spot on ferrets.If you don’t see the actual fleas, you may see their residue, which is dark black.Check the bottom of your ferret’s cage, and on the floor around his cage. Fleas that have jumped off him will look reddish brown to black and will be about the size of a pencil tip.Use a magnifying glass to find the fleas, or flea residue, more easily.;
, When your ferret swallows an infected flea, the tapeworm eggs will attach to his intestinal walls. As the eggs grow into mature tapeworms, they will absorb the nutrients from the food your ferret eats. Consequently, your ferret will start to show signs of digestive upset, such as diarrhea and vomiting, as well as lose weight.Other clinical signs of tapeworms include a distended abdomen (‘pot belly’), a dull coat, and an inability to exercise.If your ferret has been scratching a lot because of the fleas, you may also see patches of fur missing, as well as inflamed-looking skin., Due to their small size, ferrets can become very sick from tapeworms. In addition to the digestive problems, the fleabites could cause enough blood loss to make your ferret dangerously anemic.Your ferret will need treatment right away.


Tapeworms are eliminated from your ferret’s body through his feces. The tapeworms will look like tiny grains of white rice. They might even be wriggling around!Dried up tapeworms resemble sesame seeds.Bring a sample of the tapeworm-containing feces to your veterinarian when you bring your ferret in. Your veterinarian will analyze the feces to confirm the tapeworms., Treating tapeworms in ferrets is a two-pronged approach: killing the tapeworms and preventing flea infestations. To kill the tapeworms, your veterinarian will prescribe an anti-parasite medication called an anthelmintic—usually ivermectin or praziquantel.These medications are also used in dogs and cats, but your veterinarian will prescribe a much smaller dose for your ferret because of his small size.


The medications come in either an injectable or oral formulation.
Giving medicine to a ferret can be challenging.To give him a pill, scruff him by grabbing the loose skin at the back of his neck. Tilt his head backwards. When he naturally relaxes and yawns, put your fingers in the front or side of his mouth and angle the pill towards the back of his mouth. Scruff him until you know he has swallowed the pill.You may want to turn your head away, in case your ferret decides to spit out the pill.If your ferret refuses to swallow the pills, speak with your veterinarian about other ways to get your ferret to take his medicine.
If you are uncomfortable giving medicine to your ferret, ask your veterinarian for tips on how to do it safely and effectively.
With treatment, the tapeworms will die and be digested in your ferret’s intestines. You will not see dead tapeworm segments in his feces., As if suffering through a tapeworm infestation was bad enough, your ferret could get infected again if there are fleas (and flea eggs) lingering around in the environment. One way to kill any remaining fleas is to bathe your ferret. Select a shampoo that contains pyrethrins, which are insecticides that effectively kill fleas.Because your ferret is small, choose a shampoo that is suitable for a kitten.Since there may be a number of pyrethrin-containing shampoos to choose from at your local pet store, talk with your veterinarian first for recommendations on which shampoo would be best.
The shampoo should not contain organophosphates, carbamates, or petroleum distillates.These can be toxic to your ferret.
Bathe your ferret from his ears to his tail. Use a flea comb to remove the fleas from his face.Depending on the severity of your ferret’s flea infestation, you may need to bathe him weekly for several weeks to kill all of the fleas and flea eggs.Read the product label carefully and follow the instructions exactly.Do not use flea sprays or dips to bathe your ferret. Compared to shampoo, these products are very toxic to your ferret., Another way to get rid of the fleas is to wash all of his bedding in hot water. To be on the safe side, wash his bedding several times. Do not use fabric softener when washing the bedding., Cleaning your ferret’s cage will involve cleaning the cage itself, as well as all of its contents: food and water bowls, toys, and furniture. There are several options for cleaning agents, such as diluted bleach (1/2 cup bleach per 1 gallon of water). Your veterinarian may also be able to recommend ferret-safe disinfectants.In addition to disinfectant, you will need one or two buckets, a pair of gloves, sponges, and some cleaning towels or paper towels. Also, have some brushes in a variety of sizes to target all the little corners and crevices in his cage.Clean his food and water bowls in hot, soapy water.Put your ferret in his playpen or separate cage while you clean the cage and let it dry.Your veterinarian may also recommend spraying the cage and its contents (not the food and water bowls, of course) with a ferret-safe flea spray., To make sure no fleas or flea eggs remain in your home, you will probably need to vacuum like it’s going out of style! Cut a flea collar and place it in the vacuum bag to kill any flea eggs that wind up in the bag.Replace the vacuum bag frequently.In addition to vacuuming, you can apply flea spray or flea powder to your floors.Speak with your veterinarian about which sprays and powders are ferret-safe.

, Regular application of a topical flea preventative, such as Frontline or Advantage, will help kill the adult fleas on your ferret’s skin, as well as stop the development of flea eggs and larvae.Because of your ferret’s size, he should receive the dosage recommended for kittens (less than five pounds).


Make sure to purchase flea preventatives only through your veterinarian—do not order them online or from a pet store. Products that are not sold through your veterinarian may be counterfeit.Follow the label instructions carefully when applying the medication.

Buy suitable cleaning products.,
Get personal protective equipment.,
Place the cage in an area that can be easily cleaned.,
Remove the animal from the cage.,
Remove old food, bedding, and animal waste.,
Clean all parts of the cage.,
Let the cage air out and dry.,
Line the cage with newspaper.,
Put new bedding in the cage.,
Put the cage back together.",How to Clean a Small Pet Cage," To ensure the cage is properly cleaned, buy cage cleaner from a pet store or use regular dish washing soap.The cleaner is available in wipes or a spray bottle. You will also need paper towels and a something to put the used bedding and paper towels in, such as a plastic bag.


Be sure that you are using a cleaner that is non-toxic to your pet. Your cage cleaner should say ""non-toxic"" on the label and be made to clean animal cages specifically.
For the safety of your animal, be sure to follow the directions for use and strength on the cleaner.;
, The waste of your pet may be toxic, so you should avoid contact with it. Wear disposable gloves and keep all cage contents off of your skin.

, While this process can be easy and tidy, there is a chance of spilled bedding. Because of this, its important to do the cleaning somewhere that can be easily cleaned.


If it's a nice day outside, consider taking the cage outside to do the cleaning. That way any spilled contents won't get your home dirty.

, You need to take your pet out of it cage while you clean it. Put your pet somewhere safe during the cleaning process. You don't want to have to focus on keeping an eye on the pet while you are doing the dirty work of cleaning its cage.


A cat's travel basket or cage is a good choice for a small animal. Just line it with newspaper to keep it clean while you clean your pet's cage.
You can also get a small ball your rodent can run around in while you clean its cage.

, If the bottom of the cage is lined with newspaper below the bedding, you can simply roll up the newspaper, which will contain the bedding as well. This is the easiest, and cleanest, way to remove the bedding.You can compost any compostable materials, such as biodegradable bedding, newspaper, and the waste of herbivorous animal. However, if you are cleaning out carnivorous waste, put it in the garbage can.

, If you have a cage that comes apart, take it apart. Spray each part of the cage and wipe thoroughly with a clean cloth or paper towel or wash it with soap and water.If concerned about leaving cleaner on the cage, wipe with a cloth dampened with water to remove any traces.
Clean any toys that are in the cage.
Clean all food dishes with soap and water.

, You should not immediately refill the cage if it is still damp. Give it time to dry completely so that you don't introduce the risk of mold in the cage.


Remember to wash your hands after cleaning the cage and the area you cleaned the cage in.

, Newspaper helps to reduce the cleaning each time and is easily composted. Put down several layers, enough so that the layer will hold up to liquid., You do not need to put a very thick layer of bedding in the cage. In fact, you should be able to barely see the newspaper lining beneath the bedding.More bedding will not allow you to clean the cage less frequently. In fact, it increases the chance that your pet will be in contact with wet bedding, and in turn of getting an infection.

, Add fresh food and water. Check that any water teats are flowing easily. If you took the top off the cage, put it back on.


Then you can let your pet back into his or her freshly-cleaned home!

Get a cage.,
Buy furnishings.,
Set up the space.,
Add toys if desired.",How to Set Up a Ferret Cage," The first and most important part for a good set up, is the cage itself. Ferrets are hyperactive animals and like to jump around. A proper cage should have at least one square meter (+/- 10 sq. ft.) of horizontal surface to walk on. For the height of the cage, you will need to look at the ferret that is going to live in it. The ferret should be able to stand on its hind legs and stretch out without hitting the roof of the cage.


If you don't know the size of your ferret (yet), you can say the height of the cage should be around 50 centimeters (+/- 19,5 inch). This is the minimum for a good ferret cage. Some stores or websites might present smaller cages as specifically designed for ferrets, but these really are too small. Stick to one square meter and fifty centimeters, and you have a decently sized cage.;
, A ferret needs a place to sleep, to eat and drink, and to do his business.


A hammock, blankets, or something else comfortable to sleep on/in.
A food bowl and a water bowl/bottle. Ferrets love to redecorate, so you might want to get a food bowl that cannot be moved around. Same goes for the water bowl.
Ferrets can be potty trained, so getting a litterbox is advisable. Get a low one, so it's easy to step in and out. A litterbox for young kittens is the best.

, You now have everything you need to accommodate a ferret. But now you need to actually set it all up. Hang up the hammocks, fill the litterbox and where to put that waterbottle? 


With any item you add to the cage, if you can attach it to the cage, do it! Your ferret will love the sight of his food and litter flying around, but it's far less fun for you to clean it all up.
Ferrets don't need hay, straw or sawdust. These products tend to be dusty and ferrets tend to be asthmatic. Not a good combination. If you want to cover the bottom of the cage with something, use towels or blankets.
Ferrets don't really care where you hang their hammock, as long as they can easily climb in and it isn't hung too close to their toilet. They do like to hide away sometimes, so if you have an open hammock (some are shaped into tunnels to hide in), hang it a corner or a closed area of the cage where not everyone can stare at them. Also, give them more than just one place to sleep. More hammocks, blankets and baskets will always make a ferret happy.
Place the litterbox in a corner, as this is the usual place a ferret will do his business. If your cage has multiple levels, make sure each level has a litterbox. And you might want to attach the box to the cage, because your ferret will' try to find out what's behind it. And under it. And beside it. You get the point. Litter everywhere.

Place the food and water wherever you like, but like the sleeping places, not near the litterbox. You don't usually eat your burger in the bathroom, right? Just like everything else, if you have multiple levels in your cage, give your ferrets more than one place to eat and drink.

, You can give your ferret toys to play with in their cage, but since ferrets sleep about 18 hours per day, they won't play with the toys a lot. It is best to save the toys for playtime; they will be more excited about it.

Discuss treatment options with your vet.,
Have your vet perform surgery.,
Watch your ferret improve after surgery.,
Treat your ferret with medications.",How to Treat Tumors in Ferrets1," Adrenal tumors cause an excessive release of sex hormones (estrogen, testosterone, progesterone) from the adrenal glands. Treatment options for adrenal tumors are surgery or medical therapy. The surgery is called an adrenalectomy, which is the removal of an adrenal gland. Surgery is the treatment of choice for adrenal tumors because it is curative (provides a cure for the disease).If both of your ferret’s adrenal glands have tumors, surgery would not be a good idea. Removing both adrenal glands would lead to serious health complications.Medical therapy uses medications that prevent the release of adrenal sex hormones. The medications do not shrink the tumor.
Medical therapy is recommended for ferrets that are not healthy enough to undergo surgery.;
, If your ferret is healthy enough for surgery, your vet will perform an adrenalectomy. The left adrenal gland, which is most often affected, is easier to remove than the right adrenal gland. Removing the right adrenal gland is challenging because it is attached to a major vein called the vena cava.If the right adrenal gland has the tumor, your vet may refer you to a veterinary surgeon who has experiencing removing right adrenal glands.
You should be able to take your ferret home on the same day as surgery.

, With the adrenal tumor removed, your ferret’s symptoms will start to improve. For example, your ferret’s hair will regrow after a few months. Also, your ferret will get its appetite back and start regaining weight. If your male ferret had trouble urinating before the tumor was removed, that problem will also go away after surgery.In male ferrets, adrenal tumors can cause an enlargement of the prostate gland, which is a reproductive organ located next to the bladder. An enlarged prostate gland blocks the flow of urine from the bladder. This is an emergency situation that requires immediate veterinary treatment., If surgery is not an option, your vet will recommend several different medications: melatonin, deslorelin, and Lupron. Each works in different ways. Melatonin, which is naturally produced in the body, works by regulating the normal rhythm of hormone release. It can also stimulate hair regrowth.Lupron prevents adrenal sex hormone release. Given as either an injection or implant under the skin, it lasts for several months.Lupron is expensive.Deslorelin is an implant. Like Lupron, it inhibits the adrenal sex hormone release. Each implant can be effective for as long as 8‒20 months."

Respond to a hypoglycemic crisis.",How to Treat Tumors in Ferrets2," Insulinomas are tumors of the pancreas. They cause the pancreas to secrete excessive amounts of insulin, which can lead to dangerously low blood glucose levels. Treatment options for insulinomas are surgery, medical therapy, chemotherapy, and dietary management.Your vet will come up with a treatment plan for your ferret.


The type of insulinoma treatment depends on a ferret’s age and severity of the disease.Whether a ferret owner wants to be aggressive or conservative with treatment can also determine insulinoma treatment.Your vet may recommend putting your ferret on medical therapy before surgery, and continuing it after surgery.

, Insulinomas form nodules on the surface of the pancreas. Surgical treatment for insulinomas involves nodule removal and a partial removal of the pancreas (‘pancreatectomy’).Although surgery is the treatment of choice for insulinomas, it is not always curative because there may be microscopic tumor nodules that would not be visible during surgery.Insulinomas can spread throughout the pancreas, making a surgical cure difficult.For the partial pancreatectomy, your vet will remove about 60% of your ferret’s pancreas. With less pancreas, less insulin would be secreted.Surgical treatment typically extends the survival time for ferrets with insulinoma. Also, ferrets who have the surgery typically need less medical therapy after surgery than before surgery., After surgical treatment, a ferret’s blood glucose levels will start to rise almost immediately. These levels can dip again about 6‒9 months after surgery, though, so checking your ferret’s blood glucose levels after surgery will be important.Your vet will make adjustments as needed with your ferret’s medication to keep blood glucose levels within the normal range.


Your vet can show you how to take small blood samples from your ferret. They can also show you how to use a blood glucose monitoring system for your ferret.

, Two medications are available for medical therapy of insulinomas in ferrets. These medications—prednisone and diazoxide—will help your ferret feel better by raising its blood glucose levels. They do not, however, stop the progression of the tumor.Diazoxide is usually given after a ferret becomes resistant to prednisone therapy.It can also be given along with prednisone to prolong prednisone’s effectiveness.Medical therapy typically lasts 6‒18 months. As the disease progresses and the clinical signs become more severe, your ferret will need increasingly higher doses of medication.Your vet will explain how to give these medications. If you have to give them by mouth, be aware that ferrets tend to spit out pills and liquid medications., Your vet will need to monitor your ferret very closely when it is receiving medical therapy. If your ferret is on prednisone therapy, your vet will want to measure your ferret’s fasting glucose levels at least 4 times a year, as well as perform blood work and a urinalysis 1‒2 times a year. If your ferret is on diazoxide, your vet will want to measure its liver enzyme levels several times a year. Diazoxide can cause liver problems.A fasting blood glucose measurement is taken when a ferret has not eaten for several hours before the blood draw.

, Chemotherapy is most effective when started early in the disease process, when a ferret’s symptoms of insulinoma are mild. It also works well when a ferret has no physical symptoms of an insulinoma but has low blood glucose levels.The chemotherapy medicine for insulinoma treatment is called doxorubicin, which kills beta cells (insulin-producing pancreatic cells). Your vet will administer it intravenously (in a vein) in 4 doses, spread 3 weeks apart., Dietary management is an essential part of insulinoma therapy in ferrets. Feed your ferret small, frequent meals that are high in protein. Examples of high-protein foods are meat-based baby foods and high-protein cat diets.Ask your vet for recommendations on specific brands of food.


Feeding small, frequent meals will keep your ferret’s blood glucose in a normal range throughout the day.If you want to give your ferret treats, they should also be high in protein. Ideal treats are raw or lightly-cooked pieces of organ meat, such as liver. Do not give your ferret treats that are high in carbohydrates (e.g., raisins, corn syrup), because they would cause a spike in blood glucose and a release of too much insulin from the pancreas.Ferrets can be picky about new foods.Your ferret must eat throughout the day, so talk to your vet if your ferret refuses to eat its new food.
If feeding frequent meals to your ferret is not practical, leave food out all day in its cage. In general, ferrets do not overeat if they have access to food all day., A ferret with an insulinoma can suffer from a hypoglycemic crisis, which occurs when blood glucose drops to extremely low levels. During a hypoglycemic crisis, your ferret would suddenly collapse. If your ferret collapses and doesn’t respond to you, immediately rub honey or corn syrup onto its gums and take it to your vet for emergency treatment.A ferret experiencing a hypoglycemic crisis can also start having seizures. If your ferret is having seizures, be very careful with putting the corn syrup or honey on its gums—your ferret may bite you.Left untreated, a hypoglycemic crisis can be fatal.Honey and corn syrup are high in sugar and would raise your ferret’s blood glucose levels quickly.

Have your vet perform surgery.,
Treat your ferret with chemotherapy.,
Give your ferret prednisone.,
Supplement your ferret’s diet.",How to Treat Tumors in Ferrets3," Lymphoma can affect many organs, including the spleen, intestines, and liver.In ferrets, it is either called ‘juvenile onset’ (< 3 years of age) or ‘adult onset’ (> 3 year of age).Treatment options for lymphoma include surgery, chemotherapy, and medical therapy.Your vet will recommend which treatment option(s) will work best for your ferret.

, Surgical treatment can be effective for certain types of lymphoma (e.g. intestinal lymphoma), but not all. If your vet recommends chemotherapy after surgery, surgical removal of the tumor can increase the chances of successful chemotherapy treatment.When your vet diagnoses the lymphoma and identifies its location, they will tell you whether surgery is a feasible treatment option.

, Chemotherapy will not cure your ferret’s lymphoma, but can prolong your ferret’s life. The chemotherapy drugs have relatively mild side effects (e.g., weakness, vomiting, loss of whiskers). Some of the side effects can be serious, though, so your vet will want to monitor your ferret’s blood work during chemotherapy treatment.Your ferret could experience cancer remission (no signs of cancer) with chemotherapy. However, because the cancer will come back at some point, your vet may want to administer chemotherapy periodically during remission.In general, ferrets on chemotherapy do not become as sick as humans on chemotherapy., Oral prednisone helps ferrets with lymphoma feel a lot better. However, this feeling of good health usually does not last very long.If your vet recommends prednisone treatment for your ferret, be aware that it is only a temporary treatment that will not cure the lymphoma.

, Dietary supplements, such as antioxidants and supplements that stimulate the immune system, may help improve your ferret’s response to lymphoma treatment.Ask your vet for recommendations on which supplements would be good for your ferret.

Learn about lizards in your area.,
Prepare a box as a temporary or permanent home.,
Cover the box with plastic wrap and cut a slit.,
Place the trap in a good location.,
Bait the trap.,
Check the trap frequently.",How to Catch a Lizard1," Try to research the behavior of local lizards before setting your trap, so you know when they are active and what type of bait and trap location is likely to be successful. A reptile identification guide booklet or website for your area may contain useful information. You can also observe the behavior of lizards in your home or yard and see where they gather.


If you cannot find useful information, follow the general advice in this section.;
, Any sturdy container without a strong odor can be used as a lizard trap. If you wish to keep your lizard permanently, however, research how to construct a suitable home beforehand, suited for the lizard species in your area. For temporary captures, simply make your box a little more comfortable for the lizard by placing some local leaves and grasses at the bottom. This also may make the trap less suspicious.


If you plan to keep a lizard permanently, find out about laws and permits in your area before you begin, to make sure you are not doing anything illegal.
If you are not sure how to construct a good lizard home, look for vivariums in the local yellow pages. The employees there should be able to advise you.

, Stretch plastic wrap over the entire box, taping it to the sides. Cut a slit long enough for the local lizards to fall through near the middle of the box.If you're not sure how large the local lizards are, cut the slit roughly six inches (15 cm) long.

, If you've seen lizards active in a particular area, place the box there. Otherwise, look for places where insects congregate, such as near light sources that are on at night. Hiding places in your yard such as rock walls or bushes may also be a good option.

, Many lizards eat insects, but because there are so many species of lizard it is best to research the diet of species in your area. Otherwise, use crickets, moths, flies, or any other insect small enough for the target lizard to eat. Keep in mind that some lizards may not eat dead prey, but live bait may not be practical as it is difficult to keep in place.If the bait is light enough, place it on the plastic wrap near the slit.

, You may not catch a lizard for several days or longer, so don't give up if you don't see one right away. Check two or three times a day at least, so a captured lizard doesn't starve to death. Replace live bait after it dies, or dead bait every one or two days to keep it fresh.


If you give up on the trap, remember to remove it and throw it away so animals do not fall into it.

Use this method for small lizards only.,
Find a long stick.,
Attach a long piece of waxed dental floss to the stick.,
Tie the other end into a slip knot.,
Search for lizards in likely places.,
Try looking for lizards around lights at night.,
Approach the lizard slowly from the front or side.,
Gently fit the noose around the lizard's head.,
Carefully remove the noose.,
Do not keep your lizard permanently unless you are prepared.",How to Catch a Lizard2," This method involves the construction of a ""fishing pole"" for catching lizards. This is a surprisingly successful technique often used by biologists. However, as the catch involves removing a noose from a struggling, startled lizard, it is not wise to use on large, sharp-toothed lizards without experience and protective clothing., Find a stick or other long object at least three feet (0.9 meters) long. You may use an actual fishing pole if you have one, but you may want to use a softer material in place of fishing line, as described below.

, Cut off a piece of waxed dental floss at least as long as the stick.Tie one end of this onto one end of the stick. If you have no floss, you can use a different soft line, such as a strong, long grass blade to catch small lizards. Fishing line is not recommended for inexperienced lizard catchers as sharp lines can cut the lizard.

, Form a loop at the loose end of the floss. Grasp the rope on the side of the loop closest to the stick, and form a new loop by moving your fingers under and through the first loop. Keep pulling until the first loop has tightened. You should now have a makeshift ""fishing pole"" with a noose at the end.


The noose has to be large enough to go around the lizard's head.

, Lizards may be found where insects gather, such as a compost heap. If you do not see any running around or lying in the sun, they may be hiding under boards, in firewood piles, or in similar shady hiding places.


If you can find out what species of lizards live in your area, you can research their behavior online or in wildlife guides for better information about where to find them.

, If you can't find any lizards during the day, you may have better luck searching for species that are active during the night. Nocturnal lizards are often found hunting insects, which gather around porch lights, lighted windows, and other light sources.

, Oddly, this technique may work better if the lizard can see you, as the lizard may focus on your approach instead of on the noose. Move very slowly, and only come close enough to reach the lizard with your noose. Sudden movements may cause the lizard to run away and hide.

, Some species and individuals react quickly to the noose, while others will remain motionless even as the noose bumps into them several times. Once you've found the second type, or practiced your noose-slinging skills, fit the noose around its neck. Its own weight should tighten the slipknot as it moves, preventing it from escaping.

, Grasp the lizard gently but firmly by the back, not the tail, limbs, or head. Pull the noose off in short, gentle motions.

, Keeping a lizard permanently requires preparing a suitable home for the lizard, researching how to care for that specific species, and potentially acquiring permits (if keeping wild lizards is even legal in your region). In most cases, it is recommended that you keep the lizard for no more than a couple hours. Once you are done examining it or sketching it, release it as close to the spot you found it as possible.

Determine if surgery is the right treatment option.,
Discuss surgical challenges.,
Have your vet remove the affected adrenal gland.,
Monitor your ferret’s recovery.",How to Treat Adrenal Disease in Ferrets1," For many ferrets, surgical removal of the affected adrenal (‘adrenalectomy’) is the most effective way to treat adrenal disease. If your ferret has adrenal disease, your vet will consider several factors to determine if surgery is a good idea. These factors include your ferret’s age, presence of other diseases, and the severity of clinical signs.If both of your ferret’s adrenals are affected, surgery is not a good idea. Removing both adrenals would lead to significant hormone deficiencies. Your ferret would then need lifelong hormone supplements, which may not be financially feasible.If surgery is not an option for your ferret, your vet will recommend medications to treat the symptoms of adrenal disease.;
, The location of each adrenal can make surgery either easy or difficult. Surgical removal of the left adrenal is straightforward. Removing the right adrenal is challenging, though, because it’s attached to the vena cava. The vena cava is the major vein carrying blood back to the heart from the lower half of the body.Removing the right adrenal requires removing the part of the vena cava where the adrenal is attached, making the surgery very challenging.If your vet does not have a lot of surgical experience with removing ferret adrenals, they will likely refer you to a veterinary surgeon with more experience.
Partial removal of the right adrenal gland is not a reasonable treatment option, since it would only slow down the progression of adrenal disease, not cure it., If your ferret is a good surgical candidate, your vet will proceed with anesthetizing your ferret and performing an adrenalectomy. Because ferrets can become cold during surgery, your vet will use heating pads or specialized hot water bottles to keep your ferret warm during surgery.You will probably be able to take your ferret home the day of surgery.

, Hair loss is the telltale sign of adrenal disease in ferrets. After an adrenalectomy, a ferret’s recovery will involve hair regrowth. The hair will usually start growing back in about 1 to 2 months and will be fully regrown after about 6 months.The hair might start growing back as soon as 2 weeks after surgery.Sometimes, after an adrenalectomy, the remaining adrenal develops a tumor, causing a disease recurrence.Watch your ferret for signs (e.g., hair loss, difficulty urinating, swollen vulva) that adrenal disease has returned. The vulva is the external portion of a female’s genitalia.
Disease relapse occurs in about 40% of ferrets after an adrenalectomy."
"
Give your ferret melatonin.,
Have your vet administer Lupron.,
Discuss other medical treatments with your vet.",How to Treat Adrenal Disease in Ferrets2," If your ferret cannot undergo surgical treatment, talk with your vet about available medications, such as melatonin, for ferret adrenal disease. Melatonin is naturally produced in the body. In intact ferrets, it coordinates with hormones produced in the brain to control adrenal sex hormone release. This control is disrupted when a ferret is spayed or neutered, causing brain hormones to continually trigger adrenal sex hormone release.Melatonin treatment block the release of these hormones from the brain, thus preventing adrenal sex hormone release.Time-release melatonin implants that go under the skin can mimic the body’s seasonal rhythm of melatonin levels. Your vet would use a device to inject the implant under the skin. Every 3 to 6 months, your vet would need to replace the implant.Although melatonin can be given by mouth, it is very challenging to give a ferret an oral medication. Ferrets can easily spit pills and liquid medications back out.Melatonin is not curative., Lupron blocks estrogen and testosterone release. It can be given as a muscle injection or as a slow-release implant under the skin.The injection can last up to a few months. If your vet gives your ferret a Lupron injection, you may see some swelling at the injection site; this is normal.Although Lupron is a very effective, it is expensive and must be given for the duration of a ferret’s life., Other than melatonin and Lupron, several other drugs are available, including Mitotane and deslorelin.Remember that, although each drug works a little bit differently, their main function is to suppress sex hormone release from the adrenals. Your vet can determine which drugs will be most likely to work in your ferret.


Deslorelin is implanted under the skin.As you consider medical treatment for your ferret, remember that the drugs will not cure adrenal disease. They will only reduce the disease symptoms.

"
Recognize the symptoms of adrenal disease.,
Feed your ferret a healthy diet.,
Create a healthy environment for your ferret.,
Take your ferret to get regular checkups.",How to Treat Adrenal Disease in Ferrets3," A ferret with adrenal disease will have hair loss that typically affects the torso and rear legs. As the disease continues, a ferret may go completely bald. In addition to hair loss, symptoms of adrenal disease include:Muscle atrophy (loss of muscle tone). This muscle loss can occur over the abdomen
Difficult urination in male ferrets
Swollen vulva in female ferrets
Enlarged abdomen
Weakness and tiredness

, Adrenal disease is not caused by a poor diet. Even still, a healthy diet ensures a ferret receives all the nutrients its body needs. Since ferrets are carnivores, your ferret's diet should contain meat-based protein, such as chicken or turkey.A healthy ferret diet should also contain fat. Commercially available packaged foods are available that would meet all of your ferret’s nutritional needs.Your vet can recommend which ferret food to purchase.
Freeze-dried or frozen commercial foods come in small chunks and would be easy to feed your ferret.Since ferrets have short digestive tracts, feed your ferret small meals every few hours. Ferrets like drinking water when they eat, so make sure your ferret’s water bottle is full at meal time.Ferrets cannot digest carbohydrates., A healthy living environment is important to a ferret’s overall health. In ideal ferret living environment is well ventilated, large enough for it to play in, well-stocked with toys, and contains a safe sleeping area (e.g., ferret sleeping box). In addition, a healthy ferret environment:Is free of dangerous objects, such as electric wires
Is situated away from drafts, such as air vents
Has a shallow water bath, if the ferret enjoys playing in water
Has an easily-accessible toilet area (e.g., litter box) that is separate from other areas of the cage

, Regular veterinary checkups can help keep your ferret healthy. The checkups can also serve as early disease detection. Take your ferret to your vet once a year for a physical exam and vaccinations (rabies and distemper). During the appointment, your vet will also take a fecal sample to test for intestinal parasites. If your ferret is over 3 years old, your vet will run other tests, including blood work, x-rays, and a urinalysis."

Don't use detergent or bleach to wash any thing that belongs to your ferret.,
Keep the ferret's cage soft and warm in the winter/fall.",How to Keep a Ferret Healthy," The kibble you provide should have a least 35% to 45% protein, 18% to 20% fat and no more than 3% fiber. The kibble has to be meat based because ferrets are obligate carnivores (just like cats). It would be best to get a grain free all natural ferret food like Evo ferret food or Zupreem grain free ferret food. If these types of ferret food are hard to find, you can get Wellness Core kitten food, Wellness Core original cat food or Felidae grain-free Pure Elements cat food.;
, Choose foods such as egg yolk or scrambled egg and boiled or raw chicken.

, Most of them are high in sugar. Ferret N Bones appear to be fine as occasional treats though.

, Tap water contains too many minerals for the ferret to handle, which can cause health problems.

, Even if it looks like they have some already, they need fresh food and water. Remove uneaten food after 24 hours.

, Let your veterinarian check its immunity every year instead of overloading the ferret with annual vaccinations. If it still has immunity to distemper, it will not need a vaccine. By doing this you prevent your ferret from being over-vaccinated, which can cause health problems.


Try to avoid the rabies vaccine. It can be harmful to your ferret and the chances of your ferret catching rabies is very rare unless rabid bats, foxes, raccoons, coyotes and other wild animals are very common where you live and can find their way into your house.

, Advantage flea protection for cats and Heartguard heartworm prevention for cats can be used. Interceptor for cats is another heartworm prevention you can use. Revolution for kittens or cats can be used to prevent fleas, heartworms, ear mites and certain intestinal parasites. Be sure to talk with your vet on what dosage of flea and/or heartworm prevention is safe for your ferret.

, If your ferrets are especially hyperactive, let them run around twice a day, about 3 to 4 hours at a time. The safest place to walk your ferret is probably in your yard.


Make sure the room your ferret is in is safe.
You can take the ferret for walks during fine, cool weather. Walking your ferret is optional.
If you don't have a yard, look for a safe place where dogs are not too common. If you live in an area where large birds are common be careful - it might want to make your ferret its next meal!

, Play with it and provide toys. Rotate toys to help keep boredom at bay.

,,,


If you don't want your ferret to smell, change its bedding once a week and clean the cage and litter box daily.

, Use a ferret teeth gel or water and a baby toothbrush, at least once a week.

, Use a flea comb, slicker brush or bristle brush to brush its coat for a few minutes and give it no more than a teaspoon of olive oil twice a week. Olive oil helps move hairballs.

, White vinegar with water is all natural and safe for your ferret. It is good at killing bacteria and odors.

,, It's okay to use dish liquid to wash your ferrets food and water bowls.

, Be cautious about what you use to clean your floor.

, If necessary, put a little heater on to low (optional).

This hair loss might come and go, but always progresses to near-complete baldness.The hair loss, which is symmetrical, begins at the tip of a ferret’s tail and works its way forward to the head.‘Symmetrical’ means that the hair loss is the same on both sides of a ferret’s body.;
, The vulva is the external opening of a female’s reproductive tract. With adrenal disease, increased estrogen release from the adrenal glands causes the vulva to swell, as if the female is in heat (ready to mate).The female’s nipples may also enlarge.An intact female ferret that is not bred when in heat will have a swollen vulva. However, since all female ferrets in the United States are spayed (removal of internal reproductive organs), the most likely reason for a swollen vulva is adrenal disease., Male ferrets with adrenal disease can develop a musky odor, which can worsen over time.This may be due to increased testosterone release from the adrenal glands.


Healthy male ferrets smell musky when they are ready to mate with a female ferret.

, Adrenal disease can cause make a ferret’s skin become thin and wrinkled.The skin may also become very dry.If your ferret’s skin is dry, you will probably see dandruff (white flakes of skin).

, A ferret with adrenal disease may experience a loss in muscle tone, called atrophy, which may be severe.It usually occurs on a ferret’s thighs and rear end.If your ferret has muscle atrophy, its body will look smaller in the areas of muscle loss.


Adrenal disease can also cause a loss of appetite, so your ferret may lose weight and look smaller overall., Adrenal disease often causes behavioral changes in ferrets because of increased sex hormone levels. An increased release of adrenal testosterone causes aggression in male ferrets. They will display this aggression towards their cage mates or people. Interestingly, the aggression may be the only adrenal disease symptom you notice in your ferret.Aggression is usually associated with mating behavior in male ferrets. However, since most male pet ferrets are neutered, the aggression is likely due to adrenal disease.
If a neutered male ferret becomes aggressive, the adrenal disease may be a malignant (harmful) tumor., In male ferrets, adrenal disease can cause the prostate gland, which is a reproductive organ, to enlarge. This enlargement may be due to a prostatic cyst (fluid-filled sac), abscess (pocket of infection), or inflammation. Because the prostate is located near the bladder, an enlarged prostate can block the flow of urine and make it difficult for a ferret to urinate.If your male ferret has difficulty urinating, it may have an enlarged prostate due to adrenal disease.


Difficulty urinating is called stranguria. This condition is a medical emergency, because an inability to urinate can damage the kidneys and rupture the bladder.If your male ferret cannot urinate, take it to your vet right away for emergency treatment.

, Adrenal disease occasionally causes itchiness in ferrets. This itchiness may occur with hair loss. Sometimes, though, a ferret with adrenal disease can be itchy without any hair loss.Itchiness due to adrenal disease usually occurs on the back.About one-third of ferrets with adrenal disease experience itchiness., Healthy ferrets are playful and curious.Ferrets with adrenal disease, though, are less playful because they don’t have much energy.This loss of energy may be due to muscle loss, which would make a ferret feel weak.

, Adrenal disease may cause your ferret to eat less.To determine if your ferret is eating less, measure how much food you give your ferret. When your ferret has finished eating, measure the amount of food that is left over.

, Adrenal disease in ferrets requires a veterinary diagnosis. When you take your ferret to your vet, they will first physically examine your ferret. If the adrenal glands are extremely enlarged, your vet may be able to feel them when they touch your ferret’s belly.However, because ferret adrenal glands are so small, your vet may not be able to feel them on a physical exam.In addition to touching your ferret’s abdomen, your vet will look over your ferret’s entire body and listen to its heart and lungs.
As your vet performs the physical exam, they will ask you questions about your ferret, such as what symptoms you noticed and when they first appeared.

, Measuring the levels of sex hormones in your ferret’s blood will confirm a diagnosis of adrenal disease. This blood test is performed at the University of Tennessee Veterinary Medical Center.Your vet will take a blood sample from your ferret and send it to the University of Tennessee.


The test will measure the levels of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone in the blood.
It will take several weeks for your vet to receive the test results. Because a ferret’s sex hormone levels can vary throughout the year, your vet will consider the current season of the year when analyzing the results.While waiting for the test results, your vet may want to perform other diagnostic tests, like ultrasound, that can help diagnose adrenal disease.

, An ultrasound is an imaging technique. An abdominal ultrasound can identify enlarged adrenal glands.If your vet sees the adrenal glands on the ultrasound, they will measure them to see how enlarged they are.Ferret adrenal glands can be hard to see on an ultrasound because they are tiny.
Your vet may want to use ultrasound to monitor the enlarged adrenal gland for several months.However, if your ferret is really sick, it should receive treatment right away.

, X-rays are usually not very helpful with diagnosing adrenal disease in ferrets. This is because adrenal gland masses in ferrets do not calcify, meaning they do not develop calcium deposits.These calcium deposits are white and would be visible on an x-ray.


X-rays can help rule out other diseases that could be causing your ferret’s symptoms.For this reason, your vet may want to take some x-rays.
Since x-rays will not diagnose your ferret’s adrenal disease, talk with your vet about whether your ferret should have x-rays taken.

Handle your new pet carefully.,
Scoop up your lizard in your hand and hold its head delicately between your thumb and forefinger.,
Place one hand gently over the back of your lizard.,
Make sure to support the lizard’s body weight and length and allow them to become comfortable.,
Provide water for your lizard daily.,
Purchase insects such as live crickets or super mealworms and wax mealworms larvae from the pet store to feed your lizard 5 to 7 times a week.,
Clean the tank whenever it smells musty or you see animal waste.",How to Catch a Common House Lizard and Keep It As a Pet," A 20-gallon tank (24” L x 12” W x 12” D) is recommended. Make sure you seal any openings where your lizard could escape from., Lizards are cold-blooded creatures that rely on outside warmth to function. The tank should be a minimum of 80 degrees Fahrenheit at one end with a basking area with a temperature of about 95 degrees Fahrenheit.Do not use heated rocks because they can cause your lizard to overheat.

, Paper towels and newspapers are inexpensive options that work well for smaller and medium sized lizards and are easy to change.

, Your lizard likes to defend itself by hiding., Lizards like warmth and sunlight, so look for sunny outdoor spots.

,


Setting a trap: Find an odorless box, cover it with plastic wrap and cut a slit. Place the box in a location where you have seen lizards and add live insect bait. Check the trap two or three times a day. It may take several days to catch the lizard, so make sure replace the bait as necessary.
Using a lizard fishing pole: Source a stick that is at least 3 feet long (0.9 meters) and a long piece of dental floss. Tie the dental floss to one end of the stick. Make a slip knot out of the other end with a loop large enough to fit around a lizard’s neck. Approach the lizard of your choice slowly and gently fit the loop around its neck. The best time to catch lizards is early in the day because they have not had a chance to warm up and will move more slowly., Geckos, anoles, and skinks are common types of lizards that can make good pets.

, Lizards, like any other animal, can feel pain. Some signs that your lizard is feeling uncomfortable include biting, thrashing around, clawing, and scrambling.,


Alternatively, clasp it in your hand while grasping one of its front legs between your thumb and forefinger. With this method, your lizard is likely to struggle and may bite you., Use your other hand to grasp your lizard around its sides with just enough pressure to hold it still.

, Be calm and make smooth motions., Depending on the type of lizard, a shallow container of water, a bubbler bowl (for lizards who do not drink still water), or misting the walls of the cage daily will work (for arboreal and desert lizards) as water sources., Make sure to buy insects of the appropriate size for your lizard.Start with 6 insects to see how many your pet will eat. ""Leftover"" food can be dangerous to your lizard while it is asleep, so it is important to not put too many insects into the tank.

,


Remove the flooring. If it is paper, discard the original and replace with new paper towels or newspaper. If it is gravel or carpet, wash the existing flooring and set back into the cage.
Mist the cage with cleaner. A good cleaner is a mixture that is one part alcohol and two parts water with a drop or two of dishwashing liquid. Wipe the cage dry."

Keep your ferret indoors.,
Keep mosquitos out of your house.,
Do not expose your pet to DEET.,
Don't assume you will be able to treat an infection.",How to Prevent Heartworm in Ferrets1," Heartworm is transmitted by mosquitos. If a mosquito bites an animal that is infected with heartworm and then bites your ferret, your ferret may become infected as well. If you do want to take your ferret outdoors, try to avoid doing so during warm, moist weather when mosquitos are most numerous. Further, avoid taking your ferret outside at dawn and dusk, when mosquitos are most active.Heartworm is most common in the U.S. within 150 miles (241 km) of the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico and along the Mississippi River. However, heartworm has been found in every U.S. state.;
, Do not leave doors or windows open unless they are screened. Repair any damage to screens as soon as it occurs. If you need motivation to do so: people can be infected with heartworm too (though adult heartworms are usually unable to develop in human bodies).Take it for granted that some mosquitos will get into your home. They may even survive in certain areas of your home year-round. Be sure to clean eaves, crawlspaces, and attics regularly if you have pets., While DEET is a standard ingredient in many bug sprays designed for human use, DEET is extremely dangerous for your pet. Avoid spraying your ferret with any bug spray designed for use on humans. Similarly, don't use bug spray meant for dogs. There are several natural bug sprays designed for use on pets. They are available online and at most pet stores. Before using these sprays, check with your vet to make sure they're safe., Though medications that can kill adult heartworms do exist, they are especially dangerous for ferrets. These medications are even dangerous for larger animals, such as cats and dogs, as heartworms killed by the drugs can clog arteries. Since ferrets have especially small blood vessels, this risk is even greater. In short, take great care in preventing your ferret from becoming infected with heartworm, as treatment is challenging and dangerous."

Get your ferret's tumor treated.",How to Diagnose Tumors in Ferrets," Tumors can cause a variety of physical symptoms in ferrets. Hair loss is a common symptom with adrenal tumors. If a ferret has an adrenal tumor, the hair loss will occur primarily on the tail and rear legs. Eventually, the ferret may go completely bald.The hair loss with adrenal tumors is usually symmetrical, meaning the hair loss looks about equal on the right and left sides of a ferret's body.;
, Common forms of skin tumors in ferrets are mast cell tumors (MCT) and basal cell tumors, both of which produce easily recognizable masses on the skin. MCTs can appear anywhere on the skin, but usually form on the torso and neck. They are raised, have irregular shapes, and may be scabbed over if a ferret has been scratching at them (MCTs can be very itchy).Unlike in dogs, MCTs are benign (not harmful). Interestingly, they can disappear and reappear on the skin, causing some ferret owners to mistake them for insect bites.Basal cell tumors are small and look like warts. If the center of tumor is depressed, it may look like a little crater on the skin. Basal cell tumors grow slowly.Internal tumors can also affect the skin. Adrenal tumors can cause the skin to become thin.A ferret may have several tumors scattered on their skin.

, Internal tumors can cause the abdomen to swell. For example, liver tumors can make the liver so large that the abdomen distends.Lymphomas, which affect many organs (e.g., spleen, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract), can also cause abdominal distension.Adrenal tumors can create a ‘pot-bellied’ appearance, which means the abdomen is enlarged., The vulva is the external opening of a female’s genitalia. A swollen vulva is characteristic of adrenal tumors. The vulva swells because of an increased amount of estrogen being secreted from the adrenal glands.A swollen vulva also occurs when an intact female ferret is in heat. If the female ferret is spayed and has a swollen vulva, then an adrenal tumor is a likely cause.

, Tremors (muscle shakes) are common with insulinomas. Insulinomas cause blood sugar levels to fall dangerously low. In response to low blood sugar, the adrenals secrete adrenaline. The extra adrenaline in the blood would cause a ferret with an insulinoma to experience muscle tremors.Muscle tremors look like little, periodic ripples in the muscle. A ferret would not be able to control the tremors.

, Tumors often cause decreased appetites in ferrets. A ferret with liver cancer, lymphoma, or an adrenal tumor will eat less and subsequently lose weight.On the contrary, ferrets with insulinoma often eat more, yet still lose weight.When you feed your ferret, measure how much food you give it and observe how much (or how little) food is left over at the end of mealtime.

, Lymphoma can cause diarrhea and vomiting, especially if the tumor is located in the gastrointestinal tract. The feces may have a red tinge due to blood.The diarrhea may also be chronic., In male ferrets, adrenal tumors can cause a cyst (fluid-filled mass) to form in or around the prostate gland. The prostate gland is located near the urethra, the tube through which urine passes after leaving the bladder. If the prostate gland has a cyst in or around it, urine will be blocked from leaving the bladder, making urination difficult if not impossible.A urine blockage is an emergency situation in ferrets. If a male ferret cannot urinate, it would need immediate veterinary treatment to relieve the blockage and prevent bladder rupture., Healthy ferrets are very playful and energetic.Some tumors, though, can make a ferret feel weak and tired. Liver cancer, insulinomas, and lymphomas often cause lethargy and weakness in ferrets.Occasionally, lethargy occurs in a ferret with an adrenal tumor.Adrenal tumors can also cause muscle atrophy, which is the loss of muscle mass.Without out much muscle mass, a ferret becomes weak.
Weakness can form very rapidly with lymphoma., Tumors in ferrets can sometimes cause unusual behavior and personality changes. For example, adrenal tumors make male ferrets very aggressive due to increased testosterone levels.Insulinomas can cause several personality changes, including irritability and stargazing (staring strangely into space).If your ferret seems to be acting a little strange, a tumor may be the cause.

, A tumor in a ferret must be diagnosed by a veterinarian. A detailed history is one tool a vet will use to diagnose the tumor.Importantly, a history should include a description of the symptoms: what they look like and when they started. A description of the ferret’s diet and housing environment would also be helpful information for your vet.


It may be helpful to keep a diary of the ferret’s diet and symptoms.

, A physical examination is another key aspect of making a tumor diagnosis.During the physical exam, your vet will look over your ferret’s entire body and listen to its heart and lungs. If internal tumors are greatly enlarged, your vet may be able to feel the tumors (e.g., lumps in the lymph nodes). Based on the history and physical exam, your vet will recommend diagnostic tests to diagnose the tumor.

, A blood sample is a helpful diagnostic tool. For example, a blood sample can be analyzed for sex hormone levels, which is helpful for diagnosing an adrenal tumor.If a ferret has lymphoma, the blood work will show increased levels of lymphocytes (immune system cells).Blood work is also important for liver cancer.Liver cancer would cause an increase in liver enzyme levels.
For an insulinoma, your vet would take a blood sample 4 or more hours after the ferret’s last meal to measure fasting blood glucose., A biopsy is a sample of tissue. It is often the most definitive method of tumor diagnosis. A biopsy is a surgical procedure, so your vet would anesthetize your ferret to take the sample. After taking the biopsy, your vet would send it to a veterinary pathologist for further analysis.


Biopsy results would let your vet know if the tumor is benign or malignant (harmful and likely to spread).
Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is another sampling technique. With FNA, your vet would draw up a small tumor sample using a thin needle and look at the sample under the microscope. FNA can provide an initial tumor diagnosis that would be confirmed by a biopsy.
FNA can provide an initial diagnosis for mast cell tumors., For internal tumors, x-rays and ultrasounds can be effective diagnostic tools. For example, with liver cancer, chest x-rays would show if the cancer has spread to the lungs.X-rays and ultrasound are useful for visualizing lymphoma.They can also indicate if internal organs are enlarged due to tumors.


Ultrasound is sometimes helpful for identifying adrenal tumors.However, ferret adrenals are very tiny and may be hard to see on an ultrasound image.
If your vet wants to perform FNA on an internal tumor, ultrasound can be used to identify where your vet should put the needle.
Not all tumors need to be visualized. For example, an insulinoma diagnosis is usually based on clinical signs and blood work results., Your vet will come up with a treatment plan after examining your ferret and diagnosing the specific tumor type. General tumor treatment strategies include surgical removal of the tumor, chemotherapy (drugs that kill tumor cells), and radiation therapy (a beam of radiation that kills tumor cells). Sometimes, more than one type of treatment may be needed to kill all of the tumor cells, or if the cancer cells come back after initial treatment.


Your vet will determine how long your ferret will need treatment.
Ask questions about the treatment plan: How do the drugs work and what are their side effects? How long will it take for my ferret to recover? What are the risks of surgery? Will the cancer come back?

Pick out a lizard that lives wild in your area.,
Research care and local laws on the internet or in books.,
Create as large of a home as you can for your pet, making sure that you provide temperatures and hiding places.,
Catch one out in the wild:


Look in local forest areas, desert areas, fields etc.,
Make an inviting trap for your lizard:


Take some cardboard, poster board, or foam core and cut it at least as big as the opening of the tank or box.,
Make a meal for your lizard:


Get a food that is appropriate for the lizard's size, like a cricket or something to that effect.,
When the lizard comes to get the food, drop the box or aquarium on it and you've got your pet.",How to Capture a Pet Lizard from the Wild,";
, Once you are sure you have the proper permits for capturing a wild reptile, you can focus on its habitat for now.

, Remember some animals never adapt to captivity. Ask around, many experienced animal keepers (usually not pet stores) can advise you on what is ""easy"" to care for.

, for lizards.
Use the knowledge you have gained from researching to know where to look.
Catch it near home:
To catch a lizard that hangs out around your house, get a 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium, or some other rather large and clear box. It is recommended you use a clear box, so the lizards (and yourself) can see into /through the box.
Make a lizard-friendly backyard. If you don't know exactly what to look for, go in your backyard and lay out boards, plants, old mats, etc. in the dirt. Wait about 5 months.

,
Tape this to the tank as if it were hinged on, with the 'hinges' at the bottom of the tank.
Take some string or thread, and tie or tape it to the top portion of the foam core.

,
Place a few live crickets into the tank, and place the tank on its side (long ways) so there is a big opening.

, Never release it back into the wild. You can disrupt social order, introduce at the wrong season, and even spread disease.

Ask your vet about preventative drugs.,
Consider testing your ferret first.,
Administer the drug while mosquitos are active.",How to Prevent Heartworm in Ferrets2," Heartworm medication can help kill larvae that are transmitted to your ferret and help prevent infection. These drugs, however, usually cannot kill adult heartworms. They are administered either daily or monthly depending on the drug your vet recommends. Your vet will need to examine your ferret in order to make the best assessment of what drug is best for your ferret.Your vet will likely prescribe the long-time preventative drug ivermectin, or a new, but highly favorable combination of imidacloprid and moxidectin. Go with whatever they recommend.Preventative medications are most often prescribed as monthly oral tablets. Your vet may even prescribe a medication designed for cats and direct you to break tablets into portions based on your ferret's weight.

, Ask your vet about testing your ferret for heartworm before administering preventative medication. Taking preventative medication can be dangerous if your ferret is already infected with developing heartworms. Most of the time, an infection will be apparent, but it may be worth having your vet do a blood test before beginning a preventative medication routine., Preventative heartworm medication regimens sometimes need to be administered year-round. Depending on where you live, a shorter mosquito season may allow you to administer preventative heartworm medication for only part of the years. Warm, humid climates have the longest and most dangerous mosquito seasons.Provide ongoing preventative heartworm medication to your ferret if you live in an area that is hospitable to mosquitos year-round, such as the Southeastern U.S.
If your ferret does not like to eat their medication, try crushing it up and mixing into something you know they life to eat.

Watch for symptoms of heartworm.,
Look out for other signs of illness as well.,
Have a vet diagnose your ferret.",How to Prevent Heartworm in Ferrets3," A single adult heartworm can kill your ferret. Accordingly, early diagnosis of a potential infection is of vital importance. Catch an infection as early as possible by watching out for lethargy, chronic cough, shortness of breath, and/or low physical stamina. If any of these symptoms develop, take your ferret to the vet., A ferret with heartworm may exhibit either mild or severe symptoms. This can make diagnosing heartworm challenging. Watch out for weakness in your ferret’s hindquarters, changes in their eating habits, or swelling in their abdomen. While lots of illnesses may contribute to these symptoms, they should be monitored and reported to your vet., Your vet will rely on observation of symptoms, x-rays, and blood tests to determine whether your ferret has heartworm. Blood tests alone do not work as well on ferrets as they do on cats and dogs, so your vet will likely need to do a thorough assessment of your ferret’s health. While surgery to remove adult heartworms has successfully occurred, the chances of recovery from an advanced heartworm infection are quite low. Further, the medications capable of killing adult heartworms can also result in in your ferret's death. Take prevention seriously!"

Identify the sex of an Oustalet's chameleon.",How to Tell if a Chameleon Is Male or Female," Many species of chameleon exhibit some slight indication of genitalia. This is a small bulge on the underside of the male chameleon, right at the base of the tail. It may not develop until the male chameleon is several months old. Female chameleons will be smooth at the base of the tail., Chameleon coloration varies widely by species, but it is not unusual for male chameleons to be more brightly colored. In many common species, it is only the male who develops striking coloration. If you buy a baby chameleon, its colors may not have developed. Depending on the species, it may be several months before your chameleon's color comes in.


Female chameleons may exhibit fascinating colors when in heat, and startling patterns when gravid, carrying eggs., In most species of chameleon, males tend to be larger. This difference can be inconspicuous or striking, with the male growing to twice the size of the female. Size, however, varies hugely depending on species and care. Some species do have larger females, and others have no size difference at all., If you know the species, look up the sex characteristics and determine whether yours is male or female. If you do not yet know the species of chameleon, visit a library or go online and read about the different species. Do an image search and see what species look similar to your chameleon.


There are more than 180 types of chameleon classified in the world, but only a few that are common household pets.Ask the dealer. If you didn't learn the sex or species of your chameleon when you bought it, contact the person you bought it from. This is information relevant to your chameleon's care, and they should provide you with it.
If you caught your chameleon in the wild, research the kind of chameleons local to your area. However, know that capturing wild chameleons is ill-advised and may be illegal.

, Check for a hemi-penal bulge. Male panther chameleons have a small lump at the base of the tail, while females do not. Males tend to be larger, and may grow up to 20 inches long. Panther chameleons all exhibit bright and varied coloration, but male panthers may be lovelier., Check for tarsal spurs. The males of this species are born with small bumps on the backs of their hind legs. If your veiled chameleon has no tarsal spur, she is female. Males also begin to exhibit a hemi-penal bulge, or small lump at the base of the tail, when they are several months old.If you have several veiled chameleons, you may notice a contrast in the sizes and coloration of different sexes. Male chameleons have a bigger casque, are larger, and are more brightly colored than females.
The ""casque,"" or spur on the head, can grow to an excess of 3 inches in male chameleons., Check for a hemi-penal bulge, or small lump at the base of your chameleon's tail. Males will have a bump, while the underside of a female's tail base should be smooth. While both male and females of this species may bear horns above the eyes and mouth, this is more common among males., Check for a hemi-penal bulge. Male Carpet chameleons have a bulge at the base of their tail, and tend to be larger than females. Females will not grow to eight inches and will be smooth at the base of the tail., Check Fischer's chameleons for a hemi-penal bulge, present on males. Both males and females may have a ""double rostral process,"" a long bumpy double face prong. These are more pronounced in males, and occasionally absent in females., Measure your Flapneck chameleon. Female flapneck chameleons are larger than males, and may grow to be up to 16 inches long. Male flapneck chameleons are smaller. Check smaller chameleons for a hemi-penal bulge., Check for horns. Males of this species have 2-6 horns on their faces. They also have a large crest on their back, and a casque, or head-bump. Males have a hemi-penal bulge. Females are altogether smoother, possessing neither bulge, horns, crest, or casque., Check for eggs. It is extremely difficult to sex Meller's chameleons, as they are virtually identical in appearance. If you have multiple Meller's chameleons, try to catch them mating. A female may lay eggs.Outside of this, an x-ray may be the only way to determine the sex of your chameleon

, Check for green color. Only female Oustalet chameleon's may be green. Both males and females may be grey, brown, black, or white. Check as well for a hemi-penal bulge, indicative of a male. Females are smaller, while males may grow to be as long as 30 inches."
"
Decide what kind of habitat you want.,
Include a window.,
Add an artificial light.Chameleons need a basking bulb to stay healthy.",How to Make a Habitat for Your Chameleon1," There are two kinds of habitats: vivariums and free range habitats. Vivariums are the more traditional type of chameleon habitat, and are similar to the lizard cages you might see at the zoo. Open range habitats, by contrast, provide a whole room for your chameleon to wander around in freely.If you have the space in your home available, consider giving your chameleon a room of its own.
Free range habitats give the chameleon more freedom to move around and more opportunities for stimulation than a vivarium.
Animals kept in vivariums might end up with rostral abrasions (injuries on the nose or snout caused by rubbing against the glass). Rostral abrasions can be painful and cause infection.
If you have other pets like cats or dogs that could get into the chameleon room, choose a vivarium.
Only small leaf chameleons can thrive in vivariums.;
, The room you house your chameleon in should have at least one large window, preferably one facing east.If the window faces west, be sure to provide cool areas where the chameleon can get out of direct sunlight, since afternoon sun can be hotter than morning sun.


North-facing windows are not recommended because they do not provide any direct sunlight.
South-facing windows are also not recommended because they can get too hot. However, they are acceptable if you provide enough cool retreats for your chameleon.

, If your chameleon cannot be housed in a room with natural light, you'll need to provide an artificial ultraviolet light as well. Install both ultraviolet and basking bulbs outside and on top of the cage, or in a location where the chameleon can easily access them if it is housed in a free range habitat.


In the natural world, chameleons get ultraviolet light naturally. Ultraviolet light helps them digest food properly.
The basking bulb, on the other hand, helps chameleons regulate their body temperature.
Ensure you place a climbable object (a rock, tree, or stable branch) close to the basking bulb so the lizard can access it.
Ultraviolet lights need to be changed every six months, even if they still provide visible light. They lose their ultraviolet properties over time.
Turn off all lights at night.

Prevent escapes before they happen.,
Close off all escape routes.,
Check the enclosure again.,
Examine warm, covered spots.,
Look, then look again.,
Set up “traps.” Skinks and similar lizards are intelligent and crafty, but you can (at least sometimes) outwit them by setting up some homemade traps — which are really more like tracking devices.If you are confident your runaway is in a single room, close it off, lay some plastic shopping bags out flat on the floor, and wait quietly and patiently outside the door.,
Lure it home with a treat.,
Wait for it to relax.,
Recapture it carefully.,
Provide care and prepare for next time.",How to Catch a Pet Lizard or Skink," Skinks and similar lizards are notorious escape artists and excellent hiders, so prevention is definitely the best cure when it comes to catching one.


Make sure you have the proper type of enclosure for your lizard, with no cracks, seams, or holes which it can squeeze through.
Most importantly, make sure the enclosure has a tight fitting top that latches and that remains latched all times. Using a book or some other makeshift lid will not cut it, as a skink can and will slide or lift a lid just enough to slip out, or injure itself in the attempt.;
, Think about the manhunts you see on TV. The first goal is to isolate the fugitive within a known area by blocking off every way out you can.


If you know the escape was recent and are confident the lizard is still in the room, close all windows and doors, and place a rolled-up towel along the bottom of the door.If it may already be out of the room, try to close off that section of the house, or the whole house if necessary. If it escapes outside, the difficulty in finding and recapturing it will increase substantially.
Don’t forget about heating or air conditioning vents as well, and turn off any fans while you’re at it, for the escapee's safety.

, Skinks and their lizard compatriots hide in plain sight for a living (or, more accurately, in order to live), so be certain yours is not playing “hide-and-seek” in its enclosure.If you discover you left the lid open on the enclosure and don’t immediately see the lizard inside, seal up the enclosure, close off the perimeter, then come back and more rigorously search the enclosure.
Look under rocks, leaves, food dishes, and anything else that your lizard could fit behind or beneath. Repeat the process at least once more a bit later. Don’t underestimate how well skinks can hide, even in a small area.

, Skinks and lizards, especially when in hiding, like to find cozy, concealed spots. Try to look at your room or home like a lizard would, pointing out the spots you might choose in its situation.Lizards have been known to hide underneath refrigerators, because they are warm (due to the vent fan) and well-concealed. Tubs and showers, especially if enclosed by a curtain, are often warm and damp and thus also appealing hiding spots.
In a bedroom, consider spots like: under (or inside) pillows, sheets, and mattresses; in slippers or shoes; behind (or on) curtains; and under (or inside) chests of drawers, to name a few.

, A cursory examination of a room is not likely to turn up anything. Expect to have to conduct a detailed search, and perhaps repeat the process.Conduct a room-to-room search as necessary. Once you have “cleared” a room with a thorough examination, seal it off whenever possible by closing doors and putting towels along the bottom to block the gap.
Within each room of your search, don’t just look — take things down or take them apart. Remove items from shelves; pull off your sheets and lift up the mattress; empty the cupboards. Use a flashlight, along with a handheld mirror for dark, hard-to-reach areas.
If your skink or lizard has managed to escape outside, your best bet is to set up a grid search within the likely escape zone. Break your yard, for instance, into squares and observe / examine each carefully one at a time. Lizards blend in naturally, so your best bet is often to watch carefully for movement., Before long, the lizard will likely come out to take a look around, and will hopefully walk over a bag as it moves. By listening carefully, you should be able to identify the source of the crinkling sound and zero in on that section of the room.
If, again, the lizard is isolated within a room, but you need to delay your search or wait for morning, you can track its movements with flour. Dust the floor with a thin layer of flour, wait for the lizard to make tracks, then follow them to its hiding spot. And yes, this does make a big mess.

, Your pet lizard may enjoy his newfound freedom for a bit, but it won’t be long until it’s time to eat again. The lure of a tasty snack may be enough to bring it out into the open or even back into the enclosure.Crickets are the classic example of lizard bait, but other options can include silkworms, mealworms, earthworms, or snails. Basically, use your skink or lizard’s favorite treat.If your escapee is likely within range of the enclosure, leave it open and place the bait inside. Otherwise, place the bait in an open area near where you suspect the lizard to be hiding.

, If you have the lizard isolated within a defined area, time can be your friend. Eventually, with or without a bait lure, it will likely feel comfortable enough to venture out from its hiding spot. If you can manage to wait patiently, you should have a chance to spot and catch it.Loud noises and sudden movements are not your allies when conducting a search for a skink or similar lizard. Be deliberate in your movements and keep potentially distracting or frightening sounds to a minimum. Remain calm, even if concerned about finding your little friend. Odds are good that it will turn up eventually.

, When you do eventually spot your runaway, don’t lunge at it or try to throw a towel or net over it. Be quiet, calm, and deliberate in your approach and recapture maneuver in order to avoid frightening it back into hiding, or worse, injuring it.


If you need to cover it with a bucket, box, or other container in order to capture it, do so carefully so as to not injure the lizard. A transparent container is best so you can observe the escapee on the inside. Place the container upside-down on the floor and over the lizard, slide a thin piece of cardboard between the container and floor, and transfer the whole thing over to the home enclosure.
If you pick up the lizard by hand, do so gently, as you would any other time you hold it. Be sure to wash your hands any time you hold a lizard or skink, however, to reduce your risk of acquiring salmonella, which can reside on their bodies.Never pick up a lizard by the head or tail, which will cause discomfort and may cause damage. Instead, do the following:For small lizards (under about 8 inches), you should place your hand over the body and gently secure the neck between your thumb and forefinger.
For medium lizards, including many skinks (up to about 20 inches), straddle one hand across its back at the front legs (securing the neck as above), and use your other hand to grasp the rear hips.
Large lizards will require both hands, and perhaps your elbow and side to restrain it, and often requires a second set of hands as well. You may need to wear gloves and heavy clothing to protect against bites and scratches.



, Your pet has been through an ordeal, and may need some tender loving care. At the same time, though, it is probably already planning its next escape.


Feed and hydrate your lizard immediately after recapture, especially if it was missing for more than a short period of time. Show it how glad you are to have it back.If you know or can guess how your lizard escaped, be sure to block off that avenue. Skinks and other lizards are smart enough to use the same escape route over and over again. Make your pet work harder if it wants to run away again."

Choose your cage.,
Decide what kind of bottom you want.,
Install necessary plumbing.,
Lay down substrate.,
Add a natural touch.,
Put a top on it.",How to Make a Habitat for Your Chameleon2," You could choose a horizontally-oriented glass aquarium tank, or a vertically-oriented screened cage. Both are readily available for sale at your local pet or lizard store. Chameleons can grow up to 24 inches long, so you should get a cage that has enough room for it to move around. A tank that holds 210 gallons should be sufficient.Alternately, a screened cage should be at least 20 inches wide, 20 inches deep, and 45 inches tall.


When it comes to choosing a chameleon cage, bigger is always better.Chameleons love to climb, so a screened cage is probably your best choice.

, A true bottom habitat is one in which the tank is entirely self-contained, and water is absorbed directly into the substrate and/or evaporated out into the tank. However, true bottomed tanks can be problematic: plants might get waterlogged and humidity levels might fluctuate. A false bottom is one that allows excess water to drain through the bottom of the tank or habitat and into, for instance, a drip tray. False bottomed vivariums provide better drainage.Alternately, the false bottom could connect a water source below the substrate to a waterfall or drip wall.
To make a false bottom, install short pieces of PVC piping across the bottom with the open end facing up. These will act like stable pillars for your false bottom. Lay plastic egg crate frame wrapped in landscape fabric on top of the piping. These materials are available at most hardware stores. This arrangement will allow excess water to drip below the substrate and false bottom.

, If you want to include a drip wall or stream in your habitat, you’ll need to connect the bottom of your tank (where the water accumulates under your false bottom) with return lines to your drip wall. If you have any questions about what you need, talk to your local pet store or lizard store proprietor for advice.


Connect your water system to a reverse osmosis machine. These machines will dissolve salts and other impurities from the water, and will help you avoid mineral deposits on your habitat. They will also prevent potential skin problems with your chameleon.Connect a small sump pump to the water beneath the habitat.
If you do not include a pump system, you’ll need to mist the vivarium with a spray bottle twice each day for about thirty seconds each time.

, Substrate is the bottom layer of the vivarium that the chameleon will walk on. There are many choices for chameleon substrates. You might choose coco coir bricks, shredded tree fern, orchid bark, or a mix of these. The best option is shredded newspaper. There are also chameleon substrate mixes available at most pet stores.


Avoid kitty litter, sand, corn cob, gravel, and bedding that traps moisture.Change your substrate when you notice it is soiled or excessively damp.

, A few faux rocks, artificial plants (or real plants), and vines will make your vivarium comfortable for your chameleon. Attach driftwood and faux rocks to the back of the tank with silicone binder.Including plants in the layout is crucial for your chameleon. Chameleons prefer to drink from leaves, so you must spray the leaves at least twice a day to ensure the chameleon stays hydrated.

, In order to keep your chameleon from escaping and getting into trouble, you’ll have to secure the terrarium with a lid. In the case of aquarium tanks, you need to strike a balance between keeping the environment humid -- which chameleons love -- and having it so humid that the vivarium’s interior is obscured by moisture on the glass. An easy solution is to keep only a thin strip of the top open to the air.This strip should be of fine screen or wire.This way, fresh air will flow through the cage but it will still stay relatively toasty within.

"
"
Choose the room you want to use.,
Provide a temperature gradient.The room should include a 75-100 watt incandescent bulb or heat lamp to provide at least one area where the chameleon can warm up to a toasty 92-94 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Choose the furnishings.,
Select your foliage.,
Provide plumbing.,
Bathe your chameleon.",How to Make a Habitat for Your Chameleon3," Ensure the room is not a high-traffic area, and is free of dangerous objects or machinery.Bedrooms that you don’t use (a good option if your children have moved out), sun rooms, or former offices are good options for your free range chameleon habitat.


Upstairs rooms are best, because the chameleon won’t be stressed by seeing passing animals and cars.
Rooms that should never be used include bathrooms, family bedrooms, recreation rooms, garages, or utility rooms.
If you don’t want to completely devote one whole room to your chameleon, ensure that the room you choose provides a balance of features that accommodate both you and your chameleon.

, On the low end, provide a shaded space away from the windows where the chameleons can cool down to around 75-82 degrees Fahrenheit.


By providing a range of distinct temperature zones within the room, your chameleon will be able to select a comfortable temperature for itself.
Place an incandescent bulb or heat lamp near the top of a climbable tree or perch to prevent burns.

, If your chameleon has free range in a room, ensure that you don’t have anything that you wouldn’t want your chameleon climbing, walking, or pooping on. All surfaces -- tables, furniture, and window ledges -- should be smooth and easily cleaned. Plastic tables and chairs are good furnishings. Plastic coverings to cover your pillows are readily available at many home furnishing stores.


Materials of plastic, Formica, bamboo, and stainless steel are best., Chameleons love climbing on trees, both to explore and to just sit and bathe in the sun. Weeping figs and bamboo palms are favored for the climbing opportunities they afford.Smaller plants like the heartleaf philodendrons, moth orchids, peace lilies, and bromeliads enhance the natural feel of the free range habitat.For a full list of plants that chameleons can tolerate, check http://flchams.com/chameleon-safe-plant-list/.

, If you want to go all-out and transform your chameleon room into a miniature chameleon forest, you will need to place your plants and decorative fountains on a sturdy mesh rack with trays or buckets beneath each plant and water source. You might also have to incorporate a sump pump and reverse osmosis machine into your room, just as you would in a vivarium setup.


If you choose to do this, ensure your pumps are housed in a small, sealed case that the chameleon cannot access.
If you include a mister in the room, you should have tile or vinyl floors (not carpet), and paint your walls with exterior grade paint.If you have a mister, you’ll need to install gutters as well.

, If you don’t want to get so extensive that you rewire your home’s plumbing and give up an entire room, you could satisfy your chameleon’s sanitary and water needs another way. Put your chameleon on a small tree (a fig tree would work nicely) and place the tree/chameleon combo in the shower for about 30-45 minutes every other day.Set the water to a lukewarm temperature. This will give the chameleon the opportunity to bathe, defecate, and drink water. Let the tree and chameleon get relatively dry, then move them back into the free range room.

Buy live crickets.,
Vary the chameleon’s diet with other insects.,
Gut load the insects.,
Dust the insects with vitamin supplements.",How to Feed a Chameleon1," Crickets are the primary food given to chameleons in captivity. This is because crickets are easy to feed and breed. Chameleons also enjoy hunting crickets in their cage. You can find live crickets at a pet store or at a store that specializes in lizard and reptile care. These insects will probably not be fed, and you cannot feed your chameleon these straight from the pet store. They must first be gut loaded and dusted.


Crickets should be no larger than the width of your chameleon's head.Baby chameleons can be fed every day. Chameleons up to three months old should be given as many small crickets as they can eat.
Depending on the species, you can start feeding them every other day when your chameleon is between six and twelve months old. Most adult chameleons will eat between five and twelve crickets per feeding.;
, While crickets will form the bulk of your chameleon’s diet, you can add other insects to the mix. These insects will be bought, raised, and gut loaded just like crickets. These other insects should serve as occasional treats to your chameleon to supplement their cricket diet. These include:


Silk worms
Mealworms
Wax worms
Flies
Moths
CockroachesLocusts
Hornworms
Butterworms, Gut loading is the process of feeding the insects certain foods to boost their nutrition value to chameleons. To properly gut load the food, you should feed them nutritious, high calcium foods a few hours before they are to be fed to the chameleon.Some good foods to use include:


Leafy greens such as mustard greens, alfalfa, watercress, collard greens, and dandelion leaves
Sweet potato
Carrots
Oranges
Mango
Broccoli
Apples, It is important that your chameleon receives proper nutrients. You can boost their vitamin and calcium intake by coating the insects in special dust. This mineral and vitamin dust is specially formulated for lizards and can be found in most pet stores. Mist the crickets with water, and gently sprinkle the dust over the crickets. Do this immediately before feeding.For young chameleons, you will need to dust their food with calcium supplements two or three times a week. You can use a general multivitamin dust once every two weeks. Mature chameleons may only need their food dusted with calcium once a week.Chameleons are susceptible to Vitamin A deficiency. While gut loading insects with foods high in Vitamin A might be sufficient, you can also add a vitamin A supplement dust to the insects.A good calcium dust will contain twice as much calcium as phosphorus.Read the label to make sure that there is a good ratio.
Different brands have different ratios of vitamins. Always read the label to find the right dosage for your chameleon."

Use your hands if you need to catch a lizard immediately but do not have a net or trap.,
Prepare a temporary home.,
Locate the skink.,
Lure the skink out.,
Move slowly towards the skink.,
Quickly move your hand over the skink.",How to Catch a Blue Tailed Skink1," Catching a blue tailed skink with your hands is very difficult, as skinks are quite fast and quickly shed their tails. If you have no other options or like a challenge, then you can try to catch one this way.


If you have trouble luring the skink out of its hiding place, then it will be difficult to use your hands. Try using a trap instead.;
, Any unscented, sturdy container will be fine for a temporary home. You can add local leaves and grasses, along with food and water. Blue-tailed skinks will eat spiders and other insects, but the easiest food to acquire is from crickets.


Although it is not recommended, you should do research on the most suitable home for this skink if you are preparing a permanent home. It may help to talk to employees at a local vivarium, which can be found online on in the yellow pages.
If you plan to keep the skink permanently, check the laws and permits for your area first.

, If you know where the skink lives stays around often, then move towards that area. If you can find a hole where the lizard comes out from, that is even better.

, Blue-tailed skinks are attracted to light. Set up a light and some bait (either crickets or meal worms) near the area where you think the skink is located., You do not want to scare it too early, so get yourself close to it slowly and without abrupt movements. You should come towards it from behind (or above, if possible) so that it is less likely to see you.

, Use your hand to quickly capture the lizard from above or behind. Make sure you try to catch it on its body, rather than its tail. If you try to catch the tail, it is very likely that the tail will simply fall off and the skink will escape.


Be careful not to squeeze too hard, or else you could injure the skink.
Keep your fingers away from the skink’s mouth. Although skinks are not poisonous, it can still hurt when they bite!

Select crickets to feed your chameleon.,
Feed in the morning.,
Place a few insects in the leaves and branches.,
Mist the chameleon’s cage.,
Give them leafy greens.",How to Feed a Chameleon2," From your live crickets, you should measure out the proper size and number to feed your chameleon. This can vary based on your chameleon’s age, size, gender, and species. In general, you should not feed your chameleon a cricket that is any larger than the width of their head.Chameleons up to three months should be given as many small crickets as they can eat. They may also enjoy fruit and house flies.Veiled and Panther Chameleons: Chameleons up to six months old should eat between ten and twelve crickets a day. Between six and twelve months, they should have ten to twelve crickets every other day. Adults over a year old should eat between seven and ten large crickets every other day.Jackson’s Chameleons: Chameleons up to six months should eat between ten and twelve small crickets a day. Between six and twelve months, they should eat between eight and ten medium crickets every other day. Adults should eat between six and eight medium to large crickets every other day.Pygmy Chameleons: Between three and six months, they should have between six and ten small crickets daily. After six months, they should have between four and six crickets every other day.Flapneck, Graceful and Senegal Chameleons: Between three and six months, they should be given ten to twelve small crickets daily. Juveniles between six and twelve months should eat ten to twelve medium crickets every other day. Adults need five to seven small to medium crickets every other day., Feeding your chameleon early in the day can help them digest their food properly. Find a good, consistent schedule to feed your chameleons that works with your daily life.Remember that you will have to gut load the insects a few hours before you feed the chameleon.


You may want to keep track of your feedings with a planner, calendar, or schedule. Check off dates that you fed the chameleon to make sure that they are fed the proper amount at the right times.

, If you do not have leaves or branches in your habitat, you can place them on rocks, furniture, or other items in the cage. You may place these relatively near to the chameleon. Remember to close the enclosure afterwards.


The chameleon should see the insects moving and will slowly move towards them. You may want to watch your chameleon to make sure he notices the insects and that he is feeding on them.
Do not leave too many live crickets in the cage at once. Some insects are aggressive and may bite your chameleon at night.Check under the rocks, plants, and other objects in the cage to make sure that there are no crickets hiding., Your chameleon will drink water off the plants and objects in their habitat. Using a spray bottle, mist the cage twice a day. You can also attach a dropper to the top of the cage, but you should make sure that the water falls onto plants in the cage so that your chameleon will know to drink it. Chameleons will not drink out of a bowl., While most chameleons will be happy eating a varied diet of insects, some do enjoy the occasional plant. You can try giving them mustard or collard greens. Mist the leaves with water, and watch to see if your chameleon eats them.Some chameleons will even eat fruit. You can cut up a small slice of mango or apple, and place it in their cage. Do not be worried if they do not eat it. It just means that your chameleon does not want fruit.

"
"
Find a proper cup.,
Place the insects in the cup.,
Put the cup in the cage.",How to Feed a Chameleon3," Any kind of plastic cup can help you feed your chameleon. The sides should be tall enough to prevent the insects from escaping.


You should use a cup that has opaque sides. If you use a clear cup, the chameleon may not realize that it is there, and they may injure themselves trying to reach the insects.You may have success with an eight ounce cup. Some recommend that you use a cup as large as sixteen or twenty-four ounces., Place the proper amount of crickets or other insects inside the cup before you place it in the cage. If you desire, you can dust them in their vitamin or mineral supplement while they are in the cup.

, Chameleons will likely come at the cup from above, so it is good to make sure that the cup is placed low in the cage. You may even put it on a low-lying branch. Your chameleon may learn over time that their food appears in the cup, and you may even notice them hanging out near the cup when it is time to eat.You can also punch holes in the cup, and hang it from a plant in the cage.
Make sure that you use the same feeding cup for each chameleon. Do not mix the cups, or you risk spreading germs between cages.

Use a net.,
Prepare a temporary home.,
Obtain a net.,
Lure the skink out of its hiding place.,
Trap the skink by closing the net around it.,
Slide a piece of cardboard or other sturdy paper under the net.,
Turn the net over so that the skink falls inside.,
Turn the net back upside down to put the skink into its temporary home.",How to Catch a Blue Tailed Skink2," Do this if you have not had success with your hands, or do not wish to touch the skink. Using a net can be easier than your hands, since you have more reach on the skink and do not have to worry about it shedding its tail.


If you have trouble luring the skink out of its hiding place, then it will be difficult to use a net. Try using a trap instead.

, Any unscented, sturdy container will be fine for a temporary home. You can add local leaves and grasses along with food and water. Blue-tailed skinks will eat spiders and other insects, but the easiest food to acquire is from crickets.


Although it is not recommended, you should do research on the most suitable home for this skink if you are preparing a permanent home. It may help to talk to employees at a local vivarium, which can be found online on in the yellow pages.
If you plan to keep the skink permanently, check the laws and permits for your area first.

, The best nets are butterfly nets, which have a long handle and wide net on the end.


A long handle will allow you to reach the skink from farther away, increasing your chances of catching the skink.
A wide net will also make it easier to catch the skink because you do not have to be so exact when enclosing it.

, Place a bowl of food and light near the area where the skink is hiding, in order to draw the skink out into the open.

, While the skink is busy eating, bring the net down and around it to trap it underneath. It is best to approach the skink from behind so that it is less likely to see you.

, Slide the cardboard under the net to trap the skink inside the net. This will prevent the skink from escaping when you turn the net over.

, While holding the cardboard over the opening of the net, turn the net over so that you can carry the skink. Keep the cardboard over the end so it does not jump or crawl out.

, Remove the cardboard and turn the net over to allow the skink to fall or crawl into its new home.

Use a trap when you have been unable to lure the skink out of its hiding place.,
Prepare a temporary home.,
Obtain or make a trap.,
Bait the trap.,
Set the trap out where a skink is likely to come.,
Check the trap several times a day.,
Be patient.,
Transfer the skink to its temporary home.",How to Catch a Blue Tailed Skink3," A trap can be set up and left for days while it waits to catch the skink. This reduces the amount of time spent on waiting for the skink to come out of hiding.

, Any unscented, sturdy container will be fine for a temporary home. You can add local leaves and grasses along with food and water. Blue-tailed skinks will eat spiders and other insects, but the easiest food to acquire is from crickets.


Although it is not recommended, you should do research on the most suitable home for this skink if you are preparing a permanent home. It may help to talk to employees at a local vivarium, which can be found online on in the yellow pages.
If you plan to keep the skink permanently, check the laws and permits for your area first.

, You can buy a glue trap or a mouse trap from a local hardware store. Alternatively you can make your own trap using a box and plastic wrap. Cover the opening of the box with plastic wrap and cut a slit in it about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long.


Glue traps are also humane and can be safely used for skinks.
If using a mouse trap, try to get one that does not snap down too quickly. You do not want to injure or kill the skink, just catch it.

, If using a glue trap, you should attach a few crickets to the glue. If using a mouse trap, you may need to use meal worms or dead crickets to bait it. If you are using a homemade trap, you should rest the bait (if it is lightweight) on top of the plastic wrap to lure the skink up there.

, Locate the area where you usually see the skink and set up the trap.

, You do not want the skink to starve or die of thirst before you release it so you should check the trap often to see if a skink has been caught.

, You probably will not catch the skink immediately, but eventually it should work. You may need to change the bait after several days to keep it from getting old or rotting.

, When you have caught a skink, you can transfer it to its temporary home that you have prepared.


For skinks caught in mouse traps or homemade traps, you can simply allow the skink to crawl into its new home.
If you have caught a skink using a glue trap, then pour a few tablespoons of cooking oil onto the trap. This will break down the adhesive and allow the skink to escape. You can also nudge the skink off the trap with your fingers, but be careful not to be bit or cause the tail to fall off.

Make sure that you actually want one.,
Pick the species of chameleon you want to get.,
Think about who can take care of your chameleon during vacations or a period of time when you are unable to take care of it.,
Ask questions about your chameleon from whoever you are buying it from.",How to Take Care of a Chameleon1," They are very fragile creatures that you need to understand before caring for one. Also, chameleons are reptiles that do not really like to be held so if you like a pet you can hold this might not be the right pet.


Chameleons are very easily stressed. They need a serene environment. They do not do well with loud music or frat parties. They do not interact well with any other pets. Do not force them to interact with dogs/cats/ferrets, etc.;
, Easier species to take care of are Veiled, Jackson's, or Panther Chameleons. Most chameleons on sale are about 3-8 weeks old.


Chameleons can have very distinctive personalities. Some like people, some don't. If you want to know, watch the chameleon being fed in the pet store before buying.

, You'll want to think of someone who's good with animals while you're away. An attentive person who knows a little about reptiles would be best.

, The salesperson will have information and will help you.

Gain the respect and trust of the gecko over a period of several months.,
Use thick gloves.,
Be prepared to be bitten.,
Coax your Tokay out of his cage carefully and gently.,
Avoiding looking directly at the Tokay.,
Hold the Tokay over your head.,
Stroke the underside of the gecko’s tail.,
Bring your gecko to body level and stroke his tail.,
Notice if he licks your hands as he walks on them.",How to Tame a Tokay Gecko," Tokay geckos are known to be temperamental and can respond aggressively if they are not comfortable with you. Take your time to bond with your Tokay over a period of several months before you try to handle him. Providing excellent care for your Tokay will show him you can be trusted and get him more used to your presence., The Tokay gecko’s bite can be quite painful and your gecko may latch on to your skin for up to an hour. To avoid being bitten, always use thick gloves when you are handling your Tokay.If you do not have access to thick gloves, it is not advised that you try to handle your Tokay. If you need to subdue the Tokay to clean his cage or remove an item from his cage without gloves, you can restrain him by gently pinning his head down and wrapping your fingers around his neck and body. However, this is very stressful for the gecko and should only be done when necessary., Many reptile experts argue against handling your gecko unless absolutely necessary due to their territorial nature and fierce bite. Only work on taming your gecko once you have owned him for a period of several months to a year and feel you are both ready for handling.If you are bitten by your Tokay while handling him, you can try dabbing one to two drops of white vinegar on his snout to get him to release his bite.You can also try dipping him in lukewarm water to get him to release his grip.Try to get him to release his bite gently, as you do not want to injure or threaten him.

, Do this to avoid damaging his toe pads and to avoid spooking him. Call his name and offer up your gloved hand, holding it flat. If your Tokay moves towards you, slide your hand underneath him.Most Tokays will run away from you if they are not comfortable being handled. Take this as a sign to try the taming session again the following day, when the Tokay may be more interested in having contact with you.

, Your eyes can be intimidating to your gecko. You can look away and watch your gecko from the corner of your eyes.

, If your Tokay is comfortable sitting on your hand, raise your hand so it is over your head. Your eyes can be intimidating to your gecko. Placing him above you will allow him to get used to being on your hand.Your Tokay may break a limb or injure himself if he leaps off of a hand and drops a long way to the floor. You may want to sit on the floor while you handle him to avoid injury to your Tokay.

, Once the gecko seems to be sitting comfortably on your hand, keep him above your head and use your finger to lightly stroke him. Do this for several minutes and then gently put the gecko back into his cage.Your Tokay may get spooked and run away from you, launching himself into the air and landing on the floor. Be prepared for this by doing a taming session in an open area that does not have any objects or spots where he can hide when he lands on the floor.
It can take several taming sessions to get your gecko comfortable enough to be stroked by you, so be patient and go slow. Do several taming sessions throughout the week and build up to stroking the underside of his tail. You need to show your gecko that you are not going to harm to threaten him when you coax him out of his cage.

, If your gecko seems comfortable with being stroked above your head, you can work to slowly bring hims down to body level. Continue to stroke the underside of his tail and try to coax him to walk from the back of one of your hands to the other hand., If your gecko is open to walking back and forth on your hands, this is a good sign he is calm and curious about being handled by you. As he walks back and forth, he may lick as he walks, tasting his environment. If you notice him doing this, you are close to having a friendly, tame Tokay.Once your Tokay is calm and tame, he will rarely bite you and will remain pretty docile in your hands. However, you should not handle your Tokay without gloves, even if he appears tame, to reduce your risk of a nasty Tokay bite.

Determine if you are ready to buy a chameleon.,
Select a reputable pet store or breeder.,
Purchase a captive-bred chameleon.,
Purchase a young chameleon.,
Check the chameleon for signs of illness.,
Do not purchase a chameleon through the mail.,
Select a cage type and size for your chameleon.,
Place the cage in a quiet area of your home.,
Put a substrate in the cage.,
Place branches in your chameleon’s cage.,
Add foliage to your chameleon’s cage.,
Place various light bulbs above your chameleon’s cage.",How to Buy a Chameleon," Chameleons can be relatively high-maintenance animals. Before you buy a chameleon, determine if you are ready to make the commitment to own one. You can start by learning what it costs to own a chameleon—one year of care (e.g., food, supplies, veterinary care) can cost between $900 and $1200.Look at your current budget to see if you can factor in an extra $100 per month for chameleon care.
A chameleon’s cage can take a fair amount of energy to set up and maintain. For example, the humidity and temperature of a chameleon’s cage should be monitored on a daily basis. The cage also needs to contain plenty of branches foliage that the chameleon can respectively climb and munch on.Consider talking with a chameleon expert or someone who owns a chameleon to have a better idea of what is involved in owning and caring for a chameleon.;
, Buying your chameleon from a reputable pet store or breeder will help ensure that he is healthy. A veterinarian who specializes in exotic veterinary medicine could provide you with recommendations on respectable chameleon breeders. If there are reptile shows in your area, you could visit one of the shows to identify breeders or ask for breeder recommendations.Reptile magazines can also provide information on chameleon breeders.Find out if your local pet store sells chameleons. If not, the staff at the store could possibly provide you with information on other quality pet stores that sell chameleons.

, Compared with wild-caught chameleons, captive-bred chameleons are healthier, less stressed, and less likely to carry a heavy parasite burden.In addition to having more parasites, wild-caught chameleons are usually more dehydrated than those that are captive-bred.It is illegal to capture and transport wild chameleons. Shipping wild chameleons can result in shortened lifespans in captivity and increased rates of mortality during shipping.A reputable pet store or chameleon breeder should not be involved in the capture or transport of wild chameleons.
Wherever you purchase your chameleon, verify that he was bred in captivity and not captured in the wild.
Among chameleon species, veiled chameleons and panther chameleons are most likely to be captive bred., Chameleons vary in their longevity, but most live between a few years and 10 years of age.Buying a young chameleon will increase the amount of type you could keep him as a pet.

, A reputable breeder or pet store should be able to give you a full medical history of the chameleon you intend to purchase. However, you should look the chameleon over yourself to make sure he is healthy before you purchase him.


Check his eyes—sunken eyes are an indicator of dehydration. Closed eyes in the daylight indicates general malaise in chameleons.If the chameleon’s color is dark or drab, he is either stressed, sick, or cold.A chameleon with bone abnormalities (e.g., curved back, swollen jaw, bowlegged stance) likely has a metabolic bone disease due to calcium deficiency.If you notice cheesy material or a green color in the chameleon’s mouth, he may have a bacterial infection called ‘mouth rot.’Chameleons do not like being handled. If the chameleon you intend to purchase does not resist being held (e.g., hissing, gaping mouth), he is likely sick.To ensure the chameleon is healthy, the breeder or pet staff may perform routine fecal exams on him and administer prophylactic deworming.Do not purchase a chameleon who is sick.

, You should avoid a mail-order purchase of your chameleon for several reasons. First, chameleons tend not to fare well when shipped. Shipping is very stressful for them, which could cause them to get very sick (or even die) during transport.Also, ordering a chameleon through the mail does not allow you to see him before he gets to you. You may not know until it is too late that he is sick or injured., Prepare your chameleon’s habitat before you bring him home. In fact, you could even start on this after you have decided to buy a chameleon. Chameleons grow quickly,so you will need to buy a fairly large cage. The minimum recommended cage size for a pet chameleon is three feet (91 centimeters) x three feet (91 centimeters) x four feet (122 centimeters).A screened or wire cage, a glass terrarium with a screened top, and a large and tall bird cage are suitable enclosures for a chameleon.This is only advisable if you live in a climate with an ambient temperature above 86F/30C. Otherwise, the chameleon will be too cold.
Chameleons like to climb and perch on branches, so a tall cage is ideal for a chameleon.A vivarium is the ideal housing solution. It has 3 sides made of wood or insulative material, and a glass front. It is thermally efficient and has good ventilation.
Your local pet store will have a variety of cages from which you can choose.

, Chameleons can be stressed very easily. Place your chameleon’s cage in a quite area that is relatively free of noise and distractions.Within the area, keep the cage out of the path of continual direct sunlight to prevent the cage from overheating.Position the cage so that it can receive a good amount of shade during the day., The substrate is what you will use to line the bottom of the cage. It should be easy for you to clean up and comfortable for the chameleon to walk on. Examples of good substrates are butcher paper, newspaper, and paper towels.Do not use wood chips, sand, or moss as substrates. They can cause internal blockage if your chameleon eats them, and they can harbor bacteria, mites, or mold.The substrates should be replaced weekly,and the bottom of the cage should be cleaned with bleach and water.The entire cage should be thoroughly cleaned once a month., Given your chameleon’s arboreal nature, he will want to have plenty of branches to climb and perch on. The branches should be a range of diameters.The variety of branch diameters will encourage your chameleon to use his feet in different ways.Having horizontal and vertical branches will also give your chameleon a variety of branches to climb on.Different orientations and diameters of branches can be form of environmental enrichment for him.
Your local pet store will have branches, along with containers to secure the branches in the cage.

, It is important to choose the right types of foliage to add to your chameleon’s cage. Hibiscus, pothos, and ficus plants are all good foliage choices.Fig trees, bamboo palms, and philodendrons are also good choices.Make sure to wash the foliage before placing it in your chameleon’s cage to rinse off any chemicals.You can also use plastic foliage, but real foliage is preferable.Misting the foliage on a daily basis will create humidity (ideal is 50 to 70% humidity) in your chameleon’s cage. Misting will also create a water source (water dripping from the leaves). You can purchase timed misters at your local pet store., The lights will provide a source of light and heat for your chameleon. One type of lightbulb you will need is a basking bulb, which will heat a focal point of your chameleon’s cage. The recommended temperature at that spot is 90 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit.An incandescent light bulb can be used for the basking light, but you may need to try different wattages to determine which wattage will produce the desired temperature.A fluorescent light should be placed next to the basking bulb. This light will provide UVB/A light, which your chameleon will use to produce the active form of vitamin D3.A light fixture will keep the lights situated above the cage.Do not use heated rocks as a heating source, since they could burn your chameleon.Night lights are not recommended, since they could make the cage too warm for your chameleon at night.Use a thermometer to keep your chameleon’s cage at 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and the mid-70s at night.Bulbs should be switched out about every 6 to 12 months."

Get the right environment.,
Take care of lighting, heating, temperature and health.,
Set up your tank correctly.,
Check on its health.,
Feed your leopard gecko.,
Handle them with care, although they tend to cope well with it.",How to Take Care of Your New Leopard Gecko," A Leopard gecko does great in 10–20 gallon (37.9–75.7 L) tanks pretty much all of their life. Options are an aquarium, terrarium, or vivarium. Although they are desert geckos, it is recommended that Leopard geckos have either dry Eco earth or textured tile lined at the bottom of their enclosure. Do not use sand, as the gecko could accidently ingest it while eating, which can cause deadly intestinal impaction which may cause expensive trips to the vet.;
, The leopard gecko is crepuscular, which means that they are mostly active during dawn and dusk, so unlike diurnal(active during the day) lizards, who require a UVB light, Leopard geckos however do not require any UVB lighting (though it certainly doesn't hurt to have!) Unless your house gets too cold at night (below 60 degrees), no nighttime basking lights are required. Since leopard geckos absorb heat from their bellies for food digestion, it is required to buy one appropriate sized under-tank heating mat. Stick the heat mat underneath one side of the tank (inside if it's a vivarium) for heat distribution. If you are using a nighttime basking light, it needs to go into a reptile heat dome and turned on above the same side of the heat mat.Temperature should be around 75-90 degrees Fahrenheit (23-32 degrees Celsius) during the daytime, and 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit (18-23 degrees Celsius) at night. Your Gecko's tank should have a cool side, and a warm side. You will want to buy a temperature gun or digital thermometer w/ a probe. The warm side should be no higher than 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) and on the cool side should be around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). The warm side can drop to 80 at night.

, Leopard geckos should have three hides, two on the warm side, and one on the cold side. Leopard geckos should have a mealworm bowl. They will also need a water dish (big enough for the gecko to fit in) and they will need one of the two warm hides to be filled with sphagnum moss, Eco earth, or paper towel (try to avoid getting anything from the wild as it can carry mites that can be passed to your gecko). You should mist this moss regularly when the gecko is shedding.

, A healthy leopard gecko will show great alacrity, have bright vivid colors, will have eyes wide open, will have a tail size that is identical to the width between the eyes, and will easily shed over one night. An unhealthy gecko may appear very thin, weak, have sunken in eyes, show lethargy(no interest), and have runny or no droppings. Consult a vet, a local pet store, or an online forum for help with an unhealthy gecko.

, Leopard geckos should be fed crickets or Dubia roaches as a stable diet. Other prions include mealworms, superworms, hornworms, and silkworms. For babies, feed daily. For adults, feed every 3-4 days. Feed your gecko as many insects as they will eat in 15 minutes, and make sure to dust your crickets and mealworms with calcium dust right before feeding so that your gecko does not get calcium deficiency (a bone disease that reptiles get from lack of calcium due to them being in captivity). This only needs to be done every other feeding. To do so, put a certain number of crickets/mealworms into a zip block bag filled with a little bit of calcium and shake lightly until they are coated white. Multivitamins must be dusted on insects every three feedings. Feed them to the gecko. It is important to note that you do not want to put all the crickets that you buy into the tank all at once with the gecko due to the risk of uneaten crickets picking and eating at the sleeping gecko's skin. It is best to put the crickets in a bug keeper until next feeding. Make sure you are feeding your crickets, or they will not last very long at all. Food options for crickets are: cricket chow that you buy from your local pet store along with cricket water gel (water gel must be purchased along with cricket chow to ensure hydration for your crickets. It also prevents your crickets from drowning in a full dish of water) or you could feed them fruit or vegetables. Good options are Apple, carrot, greens, and potato. Keep these food options in the bug keeper with the crickets in two little bottle caps. This will ensure your crickets will live longer and also to gut load them for your gecko so that he/she can get nutrition out of them (remember: what your crickets eat, your gecko will eat too). Also note that mealworms aren't the best feeder. Baby leopard geckos are more prone to impaction from mealworms so try to stay away from them until the gecko is about 6 inches long. Mealworms must be kept in the fridge so that they do not turn into beetles.

, Do not squeeze your grip while handling, they will squirm and possibly bite. In a way, a Leopard gecko will show you how he/she wants to be handled. Your leopard gecko will warm up to you with regular handling, however do not handle them excessively within the first 48 hours of getting them as they may be very stressed and need time to adjust with his/her new surroundings (try handling them in the evening as they will most likely be awake then). However, this doesn't mean that every leopard gecko likes to be held. It is always best to try to handle the gecko before buying to test this if you want to be able to hold it. Also note to never pick them up by the tail, as they will drop their tail if frightened. Their tail will grow back, but it won't grow back the same(it will look fatter). If your gecko does drop his/her tail, line new paper towels down on the bottom of the tank and leave the towels there for about 72 hours, or until his/her wounded tail is sealed up. In the meantime, pick up anything loose in the tank that may cause infection.

",How to Take Care of a Chameleon3," The most common purchased food for chameleons is crickets. You can buy them at your local pet store. If there is no local pet store then you can always purchase them online or by phone. Avoid feeding your chameleon bees and wasps.


Baby chameleons need a smaller breed of crickets. They also like and can survive off of fruit flies.
You may see the term ""gut loaded"" crickets. That simply means the crickets have been fed a nutritious diet, which helps get lizards the nutrients they need. You may also see they are ""calcium dusted,"" which helps the chameleon get its calcium.
Chameleons also enjoy types of insects like wax worms, meal worms, super worms, flies, moths, and grasshoppers.
In addition to store bought bugs, you can give the chameleon bugs, spiders, moths from your house or garden. A mixed diet is good. If your chameleon eats the bugs from your neighbor's garden, the neighbor may be impressed.

, There are different ways to do it. If you see your chameleon licking shiny objects, that is because he is thirsty and looking for dew to lick.


Spray the leaves or side of the tank with a spray bottle for the chameleon to lick.
You can buy a waterfall at a pet store. These cost a bit but are nice/pretty.
Some people have taught their chameleons to drink from a bottle. See if you can train your chameleon to act a bit like a dog!

, First, buy a thermometer to go inside the cage. Next, put a heat lamp at the top of the reptarium. That way, the chameleon can come up and bask in the heat if he or she wants, but come down if it is too hot. A basking spot created by a simple 60-watt household bulb works well, too (but you will still need a full spectrum light because a household bulb does not provide UV). The basking spot should be about 85-90 degrees F (29-33 degrees C).


Chameleons like it colder at night, but in any normal house that is not going to be a problem.
Get good quality full spectrum UVA/UVB light. Be sure it is a regular light bulb, not a compact fluorescent. It helps to produce Vitamin D for absorbing calcium.
Time outside basking in the sun is another way for your chameleon to get Vitamin D.
The floor of the enclosure should have some material that helps maintain humidity. Shredded coconut husks work well.

, Buy a low-cost humidity meter (hygrometer.) If the humidity is below 50%, adjust the misting or water system to keep the chameleon comfortable. Humidity can be too high as well; over 80% on a constant basis can lead to mold and fungus growth.


Use a drip system, bought from any pet store or online. The best ones have a timer.
Spray or mist your chameleon. You can use a spray bottle from any store. Spray the water on the leaves in your enclosure. This helps humidity and enables them to drink as well. Make sure the water is warm, but not hot.
Buy a pressure sprayer if you like. Get them at your local hardware store. It lets you spray a very fine mist.
Buy an automatic misting system, but they cost a lot and can be hard to set up.
Manually give your chameleon water by using an oral syringe or rodent bottle. Use a syringe without a needle from a local pharmacy. Drop the water straight into your chameleon's mouth. The chameleon may or may not be thirsty, so if at first you don't succeed, try again.

, Interacting with your chameleon isn't needed, but can be a lot of fun. Each chameleon has its own personality and some like being handled more than others. Feeding your chameleon by hand is a good way to interact so it won't be as aggressive toward you. You may also find the chameleon likes to be taken outside to bask in the sun.


Know how to do it safely, without losing your self-camouflaging pet.
Taking your chameleon outside is another way to get the UVA/UVB that a healthy chameleon needs. Not only do they love basking in the sun, it keeps them healthy!

, Remove any dead things at the bottom or else parasites and bacteria will come. Remove the chameleon from the enclosure so it won't be disturbed.


Create a cleaning solution using water and a bit of dish soap. Spray on the walls, floors, and anything like fake plants, not the real plants. Use a paper towel to clean and dry off. Mist your enclosure and, again, dry off with a clean paper towel.
Alternatively, use something naturally disinfecting like vinegar and baking soda. Use hot water and rinse well.
Change the material on the floor frequently to remove dead bugs, shed skin, fecal matter, mold or fungus, etc.
Clean the enclosure daily or every other day.

, (The technical term is ""becoming gravid."")


They can start getting eggs around 4-6 months and can lay up to 3 clutches of eggs a year.

Check the temperature of the gecko's enclosure.,
Eliminate stress from your gecko's environment.,
Check for signs that your gecko is eating.,
Feed your gecko some of its favorite foods.",How to Take Care of a Leopard Gecko That Won't Eat1," The environment you have provided for your gecko can influence your gecko's appetite. If the temperature is too hot or too cold, your gecko may not eat. Try to correct the temperature in the gecko's enclosure.Geckos are cold blooded and cannot regulate their own body temperature. You will have to provide both cool and hot areas in the enclosure to keep your gecko healthy and eating properly.
The hottest spot in your gecko's enclosure should be between 90 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.
Your gecko needs to cool off as well. Provide an area in the enclosure that is around 74 degrees Fahrenheit.
During the winter months and cooler temperatures, it is normal for your gecko to have a reduced appetite.;
, If your gecko is feeling too stressed out, it may not eat. Many factors can cause your gecko stress, try to make your gecko's enclosure and life as stress free as you can.Transferring your gecko to a new environment may have caused it stress. If your gecko has stopped eating after a move, it should regain its appetite after becoming accustomed to its new home.
Other geckos in the enclosure may be bullying the one who is not eating. Bullied geckos may have scratches on it or will be herded around the enclosure by the bully. Separation is the only way to prevent this.

, It can be difficult to actually catch your gecko while it is eating, which may give the impression that it is not eating. There are two main methods to make sure that your gecko is eating, without actually seeing it eat.Weigh your gecko. In an average adult gecko, fluctuations of around a gram or two in weight are normal. If it starts continuously loosing weight however, this is good evidence that it is not eating enough.
When cleaning the cage, look for signs of defecation. If your gecko is regularly having bowel movements, this is a good indication that your gecko is eating.

, Geckos can be picky eaters and they definitely have foods that are better suited to their diets than others. Try feeding your gecko some of the following foods to stimulate its appetite:Safe insects include crickets, mealworms, waxworms, silkworms and dubia roaches.
Make sure the insects you offer aren't too large as this can cause injury to your gecko. If the insect is larger than the space between the gecko's eyes, it's too large.
Use live insects as food. The motion can attract the attention of your gecko.
Try feeding your gecko later in the day as this can mimic their hunting routine in the wild.

,
Dust feeder crickets or meal worms with calcium with pure calcium powder every other feeding and with vitamin powder every three feedings.",How to Make a Simple Leopard Gecko Enclosure," The tank must be at least 10 gallons, but a 20 gallon would be better. One with sliding doors would make taming easier. Use caution if putting on the floor as the under tank heater may burn it.;
, DON'T PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE. Leopard geckos need an UTH to control their temperature and digest their food easily.

, Don't use any kind of sand, if your gecko swallows it, it will become impacted, which will kill your gecko. Instead use reptile carpet, paper towels. Slate or natural stone tile holds heat better for belly warmth.

, Then you will have one hide for the hot side, and one for the cold side.

, And fill the inside with damp paper towels.

, These help them rub their skin off when they shed.

, Fill one with pure calcium only, and the other with water.

,, Horn worms, silk worms, butter worms and phoenix worms are high in calcium, so they don't need to be dusted, but only give these to your reptile once a week. Only give wax worms once in a while as a treat since they are high in fat content.

Know when to put your gecko back in its tank.",How to Have Fun With Your Leopard Gecko," When you first buy your leo, it will need some time to adjust to its new home. Let it sit in its tank for max a day unless it's very stressed, then give it some more time so it can explore and get comfortable. Don’t feel bad if, once it checks out its home, it doesn’t come out of its favorite hiding spot for a while. Having said that, the earlier you familiarize yourself with your gecko, the better, as geckos who are handled and played with at a young age are generally much more calm and loving when held at a later age.


An ideal age to begin playing with your gecko is when it is five to six months old, but any age that it is comfortable with humans is good as long as it's not still a hatchling.;
, In the wild, anything as large as we are would be considered a threat by any lizard. So don't feel bad if your gecko takes a little while to warm up to you.


Don’t rush your gecko. If you are antsy to begin handling and playing with your gecko, comfort yourself by learning all about your leo. When you set up its home, set up hiding places that your leo can go in without being watched. sometimes your leo just wants some alone time, and remember, they are nocturnal, so you shouldn't bother them during the daytime.
While you are watching your gecko, familiarize yourself with your new pet. Find your gecko’s ears (The large hole-like appearances on the side of the Leo's head). Count how many toes it has on each of its feet. Count how many spots your gecko has and keep track (leopard geckos’ spots will change as they get older).

, A key part of getting your gecko to feel comfortable around you is to get it comfortable with your voice. Speak to it in soothing tones. Similarly, look at your gecko from behind the glass. Is your gecko looking back at you? Speak while making eye contact with the gecko so that it knows you are what is making that noise., It is very important to do this because if your gecko doesn’t adjust to your hand, it will never be comfortable being played with. Your gecko will be most active at night, generally after you get ready for night. At this time, place your hand in the cage, letting it rest on the bottom of the cage. Do not make sudden movement or you may scare your gecko. Let your gecko investigate your hand--it will probably lick your fingers, crawl on your hand, and eventually settle on a spot of your hand that is the warmest. Do not pull your hand away if your gecko tries to lick it. Until you have created a bond between you and your leopard gecko, the gecko will see you as a predator. If you go away when it tries to lick you, it will try to lick you in order to make you go away in the future, so that it can be alone. If your gecko doesn't have human companionship, it won't want human companionship, and that will lead to an unfriendly gecko.


Don’t be discouraged if your gecko doesn’t crawl on your hand right away. All geckos are different--some are a bit more adventurous than others. Each night, repeat this step and place your hand on the floor of the tank. Eventually your gecko will come to investigate.

, After your gecko has gotten used to your hand and sits on it willingly, you can simply lift your gecko out of its cage. Make sure to cup your other hand under or next to the hand you are lifting the gecko up with so that you could catch your gecko if it makes a sudden move that could lead to it falling off of your hand.


If you do need to pick your gecko up without waiting for it to crawl on your hand, do so very gently. Only pick your gecko up by its midsection and use as many fingers as possible (using all of your fingers that can fit around its midsection will give you a sturdier grasp). Hold your other hand underneath the gecko just in case it falls. Remember to never hold to hard as this is a small animal not fitted for ruff housing.

, Geckos can drop their tails if they think a predator has a hold of their tails, or if they become startled. Never pick your gecko up by its tail. Avoid making your gecko feel cornered or threatened. If it doesn’t feel like being handled and keep running away from your hand, take a break from trying to pick it up. Then try again later. It's fairly easy to tell when your gecko is scared or displeased as it will raise and wag it's tail as a warning if this happens try to just talk to it softly to make it calm down.

, There are several different treats you can give you gecko, and most of them can be purchased at your local pet store. These include waxworms, mealworms, and crickets.Waxworms: These are the most common type of treat to give your gecko. Geckos love the taste of them yet they are high in phosphorus and fat. So only use these sparingly ( not more than about one every two weeks or so, especially if your leo is over a year old, as this could lead to obesity or your leo refusing to eat other insects.)

, Every gecko is different, but most people recommend for the best taming result to handle them at the least 15 minutes every day ones they wake up. Though if you notice this stresses your gecko out then you should lower the times you handle and play with your leo.

, Leopard geckos, especially young ones, are very fast and will run away if given the chance. When you first begin playing with your gecko, create a space that you are sure your gecko cannot escape from, such as a box or bin. You could also choose an area and then set up a barrier of pillows or other soft things to block your gecko from the rest of the house. Just make sure that your barriers are not made of anything that could tip over and hurt your gecko. A good thing to do as well when you're out and about in your house with your gecko is to make sure doors and windows are closed as drafts are not good for your gecko and other pets (if owned) may come and interfere


Once your gecko has gotten used to being taken out of its cage, it should calm down a bit and you will be able to handle your gecko on your bed, couch, floor, etc.

, Geckos are generally curious, active creatures who like to explore, so let your gecko take the reigns. Allow your gecko to crawl up your arms, ride on your shoulders, or even curl up in your hair. Be prepared for your gecko to settle in somewhere they find warmth on your body--geckos are cold blooded and our skin feels like a sunbaked stone to them. Don’t be surprised if your gecko decides to hang out around your neck or in the crook of your arm.Another way to let your gecko explore is to ball up a piece of fabric (like a shirt or towel) and place it on your bed. Let your gecko crawl around the towel and find its own favorite cave or hiding space. Make sure to keep an eye on your gecko so you know where he has hidden himself when it is time to put him back in his tank.
Let your gecko explore an empty room or your bed. Geckos like climbing (though they aren't very good at it) and finding places to crawl into so let it crawl behind and around your cushions and pillows. Just make sure that you keep an eye on your gecko and never leave it unattended, or you could risk losing your gecko.

, Get a bin or large box and place ‘obstacles’ in it. These can be paper towel tubes that your gecko can crawl through, smaller boxes your gecko can crawl over, or any other items. Get creative! Place climbing trees in the box for your gecko to climb (these can be bought at pet stores) or old toys to give your obstacle course a unique look.

, This is similar to creating an obstacle course for your gecko, the key difference being that the gecko is not trying to get from one side to the other. Instead, fill a box with ‘gecko toys’ (climbing trees, patches of carpet, paper towel rolls, etc) and simply let your gecko play. You might be amazed at the funny things geckos do. Some love climbing up climbing trees and then jumping off again. Others love rolling around in a paper towel roll. Setting up a gecko carnival is a great way to learn what your gecko likes to do., While this is not necessarily ‘playing’, it is a great way to spend quality time with your gecko. Let your gecko get comfortable by sitting in its favorite warm spot on your body, and then settle in to watch a movie. Some leopard gecko owners have noticed that their geckos stare at the screen. Others will just fall asleep in a warm spot. Make sure the sound is not too loud though as it can startle and stress your gecko.

, Geckos need warmth to keep their energy levels up. When they are climbing or running around in an area that is not as warm as their tank, they can become fatigued. A good rule of thumb is to check your leo’s belly after you have been playing with them for 10 minutes. If its belly is cold to the touch, place your gecko back in its tank so that it can warm back up.

Look for signs of illness.,
Expect younger geckos to have a smaller appetite.,
Hand feed your gecko.,
Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian.",How to Take Care of a Leopard Gecko That Won't Eat2," Your gecko may have stopped eating if it has fallen ill or is suffering from an injury. If you suspect your gecko to be ill, you should take it to your veterinarian for an examination. Carefully examine your gecko for any of the following signs:A skin infection may be identified by any area that is red, swollen, or emitting pus.
A respiratory issue can be identified by plugged nostrils, laboured breathing, or any unusual noises during respiration.
Metabolic Bone Disease may cause your gecko to have weakness in its legs and jaw or the inability to stand. It may also cause swelling in the abdomen as it can become impacted from the inability to have a bowl movement.
Your gecko's eyes may also become cloudy if it is ill or have an infection.

, Life-cycles can have an impact on how much, or how little, your gecko wants to eat. If you know how old your gecko is, you can gain some understanding as to what is the normal amount of food your gecko should be eating.Freshly hatched geckos may not eat for up to a week.
Young geckos may eat once or twice a day.
Older geckos appetite may slow down considerably. Lessened appetites are normal in these older geckos and are not necessarily indicative of a medical issue. It may only need to eat once every two days.
Females, however, are are prone to reproductive problems which can interfere with appetite. If you have a female give her an area in which she can lay eggs so that she doesn't feel inhibited. If the problem persists, then always get her checked by a veterinarian experienced with the species.

, You may be able to feed your gecko by hand, if it is comfortable with you picking it up. There are a few methods of food preparation that may work better than others. Some experimentation may be required to find which method your gecko likes the best.Fruit nectars can be applied to a Q-tip. The Q-tip is then placed near the gecko's mouth. If your gecko finds it appealing, it should begin licking and feeding from the nectar on the Q-tip.
You may simply hold your gecko in one hand and a prey item in the other. Introduce the prey item to the gecko, holding it up to its mouth. Your gecko may take interest and start eating.
If your gecko doesn't take live prey items from your hand, you may need to crush the prey before presenting it. Once crushed, the prey is gently rubbed on the gecko's lips to encourage it to eat.
Do not force feed your gecko.

, Diagnosing any medical issue on your own can be difficult. If you notice that your gecko is not eating, you should take it for a visit to your veterinarian for a proper examination. Your veterinarian will be able to accurately diagnose and will work with you to help restore your geckos appetite and health.You may need to bring a fresh stool sample.
Keep any gecko that you suspect to be ill separate from other geckos you may have. This will keep any potential diseases from spreading to healthy geckos.

Use a long and wide aquarium, terrarium, or vivarium.,
Leopard geckos are not very active lizards, but they should be given a good amount of room to move around.,
Cover your tank with a lid made of wire or mesh.,
Maintain a temperature gradient in the tank.,
Use dry Eco earth or textured tile as a substrate in the tank.,
Create a warm hide and a cool hide for your gecko.,
Make a warm, moist hide for your gecko.,
Place a food and water bowl in the tank.,
Add plants and/or rocks or logs.",How to Create a Habitat for a Leopard Gecko," A vivarium is a wooden tank with a glass front, which will help to keep your electricity bills down.


Leopard geckos are ground animals, so they will rarely climb, but you should use a glass tank so the leopard cannot climb up the walls of the tank. You should not use a wire or mesh cage for your gecko, as wire cages will not hold heat very well, are easy for your gecko to escape from, and your gecko can get injured if his foot or toe gets caught in the wire. ;
, However, avoid getting a tank that is too large for young geckos, as a tank that is too large can make it difficult for your gecko to find the heat source in the tank and hide. Adults have no size limit, but larger tanks must include plenty of hides.A single adult Leopard gecko will need a 10 gallon tank (20 gallons would be better), two geckos will need a 20 gallon tank and three geckos will need a 30 gallon tank. Up to three Leopard geckos can be kept in the same cage, though they should be of a similar size and there should only be one male per habitat. Only females who are similar in size can be housed together, and even then they may fight. Keep an extra tank incase they fight.

, Though your gecko will not be able to climb the glass walls of his tank, you should always cover your tank with a wire or mesh lid to keep out insects, other pets, or children. You can use a sliding door at the front instead, which will work better with taming.Avoid plastic, glass, or any other lid of solid materials. Solid lids can cause the temperature of the tank to rise to unsafe levels for your gecko.

, You should set up a warm side and cool side of the tank so your gecko can regulate his temperature by moving from warm to cool. But a thermometer. The best thermometers to use is a digital one with a probe or a temperature gun.Use an under-tank heater on bottom of the warm side. It should be a third of the area of the bottom. A lamp should only be used if the heat mat doesn't have enough heat alone. Leopard geckos are not basking lizards and get their heat from their belly to help them to digest food. Basking rocks should never be used. A UVB light because these geckos are crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk). However, UV can be beneficial as leis cannot overdose on d3 they get from it. It can take the place if a d3 supplement. A light is only needed if there's no window on the room.
In the daytime, the cool side should have an ambient temperature of 80 degree Fahrenheit and the warm side should be about 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
In the nighttime, the temperature should be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit on both sides of the tank.

, Substrate is the bedding or flooring in your gecko’s tank that he walks on. Never use sand at all. The natural habitat of these geckos has stone and hard packed dirt. Sand can lead to impaction.


Tiles and flat stones are cheap, conduct heat well, are nice to look at, easy to clean, and do not pose a health risk to your gecko. A thin layer of sand or Eco Earth should be under and between the tiles. The tile must be textured so the Leo has no trouble walking on it. Can get tiles and flat stones from your local pet store. This substrate is also permanent.
You can also use newspaper, butcher paper, or shelf lining as substrate in the tank. A paper based substrate is easy to maintain and easy to replace. This will make cleaning the tank very quick, as you often need to only replace the paper substrate. However, insects can get underneath it.
Some owners and vets recommend using reptile carpet, which is specially designed for reptile tanks. It looks nice in the tank and does not pose a health risk to your gecko. You can find it at your local pet store. The claws and teeth of your gecko may get caught, though. Insects can get underneath this as well.

, Your gecko’s hide is a key part of his living environment. He will use his hide to shelter himself from light, heat and anything that frightens him, like other pets or people close to his tank. The hide should be long enough for your gecko to fit in comfortably. You can make your own hides with tupperware containers, or purchase hides that resemble natural rock sources from your local pet store. Try to have a warm and a cool hide in the tank for maximum comfort. Hides that go up against the side of the tank aren't recommended, as they defeat the purpose and don't hide your gecko.


Place the warm hide on the warm side of the tank. Your gecko will use this hide to digest his food and warm up when he feels cold.
Place the cool hide on the cool side of the tank. Your gecko will use this hide to regulate his body temperature when he feels too hot and needs to cool down.

, A moist hide will help your leopard maintain a balanced body temperature and enjoy low humidity in his tank. This is also for shedding. Line this with moist paper towel, Eco earth, or sphagnum moss.You can make a moist retreat out of a small plastic container that is sandwich sized.
You will need to mist the husk or moss daily with a spray bottle of water so it remains moist, but not wet.
You can also buy pre made moist retreats at your local pet store.

, Look for a combined food and water bowl made for Leopard geckos at your local pet store. The food bowl is only needed if you will use meal worms as a regular diet. Refill the water bowl whenever the water gets low or dirty. Use bottled water, tap water left out for 24 hours, or water treated with reptisafe (found in pet stores).Do not get a food and water bowl that is too deep, as your gecko could have difficulty accessing the water in a deep water bowl and it can pose a drowning hazard. Make sure the water bowl is big enough for your gecko to bathe in.

, You can use live or artificial plants in the tank to give your gecko extra security and spots to hide himself. You can use these to keep your gecko from getting bored. However, if you use live plants, make sure they are non-toxic and safe for leopard geckos. Live plants may look more appealing but they require more upkeep and can increase the humidity levels of the tank.You can also add rocks or small sticks and logs in the tank to give your gecko spots to perch or climb on. Always clean any rocks or sticks to remove dirt and bacteria before putting them in the tank. You should also smooth any sharp corners or sides on the rock so your gecko does not injure himself.
You should also strip the sticks of their bark to get rid of any bacteria or parasites. You can place the sticks or wood in the oven on low heat for 20-30 minutes to kill any parasites on them before putting them in your gecko’s tank. You may want to put paper towel in the washroom corner and if you do change it whenever it is used.

Make sure that any food you are feeding your leopard gecko is smaller than the space between his or her eyes.,
Make sure that the worms are full of nutrients and calcium.,
Take your leopard gecko out of its vivarium.,
Gut-load the insects.,Feed to the gecko in the same way as for the worms (see above).",How to Hand Feed a Blind Leopard Gecko," This is a crucial step because it ensures easy and pain-free digestion.
, This is vital for ensuring that the nutrients are passed on to your leopard gecko. This is called gut-loading your pet's diet.

The worms will likely be in a box, tub or bag filled with oats. The oats are what the worms eat and burrow into. To gut load them, you will need to separate the worms and oats apart and keep the worms in a box or bag on their own for 24 hours; this starves the worms enough so that when they are reintroduced to their food, they will all eat straight away.
Meanwhile you will need to coat the oats in a nutrient and calcium powder which you can buy online or at a local pet store, such as ""Arkvits nutrient powder with calcium and D3"". Check that the powder contains all the essentials for your leopard gecko.
After the 24 hours, reintroduce the worms to the powder-covered oats and store them in the fridge as you would and wait another 24 hours for them to be fully gut-loaded.
From this point on, whenever you feed your leopard gecko, add more Arkvits to the worms' food (you won't need to separate them from the oats anymore.)

, Hold it belly up (do this while sitting down). Leopard geckos have a lot of nerve endings in their bottom lip so if you gently stroke it with your finger or thumb, it should open its mouth widely. Use this short window of time to pick up a worm with your fingers or feeding tongs and drop the worm into the gecko's mouth. If you're worried that your leopard gecko might bite you during this process, you can take a pair of feeding tongs, pick up a worm and whilst you're holding it belly up, rub the worm against your leopard gecko's mouth and bottom lip and when it opens its mouth, drop the worm in.

After successfully doing this for a few weeks or even a few months, you might want to try rubbing the worm against your leopard gecko's mouth when the gecko stands up in its vivarium, as opposed to on its back, in your hand.

, To gut-load locusts or crickets, put a piece of fruit or veg in the box with them. Regularly coat the food with a nutrient powder (such as Arkvits).

You can use a small piece of carrot or a slice of potato. It is best to search online for the food you can feed crickets beforehand.

Decide what types of insects to feed your leopard gecko.,
Go to your local pet store.,
Buy insects.,
Keep insects in a separate container from your gecko.,
Buy nutritional supplements.,
Cover insects in nutrient powder.,
Feed your leopard gecko.,
Place the insects in the geckos habitat.,
Give your leopard gecko water.,
Adjust the amount you feed, if necessary.",How to Feed Leopard Geckos," Leopard geckos can eat a wide variety of insects. The most commonly available insects are mealworms, waxworms, and crickets.Geckos can also eat mealworms and superworms. However, these aren't the best feeders so hey shouldn't be used as a staple diet. Waxworms should only be used as treats as they are very fatty and addictive. Crickets and Dubia roaches provide better nutrition. Other options are hornworms and silkworms.
Different insects give your gecko different nutrition. This is why it is a good idea to vary the insects you are feeding your gecko.;
, Any pet store should have the insects you will need to feed your gecko. These insects are fed to a variety of types of pets, such as frogs, iguanas, and other types of lizards.


Just to be sure, however, feel free to call the pet store before you go to make sure that the insects you want are in stock.
Don't just try to collect bugs outside. Feeding your gecko random bugs will not give it the nutrition that it needs. Another problem with bugs from outside is that they may contain parasites, which you definitely don't want to feed your leo. Additionally, buying bugs at a pet store will guarantee that you have enough to keep your gecko well fed.

, How many insects you buy will depend on how often you want to go to the pet store and how long the insects live. In general, you will only feed your gecko a few insects at a time, every other day. To begin with, only buy enough insects for a week or two. This will allow you to learn how long they live and how to extend their lives. As you get used to dealing with the insects, you can gradually buy more.


If you want to buy crickets in bulk and keep them alive, you will need to give them food and water and keep them warm.In fact, crickets need to be gut-loaded before they are fed to your gecko. Many crickets bought at a pet store are practically starving. This means feeding them a high-quality food, so that they pass on that nutrition to the gecko when they get eaten.Mealworms, on the other hand, can simply be kept in the refrigerator in a substrate material, such as wheat bran. , You will need to feed the insects you bought to the leopard gecko gradually. This means that they should be kept in a separate container from the one that the gecko lives in.


Depending on how many and what kind of insects you bought, you will need different types of containers. For example, crickets need to be kept warm and in a container with a lid to keep the crickets inside. Mealworms, on the other hand, can be kept in the refrigerator and only need a lid to keep the smell in.

, The insects that you can buy at a pet store do not completely fulfill the nutritional needs of a gecko. In order to rectify this, you will need to give the gecko supplements, specifically a supplement that gives the gecko more calcium. These supplements come in powder form.


Get a calcium supplement and a multivitamin supplement. The calcium supplement should include calcium and vitamin D3, which helps the gecko absorb the calcium. Dust insects in calcium every other feeding, and multivitamins every three feedings.Not giving supplementation can have very adverse affects on your gecko. In general, it can lead to weight loss and digestive issues., Before you feed the insects to your leopard gecko, you should cover them in supplement powder. Put the amount suggested on the packaging of the supplement into a plastic bag. Then place the specific insects you are going to put in the cage into the plastic bag. Shake the bag around to cover the insects in the powder.The goal is to cover the insect entirely in the powder. Then, when the gecko eats the insect, it will also be ingesting the supplement.
For young geckos, every feeding should be dusted. For older geckos, you can dust the insects every two to three feedings.

, Young geckos need more calories in order to grow, so they should be fed every day. Older geckos, on the other hand, need fewer calories to thrive, so they should be fed every other day.If you find that your gecko is ignoring insects that you place in its cage, you may be feeding it too often or too much. Try spacing feedings further apart, by a day or so, and see if your gecko is more interested in its meals.

, You only want to give the gecko as many insects as it will eat in 15 to 20 minutes. You do not want a bunch of insects living in the cage, not getting eaten. This can cause disease and dirtiness to build up in the cage.If you are feeding mealworms, you should place them in a food bowl. This will allow the gecko to easily access them. If you do not place the mealworms in a dish, they will simply burrow under the tank bedding and the gecko may not be able to find them.
Crickets should be placed as close as possible to the gecko.

, Geckos should be supplied with a dish of water that they can drink. Make sure that the water is replaced and the dish cleaned on a regular basis, ideally every day.This water should not be very deep, so that there is little chance of the gecko drowning in it.

, An overweight gecko is not a healthy gecko. Check to make sure that there is no area of fat gathering around the areas where the limbs connect to the body. It is good for your gecko to have a nice fat tail, but if it is wider than the rest of your gecko's body, then the gecko needs to be fed less.


This will be a gradual adjustment to find the perfect diet for your gecko. Don't make sudden, extreme changes. Just decrease the amount you are feeding your gecko a little at a time. This can be done most easily by decreasing the amount of insects you give to your gecko but keeping the number of feedings the same.

First of all you will need the housing.,
Buy, or have, a heating device.,
Put in a substrate.,
Next you will need hides.,
You will also need a shallow dish of water that's big enough for bathing.

",How to Make a Leopard Gecko Vivarium," Get a 20 gallon (75.7 L) long terrarium or vivarium, but you could do with a 15 gallon (56.8 L). You could also use a Rubbermaid tub but make sure the dimensions are at least 30""x12"" and that it is tall enough for no escape. You could get a tank with sliding doors instead, which would make taming easier.;
, Something like an under tank heater of the appropriate size. The heater should take up one third of the cages bottom and be completely to one side not in the middle. You could also use heat tape and it will work just as well. The reason I recommend an under tank heater is because Leos absorb heat from their stomachs.

, What you can use is dry Eco earth or textured tile. Do not recommend sand and do not use wood at all.

, You will need a total of three; one on the side of the heater and one of the other side. Now you will need another hide on the side with the heater and it needs to have moist moss, eco earth, or paper towels in it to aid with shedding.

Let your gecko adjust to his new home.,
Bring the gecko's cage into an enclosed room.,
Open the cage slowly.,
Lower your hand in front of your gecko.,
Pick up your gecko.,
Return the gecko when you are done.",How to Handle a Crested Gecko1," When geckos are brought into a new cage or house, they are very defensive and scared. Geckos need time to get used to their new home before you can handle them. Allow him three to four weeks to settle in before you pick him up.Babies should not be handled before they have grown to three inches long.;
, All windows and doors should be closed. The floor should be cleared of toys, books, and other objects.Turn off any TV, music, or radio. This will create a calm environment while preventing your gecko from escaping.

, Very gently remove the top of the cage, and set it aside. Do not toss or drop the top; the noise may frighten your gecko. Geckos can be easily stressed out by movement and noise. They will become flighty, running around the cage. They may even bite you or drop their tail., With your hand flat, slowly place it in the cage in front of your gecko. The gecko may run away at first. Simply move your hand towards the gecko. Avoid making quick or abrupt movements. Your gecko will realize after a minute or two that you are not going to hurt him.


You do not want to reach in and grab your gecko. Sudden snatching may cause your gecko to drop his tail. Tails do not grow back on crested geckos, so it is good to avoid this.
If your gecko refuses to climb on your hand, replace the top of the cage, and try again later. Your gecko does not want to be handled.

, Slide your hand under his chin, and let him crawl onto you. Lift the gecko out on the flat of your hand. He should be resting comfortably on your finger, palm, or arm. Cup your other hand under him in case he falls off or jumps. If he tries to run to the other side of your hand, turn your hand so that he remains on top at all times.


If he does not crawl onto you, you can try sliding your hand under more of his body while slipping your other hand under his tail. Wait for him to grip onto you before you lift him out of the cage.
Do not hold the gecko by his tail, and do not grasp him with two fingers. A flat or slightly cupped palm is key. He may also rest against your arm., Cup your gecko in the palm of your hand, and lower him into the cage. Put your hand as low as possible so that he does not have to jump off. He may climb off your hand immediately. If not, you may nudge him off with your finger.

"
"
Move your hand slowly towards the gecko so it can see your hand.,
Move gently.,
Pick it up slowly and take it out of its cage.",How to Hold a Leopard Gecko," Make sure it knows that it is just your hand. Gently slide your fingers under the belly with your hand on top of the gecko.;
, Don't squeeze or it might bite or poop on you.

, When holding it, just let it crawl around or sit on your arm or hand. Enjoy your new friend.

"
"
Sit with your gecko close to the ground.,
Move your hands as your gecko climbs.,
Repeat until your gecko stops.",How to Handle a Crested Gecko2," You can also sit at a table or couch, so long as there is a surface close beneath you. Your gecko may tumble while you handle him, and sitting will minimize the distance that he falls. Crested geckos can jump large distances, so don’t be alarmed if he takes off.If your gecko manages to escape, you should approach him slowly. Pick him up by sliding your hands under him. Try to avoid grabbing or squeezing him if possible. It helps if you are in an enclosed room with few small spaces for him to hide.

, Both hands should be touching so that your lizard can easily climb from one hand to another. As soon as the gecko leaves the one hand, move that hand in front of the other. Your gecko will climb onto that one since it is highest. This will create a treadmill effect that allows your gecko to keep climbing., Once your gecko stops climbing, it is time to put him away. Over-handling your gecko can induce stress, which may cause him to stop eating. Fifteen to twenty minutes is about as long as one gecko can handle at a time.Handling him a few times a week will build the amount of time that your gecko will spend out of his cage with you.


If you are handling a new or baby gecko, start with short five minute sessions. After a couple sessions, increase this to ten minutes and fifteen until he is comfortable with your handling.New and baby lizards will need several sessions of hand walking until they are comfortable enough to sit and hang out with you."
"
Hold your gecko close to the ground with one hand.,
Wait for him to jump.,
Practice.",How to Handle a Crested Gecko3," Position your free hand a short distance away from the other hand. Since he will be jumping, you want to prevent any potential injuries. If your gecko does fall, check him over for injuries such as bruising or broken limbs. If your gecko is not walking normally after a fall, take him to see a vet.


Do not be alarmed if his tail falls off. This is normal in crested geckos. Tail loss is a natural response to stress or fear. In the wild, they lose their tails to get away from predators. Your gecko will be fine after dropping his tail, although it will not grow back. There may be a stump left afterwards., Make sure your free hand is slightly higher with a short distance between them. You will know if your gecko will jump because of his body language. His toes will move in front of his head as his body pushes back and up. His eyes will also be locked on the other hand as he aims for it. , Your gecko may not be comfortable with jumping between hands at first. As you handle him, you can give him room to jump, and over time, he will become more comfortable with your handling. He may also jump straight over your hand. Catch him if he does, and place him back on your arm.

"
"
Sit on the ground with your gecko.,
Lift your hand gently up to your shoulder.,
Slide him onto your shoulder.,
Cup your hand by your shoulder to catch him again.",How to Handle a Crested Gecko4," You should remain absolutely still while your gecko is on your shoulder, so take a seat, preferably on the ground. Give him five minutes to relax in your hands. Sudden movements will startle your gecko, causing him to either fall off or flee up onto your head.


Do not walk around while your gecko is on your shoulder.

, Hold your hand with the gecko against your shoulder for a minute. As you do so, do not make eye contact with your gecko. This may frighten him.He may at this point wander by himself onto your shoulder. He may, however, remain still in your hand for a minute.

, If he does not move on his own, you can gently place him on your shoulder. You can slightly tip your hand so that he steps down onto your shoulder. Alternatively, you can place your cupped hand just below the shoulder and nudge him off so that he climbs the shoulder naturally.


Your gecko may try to climb your face and head. This does not particularly hurt, although he can scratch you, and it is much more difficult to catch him once he is on your head. If he attempts to flee up your neck, catch him and replace him on your shoulder., With slow movements, slide your hand under his chin. Once he climbs on your hand, lift him away, and return him to his cage. Hanging out on your shoulder may have stressed or exhausted your lizard, so give him plenty of time to recuperate.


Start with short sessions at first, no more than five or ten minutes long. If your gecko keeps trying to flee your shoulder, place him back in your hands. Try again another day.

Know what foods leopard geckos are able to eat.,
Put the food on your hand, fingertip, or arm.,
Place your lizard behind the food, so that they are directly facing it nose on.

,
Know that if they begin to look at the prey closely.,
Wait until the gecko finishes eating.,
Remove any left over food if the leopard gecko left any out.

",How to Feed a Leopard Gecko from Your Hand," If you are going to feed the leopard gecko a food, make sure it is appropriate to feed the food to it, like a meal-worm. If you are using a cricket, hold it by the back leg. Some crickets cooperate more than others and if the cricket moves around too much, the leg could come off. Don't do this with every food item you feed or the gecko will depend on you entirely. This is great for taming your gecko. If your gecko bites you while doing this, which rarely happens, it is accidental. It is best not to use tweezers if you want the gecko to connect you with feeding.


Don't feed your leopard gecko anything it cannot eat. It may get sick if you do this.;
, Make sure that the lizard will be able to reach it.


Don't put a piece of food wider than the space between your gecko's eyes.

,, You'll know it when you see it also they'll look really concentrated on the target and possibly crouch; that means they are interested and will probably eat it.


If they walk away, do it later or tomorrow - they are not interested. Don't force-feed them; imagine how much harm that could do to their digestive system, plus it's not fair on them. Try again later.

, If you put your hand near it while it is eating, it may bite your hand.

Clean the container.",How to Give a Bearded Dragon a Bath," Don’t use a sink or bathtub that’s shared with people, because bearded dragons will often defecate in the bath, and they can carry salmonella.Instead, try a container such as a kiddie pool or plastic bin.


For a baby or juvenile bearded dragon, consider using a smaller container.;
, Use lukewarm water that’s between 85 and 100 F (29.4 and 37.7 C).Water that’s too hot could burn your dragon, but because he is cold blooded and relies on his surroundings for warmth, a bath that’s too cold could also cause your dragon’s body to shut down.Fill the tub with one to three inches of water. Make sure the water is no deeper than his shoulder joints (where the limbs meet the body) to prevent drowning.
For babies and juveniles, use only one-half to one inch of water.

, Bath time for a bearded dragon is more like a swim, and you shouldn’t try to use any soaps or detergents to clean your dragon.It is unnecessary, and soap could damage his skin. Also, bearded dragons will often drink when they are bathing, and you don’t want him drinking soap.


Never put your bearded dragon into chlorinated water., Bearded dragons aren’t the strongest of swimmers and can tire easily. It’s a good idea to put a rock (or something else) in the tub in case he gets tired and wants to get out of the water., When the tub is ready and the climbing rock in place, gently put your dragon into the bath. Let him acclimatize to the water. When in the water, bearded dragons may paddle and splash around.


In the case that your bearded dragon defecates in the water, remove the feces immediately to avoid a mess. Sometimes bearded dragons will inhale air to puff themselves up so they can float around. They’ll also close their eyes to prevent water from entering. Just be sure to monitor your dragon closely if he’s floating around like this, and don’t let his head go under the water., Use a cup to pour bath water over his back and tail, but avoid his head and mouth (you don’t want him aspirating water). Use your hand to splash water under his belly., If there is any skin left a couple weeks after shedding, use a soft toothbrush or wash cloth to help remove the skin in the bath after he’s been soaking for a while.Don’t brush at old skin if your dragon is currently shedding because you could damage the new skin underneath. , This is a good amount of timeto let him soak and help moisturize his skin, which is especially important when he’s shedding.


If the water starts to get too cold, take some out and add more warm water. Use a thermometer to keep an eye on the temperature.Get your dragon out of the water immediately if he starts struggling or getting tired., Remove your dragon from the water and place him on a soft, clean towel. Gently pat him dry. It’s a good idea to keep a special towel just for your dragon.

, Once he’s dry, get him under his basking light.His temperature may have dropped in the bath or during drying, so it’s important that he warm himself.

, Bathing helps remove old skin and scales, helps with shedding, and can remove bacteria from your dragon’s skin and feet,so it’s extremely important to wash your dragon’s tub out after every bath, especially if he defecated.


Wash the tub with a good strong soap and rinse it out well after the bath. Don’t forget to wash any towels or cloths that you used to clean and dry your dragon.

Choose a glass aquarium.,
Choose a melamine cage.,

Choose a professional cage.,
Ensure your tank has an appropriate lid.,
Ensure your dragon has enough room.The size of your tank depends on how large your dragon is.The larger your dragon, the bigger the cage it will need.,
Install a full-spectrum light in your dragon’s tank.A full-spectrum light emits regular visible light that helps us see, plus other ranges in the ultraviolet spectrum (UVA and UVB) which dragons need to stay healthy.,
Change your UVA/UVB bulbs frequently.,
Include a basking light in your dragon’s cage.In addition to the full-spectrum light, you will need to provide a source of hot light.,

Add some naturalistic elements.",How to Set Up a Tank for Bearded Dragons," This is the most common type of tank for bearded dragons. Glass aquariums are inexpensive and easy to find at local pet stores or on local market sites like Craigslist. The only downsides are that they are heavy and not well insulated. A heavy tank can be difficult to move and once it’s set up with the dragon inside, you’ll not be inclined to move it. And while bearded dragons might not mind the lack of insulation, some owners complain that a lower temperature dulls the reptile’s color., Melamine cages are made of melamine board, a kind of wood coated with a laminate finish. You can build a melamine cage yourself or buy one at your local pet store.These types of cages replicate the zoo-going experience. Unfortunately, this means the lizard can only be seen from one side of the enclosure.


You can leave the boards within the cage plain white to reflect light, or choose to affix an artificial rock surface to the back and side of the cage to replicate a more natural environment.

, A PVC cage is made of a kind of plastic and therefore much easier to move than a melamine cage. They are, unfortunately, more expensive than melamine, but many people find that the PVC plastic looks better than the melamine board cage., There are several high-end companies that make quality cages for reptiles. These cages are professional-grade and made of one molded piece of plastic. They are quite expensive but many breeders favor them because they are conveniently stackable.Chemically resistant, easy to clean, and shipped with a built-in heat lamp, professional cages are the best cages available.

, Do not use solid lids of plastic or glass. These can limit airflow in your dragon’s tank.Bearded dragons come from very dry, arid regions in Australia where there is little humidity. A firmly closed lid will lead to an unhealthy increase in humidity.

, Baby dragons, for instance, need a 20 gallon tank. Larger (10-16 inch) dragons will need a tank of at least 40 gallons.


It doesn’t hurt to get a tank larger than the minimums listed above. Doing so will make your dragon happy.
It’s a good idea to get the largest tank you expect you’ll need, rather than working up through progressively larger tanks. For instance, instead of starting with a small 20 gallon tank and then buying larger 40, 50, or 75 gallon tanks as your dragon grows, just spring for the 75 or 120 gallon tank and let your dragon grow into it.

, Your light needs to be in a location where the lizard can come within six to eight inches of it. If your light is located in an overhead position more than six to eight inches from the floor of the tank, provide a rock or branch which your lizard can climb to move closer to the light.

, Over time, UVA/UVB lights become less effective. Even if your bulbs seem to be operating in good condition, change them every six months in order to keep your lizard healthy., This basking light should be a bright white and can be bought either at local hardware stores or from a pet store. Be sure you provide room for this light in addition to the full-spectrum light (which usually runs the whole length of the cage) when setting up your bearded dragon’s tank.


Install the basking light at one end of the tank. This way, the dragon will have a warm side and a cool side of the tank.
Alternatives to the basking bulb include a ceramic heater or a household bulb that puts out a lot of heat (any old-style rounded bulb will do).

, Install the other at the opposite end where the temperature should be cooler. This way you can ensure that the basking lamp is doing its job. If you see that the temperature is uniform throughout the tank, replace your basking bulb.


You could also install a humidity gauge to ensure that humid air is not accumulating in the tank.
If your cage is small, you might be okay to install just one thermometer gauge.Use small, round thermometer gauges available at your local pet store. They attach easily to the inside of the tank and are specially designed for reptile habitats.
Additionally, invest in an infrared temperature gun or a digital thermometer with a probe end. Use it to monitor the temperature in your tank.
Do not use traditional “stick” style thermometers; they are notoriously inaccurate., The warm side of the tank should be at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The cooler side should be at about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Be careful at night. The tank should never be below 70-75 degrees Fahrenheit. Check your tank at night; it can be hard to keep nighttime temperatures in the acceptable range.If you’re having trouble keeping the tank warm at night, invest in an under tank heater (UTH).
You can also adjust the tank temperature by moving the basking light closer to or further from the tank.

, Reptile carpet is good for dragons of any age, but is the best choice for juveniles (dragons less than six inches long).Small bearded dragons might accidentally ingest more sand than their tiny lungs and stomachs can handle.


For close substitutes, you could also use AstroTurf or indoor/outdoor carpet., Tile is easy to clean up and will easily outlast your bearded dragon. Regular slate or ceramic tile makes a good substrate for your dragon. It is nontoxic, inedible, and sturdy. You can get tiles at your local hardware store., These materials are cheap and easy to replace. However, they do have to be replaced daily when they get wet or yucky. If you do not, your dragon might get sick and the tank will become uncomfortably humid.If your dragon gets ill, you can lay newspaper and/or paper towel down until they are better. Doing so makes cleanup easy and is an important step in preventing infected fecal matter or vomit from re-infecting your sick dragon. Newspaper and/or paper towel are also useful when treating a dragon with parasites., However, sand is messy and gets everywhere, including in the lizard’s food and water. Because sand is so easily ingested by lizards, it is a leading cause of impaction, eye abscesses, and other ailments. Avoid substrates like sand, gravel, wood shavings, walnut shells, and other particulate substrate.Besides the health risks sand poses for your bearded dragon, it is impractical in that it is difficult to clean.

, A basking platform allows your dragon to get closer to the basking light in his or her cage. While you can buy a sturdy (if artificial-looking) structure, you might prefer to introduce a long branch or a rock over which your dragon can climb., Your dragon will also use the hide for brumation, the reptile equivalent of hibernation. And, like humans, sometimes bearded dragons just get shy and want some privacy away from prying eyes.


Place the hide beneath the basking lamp to keep it warm inside.
If your dragon isn’t using its hide, try to move the location, or try a different type of hide., Give your tank a natural look by adding things like plastic cacti or flowers.You could also use real plants like Dracaena, Ficus benjamina, and hibiscus. If you do choose to use live plants, ensure they are nontoxic and have not been treated with biocides. Wash them thoroughly with a water spray and water them for a few weeks before introducing them into the tank with your bearded dragon.


Artificial plants are the best choice since you’ll never have to worry about them having any pesticides or bugs on them. Plus, you won’t have to water them."

Purchase mealworms.,
Keep your mealworms well-preserved.,
Do not use dead mealworms.,
Dust the mealworm with calcium.,
Feed your dragon by hand.,
Place one or two worms on a bowl or plate.,
Do not feed mealworms to baby beardies.,
Offer juvenile dragons mealworms.,
Give your adult dragon mealworms sparingly.",How to Feed Mealworms to a Bearded Dragon," You can buy mealworms in various sizes via mail order or at pet stores.For example, Petco sells mealworms in sizes ranging from ¼ inch to 1 inch.The younger your dragon, the smaller the worm should be. In fact, if in doubt, always purchase a smaller worm.


Mealworms consist of over sixty percent moisture, with smaller amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, and ash. They can be quite small, from a centimeter to almost two inches in length.You can raise your own mealworms. See Raise Mealworms for more tips.;
, If you leave your mealworms at room temperature, they will become beetles. Your beardie should not eat these. You also may put mealworms in the refrigerator for several months, which will incite deep sleep. If you want the worms to be “active,"" place them in a plastic container with oatmeal flakes. Add bits of celery or apple for hydration. They will last for two weeks this way., If you are preserving your mealworms and some die, do not feed them to your beardie. Dispose of them (preferably with gloves). Mealworms are appealing and exciting to eat because they are moving prey.


Wear gloves when touching and removing dead mealworms., When you feed your beardie mealworms, sprinkle calcium dust on the worms. At most, give calcium twice per week. This will help your dragon get needed nutrition plus necessary calcium.Purchase calcium carbonate at drugstores.
Grind the tablets into a powder.
Use a sugar shaker to coat the worms., One way to bond with your bearded dragon is to feed him his food from your fingertips or from a pair of tweezers. Put part of a worm on your finger. He will use his tongue to lick it up. Be aware beardies are not aggressive, but an accidental bite could take the tip off your finger. So be careful with your fingers!Only give your dragon small amounts of food that he can eat in one day., Place the mealworms in a bowl. Your dragon will eat from the bowl like a cat would eat.Make sure the bowl’s edges are not too high. Another option is to put the food on a plate for easy access. While this might be a bit messy, the food could be easier to reach.

, Because mealworms have a rough outer skeleton, they are hard for babies to digest. In fact, if a baby eats a mealworm, he might get a dangerous intestinal blockage. Instead, feed babies smaller foods like crickets, fruit flies, and tiny wax worms.If you notice your baby is having a hard time eating a certain food (e.g. she cannot get it in her mouth), remove the food from the cage. The food might be too big for your beardie to eat. For examples, beardies can only eat insects smaller than the distance between their eyes., One or two times weekly, you can feed mealworms to a juvenile dragon as a treat. Juvenile dragons are five months to eighteen months old. Still, you should aim to offer more vegetables than insects at this stage.Feed your dragon vegetables minimally four times weekly.Use baby mealworms. When mealworms are young (hatchlings), they are easier for the beardie to eat and digest.Only offer one to two worms.

, Adults are dragons over 18 months in age. While your adult can now digest mealworms properly, he should be eating even more fruits and vegetables than when he was a juvenile.Perhaps offer mealworms once per week and rotate mealworms with other insects.


Aim for a balance of one fourth insects, three fourths fresh fruits and vegetables.
Adult dragons also may eat mice or small lizards but feed these foods rarely.
Adult dragons are prone to be overweight. Do not overfeed them.
Female dragons may receive more food when they are breeding. Remember mealworms are a treat — only offer a few to your beardie.

Group the baby dragons together according to size.",How to Breed Bearded Dragons," There are several physical characteristics that will help you tell your male and female dragons apart. The male bearded dragon’s head is larger than that of a female. In addition, his abdominal girth will be smaller and he will have larger pores in his anal region.Another way to determine the sex is to look at the hemipenile bulges. To do this, hold your bearded dragon on his back in your hand and gently bend his tail toward his back at a 90-degree angle; be careful not to damage the vertebrae in his tail when you bend it. Two hemipenile bulges on either side of the tail indicate a male; one centered bulge or no bulge at all indicates a female.;
, It is essential that your bearded dragons are in optimal condition prior to breeding. Your veterinarian can give them a thorough physical exam and let you know if they are in good health or are in need of treatment. He or she can also test your dragons for atadenovirus, which is very contagious among dragons and can cause serious disease.Bearded dragons should not be bred if they test positive for atadenovirus, since it can be passed from mother to baby.Keep in mind that a bearded dragon that has the virus may not be shedding it at the time of the test, leading to a false negative result. For this reason, it would be good to have your dragons tested repeatedly before breeding.Have your veterinarian check your bearded dragons’ ages, lengths, and weights. For optimal breeding, the male should be at least 18 months old and the female should be at least 24 months old.They should both be at least 18 inches in length from snout to tail. The female should weigh at least 350 grams., Your female will need a daily supplement that contains calcium and vitamin D. This will help ensure that her eggs will be adequately calcified and that she will not suffer from a calcium deficiency after laying her eggs. She will also need a general multivitamin.Your female should receive this supplementation at least several weeks before breeding.Talk with your veterinarian if you have questions on how to incorporate these supplements into your female bearded dragon’s diet.

, Although your female and male bearded dragons will only temporarily live together in the same enclosure, it is important that the enclosure is set up for an optimal breeding situation. First, the enclosure should be large enough to comfortably house two adult bearded dragons; your local pet store can help you determine the exact enclosure size that you will need.Glass aquariums are very popular enclosures for bearded dragons, but other types are also available, including melamine cages and PVC cages. Using a screen lid cover will keep your bearded dragons from escaping and will allow for fresh air circulation.Use a thermometer to maintain the overall temperature at 77 to 88 degrees Farenheit during the day and the mid 70’s at night.Place a basking light (available at your local pet store) outside of the cage to provide a focal basking spot in the cage at a temperature of 105 degrees Farenheit.Position full-spectrum light bulbs (UVA and UVB) above the enclosure, about one foot from where your dragons will likely spend most of their time. The UVA and UVB rays from the bulbs will help keep your bearded dragons healthy by helping them produce vitamin D.Places branches and rocks in the enclosure. The branches will give your bearded dragons something to climb on, and the rocks will give your dragons opportunities to rest and hide from each other., The lay box is where your female dragon will lay her eggs. The lay box should be an eight to ten-gallon plastic container with a secure lid that allows for air circulation. Fill the box with about eight inches of either topsoil or potting soil, along with sand.The soil mixture should be damp enough so that it lightly clumps together and is easy to dig in. The soil should not be so dry that it would cave in when she tries to bury her eggs., The eggs will need to be removed from the lay box and incubated. It would be best to purchase a pre-made incubator at your local pet store to reduce the likelihood of malfunction. The Hovabator is a commonly used incubator for bearded dragon eggs.Fill small containers with either vermiculite or perlite (available at your local gardening store) and place them in the incubator. Press your thumb in each container to make a depression where the egg will go, and cover the container with a lid that allows for air circulation., Brumation is the process of decreasing the temperature and photoperiod (lighting schedule) for your bearded dragons. When the male and female are in their separate cages, decrease the temperature to 80 degrees Farenheit during the day and 60 degrees Farenheit at night. Decrease their exposure to light: 10 hours of light and 14 hours of darkness.You will probably notice that your dragons will eat less and hide more during brumation. They probably will not bask as much either. After brumation, they will want to resume their usual diet.Brumation should last at least two to three months before breeding., Your dragons probably will not mate right away, and will need some time to adjust to their new surroundings. Making this enclosure ready for them beforehand will get them more comfortable. When the male is ready to breed, his beard will darken to black., Your bearded dragons will exhibit courtship behaviors before the actual mating. Both your male and female will start bobbing their heads; the female may also start waving one of her arms to indicate her receptiveness to be bred. Your male may also stomp his feet and chase your female around the enclosure.Your bearded dragons may also twitch their tails as a courtship behavior., To mate, your male will quickly climb on the back of your female and bite her neck; biting her neck keeps her from running off before the mating process is complete.Your male will then press his cloacal region against that of your female. The entire mating process only take a few minutes.

, It is recommended to leave your dragons together for about a week after mating. After this one week, place them in their separate cages for one week. Put them together for another week for another mating session. You may need to do this several times to ensure a successful mating.Continue to feed your female her supplements after the mating. Increasing her exercise and keeping her well hydrated after mating will help her be better prepared to lay her eggs., Your female will demonstrate behavior that shows that she is ready to lay her eggs. She may start pacing her cage and looking a little anxious. She will also eat less and frantically dig in her cage.When she is exhibiting this behavior, gently move her to the lay box so that she can lay her eggs.


You will also be able to easily see that her belly is full of eggs. You will be able to see the outlines of the eggs, which will look like small marbles.Egg laying typically occurs about four to six weeks after mating., You will see her digging in the enclosure to create an area to lay her eggs. It may not be easy to tell when she has laid her eggs, especially if you didn’t see her do it. If this is the case, you will know that she has laid eggs when you see that her belly looks more deflated and flat.Remove her from the lay box after she has laid her eggs.


If you do not think that your female has laid all of her eggs, take her to your veterinarian immediately.She may be suffering from egg binding, which is a serious medical condition that would keep her from laying her eggs.
Female bearded dragons typically lay their eggs in the afternoon or early evening. You may want to start watching her around this time of day to see if she looks ready to lay her eggs.Females usually lay between about 24 eggs at a time, but can also lay as few as15 and as many as 50.A group of eggs is called a clutch.

, After she has laid her eggs, she should be placed back in her original cage. In general, female bearded dragons are not very maternal. Also, captive female bearded dragons tend not to guard their eggs., To do this, lift the eggs with your hands or a spoon. It is important to be extremely gentle when you are transferring the freshly laid eggs from the lay box to the incubator. As best you can, keep them in the same orientation as you found them in the lay box. It may be helpful to mark the top of the egg with a pencil to keep you from accidentally turning it upside down when placing it in the incubator.Place each egg in an individual container in the incubator. The egg should fit snugly within the thumb depression that you made earlier. Make sure that the egg is not covered with the vermiculite or perlite and place the lid on the container., Use a digital thermometer to monitor the temperature. If the temperature gets too hot within the incubator, the embryos could die inside the eggs.The incubator should be in a room that is cooler than the temperature inside the incubator; a warmer room would increase the incubator’s temperature, which puts the embryos at risk.The incubator’s humidity should be maintained at around 80%. Placing a bowl of water within the incubator will help to maintain the humidity level. Refill the water as needed.Check the temperature daily and the humidity about twice a week., Pay close attention to see if the eggs look wet or overly dry. Condensation on the eggs can be deadly to the embryos, so it is very important to make sure that the eggs do not have any moisture on them. If they look wet, take the lid off the incubator for 24 hours to release the excess humidity and let the vermiculite or perlite dry.If the eggs look dimpled or look like they’re about to collapse, they may be too dry. Use room temperature water to dampen the vermiculite, making sure not to make it so damp that the egg gets wet.Healthy and fertile eggs will increase to about twice their original size and turn chalk white. Eggs that are yellow, pink, or green may not be fertile.Eggs with mold on them may or may not be fertile. Talk with your veterinarian if you are unsure what to do with the moldy eggs.
The eggs will begin to hatch in about 60 to 70 days., Just prior to hatching, the eggs may begin to deflate and develop water droplets. These changes are completely normal and should not be confused with signs that the egg is infertile. You will also see a slit in the eggs exterior, which is caused by a baby bearded dragon’s egg tooth on the tip of their snout. The baby will make a slit large enough to fit its snout and head through, and will rest with its head out for about one day., Let the babies hatch on their own, which will typically take about 24 to 36 hours. You will probably notice that all of eggs will hatch within a day or two of each other.Keep the babies in the incubator for their first 24 hours of life to help them adjust to their new environment.Remove any babies that did not survive.

, Line their enclosure with moist paper towels, which will help keep them hydrated during their first few weeks of life. You can also lightly mist them with water until they begin drinking water on their own. In terms of food, the yolk from their individual eggs will provide them with nutrition for a few days, so you can wait until around day 3 to feed them real food (crickets, chopped greens).You will need at least a 20 gallon tank to hold the baby dragons. They will need larger tanks as they grow older.Provide the babies with plenty of food so that they do not begin nipping at each other’s toes or tails. Place the larger and more dominant babies in a separate enclosure so that the smaller ones can eat. "

At this time, you decide whether a beardie is the right pet for you, and make sure that you have everything you need before bringing your dragon home.Be aware that bearded dragons, while they make delightful pets, are not ideal for children. They require close attention to detail, such as correct temperatures and regular replacement of UVB bulbs.;
, Baby dragons can be very fragile and more apt to become ill or overly stressed. It's much easier to care for a more developed bearded dragon., You don't want a dragon that can't lift its head or looks lethargic.

, It should have no sores, burns, pus, external parasites, or deformities.


Note, however, that many dragons may be missing toes or bits of their tail, but this will not cause them any discomfort as long as the wound looks healed and shows no sign of infection.

, Shortly after purchasing your dragon, make an appointment to visit the vet, who can check for any parasites and evaluate the dragon's overall health.


It may help to bring a stool sample on your first visit. Inquire about this when you call to make the appointment.
There are no vaccines recommended for bearded dragons., Larger beardies may be aggressive towards smaller ones, and males tend to be territorial. This is further complicated by the fact that it can be difficult to sex bearded dragons when they're young, so you may not know whether you have a male or female beardie at first., As opposed to a terrarium or aquarium, which have four glass sides, a vivarium has solid walls on three sides with a glass frontage. A terrarium is difficult to keep adequately hot, so your beardie will either be chilled or your heating bills sky high. Note that the vivarium has to be at least 3'x1'x1.5'.


If a vivarium is not available, opt for a glass aquarium with a screen top.
If you're building an enclosure yourself, keep in mind that it must be well ventilated, easy to disinfect, and able to maintain high temperatures (see below).
Cages with wooden sides must be sealed with polyurethane or a similar waterproofing agent, and the joints must be caulked for proper cleaning and disinfection. Ensure that fresh polyurethane be allowed to dry several days and air the cage out thoroughly before placing your beardie in it, otherwise toxicity may result., Beardies can grow up to 2 feet (61 cm), move fast, and like to climb, so they need plenty of space in their home.For young dragons, a 10 gallon (39 L) tank is adequate,but this will last them only for a few months, as they grow quickly. An adult dragon requires much more room: a minimum of 55 to 60 gallons (208 to 227 L) is required,but 75 to 120 gallons (284 to 454 L) is preferable.


If you're building an enclosure, make sure it is at least 48 in (122 cm) long, 24 in (61 cm) wide, and 18 in (48 cm) high.
To save money, you can purchase a large adult habitat immediately. Consider using adjustable partitions to increase the living space as your beardie grows., Do not use glass, plexiglass or wood to cover your cages. This will not allow enough air circulation and will also trap humidity in the cage. Screen tops ensure there's adequate air flow, allow your lighting and heat sources to work correctly, and also let humidity escape.


Ensure that the lid fits tightly.

, The bottom of the enclosure should be lined with a substrate that is safe for your dragon and easy to clean. It is very important to choose a material that does not put your dragon at risk: beardies often eat bedding made of small particles, which can result in impaction (blockage of the intestines) and death. Use flat newspaper, paper towels, butcher paper, or reptile carpet.These choices are cheap, easy to clean, and pose no health risks to your animal.


If using reptile carpet, the type that looks and feels like grass (Astroturf) is the best. The felt kind has little loops of fabric that may catch the nails of your dragon and cause injury.
Never use sand, shavings, corncob, fiber pellets, kitty litter, potting soil with vermiculite, pesticides, fertilizer, or wetting agents, or any other loose substrate for bearded dragons., Create an environment where your beardie can climb, hide, and bask – all behaviors that it needs for well-being.


Add some branches for climbing and basking. They should be securely located under the secondary heat source (see Part 3). Make sure they are as wide as your bearded dragon. Oak is a good choice, as are boards covered in carpets. Avoid wood with sticky sap or pitch.
Provide some smooth rocks for basking and wearing down nails.
Give your beardie a place to seclude itself. You can add an empty cardboard box, cardboard tube, or flower pot. The hiding place should give a snug fit and be placed high in the enclosure. If your dragon doesn't use the hiding space, try moving it to a new location or using a different object.
Put in a few plants to provide shade, humidity, and a sense of security. Make sure the plants you choose are nontoxic to bearded dragons (such as Dracaena, Ficus benjamina, and hibiscus). It is important that the plants and their soil have not been treated with pesticides, vermiculite, fertilizer, or wetting agents. Before putting the plant in the cage, wash the plant with a water spray and pour water enough water on the soil so that it drains out the bottom: this helps remove any toxic chemicals. You may also want to keep newly purchased plants in a separate part of the house for a while before introducing them to the bearded dragon's  enclosure., You'll need a source of heat that maintains temperatures within the enclosure at a level comfortable for the bearded dragon. Dragons like temperatures between 78 and 88 F (25 to 31 C) during the day, and evening temperatures between 70 and 79 F (21 and 26 C).


Use a series of incandescent lights above the top of the cage. Keep in mind that they'll need to be turned off at night, when another heat source will be necessary, depending on the temperature in the room.
Try a heating pad under the cage or a ceramic infrared heater as an evening source of heat.
There are reptile-specific incandescent bulbs which emit heat but little visible light; however, these are expensive.
For larger enclosures, adjust the room temperature with a thermostat or space heater.
Always include a fire alarm in a room where light or other heat sources are in operation., Beardies like a temperature gradient in their habitat, allowing them to move between warmer and cooler spaces. The secondary heat source provides them with a spot where they can bask. This area should cover about 25-30 percent of the total enclosure surface, with a temperature of about 95-100 F (35-38 C). You can use a special basking light, or opt for a simple 30-75 watt incandescent bulb in a ceramic base. The source should be securely mounted where the animal cannot touch it.


Never use hot rocks as a heat source!
Note that baby bearded dragons in a smaller cage space will need a lower wattage, otherwise the enclosure may become too hot.Any temperatures above 110 F (43 C) are not recommended, but within a few degrees of these basking temperatures will be sufficient.
One thermometer on the ""hot side"" and one on the ""cool side"" will make sure that your temperatures are in the correct range.

, Bearded dragons require ultraviolet light in order to produce Vitamin D, which in turn aids calcium absorption; insufficiency can lead to metabolic bone disease. You can use either fluorescent or mercury vapor bulbs; the former need to be replaced approximately every six months, since UVB output diminishes over time.They should have about 12 to 14 hours per day of exposure.


Make sure the fluorescent bulb has at least 5 percent UVB (check the packaging for these specifications).
Look for light strips that cover the length of the enclosure.
Consider reptile-specific black lights in the 290-320 nanometer range. (Note that these are not the same as plant-grow lights or psychedelic black lights, neither of which produces UVB rays.) You can choose bulbs that emit both white light and UVB, or UVB only.
Ideally, the UVB light source should be about 10-12 in (25.4-30.5 cm) from wherever the bearded dragon spends most of its time (such as the basking site) to ensure adequate exposure. It should be no farther than 18 in (45.7 cm) away.
Keep in mind that UVB rays do not pass through glass. Your UVB source should be above the mesh top of the enclosure, and the mesh should not be too fine.
The sun is the best source of UVB rays. On sunny days when the temperatures are in the appropriate range (see Part 3, Step 1, above), place your beardie outside in a secure screen or wire cage with a locking door. Remember to provide some shade and hiding spaces, as well., One of the most important things to keep in mind when feeding your beardie is that any and all food items it eats should be no bigger than the space between its eyes. If the food items are larger than this, it could cause choking, impaction, and hind-leg paralysis.

, Beardies are omnivores, meaning that they eat both animal and plant matter. However, hatchlings and juveniles have specific dietary needs. Offer as many tiny insects as your beardie will eat in a five-to-ten minute time frame. When your beardie stops eating, stop offering. Young bearded dragons can eat anywhere from 20-60 pinhead crickets a day.


Provide hatchlings with a diet of small insects. If you are caring for a very young bearded dragon, you'll need to give it very small prey, such as pinhead crickets and tiny, freshly molted worms. You can very gradually introduce day-old pinkie mice when they are ready.
Feed juvenile dragons (two to four months old) a mix of 80 percent small insects and 20 percent greens (see below for recommendations).
Young dragons need to be fed two to three times per day.

, The adult diet is about 60 to 65 percent plant foods and 30 to 45 percent prey items. Calcium-rich leafy greens and other veggies should make up the bulk of the diet.


Feed a ""salad"" based on collards, dandelion greens and flowers, escarole, endive, grape leaves, mustard greens, turnip greens, and/or watercress.
You can add the following to the salad to balance it out: acorn squash, red and green bell peppers, butternut squash, green beans, lentils, peas, pumpkin and other winter squash, snow peas, sweet potatoes, and turnips. Cook or microwave squashes before feeding to soften them up.
Give the following veggies sparingly as treats: cabbage, chard, and kale (which are high in calcium oxalates and can cause metabolic bone disease); carrots (high in Vitamin A, which in high levels can be toxic); spinach, broccoli, and parsley (high in goitrogens, which decrease thyroid function); and corn, cucumbers, radishes, sprouts, and zucchini (these are low in nutrition).
Spraying the greens with water will help them last longer and will also help keep your bearded dragon hydrated.
Shred the veggies and mix them together in the salad to encourage your beardie to eat a variety of foods, rather than just picking out its favorites., You can also give your bearded dragon bites of the following: apples, apricots, bananas, berries, cantaloupe, figs, grapes, mangos, oranges, papayas, peaches, pears, plums, tomatoes, Ficus benjamina, geraniums, hibiscus flowers and leaves, pansies, petunias, pothos, rose petals and leaves, snail vine, and violets.

, You can try feeding crickets, super worms, wax worms, mealworms, pinky mice, and hissing cockroaches.""Gutload"" the prey by feeding it a nutrient-rich diet one to two days before serving it to your beardie. For example, you can feed it ground legumes, cornmeal, carrots, sweet potatoes, collard greens, mustard greens, broccoli, spinach, apples, oranges, cereals, and rolled oats.Any uneaten prey items should be removed from your dragon's enclosure.
It is advisable to purchase the prey, since wild-caught prey (for example, something you catch in your yard) may have been exposed to toxic chemicals or have parasites that could be passed on to your dragon.
Lightning bugs are toxic to your dragon.
Silkworms are a good staple diet only if you have a sick or pregnant dragon.

, Buy a calcium supplement in powder form (without phosphate added) and sprinkle it over the salad and prey right before serving. Do this once per day for juveniles (under two years of age) and once or twice a week for adults.You may also want to supplement Vitamin D3.
Consult the product directions and/or your veterinarian about the amount of supplements to give, since over-dosing can lead to toxic levels.

, When it is time to shed, a bearded dragon may not eat. However, if it does not eat after more than three days and there is no sign of shedding, then your beardie may be ill. In that case, call your veterinarian to schedule an appointment.

, Offer the water in a shallow bowl. Wiggling your finger in the water may also get their attention. Bearded dragons like things that move, so creating ripples in the water may pique their curiosity. However, many dragons do not drink from a water bowl, so you may have to drip the water slowly onto your dragon's snout with a dropper.


Beardies often defecate in their water bowl, so change the water once a day (or immediately if you notice fecal matter). For the same reason, you'll need to disinfect the bowl once a week with a 1:10 bleach-water solution to avoid any bacterial build-up.If your beardie is uninterested in drinking, spritz it lightly with water: it will lick the drops off its skin., Bathing your dragon once a week will help keep it hydrated and also aid in shedding.


Bathwater should be warm on your wrist and not hot, much like Bathwater for a small child.
Make the water only as deep as your dragon's chest, or half-way up their front arms. Fill the tub until the water reaches the second knuckle on your index finger for adults and the first knuckle for the juveniles.
Never leave your Bearded Dragon unattended in the bath - accidents only take a second to happen.
It's a good idea to disinfect your tub when the bath is over because dragons will often defecate in the water. Use a 1:10 solution of bleach and water., You'll need to clean their enclosure, as well as the food and water bowls, once a week.


Mix a 1:10 solution of bleach and water in a spray bottle.
Remove your beardie from the cage. Have someone hold it, or place it in a safe enclosure.
Use hot, soapy water and a clean rag to wipe away any dirt or feces.
Next, spray the bleach solution across the entire surface of what you are cleaning until it is soaked and let it sit for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, scrub the surface with a rag or paper towel, making sure any old food or feces is removed.
Rinse all surfaces repeatedly with water until you can no longer smell bleach. If you still smell bleach rinse again.

, Hand washing is very important when owning any reptile. Washing your hands before and after handling your dragon will help keep you and your new pet healthy. If you wash your hands before handling, you reduce the risk of passing anything on to your dragon. Washing your hands after handling greatly reduces the risk to you of contracting Salmonella. The risks of getting this are very slim to begin with, but hand-washing will even further reduce them. Your chances of contracting Salmonella from the food you eat are greater than your chances of getting it from your dragon.


Because bearded dragons may carry Salmonella, use a separate sponge to clean their food and water bowl, supervise children when handling them, and don't let them crawl around the kitchen. Also, avoid kissing your beardie, no matter how much you love it., Bearded dragons tend to be curious, mellow creatures that appear to enjoy human company. Regular handling helps them get accustomed to people and minimizes stress during events like enclosure cleanings and trips to the vet.


Pick up your beardie by placing your hand under its belly and gently scooping it up. Let the dragon lay on your palm, and lightly curl your fingers around its abdomen., Bearded dragons have very rough skin, so this may protect you from light scratches.

, Your dragon's nails will get needle-sharp, so be sure to maintain them.


Wrap your beardie in a towel, leaving one leg exposed.
Have an assistant hold the beardie.
Use human nail clippers to take off the very tip of the nails. Do just a little, as lizards have a vein, called a quick, running through their fingers.
If you do cut into the quick, stop the bleeding by dabbing a little cornstarch onto the nail with a cotton swab.
Alternatively, you can file your dragon's nails, or have a vet cut them for a nominal fee., You'll understand your beardie better by recognizing certain gestures it makes.


Inflated beard: When a lizard wants to show dominance, or feels startled or threatened - this particularly happens during breeding season - it puffs its throat out.
Mouth gaping: As with the inflated beard, this gesture is meant to make the dragon look menacing, as a show of dominance or to scare off a potential aggressor.
Bobbing head: Males show dominance with this gesture.
Arm waving: Sometimes a dragon may hold up one front leg and slowly wave it, which is a sign of submission.
Raised tail: This is commonly seen during breeding season. It can also be a sign of alertness and activeness. Juveniles tend to raise their tail when they're hunting prey., After your initial veterinary visit, it is important to bring your beardie for an annual check-up. This helps detect any potential issues early, and keeps your friend as healthy as possible."

Take your dragon to the veterinarian.",How to Build Love With Your Bearded Dragon," A vivarium is a wooden tank with a glass front. It should have a tight lid and smooth sides to prevent the dragon from hurting his nose. Look for a vivarium that will be easy to clean. Vivariums should have a polyurethane or waterproof sealing. You should make sure the joints are caulked as well.If you waterproof a vivarium yourself, be sure to allow the vivarium to dry for a week before putting your dragon in his home.Make sure your dragon has enough space to run around, climb, and sit on branches.Clean your pet’s habitat thoroughly regularly with a 10:1 mixture of water to bleach.Remove any vegetables that he does not eat within four hours. Remove uneaten insects at the day’s end.;
, You can also purchase an aquarium for your dragon. Baby dragons can live in a 10–15 gallon (37.9–56.8 L) aquarium, while adults need a larger 55-60 gallon space.Aquariums are a better short-term solution because it is difficult to regulate the temperature in them., Wooden vivariums encapsulate heat better than glass or metal does. Aim to provide a less warm area (30 degrees Celsius/86 degrees Fahrenheit) and a warmer section (45 degrees Celsius/113 degrees Fahrenheit). The vivarium should be no smaller than 48 x 24 x 24 inches (61 cm). Make sure your vivarium has air vents, minimally one per square foot. The vent should be on the upper part of the back wall rather than on the lower section.See Care for Bearded Dragons for additional instructions on how to set up your pet’s habitat and vivarium.


You can purchase a vivarium or make your own using DIY kits, such as Vivexotic., A substrate is the material that fills the bottom of the vivarium. Your pet will dig into the substrate.Aim for a substrate that looks natural and makes your dragon feel at home. The substrate should also be absorbent. Because your dragon might eat parts of it unintentionally, try to find substrate that is non-toxic and safely digestible. You can utilize smooth newspapers, indoor or outdoor carpet, brown paper, or AstroTurf.


Do not use wood chips or shavings, gravel, cat litter, or soil with pesticides, vermiculite, fertilizers, or surfactants for your substrate, Include branches for climbing. A reptile hammock is also fun for your pet and available at pet stores. Equip your dragon's space with a ""reptile hide,"" which is an enclosed area in which your dragon can hide from you. Your dragon also will use this space for long periods of sleep. Place a ""basking platform"" in the habitat as well. This can be a rock or another surface within six to eight inches of the basking light source. Here a dragon can warm himself.Be sure to strip all bark from natural wood branches so that your dragon does not eat the wood. Clean all branches prior to use., Dragons actually like to be held. Wait three to four days after the dragon’s arrival to start holding him. Wash your hands before and after handling the pet. Begin by holding him for short periods multiple times a day. This helps build trust slowly.


When holding your dragon, strive to have a quiet setting.Babies, young children, women who are or might be pregnant, the elderly, or people with weakened immune systems should be careful about touching the dragon or being near its home.Salmonella infections can occur.Consult a doctor if you or your child belongs to one of these populations before allowing contact with the reptile.
See Hold a Bearded Dragon for thorough tips.

, Gather your dragon from underneath his body in a slow, yet self-assured, scooping motion. Support his whole body plus his legs and tail.Do not hold or pull your dragon by his tail. It can come off!, It is important to tame your dragon from the beginning. If your dragon appears aggressive (his “beard” will darken),hold him tightly (not too tightly) with both of your hands and pet him. If your pet appears particularly agitated, release him for a short moment and then try holding him again until he calms himself. Training your dragon to be held and calm can take a number of months but it is vital to creating a good relationship with your dragon., One way to bond with your dragon is to give him his food directly. You should do this occasionally but not so often that your dragon becomes reliant upon you. Instinctually, dragons hunt for their food so you should still give your dragon his food in a bowl most of the time. Place the food on the tip of your fingers. Your dragon will use his tongue to take the food from you. Bearded dragons eat vegetables, living insects like crickets, waxworms, or mealworms, or bearded dragon foods available for purchase at pet shops.Safe vegetables include squash, endive, turnip greens, or collard greens. Dragons also can eat apples, strawberries, and melons.Do not feed your pet spinach, avocado, lettuce, or wild insects.Implement a regular feeding plan. Whether feeding by hand or putting the food in your dragon’s home, your dragon will anticipate feeding time. He then will associate a positive experience with you!You should feed your young dragon once daily and your adults once per day or every second day.Juvenile dragons require a mainly live food diet. Beardies are able to transition onto a vegetarian diet as they mature.
It is possible your dragon might think your fingers are food. Be careful when feeding him!, By giving your lizard a bath, you will help him stay hydrated. Dragons absorb water through their pores. This is particularly important because dragons do not love to drink form a water bowl. To bathe your dragon, fill a sink, bathtub, or other clean container with warm water (try to reach 34.5-35.5 degrees Celsius/94-96 degrees Fahrenheit). Your dragon might enjoy this activity and again associate pleasure with you!Be sure to clean the bathing container thoroughly after use.Mist your pet with water every second day. This will help your lizard also to stay hydrated.Try to bathe your pet every four to eight days although you can bathe him every day., In order for your dragon to be happy, you should try to reduce his stress levels. High stress can lead to aggression. When your dragon sleeps, keep the noise levels in your house down. When your dragon decides to hide under something, this could signal that he wants to be alone. Try to respond appropriately to your dragon’s behavior and avoid disturbances unless there is a pressing need.It’s okay to let your dragon roam a bit outside his habitat. Just be sure to keep him from the kitchen or other rooms where you eat or prepare food., Like any pet, bearded dragons should have yearly check-ups. Also, if you sense that your bearded dragon is acting differently than normal, schedule an appointment with the vet. Mites are a common issue that dragons face--they suck the reptile’s blood. Only a vet can determine, though, through testing whether your pet is truly ill."

Know your gecko's active periods.,
Know where to look.,
Understand a gecko's ideal temperature.,
Know the legality of keeping a wild gecko.",How to Catch a Gecko1," Most geckos are active at night.This makes it easier for them to hunt for insects and avoid the extreme temperatures of the desert during peak sunlight hours.However, some geckos, notably from the genus Phelsuma, are diurnal, or active during the day. These geckos are called day geckos.Knowing whether the gecko you are trying to catch is active during the day or during the night will determine when and how you approach these lizards.


Geckos from the genus Phelsuma are indigenous to Madagascar and several islands in the Indian Ocean, but have been introduced to Hawaii and Florida in the United States by humans.Geckos from the genus Lygodactylus are native to parts of Africa, including Madagascar, and parts of South America.Geckos from the genus Gonatodes are native to the Caribbean Islands and parts of Central and South America.Geckos from the genus Eurydactylodes are native to the Southwest Pacific region, located in New Caledonia and Koumac.The Moorish gecko, from the genus Tarentola, is indigenous to South Europe and North Africa, but has been introduced by humans to Florida and California in the United States.Tokay and leopard geckos are naturally nocturnal, but have been observed in captivity to adjust to diurnal cycles.If you have a pet tokay or leopard gecko, it may have adapted to your diurnal schedule, and you may need to search for your gecko during the day.;
, If you decide to look for a nocturnal gecko during the day (or a diurnal gecko during the night), knowing where the gecko sleeps may be helpful. Many geckos seek out sheltered places to sleep. In the wild, geckos may sleep hidden under tree bark, in natural crevices, or underneath larger objects.If you're looking for a wild gecko in your yard, try peeling back loose tree bark or lifting fallen tree branches. If you're searching in or around your home, look for small cracks in the foundation, gaps in the siding or floor boards of your home, or anywhere else a small lizard might fit.

, Geckos are cold-blooded, which is important to keep in mind as you search for a gecko. If you are trying to find a gecko that is loose in your house, and you keep your home air conditioned, the gecko may seek out a warmer location within your house, such as underneath heat-emitting appliances like refrigerators., Laws that govern the catching and keeping wild animals, including geckos, can vary widely from one state to another, and from one country to another. Check with your local Department of Agriculture or your country's office of disease control, or contact your local government on regional regulations regarding the keeping of wild geckos as pets."
"
Wash your hands.,
Approach the lizard slowly until you are able to touch it.,
Pet the bearded dragon gently.,
Pick up the beardie.,
Get comfortable and stay calm.,
Read the bearded dragon’s body language.,
Return the dragon to its habitat.,
Wash your hands.",How to Hold a Bearded Dragon," Washing your hands before you handle a bearded dragon will reduce the risk of passing any germs or illnesses on to the dragon. You may also consider wearing gloves; this has the added benefit of protecting your hands from the dragon’s rough skin.;
, It is important that your actions around the beardie are calm and deliberate. If the beardie is stressed, it will not be comfortable being held. If the beardie is in a cage or enclosure, you will have to slowly reach in, but do not attempt to reach from above; bearded dragons have sensory nerves on top of their heads that will interpret your reach as an attack.


Do not interrupt the bearded dragon while it is eating.
Do not back a beardie up in a corner, as it will feel threatened.
Do not tease the lizard with your finger, as it might think it's a worm and chomp!

, This will allow the dragon to become accustomed to your hand and feel comfortable. When the bearded dragon has blinked or closed its eyes, it is calm enough to pick up. A beardie shows anger or stress by making his chin go black, and if he's very angry his chin is black and puffed up. If you see this, then it's best to back off as the beardie is not in the right frame of mind to be picked up.Again, remember not to approach your beardie from above, as holding your hand above their head or eyes will trigger their predatory instincts.

, Gently put your hand, palm upturned, under its body and scoop it up. Use your thumb and forefinger to support the front arms while the body rests in the palm of your hand. Make sure that all of the dragon's legs are supported. You might place a second hand under the tail as well.


If getting your hand under the dragon is awkward, gently grasp the dragon behind the front shoulders with your forefinger and thumb to lift slightly, and slide your other hand underneath.
Don’t squeeze, just support. Let it sit on your hands.
Be aware that if the beardie's back end is not supported, he will 'windmill' his tail around in circles. If this happens, immediately support his rear legs and tail, so that he feels more secure. Otherwise, he may injure his back.

, Place the bearded dragon on your arm, chest, or lap and it will most likely stay there comfortably while you pet it. Your calm gentle touches will help the beardie to feel relaxed. Adult bearded dragons can be up to two feet long, so you may be most comfortable sitting with it. Young dragons are speedy, so you may want to loosely hold on.


Know that a beardie's scales and spikes point in one direction, so pet him along the scales rather than against or you will end up with prickles in your skin and an angry beardie.

, The bearded dragon will communicate its level of comfort to you and if you’re able to decipher what it’s saying, you’ll have a better experience holding it.If it becomes stressed or agitated, put it back in its cage. Watch for these gestures:


Inflated beard: When a lizard wants to show dominance, or feels startled or threatened - this particularly happens during breeding season - it puffs its throat out.
Mouth gaping: As with the inflated beard, this gesture is meant to make the dragon look menacing, as a show of dominance or to scare off a potential aggressor.
Mouth open, but not wide. It may just be trying to cool off.
Bobbing head: Males show dominance with this gesture.
Arm waving: Sometimes a dragon may hold up one front leg and slowly wave it, which is a sign of submission.
Raised tail: This is commonly seen during breeding season. It can also be a sign of alertness and activeness. Juveniles tend to raise their tail when they're hunting prey., When you are done holding the dragon, or the dragon is done being held, return it to is enclosure using the steps described above. You can hold a bearded dragon for as long as it will tolerate being held. Start with 15 minutes once a day and as it gets used to being handled, you can hold it longer. Some dragons enjoy being held several times a day for several hours. When the beardie becomes restless, it is time to put him back.


The length of time he can stay out of his vivarium depends on the room temperature. Reptiles are cold-blooded, so if the room is cool, he may start to chill and his digestion will stop. If his belly feels cool to the touch, then return him to the vivarium to warm up.

, Bearded dragons, like most reptiles carry Salmonella. It is normal for them, but can cause illness in people. Always wash your hands after handling a bearded dragon."
"
Create a humid environment.,
Set a pitfall trap.,
Make funnel traps.",How to Catch a Gecko2," Many geckos will be drawn to a warm, wet environment. You can replicate this climate by creating a trap that will lure your gecko in.Cut a small hole in three of the four faces of a shoebox.
Run several sheets of paper towel under warm to hot tap water.
Line the floor of the shoebox with the warm, wet paper towels.
Set the box up against a wall in a quiet part of the house.
Check the shoebox at least once every hour.

, This will only really work for catching geckos outdoors. A little planning will help you create an excellent in-ground gecko trap.


Dig a hole in the ground, as deep as the height of a bucket.Create a series of in-ground holes to maximize the efficiency of this method.Put a wet sponge in each bucket so that the geckos you catch do not dry out, in case they are not found right away.Once submerged in the ground, cover the opening of each bucket with a piece of netting or fine mesh. The covering should be big enough to completely cover the mouth of each bucket, but not so big that the gecko will be able to climb out once it falls into the bucket.
Check the buckets every couple of hours., Funnel traps do not have to be dug into the ground like pitfall traps, and rely on a setup that allows a gecko to enter the trap and have difficulty exiting the trap.


Cut 0.125-, 0.25-, or 0.33-inch mesh hardware cloth into 18-inch wide sections.Roll each trap body into a cylinder, and secure it into that shape with zip ties, rubber bands, or twine tied around the tube.Roll additional pieces of mesh hardware cloth into funnels with a narrow opening, around two inches (roughly five centimeters) in diameter.Insert the funnels into each end of the cylinder, with the narrow points inside the tube.Cut flaps into the mesh hardware cloth that hangs over the opening on each end, such that geckos could easily climb into the tube but would not be able to easily climb out.Be sure to leave a wet sponge in the cylinder of each funnel trap you set up, and leave the trap in a shaded area for outdoor setups so that the gecko(s) will not overheat in direct sunlight.Make the trap more alluring by leaving a couple small insects, such as crickets, inside the trap.

"
"
Use a net.,
Use your hands.,
Use a stick.",How to Catch a Gecko3," Having a big, long net will be the easiest way to catch a gecko, as it allows you to capture the gecko from the greatest distance.Hover the net slightly above the gecko.
Try to center the net's rim around the spot the gecko is standing.
Drop the net as quickly as possible. Hold the rim of the net down against the ground or wall to contain the gecko, once you've trapped it.

, Wear thick gloves if you're unsure whether the gecko might bite.Cup your hands together, creating a hollow tube with your hands.
Hover your hands slightly above the gecko.
Drop your cupped hands down over the gecko. Be sure that the gecko won't be able to climb out of your hands. Keep the bottoms of your hands flat against the ground, and your fingers tightly knit.

, You can use a stick to gently ""guide"" a gecko in the direction you want it to go.


Slowly lower the stick slightly behind the gecko.
When the gecko moves, continue to ""herd"" the gecko in the direction you want it to go.

Be careful not to harm the gecko. You should never actually touch the lizard with the stick. It should simply be used to guide the gecko toward a net or a second person with open hands.

"
"
Pick your gecko up carefully.,
Let your gecko get used to you.,
Create a comfortable habitat.",How to Catch a Gecko4," It's best not to handle geckos too often, especially if the gecko is still growing accustomed to living with and being handled by you. Some geckos may even bite humans who try to pick the gecko up or handle it.But if you must pick it up, be sure to exercise great caution to avoid frightening or injuring the gecko.


Wear gloves if your gecko is prone to biting. This will protect your hands, in the process, may help prevent accidental drops that result from unexpected bites.
Sit on the floor. This way, in case you accidentally drop your gecko, it won't fall far.Never squeeze or handle your gecko roughly.
Do not grab your gecko by the tail. It may come unattached, and it can take up to 40 days for a new tail to grow., Once your gecko has been adequately adjusted to its new living environment, it will need to get used to being handled by you. Spend 10 to 15 minutes each day letting the gecko run over and through your loose fingers and across from one hand to the other., Understand what kind of environment your species of gecko prefers, and try to replicate that environment as best you can at home.


Nocturnal geckos should be kept in a dark enclosure at night.Give your gecko small plants and little objects to hide under or behind.Be aware of whether your species of gecko can climb walls. You may need to put a mesh screen over the enclosure to prevent your gecko from escaping easily.Keep a clean water bowl in your gecko's enclosure. You may also want to spray a mist of water onto the plants in the enclosure, as this may help further replicate what your gecko is used to in the wild, depending on its species.Feed your gecko insects. Some geckos prefer crickets and mealworms. Others prefer smaller insects, depending on the size and dietary needs of each gecko species. Young crickets may need one to three insects everyday. Older geckos may prefer being fed four to six insects three times each week, or roughly every other day."
"
Go for a full grown dragon.,
Check that the bearded dragon is alert and plump.,
Make sure the dragon has no broken limbs or skin.,
Check the enclosure for cleanliness.,
Buy a dragon from a breeder.,
Get the dragon from a pet store.,
Look for bearded dragons at reptile shows.,
Have the enclosure set up and ready.,
Be prepared for the dragon to be nervous or timid.,
Put the dragon on a feeding schedule.",How to Buy a Bearded Dragon," Though younger bearded dragon babies are cute to look at, they are fragile and have a higher risk of illness. Some babies may also lose their appetite and must be force fed to stay alive. Getting a full-grown or close to full-grown dragon as a pet will ensure it remains healthy and easy to care for.Look for a dragon that is at least six to 10 weeks old and six to 10 inches in length. This will ensure the dragon is not too young and has hit a mature age. You can also ask the breeder you are buying from about the age of the bearded dragon before you buy her.
If you already have one bearded dragon and are looking for a second one, you should go for a dragon of the same sex. Two female dragons usually get along well. A male and a female dragon may end up fighting or mating, which could lead to unwanted dragon babies in your vivarium.You may want to avoid buying more than one bearded dragon at a time, as the two dragons may end up not getting along. You would then have the sell one dragon or set up a separate vivarium for each dragon.;
, Note if the dragon moves her eyes towards you when you approach its cage, appearing alert and awake. The dragon should not look lethargic or have eyes that are sunken in, as this may be a sign of dehydration or illness. You should also check that the dragon’s face is clean and not covered in pus or fluid.You should notice if the dragon appears plump and large. Look at her limbs and tail. Make sure these areas appear full and fat, and that you cannot see her tail or hip bones. Lizards store fat in their tails and a healthy lizard should have a good fat supply.

, You should check the dragon’s skin to ensure there are no lesions, wounds, or irritated bumps. Then, look at her limbs, tail, and toes to make sure the skin does not appear broken or swollen. Make sure the dragon has no broken bones, as broken bones can be a sign of metabolic bone disease.You should also examine her limbs and toes to make sure they do not twitch or tremble, as these can also be a sign of metabolic bone disease.
You may observe the dragon running around in the enclosure to make sure she can use all of her limbs properly. The dragon should not limp or stumble when she moves. A missing toe or tip of the tail are okay as these often heal on their own, though they will not grow back. But broken bones and damaged legs or arms are not a good sign.

, You should inspect the enclosure the dragon is kept in and make sure it appears well kept, with fresh food and water. You should check that the dragon has been getting enough UVB light from a heat lamp in the enclosure and that the dragon has been given calcium supplements., Many lizard lovers buy their “beardies” from reputable reptile breeders. Buying a dragon from a breeder is often the safest option as many breeders only raise the same breed of bearded dragon, leading to less illness, injury, and disease. You can find bearded dragon breeders online and through your local herpetological society.Bearded dragons usually cost around $100 each, though this may vary by breeder. When you visit the breeder, you should check the cleanliness of the enclosures where the dragons are kept. Make sure you also do a good inspection of the dragon’s body and mannerisms to ensure he is going to be a healthy pet.

, You can also buy a dragon from your local pet store, though it may be more difficult to ensure the dragon is healthy. The best option is to buy a dragon from a breeder, but if you are not able to get in contact with a breeder, the pet store may be your only option. Try to find a pet store that keeps the same breed of bearded dragon in the same enclosure.You should also inspect the enclosure for cleanliness and examine the dragon well before you purchase him at the pet store.

, You can also buy bearded dragons from reptile shows or events, where collectors and breeders get together to sell reptiles. Make sure you check that the enclosure that holds the dragons is very clean and well kept.You should also chat with the breeder at the show to check that the dragons have been exposed to UVB light and been given the necessary supplements. A reputable breeder will only keep dragons of the same species together and may focus on breeding one particular breed of bearded dragon.

, Before you bring your new pet home, you should have its enclosure ready and setup. You should have a vivarium that is at least 47 inches (120 cm) long x 23 inches (60 cm) high x 23 inches (60 cm) wide for one bearded dragon. You can hold more than one dragon in the same vivarium or enclosure, but it should be large enough for more than one dragon.The enclosure should be well-ventilated, with a screen top and glass sides. You should include reptile-safe substrate at the bottom of the enclosure. Include rocks and branches from your new pet to climb on, as well as hiding areas in the enclosure.
There is some controversy about what is safe substrate for a reptile enclosure. Reptile-safe sand may still cause a gut impaction. It's best to weigh up the pros and cons of different substrates to see which one best suits you. Choose from reptile-safe sand, aspen, or repti-carpet.
Make sure the vivarium has one end that is hotter, at 38 to 42 degrees Celsius (100 to 107 degrees Fahrenheit), with the help of a UVB lamp that is a 10 to 12 percent fluorescent UV tube. You should have another end of the vivarium that is cooler and shaded, at 22 to 26 degrees Celsius (72 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit).
The humidity should be low in the tank. Use a hygrometer to make sure the enclosure is not too humid — it should be between 30 and 40%., Your new bearded dragon may appear nervous or timid during the first few days in her new space. She may not eat properly for the first two to three days as she adapts to his new environment. After warming up to you and her new enclosure, she should start to eat normally and be less shy.You should get in the habit of handling your dragon as a way to bond. Try to handle her on a consistent basis so she gets used to being held and touched. Always be gentle and use both hands to scoop up the dragon, supporting her four legs. Only handle the dragon for 10 to 15 minutes at a time, as you do not want her core temperature to drop too low.

, Try to put your dragon on a feeding schedule right away so she gets used to set meal times. Bearded dragons are omnivorous, so they eat live invertebrates as well as plants and animals. You should feed your dragon once a day, preferably in the morning so she can digest his food during the day.Feed your dragon greens like watercress, rocket, chicory, cress and grated butternut squash, as well as wild plants like dandelion, clover and plantain leaves. Avoid giving your dragon spinach, as well as too much cabbage or kale. Remove any uneaten items in the cage and replace them with fresh food at feeding time.
Give your dragon live invertebrates dusted with a calcium supplement. This can include crickets, locusts, and calci worms. Make sure the live food is no bigger than your dragon’s mouth. You should feed the live food the same greens as you feed your dragon and keep them in a well-ventilated container.
You should provide fresh water in a shallow water dish on a daily basis. Make sure there is not feces in the water dish, and if there is, replace the water.

Monitor your bearded dragon while it eats.",How to Feed a Bearded Dragon," Bearded dragons are omnivores, which means that they have a diet comprised of both plant and animal products. Beardies can also be fed baby mice (pinkies) occasionally.


In addition to insects and raw produce, bearded dragons can also eat some edible plants including carnation petals, clover, geranium flowers, maple leaves, and rose petals.;
, Juvenile bearded dragons require more meat-based protein than adults do, so they should be fed more insects and fewer plant products than adult bearded dragons.A bearded dragon is no longer considered a juvenile when it reaches approximately eight months old.
The correct ratio for juvenile bearded dragons is 80% insects and 20% plants, while the ratio for adult bearded dragons is the opposite: 20% insects and 80% plants.

, Purchase a few specimen from a pet store (don’t collect them from nature because they could be infested with parasites) and keep them in a small aquarium cage with a secure lid so they can’t escape. You should feed the insects vitamin-rich foods like carrots, legumes, apples, broccoli, and grain cereals to in turn give your bearded dragon added nutrition. Some insects, like fireflies, are poisonous to bearded dragons, so be careful to only feed them approved insects and food. Some good insects to choose from include:Crickets
Dubia roaches
Earthworms
Mealworms
Silkworms
Cockroaches
Superworms

, Your bearded dragon will also need a variety of fresh, raw vegetables as a central part of its diet, especially as your pet grows out of the juvenile stage. Make sure you cut the vegetables into smaller pieces that are easier for your bearded dragon to attempt to eat. Some safe vegetables you can provide include:Carrots
Zucchini
Cabbage
Bell peppers
Squash
Broccoli
Celery
Cucumbers
Kale
Pumpkins

, You should also prepare some fresh fruit for your bearded dragon to eat. Since bearded dragons are omnivores, much of the nutrition in their diet needs to come from plant-based materials, including fruit. However, fruit should constitute the smallest part of your dragon’s diet. Cut the fruit into small, manageable pieces. Some great options for safe fruit to feed your bearded dragon include:Apples
Peaches
Apricots
Blueberries
Papaya
Melons
Grapes
Raisins
Figs

, A common practice when feeding bearded dragons is to coat the insect specimen with calcium supplements. You can usually find calcium supplement in powder form at most health stores or supermarkets. Just sprinkle a bit of the powder on the insects before feeding them to your bearded dragon.You can use calcium carbonate or calcium gluconate.
This should be done once every day for juvenile bearded dragons, and 3-5 times per week for adult bearded dragons.

, If feeding your bearded dragon fresh fruits, vegetables, and insects every day seems like too much work, you might consider supplementing or even replacing these items with some commercial bearded dragon food. This kind of food supplement is made of little pellets that are packed with nutrients, usually from dried fruits and vegetables, so your bearded dragon will still get much of the same nutrient content.You can buy jars of this commercial food at most pet stores.
For most commercial food options, you’ll need to add a little bit of water to moisten the dried products.

, Once you’ve had your bearded dragon for a few weeks, you’ll get the hang of how much your dragon eats at each feeding. You don’t want to give them too much each time because then the fruit/vegetables will rot in their cages and you’ll have to clean it more frequently.A good rule of thumb is to give your dragon 1/8 cup of food at each feeding.
Adult bearded dragons should be fed 2-3 times each day.
A grown dragon should eat around 50 crickets or 30 worms per week.

, If you are using a feeding bowl (which is recommended for Mire worms) you should remove the bowl first, so you can do the work without worrying about the Bearded Dragon's actions or possible escape.Make sure you prepare the food out of the bearded dragons' view; if they can see food, they may become hyperactive and do their best to reach the food, even if it means escaping from their enclosure.

, Bearded dragons, especially young ones, often have a problem with eating too quickly and indiscriminately, so they may accidentally eat some of their cage substrate along with their food if you simply put the food inside their cage.Instead, you should place the food in a small, shallow dish and then put the dish inside the cage when it is time for your dragon to feed.
If you are using worms, place them in the bowl, sprinkle calcium powder on them, and place the bowl in the enclosure. The lizard will notice the worms moving, run over, and begin eating.
If you are using crickets or locusts, simply dust the crickets and find the opening to the enclosure that is furthest from the bearded dragon. Put the insects in the enclosure; the lizard should run straight at the insects and begin eating.

, This is especially important during the first few weeks that you have your pet dragon. You’ll need to watch your bearded dragon eat to make sure it is able to digest all of the food you give it.If it seems to struggle with the size of the food, you may need to provide smaller portions for the next feeding.
If your dragon doesn’t eat all of the food within the first 5-10 minutes, you should give it less food during the next feeding to avoid waste and added mess in the cage.

Get at least a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank for young ones or 20 for adult ones for it to live in.,
Buy crickets; fifty should be good for the first few weeks.,
Add a heat lamp on one side of the tank.

,
Put a bowl of water under the heat lamp so it will evaporate and help with the humidity level.,
Feed your gecko every other day.

,
Know that Tokay geckos are not very tame by nature.",How to Care for a Tokay Gecko," You will need a good substrate (cocoa fiber works well), and a hide of some sort for it to go in. Tokay geckos are strictly nocturnal.;
, Buy cricket food or put a few pieces of dog food in with the crickets.Dust crickets with a vitamin and calcium supplement at least every third feeding

,, Also, spray water all around the tank daily.Get a hygrometer -- the humidity level should be between 60-80%.

,, Sure, some can be dog tame, but most likely they will remain quite wild for their entire lives. You can try working with them to ""tame"" them, but don't get your hopes up. Tokays are amazing geckos that are beautiful and males can be vocal as well. They are a great lizard for someone who wants a lizard to look at, but not handle.

Wait a few days before feeding the newborns.",How to Care for a Leopard Gecko Egg," Gecko eggs need to be incubated to be healthy and safe. You will need to have an incubator ready before your gecko lays eggs so you can transfer the eggs quickly once they're laid.You can purchase an incubator at the store. This may be your easiest option as it will save you some time. However, if you're on a budget you can make an incubator.
You can use a small plastic container for the incubator. You can use a deli cup or a small tupperware container. Make sure any container you use is big enough to hold at least 24 ounces.;
, Substrate is the lining of the bottom of a cage. You can purchase substrate online or at a local pet store. The best materials for an incubator are the soils vermiculite or perlite. You can use one or the other, or a mixture of the two.You should put enough substrate  in the container that the bottom is fully covered. There should not be any parts of the bottom of the incubator exposed.
The exact amount you need will depend on the shape and size of your incubator.

, Gecko eggs need moisture to thrive, so you'll want to make sure the container is adequately moist. You want an equal ratio of water to substrate, based on weight.Weigh your substrate and add an equal amount of water. For example, say your substrate is 3 ounces. You will want to match that with 3 ounces of water. You can buy a small scale at a hardware store to take measurements.
Make sure the ratio is based on weight and not volume. It's very important that you keep the moisture levels appropriate as you want your geckos to be comfortable.
Mix the water in with your substrate to create a moist, even mixture in the incubator. Tap water is probably safe here, but you can use filtered water or bottled water if you want to err on the side of caution.

, Geckos need a temperature of at least 73 degrees. However, the ideal temperature is between 86 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. You can buy a small thermometer, like an oven thermometer, to measure the temperature in your incubator.If you need your incubator to warm up slightly, you can use heat tape or an under tank heating pad. Avoid heat rocks. These could burn a gecko.
Avoid air holes. You need to keep the environment for your gecko eggs warm. All you need to do is open the lid about once a week. You can let some air in, providing adequate oxygen, and check to make sure the eggs look healthy., Your female gecko will lay eggs somewhere in her tank, and may bury them slightly in the substrate. This will usually occur 3 to 4 weeks after mating, so be vigilant to check your female gecko around this time. She will lay eggs in batches, so not all the eggs will be laid in one sitting. Keep an eye on your gecko and notice when she is laying eggs. You will want to remove the eggs shortly after she finishes laying them. An adult gecko tank is not appropriate for eggs.Provide a moist hatching box, filled with substrate and an equal amount of water. Your gecko will naturally be drawn to a moist environment to lay her eggs. This will assure the eggs will be temporarily safe in the cage in the event your gecko lays her eggs while you're at work or school.If possible, wait until the mother has left the eggs. This way, you will not have to deal with working around the mother when you remove the eggs.
Remove the eggs gently, preferably using a spoon. If you pick the eggs up with your fingers, touch them very lightly. You do not want to damage the eggs when moving them.

, Gecko embryos attach themselves to one side of the egg shortly after birth. If you flip the eggs upside down, the embryo will die.If can help to mark the top side of the egg with a sharpie. If you choose to do so, however, mark it very lightly to avoid hurting the egg.

, Not all eggs will be fertile, so check your eggs for signs of good health. It's fairly easy to tell the difference between a healthy egg and an infertile egg.A healthy gecko egg is usually hard upon hatching, and gets harder as time passes. They are oval shaped. If you hold a candle near the egg, you should be able to see the embryo inside.
Infertile eggs are very soft. They have a texture similar to a water balloon. Infertile eggs may also be misshapen or shriveled in appearance.
You can discard of infertile eggs if there's limited room in your incubator. However, if you have the room, it's a good idea to keep all the eggs. Sometimes, a gecko egg that initially looks unhealthy may become healthier as time passes. What appear to be infertile eggs sometimes go on to hatch.

, Geckos should be transferred to a different tank within a few hours of hatching, so have a tank for them ready to go. As you're waiting for the eggs to hatch, take steps to have a tank ready for the hatchlings.You can buy an aquarium online or at a pet store. It should be at least 10 inches long, 8 inches wide, and 6 inches high.
Make sure you have a heat mat under the container to keep it warm.
Use a few layers of paper towel for substrate. Also, buy small tubes and structures at a local pet store. Newborns like to have space in their cage to hide.
Make sure you provide a small water bowl. You can buy a water bowl for newborns online or at a pet store. You can also use a plastic bottle cap.

, You do not need to intervene as the eggs start hatching. If you notice the hatching process, allow it to happen naturally. Gecko eggs do not take long to hatch, so it's possible you will check on your tank one day to find the geckos have hatched. Gecko eggs usually hatch within 35 to 89 days.Usually, you will not see the eggs hatch as it happens so quickly. You will only look in the incubator to see a gathering of gecko babies.
If you see the eggs start to hatch, marked by the eggs cracking and geckos emerging, it can be fun to watch. However, you do not have to intervene.

, Newborns will be very frightened of people after birth. Everything is new to young geckos, so leave them alone for about 12 hours. After this point, they will be used to the world and slightly more used to humans. Aim for a 12 hour range before removing the babies from the tank., Carefully pick up the newborns when transferring them. You may want to wear gloves when handling newborns, as they may bite. They will be afraid of humans at first.Remain calm when transferring the geckos. They may hiss or screech as you attempt to pick them up.
This sound can be startling, but reacting to it may frighten your newborns more.

, Newborns absorb a lot of nutrients from the yolk of their eggs. Therefore, they will not require food until a few days after hatching. When you do feed them, make sure you provide them with appropriately sized food.Crickets are a good food for newborns, but make sure the crickets you choose are small. They should be no wider than the width of a baby's head.
Do not be surprised if the geckos do not eat a lot at first. They may initially only eat one cricket per meal. Their appetite will increase as they grow.

Provide a 5–10 gallon (18.9–37.9 L) tank for your gecko.,
Make sure the tank has a heat gradient.,
Put substrate at the bottom of the tank.,
Add in plants and hiding spots.,
Mist the tank once a day to keep the humidity up.,
Give your gecko fresh water every day.,
Feed your gecko protein rich meals.,
Add supplements to your gecko’s food.,
Handle your gecko when it has reached adulthood.,
Never pick up your gecko from his underbelly.,
Allow your gecko to shed his skin on his own.",How to Care for a House Gecko," One single house gecko does not need much space to be happy and healthy. A deeper tank, with high walls, is ideal for a gecko. Use a glass tank with a screen lid so the gecko gets enough ventilation in his tank.If you decide to keep more than one gecko at a time, you should add five gallons to the space per gecko. So, for two geckos you will need a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank, for three geckos you will need a 15 gallon (56.8 L) tank, for four geckos you will need a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank, and so on.
Never house more than one male in the same tank as they may fight. As well, if you decide to keep female and male geckos together, be prepared for them to breed and produce baby geckos. You may need to move your expanding population of geckos to a larger tank to make sure there is enough room for the adult and baby geckos.;
, Heat is a very important part in a reptile’s life; if a reptile does not have enough heat they may become inactive and could fall ill. If a reptile has too much heat they may overheat and become sick or die. Your house gecko’s tank should have a heat gradient, with a heat lamp at one end of the tank. This will allow your gecko to get heat during the day and less heat at night, when you shut off the heat lamp.The tank’s overall temperature should be around 85ºF-90ºF (29ºC–32ºC) at the warm end and about 78ºF-80ºF(25ºC–27ºC) at the cool end. Night temperatures should stay around 78ºF-80ºF(25ºC–27ºC). Make sure you provide a cool and a warm end in their enclosure to assist with thermal regulation.
Appropriate temperatures can be achieved by using a small low wattage heat lamp on one end of the of the tank. You may also use a side or under tank heater for your tank. Keep the heat lamp on for 12 hours a day and then turn it off at night. You can also use a blue heat lamp may to control nighttime temperatures.
Do not use a heat rock as they are outdated and can cause severe burns and even death. You do not need to use UV lighting for house geckos as they are nocturnal.

, Substrate at the bottom of the tank will help to keep the environment humid and hot, just how your gecko likes it. You can use a simple and low maintenance option for substrate, such as paper towels or newspaper. You can also splurge for a more natural looking option, such as organic potting soil, cypress mulch, bark, or leaf litter.The substrate should be at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep as geckos typically create a small divot or burrow for their eggs.
Do not use sand or pebbles as substrate for the tank, as you gecko can end up trying to eat it and become sick.
Change the paper substrate two to three times a week. If you are using particulate substrate, like mulch or bark, spot clean them once a day and replace all the substrate once a month.

, Live plants and artificial plants provide lots of climbing spots for your gecko. Live plants also help to increase the humidity of the tank, an ideal environment for your gecko to thrive in.Because house geckos are nocturnal, they will need a place to sleep and hide at night. You can buy hiding structures, often made of cork, from your local pet store. Buy two hiding structures and place one on the cool side of the tank and one on the warm side. This will give your gecko the option of cooling down or warming up. Try to have at least two hides per gecko.

, House geckos are tropical species and they respond well to a humid environment, about 70% - 90% humidity. You can ensure the tank stays humid by misting the tank with water once to twice a day. Use a clean misting bottle and fresh chlorine free water. Aim the bottle at the sides of the tank to ensure it is moistened.You can also set up an automatic mister in your tank that releases a spray of water on a daily basis. Look for automatic misters at your local pet store.

, Provide a small, shallow water bowl for your gecko and fill it with fresh, chlorine free water once a day. The water dish should go on the cool side of the tank. Your gecko may drink from it and/or use it as a spot to bath. Most geckos will drink water droplets from daily misting, rather than from their water bowl.Always give your gecko de-chlorinated water, as distilled water can cause medical issues for your gecko due to its lack of nutrients and minerals. Avoid giving your gecko untreated tap water, as it can be unhealthy for your gecko.

, A baby gecko, or young gecko, will need to be fed five to six times a week. Your gecko should have a diet that is high in protein, consisting of crickets, mealworms, waxworms, silkworms, and roaches. The insects should be no longer than the width of your gecko’s head to ensure he can stomach them. If any uneaten insects survive, somehow, and are roaming around in the tank, remove them, as they can end up chewing on your gecko’s skin and eyes.You should gut load the insects, feeding them a nutritious diet about 24 hours before offering them to your gecko. Then, give the gut loaded insects to your gecko. Do not give your gecko wild caught insects, as they can carry diseases.

, You should dust your gecko’s food with a calcium supplement before giving it to him. A growing gecko should be dusted more often than an adult gecko. You can ask your veterinarian for exact instructions on how much supplement you should dust on your gecko’s food to avoid over-supplementing the food.Opt for a calcium supplement fortified with vitamin D3 and dust it on two to three time a week. Do not use a calcium supplement with added phosphorous, unless specified by your vet.

, Most growing house geckos do not enjoy being picked up and held. Handling your gecko may also prevent him from getting used to his new environment. House geckos are fragile and if you pull on their tail, they may lose their tail or become injured.You may want to wait until your gecko is an adult to handle him outside of his cage. Even then, you should be careful when handling him and try not to let him out of your hands as house geckos can move very fast and tend to hide in hard to reach places once they are out of their tanks.

, Lifting your gecko from his underbelly will spook him and cause him to jump out of your hands. Make sure you pick him up from the top of his body and get a good grip on him before you lift him out of his tank. You may then cup him in your hands to ensure he does not run away.In general, you should only handle your gecko if you need to remove him to clean the tank. Wash your hands before and after handling your gecko, as you may have bacteria on your hands that can cause illness.

, Your house gecko will shed his skin in patches every four to six weeks. He may turn a dull color and the skin over his eyelids may pop as he sheds his skin. Though the shedding can look uncomfortable, do not try to peel off the skin from him as this can be painful and dangerous for your gecko. If the tank conditions are humid enough, your gecko should be able to shed his skin on his own and he may even eat his own shedded skin.During the shedding process, your gecko will grow a new layer of skin and it will separate from the old layer, creating a fluid between the two layers. If your gecko’s enclosure is too dry, the fluid will not form properly and make it more difficult for your gecko to shed his old skin. If your gecko’s old skin does not seem to be coming off on its own, you may need to adjust the humidity of your tank by misting the tank twice a day. You may also provide a moist box in his tank, such as a plastic container filled with moist reptile terrarium moss. Cut a door into the side of the container and place the lid on the container. This will allow your gecko to go into the box at his will.
If your gecko has trouble getting old skin off his toes, tail, or head, you can assist him by spraying the area with water and gently massaging the skin until it peels off on its own.

Take it to the vet if at all possible.,
Make sure the gecko's habitat is properly set up.,
Check the tail.,
Be patient.",How to Care for a Wounded Leopard Gecko1," First off, if something is seriously wrong it would be best to see an ""exotic vet"". Keep in mind that some vets that care for animals like cats or dogs may be unaware that several meds used for mammals are toxic to reptiles!;
, For an injured gecko it is often best to place it in a habitat like one a leopard gecko breeder would use: a tank or appropriately sized tub with paper towel as a substrate.


Try to avoid the use of sand even for a healthy gecko, regardless of what a pet store says! Their natural habitat is more dirt-like with firmness to it.
Add sanitary hides for the gecko to feel secure in; a stressed gecko won't heal as well as a content and calm one!

, Often when a gecko will falls it lands on its tai;, this can break its tail, but usually isn't too serious. The tail may drop off, but if the above requirements are met, all ""should"" be well and the tail should regrow!


Add a humidity hide for the gecko; it can help scabs from scarring and allow shed to become unstuck.

, Make sure the wounded leopard gecko gets plenty of vitamin-dusted and gut-loaded food, as well as clean daily changed water. Hopefully it will heal right up again, as sometimes the gecko is just shocked from the event so let it rest in peace!


Avoid handling as much as possible; even a gentle hand may still cause pain or increase of injury to a tender hurt gecko.

A secure lid is important, especially if you have a cat. You may find these sold as aquariums, vivariums, or terrariums. If you already have a home for your gecko, skim through this section to make sure it meets your pet's requirements. The tank should be wider than it is tall, as leopard geckos are terrestrial. There's no size limit for adults, but in larger tanks there must be plenty of hides so they don't get stressed.


You can also buy a tank with a sliding door at the front instead of a screen lid. This tank would make it easier to tame your gecko.
A 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank will hold one to two leopard geckos. It is best to house geckos separately in 10 gallon (37.9 L) tanks as these reptiles get extremely stressed and fight if housed together. Only females who are similar in size can live together, and even then they may fight. Keep an extra tank in case they fight. Even a breeding pair should be separated after mating.;
, Cover the bottom of the container with a layer of textured tile or dry Eco earth. Reptile carpet is an option as well, but your gecko's claws and teeth may get caught in it, and crickets can get under the substrate. You may use paper towels or newspaper instead, but be prepared to replace them regularly as they get dirty or break apart. Crickets can get under this as well. Never use sand, especially not calcium sand.If using stone or another heavy substrate, consider putting a couple layers of paper towel or a handful of dry Eco Earth between the floor and the stone to reduce the chance of breakage and chipping. Sand is another option, but make sure it is not in reach of the gecko.
Never use cedar wood chips or other resinous wood, since these may be toxic to leopard geckos. They also have been known to pierce the gecko's gullet.

, Use a heating pad/mat specifically for reptile tanks, or ""under tank heater,"" to heat the tank to about 90F. Use thermometers on each side of the cage to keep track of the temperature. The most accurate thermometers are temperature Gina and digital thermometers with probes. A thermostat is necessary to prevent the UTH from overheating and to regulate the temperature. During the night, the temperature should drop no lower than 80F (21ºC). If extra heat is needed during the winter, a CHE (ceramic heat emitter) can provide extra heat., Leopard geckos are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk, but they are still adapted to live in areas with 14 hours of sunlight a day, or 12 hours during the winter. The easiest way to provide this is through indirect sunlight from a window. A light is only necessary if a window is unavailable. A common misconception is that Leos cannot see red light. Although they can't see the colour, they can still see the light so it's best to no use one. UV lighting, while not completely necessary, is beneficial and can take the place of a d3 supplement. Leos cannot overdose on d3 they get rom this light.

, Purchase rock caves, logs, or any other reptile shelter from a pet store, large enough for the lizard to hide beneath. Alternatively, make these shelters yourself from smooth-sanded PVC piping or other materials, but avoid objects that have been outside, and objects with sharp edges. Place the shelters in three different places, to meet the leopard gecko's needs:Place two shelter on the warm side of the tank, and keep one lined with moist paper towels, Eco earth, or sphagnum moss underneath it. This is called the ""humid hide,"" and the floor will need to be moistened regularly to allow the gecko to shed easily. (Keeping this on the cold side is not recommended due to the risk of respiratory infection.))
Place a third shelter on the cooler side of the tank, and keep it dry.

, Find your leopard gecko at a certified breeder if possible, or at a pet store with healthy, well-cared for animals. Select an animal with bright, clean eyes and a fat tail. Missing toes and crusty material around the mouth are signs of illness or retained shed. Do not purchase an unhealthy leopard gecko if you are not prepared to rehabilitate it.


If you own a gecko that looks sick, do not allow it to breed. It may produce unhealthy offspring.

, A wide, shallow water bowl is best, to allow the gecko to drink and bathe without a significant risk of drowning. Keep this on the cooler side of the tank. Refill it every day and clean it whenever necessary, typically every other day. Use bottled water, tap water left out for 24 hours, or water treated with reptisafe purchased from a petstore.

, Live crickets and mealworms are the most common food source for leopard gecko pets, but you may use live dubia roaches instead, purchased from pet stores. Other options are superworms (not the healthiest), hornworms and silkworms (very healthy but not to be bought in large amounts), and locusts. Never feed your Leo fruit, pinkies, or wild insects.Butter worms and wax worms are options, but due to their high fat content, you may want to use them as an occasional supplement for variety, rather than a main meal. Wax worms can be addictive to geckos and overfeeding may lead to your gecko refusing other food. Because leopard geckos will rarely eat dead insects, you'll need a plastic container with holes punched in the lid in order to keep the insects alive. Dead insects also provide no stimulation and are far less nutritious. You can buy insects as needed from pet stores, or maintain a larger container with enough insects to breed.


If using crickets, put egg cartons in the container.
To make safe and appealing food, the insects should be slightly smaller than the space between the gecko's eyes.
If keeping mealworms short-term, store them in the refrigerator. If you are breeding them, keep them at room temperature so some of them morph into beetles.

, Purchase powdered ""calcium without D3"" and vitamin with D3 powder for reptiles, often called ""dusting powder."" Before feeding insects to the gecko, place them in a plastic bag with this powder, and shake the bag until the insects are completely coated with the white powder. Feed these to the geckos immediately, as described below.


Typically, you would use calcium powder every other feeding and multivitamins every three feedings. This can vary based on your gecko's age and diet, so you may want to ask an expert for advice.

, Another excellent way to add nutrients to the gecko's diet is to ""gut load"" the insects. Use a special formula for this purpose, or simply provide your container of insects with fruit, oats, and/or vegetables for 12–24 hours before feeding them to the gecko. Carrot, greens, potato, and apple works well. A very important thing is to never mix vitamin and calcium just to make it easier for your as this can actually kill your gecko.If you decide to try this, do this in addition to using the dusting powder described above, not as a replacement.

, Leopard geckos under six months old need daily feeding, Leos 6-12 months old need to be fed every other day, and Leos over a year old can be fed every 3-4 days.Generally speaking, each gecko should be fed enough food to eat in 10–15 minutes, or roughly 7-10 crickets.Remove all insects from the cage after 15–20 minutes, since they may attack and damage the leopard gecko's skin or eat the gecko's feces.


If your gecko is a slow eater, or appears obese, check the section on health problems for advice.

, Remove feces, dead insects, and other debris from your leopard gecko's tank daily, to reduce the risk of disease and attracting harmful insects. About once a week, wash the entire enclosure with warm water and safe reptile disinfectant, rinsing the disinfectant away before the leopard gecko is returned to its tank. Change the substrate when it begins to have a noticeable odor, usually once a month. Dry Eco earth only needs to be changed every six months.


If you are using tiles or a similar, non-disposable substrate, just remove them from the tank temporarily and clean the floor beneath then when you notice a smell.

, Wash your hands in warm, soapy water before handling a reptile, to avoid spreading disease to you or the animal. Herd the leopard gecko into your hand, or gently pick it up by the body, cradling it in your hand to provide enough support.Never pick up the animal by the tail, since it can detach its tail in reaction to predators.


If the tail does detach, dispose of it, and clean the tank daily to prevent infection at the tail stub until it heals and starts to grow a new tail.
Do not smoke in the same room as your gecko, and especially not while holding it., Leopard geckos shed their skin about once a month, although the exact timing varies with age. The skin will turn grey or white a day or two before the shedding begins. As long as the old skin is successfully removed, usually eaten by the gecko, this is a harmless process and nothing to be concerned about.


If the skin gets caught around the toes, gently rub it off with a damp Q-tip. Your gecko probably won't like this, but if left on, the gecko could lose a toe.
If the old skin clings to other areas of the gecko, it's generally best to leave it on unless it's near the eyes, as this could cause eye problems.

, If you keep the ""humid hide"" shelter moist, as described in the set up section, adult leopard geckos are usually able to regulate their own skin moisture. However, if the gecko develops sunken eyes, constipation, or slow shedding (old, white skin clinging to the new), it may have a serious health problem. You could consider gently misting the gecko's skin once every day or two, but be aware that too much moisture can cause dangerous skin problems and respiratory infection.It may be safer to take the gecko to a veterinarian.


Leopard geckos under a month old may ""scream"" when misted, but this is not a sign of harm., On the other side of the spectrum, if the air is very humid in the area the gecko is kept, consider purchasing a hygrometer to track humidity in the tank. If it rises above 40%, point a fan over the tank or replace the water dish with a smaller one., Leopard geckos store fat in their tails, so they should have a wide, fat appearance. However, if the gecko's tail is wider than the body, and/or if fat deposits have built up around the limbs, reduce the amount of food per feeding., Seek urgent veterinary attention if the lizard is not responding to your touch or to food, or if you notice twitching, weight loss in the tail, bleeding, or other serious health problems. Consult a veterinarian within 24 hours if you notice diarrhea, constipation, crusty material building up, or a dark, discolored toe or tail tip.Behavioral changes in eating preferences or sleeping schedule can occur naturally with age, but talking to a veterinarian or reptile expert about them is still recommended.

Put the gecko in a proper habitat.,
Add a humidity hide.,
Take care of the eyes.,
Help it eat.,
Make sure the gecko has access to calcium dust, as well as any other geckos around!,
Be patient and caring.",How to Care for a Wounded Leopard Gecko2," Often, its is best to start with a breeder style habitat, so you can monitor its feces, eating, drinking, and shedding. Later on, the gecko can be placed in a proper display habitat.

, This is important for a leopard gecko in captivity, because they can't go down into a nice moist burrow. Place some type of leopard ""gecko sized"" tupperware or tub that is nontoxic and capable of holding humidity in the habitat. Simply wet down some paper towel inside the little box and allow an opening that the gecko can go in and out of. This very important step, will remove stuck shed effectively, and prevent the gecko losing its toes due to a very dry habitat!

, If the gecko was on a substrate such as: ground walnut shells, sand, or some sharp, small, substrate, the gecko may have impaction or eye damage! Carefully rinse the eye with slightly warm, clean, and distilled water to prevent chlorine or other unwanted chemicals from entering the eyes.

, If the gecko has bad eyesight or is now blind and won't eat, the innards of a food item may get them hunting. If that's to gross (you can try using a little bit of chicken), rub that juiciness on their snout and around the mouth; the gecko may back up. But when you stop, the gecko should start cleaning its mouth and a feeding reaction hopefully will be triggered! This technique is used to start hatchlings that won't eat after about a week.

, This can be found at a regular pet store, or purchased online; regardless, it is necessary to make sure that reptiles have access to calcium,. Their food is not wild so this is a responsibility that should not be taken lightly. Make sure the food is suited to their nutritional needs. Without calcium, metabolic bone disorder (MBD) will begin setting in; not much can be done at home for a broken gecko bone, but providing plenty of calcium supplementation can prevent the bone from becoming broken, fractured, rubbery, weak, swollen, limp, or downright painful!

, The best thing to do, is provide the animal with the best care possible and have patience while waiting for the gecko to complete its healing process; don't try playing with it during that time.

Look at the gecko's tail.,
The gecko should also have no signs of disease, and have clear eyes, mouth and nose.

,
If you take a look at the face, it should have no ""goop"" around or on the eyes, and no scratch, burn or bite marks should be seen, and the jaw should properly close.

,
The gecko should have all toes.,
The body should be in-line and smooth with no large lumps.,
Take a look at the eyes.,
If there is feces in the cage, look at those.,
Ask the seller to let you see the gecko.",How to Choose a Leopard Gecko," It should be plump and fat, preferably as wide or wider than the space between the gecko's shoulders. The tail should be somewhat rounded and not have a shriveled appearance.;
,,, Some leopard geckos are born with missing toes, but any that are infected are not sanitary and could cost lots of money as a result. The toes should be swell-free and even.

, That could be a disease. There should not be any bones showing like ribs.

, Neither should be ""glued"" shut, bigger or smaller than the other, dirty or sticky. Avoid geckos with bug-eyes or small eyes.

, They should be semi-formed and somewhat pellet shaped. The color should be dark with white urates. Pale, yellow-orange, light-colored, runny or pasty feces results in a sick gecko; signs of possible disease.

, It should have a clear and flush vent without swelling, fecal smearing, or caked material. Also, the gecko should be alert and watchful with bright eyes.

Don’t be alarmed if your gecko loses its tail.",How to Care for a Crested Gecko," Cresties will love having some space. If you’re starting out with a baby gecko, look for a 10 gallon glass terrarium or aquarium at a pet store. If you have an adult gecko (or once your baby grows up), get a 20 gallon one.Crested geckos like a little humidity. If it’s normally very humid where you live, you can also try housing your crested gecko in a cage with screen sides.;
, Pet stores will stock soil meant to be used in reptile houses. A mixture of peat moss or coco fiber and soil will also work just fine. Whichever substrate you use, place enough in your terrarium to cover the bottom well., Your gecko will appreciate having some plants to climb on and hide under. Plants will also help regulate the humidity in the terrarium, making it more comfortable for the gecko.Live plants are best, but fake plants will give your gecko something to play on, at least.
Your local pet store should stock some plants that will work great in your terrarium and will be safe for your gecko.

, Since your crested gecko will spend most of its time inside the terrarium, try to make it an interesting habitat. Place things like pieces of driftwood or bark in the terrarium. Your crestie will love climbing on and crawling under them., Cresties come from warm habitats, so they’ll do best in a terrarium that’s a little toasty. The average temperature in the terrarium should hover a little below 80 °F (27 °C). It’s fine if the temperature dips a below this at night, but the daytime temperature should not go below 65 °F (18 °C).If the temperature in your area is higher that cresties tolerate, make sure to put the terrarium in a cooler room.
If you need to warm to terrarium to keep it comfortable for your crestie, look for a warming bulb or ceramic reptile house heater at a pet store.
Place the warming bulb or heater over just one side of the terrarium, so that the gecko can move to a cooler side when it needs to regulate its temperature, like reptiles naturally do.

, Crested geckos will thrive when the humidity is maintained at between 50 and 70 percent. To keep it humid, you can lightly mist the terrarium nightly with a spray bottle of water, or place a cool mist humidifier nearby.If you want to keep track of the exact humidity inside the terrarium, go to your pet store and buy a hygrometer that can be attached to its side.

, Spot clean the terrarium everyday by wiping up any grimy spots with a paper towel. Deep clean the terrarium once a week. Wipe down the sides, clean your gecko’s water dish thoroughly, and remove an debris from the plants or lay items.A cloth and water should take care of most messes inside the terrarium. If you have to use any soap, make sure to rinse it off thoroughly.

, Pet stores will carry a powder mix that contains all of the nutrients that crested geckos need. Mix this with two parts water and put it in a dish inside the terrarium. Provide your gecko as much as it wants to eat three times a week., While the powdered food will keep your crestie nourished, it will love a few treats as well. You can give it bits of fruit (apricots or peaches are good choices). Dusted gut loaded crickets are another snack your crestie will love, and can be found at a pet store.Give your gecko crickets or fruit three times a week if you want to supplement its regular diet, or once a week if you just want to give it a treat.

, A shallow dish of water should be placed in the bottom of your crested gecko’s terrarium. Keep it constantly full.Don’t be concerned if your crestie also uses this dish as a potty.

, Crested geckos will live just fine all by themselves. However, you can house a single male together with several females, or pair a couple of females together. Just avoiding pairing two males in the same terrarium, since they can become aggressive with each other.Make sure to ask about the sex of your geckos when you purchase them.

, It takes cresties some time to get used to a new environment. After you bring yours home, don’t handle it for the first three to four weeks. This will give it time to become acclimated to the new setting without becoming stressed.After a few weeks, handle your crestie for only five minutes or so at a time, at first. Do this until your gecko is at least three inches long.

, Cresties are surprisingly fragile. Falls can really hurt them. When handling yours, keep it just above a flat surface, like a table. If you need to move your gecko over a distance, keep it in its terrarium., People love the colorful patterns on the skin of geckos, including their tails. However, the tails are fragile. If you handle a crestie roughly, its tail may fall off, or this may happen all by itself. This won’t harm your gecko, but the tail will not grow back."

You need to think about where your gecko will live.,
Substrate is what you put at the bottom of the tank.,
Leopard geckos need heat to digest their food.,
You'll want to keep accurate thermometers (the most accurate being digital ones with a probe or temperature guns) in the tank so you can keep a close eye on the temperatures.,
As for furnishings, there should be two hiding places on the hot side of the tank and one on the cooler side.,
You gecko will need a water dish and a food dish if feeding meal worms.",How to Build a Habitat for Leopard Geckos," The tank can either have a screen top or a sliding door at the front (better for taming). You can use an aquarium, vivarium, or terrarium. The tank should be wider than it is tall. A 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank is enough for one adult gecko, but if you're getting more than one, a 20 or even 30 gallon (113.6 L) tank is best. Adults have no size limit, but should be provided with plenty of hides in larger tanks. Only females who're similar in size can be housed together, and they still have potential to fight. Keep an extra tank in case they fight.;
,


The best options are textured tile or dry Eco earth. Tile conducts heat very well and is easily cleanable, and Eco earth promotes digging and lasts for six months.
If you want your tank to look nice, an indoor or outdoor reptile carpet would be suitable. Yet, if any pieces of the carpet are sticking up, there is a chance a gecko's claw or tooth can get stuck. Insects can also get underneath it.
It is a bad idea to use sand, especially for baby leopard geckos. If they eat it either by accident or not, it can cause serious health problems like impaction.
You can use paper towel, but insects can get underneath it. You could use excavator clay instead, but there is a small impaction risk and a heat mat can't be used.

,


The best choice would be an under tank heater. This way, when the gecko is done eating they can lay on the heater and get the belly warmth. On an under tank heater, there is a sticky side. You stick that side under the tank, and plug it in to an outlet. If you use a vivarium, the UTH goes inside the tank. After a couple hours it will reach full heat. If you choose a heater, make sure it is only the size of a third of the tank, so the gecko can pick the hot or cool side to be on.alf
Another heat option is an overhead light, but this should only be used as well as a heat mat, when the heat mat is not enough heat. This will provide light and heat, although geckos are crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk) so they might be bothered with the bright light.

, The side with the pad should be around 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, and the opposite side should be around 80 degrees. The warm side can drop to 80 degrees at night.

,:


The humid hide should be one of the hides on the warm side. This is where geckos go to have a humid climate, so they can easily shed their skin. Inside of this hide you will either need wet paper towels, damp peat moss, or Eco earth. Spray this hide with a water bottle each day and for the hot hid make sure it's on top of the heat mat.
The cold side should be a dry hide. Things to use for this hide is any hiding places big enough for your gecko you find at the pet store-like hollow logs. Make sure these hides actually hide your gecko and don't go up against the glass.

, The water dish should be in the middle of the tank, or next to one of the hides. It needs to be shallow enough so your gecko can drink without having to go inside of it, but big enough to hold enough water for a day and let your gecko bathe in it. Make sure to replace with fresh, clean water when low or dirty. Use bottled water, tap water left out for 24 hours, or water treated with reptisafe (found in pet stores).

Get a male and female leopard gecko.,
Get a large cage for the male and female to live in together.,
Get the incubator ready for the eggs and provide a lay box.,
Ensure you have customers who will buy your babies when they are ready.

,
Introduce the female to the male.,
Let nature take its course.,
Ready the laying box to put in the cage.,
In about 4 to 5 weeks, the female will lay her eggs.,
Place the eggs in the incubation medium.,
Observe the developing embryos.,
After around 60 days, give or take depending on the incubation temperature, the eggs should hatch.

,
Set up the cages for the babies.,
Have tiny crickets readily available.,
Most importantly and before you breed your leopard geckos, make sure you have homes for all the babies.",How to Breed Leopard Geckos," The males have hemipenal bulges below the vent whereas females do not. Males and females both have a V-shaped row of scales above the vent but only the male's scales here are hollow and produce wax. This wax is for scent marking their territory.


It is best to check yourself to ensure you have a male and female, rather than trust people at a large pet store. Smaller specialists or Reptile show people typically will know their stuff.
Never house two males together or they will fight to the death.;
, Geckos can be kept together without the need to separate them unless you see major aggression. It is sometimes normal when first introducing a male and female for there to be a little squabbling but this usually stops within the first week.


For a pair you will need at least a 20 gallon (75.7 L) long tank.
You may also choose to house one male with 4-5 females, add 10 gallons (37.9 L) of space for each additional gecko.

, You can use a plastic sandwich container with a lid for this purpose. Cut an entry hole on one side and fill it with damp moss (This can be used as the moist hide too).

,, You can introduce them into the same cage right away, usually.(If you have a female that isn't healthy, do NOT try to breed her. She could die.)


Females should be at least one year old and have a healthy weight. Provide a shallow dish full of calcium plus vitamin D3 powder that the female can lick up as needed. Females use their calcium reserves to make eggs and if those reserves should deplete she will end up dying from metabolic bone disease.
You must also take care to feed her generously with calcium dusted insects and make sure she always has access to water. Producing eggs takes a lot out of a female.

, Breeding should occur within a week.


If you see major drama/fighting, separate the pair. You'll want to confirm they are not both males. If one male and one female, you can reintroduce them again later.

, Females dig to lay their eggs, so you will provide a place for them to dig.

, Normally, you will see her digging in the laying box and laying the eggs in pairs. It will be easy to tell she has laid the eggs, particularly since she will be much thinner.

, Remove them from the laying box and be careful not to rotate or jiggle the eggs. After 24 hours of being laid, the embryo inside attaches itself to the side wall of the egg. Rotating or jiggling this egg could cause the embryo to come loose and drown inside, killing it.


Take a deli cup filled two inches high with incubation medium and make a dent in the medium with a finger right where you are going to put an egg.
Carefully place the egg in this indentation and mark the top with a sharpie or pencil with a dot so you know what is right side up. In the event the egg gets moved, you will be able to place it right side up and hope for the best that it didn't drown.
If you want girls, set the incubation temperature 80 to 85 degrees, if you want males, set the temperature 90 to 95 degrees, and if you want a mix, set the temperature in the middle!

, After a few weeks you will be able to ""candle"" the eggs using a small flashlight. You don't have to touch the eggs, just take them into a dark room and shine the light as close to the shell as you can. You should see pink inside with red blood vessels. The further along the eggs are, the more you will also see the baby inside as a dark mass.,, Before they hatch, set up each individual with it's own small cage. You can also use a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank with plastic dividers so each baby is housed by itself. Each cage should have a small water bowl as well.

, Babies will start eating insects within a day or two of being hatched.

, A single female can lay 12 to 20 pairs of eggs a year, that's 24 to 40 babies!

Check to see if your gecko is dirty.,
Wash your hands.,
Fill a small container with warm water.,
Scrub the gecko.,
Dry your gecko.",How to Bathe a Leopard Gecko1," Leopard geckos rarely need to be bathed. In fact, over-bathing your gecko can dry out its skin and cause disease. You should only bathe your gecko if it is having difficulties shedding or a veterinarian instructs you to wash it.


You can also wash your gecko if it is noticeably dirty. However, you should avoid doing to more than once a month.
This method for washing your leopard gecko can be used to clean other large lizards.;
, Before you take your gecko out of it vivarium, you need to wash your hands with hot water and soap. This will help prevent you from transferring microorganisms to your gecko that could potentially make it ill or kill it. Be sure to thoroughly rinse the soap off of your hands as well. Soap can make your gecko very ill.You should also wash your hands after handling the gecko to prevent spreading any diseases from it to others.

, Once you have determined that your gecko needs a bath, fill a small container with warm water up to the bottom of its belly, generally less than a half-inch (13mm). Because geckos are cold-blooded and unable to regulate their body temperature, make sure that the water is between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (27 to 32 degrees Celsius).Avoid using any soaps. This may make your gecko extremely ill. Just use warm water unless instructed otherwise.
If your leopard gecko is having difficulty shedding, let it soak for a few minutes and gently pour water over its back. This will help moisten and soften the dead skin. Be sure to avoid getting water in the gecko’s eyes, which can easily dry out.
Your veterinarian might also suggest adding a drop of mineral oil to the water. This will help soften the shedding skin and make it come off easier.If your leopard gecko has a fungal infection on its skin, your veterinarian make recommend that you add a little Betadine solution to the water.

, After the gecko is comfortably in the warm water, dampen a washcloth, paper towel or a Q-tip and gently massage its skin. This will clean your gecko and remove any dead skin. Do not pull on any shedding skin. This could hurt your gecko, leading to skin damage and possibly an infection.Do not scrub too hard and rip the skin off your gecko. In places, the shedding skin will still be attached to the new skin underneath it. There will likely still be pieces of dead skin attached to your gecko when you finish.
You can also rub your gecko with your fingertips. However, be sure to resist the temptation to pluck any flakes of dead skin.
If you brush gently, a toothbrush may also help remove dead skin.

, After you have properly bathed your leopard gecko, you should dry it with a cloth or paper towel. Gently wrap the gecko in the cloth, keeping its head exposed. Softly rub the animal’s body in slow circular motions with your cloth, and then gently wipe the top of its head and its vent area.Throw away any paper towels immediately, and be sure to wash and disinfect any washcloths you use.
Be sure to dry your gecko quickly to keep it from getting too cold.

Make a gecko sauna.,
Be patient.",How to Bathe a Leopard Gecko2," Over time, you may notice that your leopard gecko does not shed completely and that excess skin can collect in certain places. This can be problematic around your gecko’s tail and toes, where blood flow can become constricted. If the problem goes untreated, your gecko might lose its toes or its tail due to a lack of oxygen. Fortunately, its tail will grow back. However, the toes will be gone forever. If you notice a buildup, you may want to moisten your gecko’s skin to help the excess fall off.In nature, geckos regularly lose their toes because of constricted blood flow due to skin buildup. Although this is disconcerting, your gecko should be fine. If it does lose a toe, keep an eye on the wound to make sure that it does not become infected., In order to help your leopard gecko properly shed, provide it with a moist house or box. This is a special enclosure that you add to the gecko’s vivarium and keep moist. You can buy these boxes at your local pet store. You can also make one yourself using by cutting a hole in the side of an old plastic container and placing moist paper towels in the bottom. While your gecko is shedding you will need to moisten this box every day.If you keep your gecko properly moistened, you should avoid any difficulties when it comes to shedding.

, Moisten your fingertips or a Q-tip with a little lukewarm water and gently massage any areas where the skin has built up. Again, be gentle and do not rub so hard that the skin tears off. It should wad up and roll off in a clump., Add warm paper towels to your gecko’s moist box or another container. The temperature should not be more that 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius). Then place the gecko in the box and let it sit there for about thirty minutes. Once the time is up, take the gecko out and gently massage the areas of built up skin.If you use a container that is not your moist box, make sure that you add holes so that your gecko can breathe.

, If you are unable to get the excess skin to come off, do not force it. Scrubbing too hard or washing too often can hurt your gecko. If you give the gecko a moist place to hang out, the skin should come off. If it does not, try again after a few days or go see a veterinarian."

Place a bathing dish in the gecko’s habitat.,
Replace the sand.,
Remove any waste.,
Clean the vivarium.",How to Bathe a Leopard Gecko3," Leopard geckos get most of their moisture from the crickets that they eat. However, they do benefit from a small bathing dish in their bowl. Simply take a small plastic bowl and fill it with water about a half-inch (13mm) deep. This will help with the habitats humidity and give the gecko a place to cool off it gets too hot.Maintaining the right humidity is essential to keeping your gecko’s skin healthy.
Be sure to replace the water every day.

, After about six months, the sand in your gecko’s vivarium with become soiled and need replaced. Removing the dirty sand and replacing it with fresh sand will help prevent your gecko from developing any skin issues. It will also help keep your gecko clean and require fewer cosmetic cleanings.You may use other materials, like newspaper or artificial turf. However, newspaper needs regular replacement, while artificial turf is difficult to clean.

, Once a gecko moves into a new enclosure, it will designate one area in the habitat as its bathroom. Although this makes cleaning up after your gecko easy, you should be diligent about cleaning its waste. Determine where your gecko’s bathroom is and clean it daily.Use a small fishing net to scoop the waste out of the habitat.

, Occasionally, you will need to fully clean out the entire vivarium. This includes scrubbing and cleaning the glass, as well as washing any bowls or containers. The best time to do this is when you replace the sand in your animal’s vivarium. However, if you feel like your vivarium is not dirty enough to be cleaned every six months, you can wait and do it once a year.Regular washings of your animal’s habitat will ensure that it stays clean and healthy.

",How to Spoil Your Gerbils," Pet stores will often sell things that are labeled as ""Premium Gerbil Food,"" but look at the ingredients. You don't want berries or too many sunflower seeds in it (Some are good, but too many will make them overweight).;
, Do not buy your gerbils wheels that have normal serrated edges. Their tails can get caught in them and be amputated! Try buying them a Silent Spinner wheel, several paper towel rolls (you can buy these at pet stores) or Pop-Up houses, one or two wooden houses or the new all-natural Hay and Honey house (These are at pet stores. Do not give them plastic as they can chew it up and ingest it - causing their intestines to get plugged up!), lots of Timothy hay, and several wooden blocks (for them to chew on).

, The more room you have, the more stuff you can put in it and the more comfortable your gerbils will be. Be careful though, if it's too big, gerbils will start acting territorial and fight.

, In addition, you are going to want to buy some kind of treat stand for your gerbils. Try a little marble block about one square inch in size to put their fresh fruit, veggies, and nuts on.

, Your gerbils will love to take baths in it and it will make their fur into something to be proud of.

, Put some CareFresh bedding in there along with your exercise equipment, water bottle, bathhouse, huts, food dish, etc. Put a large amount of timothy hay in the corner. This will act as a ""safe spot"" for when your gerbils come home. NOTE: Make sure you do this before you go out and buy your gerbils.

,, Look at other gerbil guides to find out which can and cannot be used or research on the internet. Make sure that their treats do not exceed 10% of their diet and that you take them out after six hours (they can stay in for more than twenty but your gerbils don't deserve old treats). Make little designs with the treats you give them. Try making some of your own recipes, naming them, and presenting them in a way that is good enough for only your babies.

Repeat for at least a fortnight until you see positive signs.,
Remove the divider.,
Leave them in the same cage and add nothing new.,
Keep an eye on them.",How to Split Cage a Gerbil," Is your gerbil over two years old and male? if so, you should think about trying to introduce two just-weaned pups instead so you are not left with a lonely gerbil in a few years time (this is the only exception to the not introducing one to a pair or group). What is your gerbil's temperament like? Some gerbils will not accept a cage mate if they've been alone too long, or do not like other gerbils.;
, If it does not work, what will you do with your two lonely gerbils? Make sure you have spare cages or good homes lined up.

, You may find your gerbil breeder will guide you through the split cage or even do it for you. They should also be prepared to take the second gerbil back if the split cage does not work.

, With girls, they should also be the same size. Male gerbils are easier to introduce than girls and less likely to declan in later life.

, Details of this are in the sources. Ideally start with a double layer of mesh, and remove the first layer after a week if signs look good. This is because gerbils can bite each other through a single layer.

, Make sure you have no toys, wheel, or bowls. A water bottle can be taped to the side and food can be thrown loosely into each side (known as scatter-feeding).

, Do not let them interact whilst doing so.

, Positive signs include sleeping flank to flank against the mesh divider, grooming each other through the mesh and sleeping in the bed used by the other gerbil. If your gerbil continues to bite at the mesh to get at the other gerbil then they are not ready. Research more on when to know to remove the divider through sources and other articles.

, Monitor very closely and intervene if you see any warning signs such as that listed under warnings in this article. Set aside a full day to watch them.

, If signs are good you can now leave them in the tank together, but do not add anything else to their cage. If they continue to get on you can gradually add more neutral items - if these have been used by a gerbil already then make sure you have thoroughly cleaned them. Add one new item every few days and don't clean them out for a few weeks.

, Gerbils can declan later on, even if they are initially stable - but if they've accepted each other they will be much happier with company!

When first buying your gerbil you should consider getting more than one. This will keep your gerbil much happier. However, if you already have a gerbil(s) and introduce a new one, it is likely that they will fight.


Consult a vet before getting another gerbil to see if it is a good idea for the health and well-being of your pet. If you decide to get another gerbil, you may need to use a split cage to introduce the new gerbil to the old one before putting them into the same cage.
Do not get a male and female gerbil or they will breed. While the baby gerbils may be cute at first, gerbils breed quickly and it is easy for a pet gerbil population to get out of control. Most people would find it difficult to provide adequate housing, food, and care for dozens of gerbils.;
, Line the cage or tank with plenty of bedding such as timothy hay or aspen shavings. Place the cage or tank out of direct sunlight and away from drafts. You don’t want your gerbils to get too hot or too cold.


Do not use pine or cedar shavings because the fume may be harmful to your gerbils.
Make sure that you provide enough bedding for your gerbil to dig and burrow, since gerbils are natural diggers., For example, your gerbil will enjoy an exercise wheel. Gerbils need lots of exercise to be happy, and an exercise wheel is a great way to provide them with that. Make sure that the wheel does not have any openings that may cause your gerbil’s tail to get caught.


Give your gerbil a nice enclosed place to sleep. Gerbils like to hide and sleep in tight, dark spaces, so place a small flower pot or a box in your gerbil’s cage.
Add pvc tubes to your gerbil’s cage for tunneling and playing.
Place a rock in your gerbil’s cage for perching and inspecting. , Just make sure that the toys are not made from soft plastic because your gerbil will chew these items to shreds. Look for toys that your gerbil will not be able to shred, such as hard plastic toys and strong wooden toys.Anything made of cardboard will also get chewed to shreds, but it won't hurt your gerbil.

, Look for a specially formulated gerbil food mix at your local pet store. Follow the package instructions for how much to give your gerbil each day and serve the food in a small ceramic dish placed inside of his cage.


One way that you can begin to bond with your gerbil is to pick out some of the larger seeds from the mix, such as the sunflower seeds, and feed them to your gerbil by hand., Gerbils need to have access to clean fresh water at all times. Use a hanging water bottle to provide your gerbils with plenty of water. Make sure that the water bottle’s tip does not touch or come too close to the bedding or the water may drain out.


Check the water bottle’s tip daily to make sure that it is working properly., Cheerios, rice crispies, apples, carrots, and lettuce are all good choices to treat your gerbil. Make sure that whatever you give your gerbil does not contain any sugar, flavors, or other additives. Do not give your gerbil junk food.


Give your gerbil a large chunk rather than small ones or they may get lost in the bedding. Remove the treat after your gerbil has finished with it., Like all rodents, a gerbil’s teeth never stop growing. Gerbils need to chew to keep their teeth from growing out of control, so make sure that you provide your gerbil with a sterilized bone or a pesticide and chemical-free stick to chew on., To help keep your gerbil happy, you will need to keep his cage nice and clean. Once per week you should also perform a deep cleaning on your gerbil’s cage. Remove everything from your gerbil’s cage (including your gerbil) and scrub the sides and bottom with warm, soapy water. Then rinse and dry the cage before putting in new bedding, your gerbil’s accessories, and your gerbil. In addition to a weekly deep clean, you should also do the following every day:


Remove and replace any soiled or damp bedding.
Remove and dispose of droppings.
Remove old food., It will take some time and patience before your gerbil is ready to let you hold him. Build up his trust in you by allowing him to sniff your hand and even give you a little nibble. You can also offer your gerbil some treats from your hand to build up his trust in you. Once your gerbil is more comfortable with you, you can try to pick him up.


To pick up your gerbil, gently cup both hands around him and lift him slowly out of his cage. Do not swoop in and grab him or you will startle him and cause him to hide from you., Gerbils also need time outside of their cages to be happy. Once you have established trust with your gerbil, take him out of his cage once per day for a little supervised play time outside of his cage. Make sure to keep him in a room where you can monitor his movement. Otherwise he might burrow somewhere and make it difficult for you to find him., A healthy gerbil will be much happier than an unhealthy gerbil. If a gerbil is well cared for, it may live to be 3 or even 4 years old. Take your gerbil for regular check-ups with the veterinarian to make sure that he stays healthy and happy.


An unhealthy gerbil may have a variety of symptoms, such as sneezing, difficulty breathing, diarrhea and lethargy. If your gerbil is sick, take him to see a veterinarian right away."
"
Be patient.,
Place their cage in a central area of your home or room.,
Sit near your gerbils' cage and talk or sing to them.,
Wash your hands.,
Offer your gerbils a treat from your hand.,
Place your hand out and let them jump into it.,
Use both hands to “scoop” up your gerbil if you have to pick them up.",How to Play With Gerbils1," Gerbils, like people, build relationships based on trust. Since they are prey animals in the wild, they are especially cautious of bigger animals (like you)!Until your gerbils get used to their new home and you, avoid trying to touch them or pick them up.


The amount of time it takes gerbils to get used to a new environment and owner varies from a few hours to a few days.
Your gerbils will “tell” you when they are ready for more interaction. If they hide or run away from you, they aren’t ready to be touched or held.;
, To become socialized, gerbils needs to be around people more than they are not.Do not let gerbils out of their cage to roam freely until you are able to hold them!, If your gerbils won’t come near your hand, spend some time each day sitting near their cage and talking to them so they can observe your movements and get used to your voice.


You don’t have to speak directly to them, but talk or sing out loud (but not loudly) so they become comfortable with your voice.

, Gerbils have a very strong sense of smell and use this sense to familiarize themselves with people. Washing your hands well before interacting with them ensures that they are smelling you and not whatever you touched earlier in the day.


This is especially important if you have other pets, like dogs and cats. These animals would be predators in the wild.
Use a non-perfumed soap so you don’t mask you own scent.

, Taming your gerbils requires a series of steps. Getting them to eat out of your hand is the best way to encourage them to come close to you and to become accustomed to your smell. Lay your palm on the ground with a treat in the middle of it and keep your hand still.If they will not eat from your hand right away, that’s ok. Put the food on the floor near them and back away. Eventually they will associate your hand with treats.
The best treats are things that don’t typically come in gerbil food, like almonds, pecans, or walnuts.
Gerbils, like people, are individuals with different levels of social acclimation. Some may come to you quickly, while some are more skittish. Don’t take it personally.
Sometimes gerbils will backslide, and you may have to start from an earlier stage to rebuild trust. Don’t get frustrated and try again.
Offer a second treat if they are not tempted by one. Put one on the ground and one in your hand to encourage them to go to either one.

, This is the best way to hold your gerbil, and will be much less threatening to them than trying to pick them up.It might take a few times before s/he is comfortable getting in your hand. Be patient and kind.
When they first jump into your palm, raise your arm slowly to your chest so that they don’t feel scared.
If they won’t let you touch them, try holding your hand in a fist near them and letting them get used to your smell first., It is better to let them come to you, but if you need to pick them up, cup your hands and place one on either side of them. Move them slowly together so that they have to step up into your hands. This method lets them know what is going on and allows them to decide to let you pick them up."

Add some toys.,
Pet your gerbil gently on the head or back.,
Make your gerbil a present!,
Teach them to flip backwards.,
Train them to jump up for treats.,
Teach them to run through a maze.",How to Play With Gerbils2," Gerbils need regular attention to stay socialized. If you stop playing with them, they won’t want to play with you anymore. Make sure you are spending sufficient time with them every day, both caring for them and providing recreation.Don’t ever let them out of their cage unsupervised. Gerbils are very good at hiding!

, Gerbils need playtime outside their cage every day. Whenever you open the cage, make sure you are in an enclosed area with few hiding spaces so that your gerbil can’t run away. Check that all windows and doors are closed before opening the cage and make sure no electrical cords are within reach.It’s best not to let your gerbils out of their cage until you are able to hold them.
If they do manage to find a hiding place, it’s best to wait for them to come out on their own rather than forcibly grab them.
A great place to let them play is in an empty kiddie pool.

, After the initial introductory period, let your gerbil enter your environment on their own terms. If you can’t touch them by the second day, try letting them out in an empty bathtub.Place their cage in the tub, sit on the opposite side, and open the cage door.


Don’t pull them out of their cage forcibly! Just open the door and sit near it.Make sure the tub is clean, with no soap or detergent residue., You can buy safe toys or make your own. Cardboard tissue boxes, egg cartons and empty toilet paper rolls are great “toys” you can easily find around your home. They also might like wooden blocks with holes drilled for walking through and wheels to run on.Buy a wheel that is solid, not one with spokes or holes in it. Their tails or feet could get caught in any holes and cause injury.
Don't give them scented paper towels or towels with text or writing.
Gerbils need to chew, so look for untreated and unpainted wooden toys rather than plastic ones or painted ones.
Use empty paper towel or toilet paper rolls to make a fun tunnel for your gerbils to run through.
Make a tunnel out of PVC pipe.

, Gerbils tend to be fidgety, but to develop a close bond they need to get used to your touch.Wait until they approach you and gently stroke their head or back.


Be careful not to use too much force! Gerbils are little and may scare easily until they get used to you.

, Wrap a treat in a few tissues and paper to make your gerbil a special toy. Make sure to use clean, white tissues with no lotions or added scents!Put treats in the middle, fold tissues in half, and roll up like a burrito.
Tie the end of the tissue pack into a loose knot and put inside a toilet paper tube.
Stuff a tissue into each side of the roll, so that the treat is in the middle.
Place the roll on a sheet of white paper and roll like a burrito.
Twist the ends like a candy wrapper and present to your gerbil.

, Hold a treat in your fingers just out of their reach. When they move towards it, bring the treat up and over their head, towards their back. Eager gerbils will flip over to get to it.If your gerbil is really smart, they may just turn around on the ground to get the treat. Try holding it closer to their head next time.

, Gerbils can jump 18 inches across and 6 inches high, and can even change direction in mid-air.Hold a treat in your fingers up high to encourage jumping. Hold a treat several inches away and a couple inches high to encourage a long jump.

, Create maze with blocks or other light objects and put a treat or two at the end. Carefully place the gerbil at the beginning and watch them try to find the treat.


Start with a straight line maze and increase difficulty as your gerbil gets used to it.

Refrain from picking up your gerbil from above.,
Avoid placing your gerbil on his back.,
Do not punish your gerbil.",How to Pick up a Gerbil," You may be tempted to start holding your gerbil as soon as you bring him home, but he will need time to learn his new environment first. Let him explore his cage and get used to where things are. Give him at least a few hours of exploration time.Gerbils can be very timid, so your gerbil may need longer than a few hours to adjust to his new home.Giving your gerbil up to one to two days to adjust is also recommended,but your gerbil may not need that long.;
, Even during your gerbil’s adjustment time, you do not need to leave him completely alone—you just shouldn’t try to pick him up. Interact with him by placing your hand in his cage and letting him learn your scent.Make sure to wash your hands first, though—he should become familiar with your personal scent, not the scent of whatever you just ate!, Place one clean hand into your gerbil’s cage for two to five minutes at a time. You can have your palm facing up or down. Do your best not to flinch or jerk your hand away if your gerbil starts to nibble. The nibbling is his way of exploring. If you do not want him to nibble, blow a gentle puff of air near him and say ‘no.’Keep your hand and arm as still as possible as your gerbil explores them; it may help to take all other accessories out of your gerbil’s cage so that your hand and arm are his only sources of exploration.Talk to him quietly as he is exploring you.If he will let you, stroke him gently with your other hand., Offering treats is a great way to gain your gerbil’s trust. When he crawls onto your hand, give him a few treats (e.g., sunflower seeds, Cheerios, small pieces of bread). Remember that sunflower seeds can cause obesity in gerbils, so do not be too generous when treating him in this way.You could also turn your whole hand into a food bowl by holding some of his normal food in your hand. Not only will your gerbil gladly come to your hand and start eating, but he will also learn to associate your hand with something positive, making it easier to handle him., If your gerbil is particularly timid or skittish, it may take him a while to be comfortable with you. That’s okay! By interacting with him on a daily basis, he will learn that he can trust you.Gerbils are up for playing at any time of day.Play sessions should last at least 15 minutes, and can be longer if your gerbil does not have a cagemate., Before you pick up your gerbil, make sure the room is free of hazards and does not have any nooks or crannies where your gerbil could run and hide. Remove or hide electrical cords and wires and close all windows and doors. In addition, block access to any radiators or vents into which your gerbil could fall.In case your gerbil leaps out of your hands, you want to be sure he will be safe and that you will be able to find him.
You may want to practice picking him up in your bathroom.Place a few towels in the bottom of the tub and plug the stopper. Place your gerbil’s cage in the bathroom and find a comfortable way to position yourself in the tub so you can lift him out of his cage and into the tub.
The bathroom is a small enough space where your gerbil would not be able to escape and hide.

, By now, your gerbil is probably pretty comfortable with you and your hand. Now, it’s time to practice picking him up. Do not be nervous—your gerbil’s excellent sense of smell could allow him to smell the adrenaline in your sweat if you are anxious. When you place your hands in your gerbil’s cage, leave them still for a short while so he knows you are there; this can also let you calm your nerves before picking him up.The calmer you are, the calmer he will be, and the easier it will be to pick him up.

, The preferred way to pick up your gerbil is to scoop him up from underneath with your hands.This will be easier to do if you can gently nudge him into a corner with both of your hands.Cup your hands together, with fingers pressed closely together, and let your gerbil climb onto your hands.


Having him in a corner will prevent him from running away from you during your attempt to pick him up.
You may want to encourage your gerbil to climb onto your hands by holding a few small treats.

, When your gerbil is in your hands, slowly lift him up. Compared with other small pets, gerbils are not big fans of being picked up, so he will need some time to get used to the idea of being in the air.Start by lifting him up only about one inch (2.5 cm) into the air and then placing him back down. As your gerbil settles in to the idea of being picked up, gradually lift him up high enough to lift him out of his cage.Do not lift him too high—he could seriously injure himself if he jumps from a high height.
If your gerbil does not want to climb onto your hands, encourage him to run into an empty toilet paper tube or plastic cup. Cover the open end(s) with your hand(s) and lift him up out of the cage.You can then gently ‘pour’ him into your hands.

, It may be tempting to hold your gerbil close to your chest and keep him still. However, the best thing you can do is give him the freedom to crawl on your hands and arms. Keeping him still would mimic your gerbil being trapped in a predator’s claws in the wild—you definitely do not want your gerbil to see you as a predator!Place your gerbil gently back down in his cage to give him time to rest from being picked up.

, This cannot be emphasized enough! Gerbils have very thin skin on their tails. If you try to lift him up by his tail, the skin would slip off of his tail, exposing the bones.If the skin comes off, your veterinarian would need to amputate that portion of the tail. Otherwise, the damaged portion of the tail would slough off.The portion of the tail that you grab may actually break off as a defense mechanism. In the wild, this allows gerbils to slip away from predators that grab them by the tail. Unfortunately, your gerbil’s tail will not regrow once broken off., In the wild, a predator bird will swoop down from overhead and scoop up a gerbil with its claws. If you reach down and wrap your hand around your gerbil, he will probably think you’re a predator.To avoid being seen as the bad guy, scoop him up from underneath, rather than grabbing him from above.

, When you have picked up your gerbil, do not try to lay him on his back in your hand. In the wild, gerbils typically do not lie down with their bellies in the air. If you try to put your gerbil in this position, it will feel very uncomfortable to him. He may struggle so much to get out of the position that he injures himself., If your gerbil starts to nibble at your hand or looks like he wants to jump, do not punish him by yelling at him or flicking his nose.Punishing him will serve only to make your gerbil fearful of you, which would weaken your bond with him. Instead, give him a gentle puff of air.

Assess your gerbil's coat.,
Give your gerbil a dust bath.,
Let gerbils groom each other.,
Evaluate your gerbil's health.",How to Groom a Gerbil1," The best way to determine if your gerbil needs to be groomed is by examining his coat. If your gerbil's hair appears greasy or oily, it may be time to let him groom himself.Grooming takes up a great deal of a gerbil's day, and along with eating and sleeping, it is one of his main activities.;
, Gerbils naturally thrive in the desert.Because their natural habitat is dry and sandy, gerbils are not used to bathing in water. Instead, they take what is known as a ""dust bath,"" which means they roll around in sand and use it to groom the exterior coat.


Use chinchilla sand for your gerbil's dust bath.You can find chinchilla sand at most pet stores, or through online retailers.
Even though it is called a dust bath, it's important to give your gerbil chinchilla sand. Do not give your gerbil chinchilla dust, which is a product at many pet stores. The name may confuse you, but remember to only use sand.
Do not give your gerbil sandbox sand or sand from outdoors. Store-bought chinchilla sand is the safest and most effective way to let your gerbil groom himself.Pour the chinchilla sand into a heavy crock bowl and leave it in your gerbil's cage at least once each week.

, If you have multiple gerbils living together (who are not aggressive or trying to breed), they will probably groom each other from time to time. This is a normal part of gerbil behavior. It's used for both cleanliness/hygiene, as well as for social bonding.Gerbils that are close with one another may groom each other on a daily basis.
You should still provide your gerbils with a chinchilla sand bath, even if they groom one another regularly.

, A common indicator of health problems in gerbils is a coarse, rough coat of hair. Though you may assume this means he needs to be groomed, it's actually a sign that something is wrong with your gerbil. Talk to your vet about possible causes of, and solutions to, your gerbil's condition.


In addition to a rough coat of hair, look for a dull coat, matted hair, and any underlying skin irritation.A healthy gerbil should have a glossy, smooth coat, plus bright eyes and a normal level of energy.It's possible your gerbil's rough coat is simply caused by his environment. Make sure your gerbil's cage is well-ventilated and kept in a stable temperature with humidity levels below 50%.More serious causes of a rough coat of hair include infection, parasites, or other diseases.

"
"
Give your gerbil a rough surface.,
Trim your gerbil's nails.,
Have a vet examine your gerbil.",How to Groom a Gerbil2," While the floor of your gerbil's living quarters should be lined with something soft and comfortable (like wood chips), your gerbil will also need a small, rough-surfaced object in one corner of his cage or tank. This is to help wear down his claws so they do not become overgrown.A hand-sized stone or the backside of a bathroom tile would make an excellent scratching surface.
A running wheel may also help your gerbil's nails trimmed, but be sure the wheel is a continuous surface and not a wire bar surface., If your gerbil is not keeping his own nails trimmed through regular wear, you can trim them at home. However, it's important to exercise great caution so you do not injure your gerbil or yourself in the process.


Wear leather gloves when handling your gerbil to trim his nails. This will help keep you from getting scratched, which in turn will help ensure you do not accidentally drop your gerbil.Do not trim too close to the quick (the soft, inner part of an animal's claw). This can cause bleeding and serious injury.

, You should take your gerbil to see a veterinarian at least once a year, though some experts recommend twice a year. In addition to the regular checkups that can be performed, your vet can also cut your gerbil's nails if you aren't comfortable doing so at home."
"
Provide your gerbil with chew toys.,
Give your gerbil a wooden branch.,
Recognize dental problems.",How to Groom a Gerbil3," Most pet stores carry chewing blocks made of wood. These are designed for gerbils, as their teeth grow continuously. Your gerbil will need access to his chew toys every day to manage his ever-growing teeth so he can keep them sufficiently worn down.Make sure the chew toy you give your gerbil is made with untreated wood. Treated wood could contain harmful chemicals that can be dangerous for gerbils.

, If you're skeptical of buying chew toys or just want to save some money, a small branch from a fruit tree is a great option for your gerbil. It will allow him to chew as much as he wants to keep his teeth in check.


Apple trees make an ideal wood for gerbils. You can also give your gerbil willow, beech, birch, or pine branches.If you give your gerbil a wooden branch, make sure the tree was not sprayed with any pesticides. These can cause serious health problems for your gerbil, so make sure the wood is clean and untreated., You should check your gerbil's front teeth on a regular basis. If you are providing your gerbil with wooden objects to chew on, his teeth should not be a problem. However, if your gerbil has any tooth pain or other dental problems, he may stop eating/chewing, leading to overgrown teeth.If your gerbil's teeth become overgrown, take him to the vet. Your vet may be able to fix his dental problems.
Do not attempt to cut or file your gerbil's teeth at home under any circumstances. This can cause serious injury to your gerbil, and could stress him out to the point where he no longer trusts you.

Find a breeder.,
Look for healthy and friendly gerbils.,
Purchase multiple gerbils.,
Find gerbils that like one another.,
Purchase housing.,
Feed your gerbil well.,
Equip the bowl with a water bottle.,
Make a bed.,
Clean cage periodically.,
Encourage play and exercise.,
Take it slow.,
Handle with care.,
Do not pick up your gerbil by the tail; this can break the tail.,
Do not attempt to breed unless experienced with gerbil care.",How to Care for Gerbils," The best option is to purchase from a breeder. Because of the number of animals at a pet store, these establishments can have difficulty keeping track of the gender of gerbils and their relationship to one another. This is problematic since they are both social and territorial, requiring carefully planned interaction. A gerbil breeder is more likely to know the gender of the gerbil, whether two gerbils are familiar with one another, and whether they are related.A breeder should allow you to meet the parents of your gerbils. Ask to do this and verify that you like their disposition and health. Many of their traits will be passed on to their litter.
Ask the breeder questions about the pup and its litter. Was it born healthy? What percentage of the litter died? How inbred are the parents? How do the parents interact with other gerbils?;
, Even healthy gerbils are only likely to live for two to four years. You should be attentive, therefore, to signs that your gerbil is ill. There are also some cues which will indicate whether or not the gerbil is likely to be friendly.


For healthy gerbils, look for a tail that is as long as the body and full of fur, the fur should be shiny, it is a sign of good health much like humans; eyes that are shiny, large, bright and clear; and a body that is thick and stout. Dull or sunken eyes, red noses, bleeding noses, and depressed demeanors suggest that the gerbil is ill.You should not buy a gerbil that has overgrown teeth, patches of fur falling of, diarrhea or has evidence of diarrhea in the cage, seems to be skinny or not eating/drinking, or sneezing and has a running nose.
The signs that a gerbil is friendly are much what you would expect. It should approach the glass and seek attention. It is natural for young gerbils to nibble a bit with their mouth, as a way to explore their surroundings. This, however, should not be painful. If the gerbil bites you hard, it is likely anti-social. , Gerbils are naturally social animals and will get depressed and listless if left to themselves. You should always purchase at least two and perhaps more. Usually the optimal arrangement for a first time owner is purchase two gerbils of the same sex. If your gerbils breed, it can be both an expensive and complicated process for you.


Recognizing the sex of two gerbils is not always easy. To do so, turn them over on their back in your hand. At three weeks old, females will exhibit a shorter distance between their urinary and anal openings. At five to seven weeks of age, males will develop prominent testicles that will make identification easier. The qualified assistance of a professional will help, but, depending upon the establishment, the owner might not have sufficient knowledge of the gerbil’s background to provide much guidance., This can be difficult if the seller does not have sufficient knowledge of their interactions. If possible you should purchase gerbils that are from the same litter and somewhere from six to eight weeks old. This is the optimal time for them to establish relationships with each other. If this is not possible, you can introduce them with the split cage method.


To introduce unfamiliar gerbils to one another, purchase an aquarium divider. Place it in the middle of the tank and place the gerbils on different sides of the tank. Switch which side the gerbils are on several times per day so that they become accustomed to the other’s scent.
After about a week lift the divider and monitor the gerbils closely for a day. While it is okay if they box slightly, if they spring into the air or start rolling around in a ball fighting, these are indications that they are aggressive and should be separated immediately. Conversely, if they sleep together, this means that they have bonded.
If this procedure fails, try three more times. If it still does not work, it is probable they will never be able to get along.
Never try to introduce a bonded pair to a third gerbil. They will gang up on the unfamiliar newcomer., The best habitat for a gerbil is a large glass tank. For two Gerbils a 10-gallon tank should suffice. For each additional gerbil, the tank should be 5 gallons larger. Fill up a third of the tank with a substrate like Megazorb, Finacard, Carefresh or Bedexcel that the gerbils can dig in. Sufficient room to burrow is necessary to keep your gerbils active and entertained.Never line the bottom with sawdust because pine and cedar wood shavings can cause serious respiratory problems.You will need a top to protect the gerbils. The best option is something like a fine wire mesh that can be purchased at a pet store. These are optimal because you can hang items from them, including a wheel and a water bottle.
Avoid cages. Gerbils can easily get their feet caught in wire. Be mindful of this when purchasing anything for their home, including wheels., The first step to good health is a good diet. Like us, gerbils need a balanced diet of greens, protein, fats, and vitamins. Their base diet should be a commercially produced gerbil food, because these are designed to accommodate all of their nutritional needs. However, this can be augmented with occasional treats. Food should be scattered across the surface of the bedding.


Start with gerbil pellets or combinations of seeds marketed at the pet store for gerbil consumption.
Gerbils like seeds, but avoid giving them too many sunflower seeds, as these are particularly fatty. Pumpkin seeds are better. Occasionally give them cheese for extra protein but don't give it to them regularly as it can result in them being obese and unwell.
Supplement their dried food with fresh, healthy fruits and vegetables, including pear, melon, apple, oranges, cucumbers, carrots, pumpkins, and fennel. Rhubarb and grapes, on the other hand, are poisonous to gerbils.Hay is also a popular and healthy treat for gerbils; use the type available at pet stores.You do not need bowls. Scattering food is easier for you and better for your gerbils as it encourages their natural instinct to forage, while discouraging fighting.

, Get one with a nice metal spout. It helps if the body is composed of clear plastic, so you can see how full it is with a glance. Hang it from a mesh lid on a glass aquarium or through the bars of your topper. Clean the spout regularly. Refill frequently enough that the gerbils always have access to water.

, A simple wooden box is ideal for nesting. These can be purchased at a store. Shred tissue paper into small strips and place into the box to make your gerbils bed complete., You should check the cage daily and remove any stale food that has not been eaten. Otherwise gerbils are relatively clean. The bedding will need to be replaced, but not more than once a week., Exercise is also important to any pet's health. Luckily gerbils are naturally active. Space and bedding for digging are the most important requirements for gerbils. Other items, however, can help.


A solid wheel can provide great exercise. If it is not solid, the gerbil can get its feet or tail stuck and hurt itself. A good wheel is one that has no gaps in it but has ridges to use and run on. Also be sure to suspend the wheel off the ground from the wire top, so that it does not take up space in the cage.Pet stores sell wooden chew toys for gerbils that can provide entertainment.
An exercise ball is the best way to allow your gerbil to explore the wider world and get a work out. Just beware that your gerbil may not like the confined space so if they show signs of being stressed, take them out immediately and do not put them back in there until they are calm the next day.Gerbils also love cardboard. A cheap way to entertain gerbils is to give them the cardboard center of a roll of toilet paper after you have used it up., When you first purchase your gerbil, it might be too disturbed by its new environment to be friendly. Do not try to pick it up for the first couple of days. You can, however, begin to build positive associations with it by hand-feeding it seeds, a good sign of it trusting you is when it climbs onto your hand and stays there as it eats. If it runs away with the food to a small space or a corner, do not worry because this is natural as in the wild a gerbil will have to fight for it's food., You will want to handle the gerbil often so that it becomes accustomed to human interaction. A happy gerbil will receive daily social interaction. However, you should be careful. Wash your hands before handling. Use both hands to create a big bowl that will support the gerbil. Place your hands next to the gerbil so that it will walk up on to them.Avoid standing directly above the gerbil. It will associate any shadows being cast on it with predators, causing agitation.

, If you absolutely have to pick it up by the tail for whatever reason, do so by gently but firmly holding the bit nearest the gerbil's body, this reduces the risk of it releasing it's tail and running away. You should try to cup the gerbil and hold it carefully. You can also take them into your bathroom and play with them in the bathtub because it is a great way to get to know their personality and characteristics and also for them to get to know your scent and movements., A pair of gerbils can produce ninety-six pups a year. Those pups will soon begin to produce more babies. Unless you have considerable experience with gerbils, you should verify that you have no mixed sex pairs in your possession. Otherwise you will shortly be responsible for a small army of gerbils."

, Try to keep the gerbil away from glass and electricity, or you could have problems on your hands.


If a gerbil spots glass, it will be curious and may push it off a ledge by accident.
If a gerbil spots electric wires, stop it immediately. Gerbils can chew through wires with ease, which will kill them right away, and they may even start an electrical fire.

, If they are bored, then they will try to escape and find some fun things to do.

, Check every time you interact with your gerbils.

Go to your local pet sore, and find 'chinchilla sand'.,
Get a small bowl to put the sand in.,
After putting the sand in it (Don't put too much in, just enough for them to be able to roll in it), leave it in your gerbil's cage.,
Take it out about 10 minutes later, because the gerbils may go to the toilet in it.",How to Give a Gerbil a Sand Bath," IMPORTANT: Chinchilla Dust is NOT the same as chinchilla sand. Chinchilla dust damages their respiratory system, as well as making their fur ruffled and unhealthy. It will say somewhere what type it is, so just read all the labels.;
, Something like a cat food dish, enough for your gerbil to roll around inside. Avoid plastic, make sure it is not spiky, and that it's heavy enough that your gerbils can't tip it over.

, Chances are your gerbils will come investigate. They may try to eat a bit, but as long as it is not chinchilla dust, this is perfectly harmless. It may take a few times for them to get the hang of rolling around in, but they will eventually. Most get it straight away.

, Put it in every few days so they can get clean.

Enjoy your gerbil!",How to Tame Your Gerbils," Before you can tame a gerbil, it’s important to learn about their temperament. While they are loving animals, they can also be shy and aggressive if they are scared. Understanding your gerbil can help you successfully tame it.


Gerbils are naturally shy but are social, inquisitive, and can bond well with their human family. They don’t like to be left alone or isolated.Gerbils are very curious and active. If you have more than one gerbil, they will likely play with each other all day.Gerbils are very territorial and you’ll want to be careful introducing a new gerbil to your home or an already existing gerbil community.Gerbils rarely bite and only may exhibit this kind of aggression if they are scared.Unlike other rodents such as rats, mice, or hamsters, gerbils don’t produce the same bad odors.;
, Purchase a cage that will fit your gerbil or gerbils before you obtain the animals. Having their “home” prepared and inviting will help you tame them more effectively.


Place their cage in an area of the house with medium traffic so that you don’t startle your gerbil with too much activity. Gerbils are curious and like to watch and be part of the action. They also need to get used to the fact that humans make noise and motion.Fill the gerbil cage with bedding such as corn cob or aspen shavings.You can use alfalfa grass as a filler with any of these bedding options.Gerbils eat a mix of rodent pellets, seeds, fruits and vegetables, and insects. Keep a variety of food for them in the cage.Make sure you also put a water bottle in the cage so that your gerbil doesn’t get dehydrated.However, gerbils originated as a desert dwelling creature, so don't expect to see your gerbil drinking a lot.

If you buy one gerbil it will be more work, in particular since there is less entertainment, so consider getting two. The younger the gerbil is, the more success you are likely to have taming your gerbils.


Don’t get a gerbil under 5 weeks of age to help ensure that they’ve had enough time with their mother and are healthy.

This can also help ensure that your gerbil is healthy and doesn’t have any deformities from inbreeding.Check to make sure your gerbil choices are healthy.

, Moving a gerbil into a new space from another home is traumatic for the animal. Although your instinct may be to take them out and play, allow them some time to recuperate and settle into their new surroundings. This may help you tame them more effectively as well.Your gerbil may need a few hours to a few days in their new home for a few days before you start trying to handle them. Otherwise, they'll be too stressed to tame.

Some gerbil’s will naturally jump onto your arm while others may take time to get used to you.Since training is something you need to do regularly and over time, set short- and long-term goals. You can develop your plan by setting daily, weekly, and monthly intentions or goals for your gerbil.
For example, you could have the goal one week of getting your gerbil to jump into your hands without smelling you first. Make a plan over the course of the week to expose your gerbil to your scent and your personality. Remember to keep the exposure short and consider giving your gerbil a treat to warm him up..
It’s important that you can commit time over a longer period to taming your gerbil.

Gerbils of any age respond to taming.If your gerbil is older, it’s important to not be discouraged if he takes longer to tame. You can tame him as soon as he joins your family. Just know that it may take a little more time, effort, and patience on your part.Remember that gerbils can be intelligent and loyal companions. Proper communication and behaviors with your gerbil will help you to train him at any age., Gerbils are very sensitive to smells and before you handle them, you need to thoroughly wash your hands. This can help calm your gerbil and make him more likely to jump on to your hands to play.Don’t use a soap that is too perfumed so that it doesn’t turn off your gerbil.

, Before you can handle your gerbil frequently, gain his trust. This is a simple process that requires you to put your hands in the cage often.


Put your hands in the cage often to clean it or allow your gerbil to sniff you. He may or may not jump into your hand.Make sure your gerbil knows you’re around before you put your hand in the cage so that you don’t startle your animal.It may help your gerbil to trust you if you put a few seeds in your hand when you place it in the cage.Remember to remain calm as gerbils can smell adrenaline in your sweat., Once you’ve gained your gerbil’s trust, you can start to hold him more often. By staying calm and handling your gerbil properly, you can hold him for hours or let him explore you for fun.Just as with gaining a gerbil’s trust, it’s important to stay calm and not panic when you hold your animal.It’s very important to handle your gerbil properly so that you don’t scare or injure him.Scoop up your gerbil with both hands and hold gently and securely.

This will keep him happy and comfortable in any situation, and less likely to be aggressive. It will also make help tame him.


Gerbils may act aggressively towards other animals and people and this behavior can be prevented with proper socialization.Help your gerbil be comfortable around people by exposing him to positive and calm situations with other individuals.Tell any new people to allow your gerbil to sniff them first so the animal is less likely to feel threatened.Socialize your gerbil by taking him out of the cage and letting him explore. It’s also important to invite people to your house so that your gerbil is comfortable having other people visit his home.Keep every aspect of socialization calm and positive.If you are introducing two new gerbils, place them in a clean space free of scent.

If you are calm and happy, your gerbil will be calm and happy.You will be most successful at taming your gerbil if you are patient with him. If you keep your time together fun for both you and your gerbil, you’re more likely to be patient with him.
Yelling or physical punishment will only counteract your taming, and also may cause your gerbil to fear you and other people., Rewarding your gerbil for his positive behaviors is an integral part of the taming process. Understand that your gerbil may make occasional mistakes and that you must avoid physical discipline or yelling at him in these situations.


Positive reinforcement trains your gerbil by rewarding the actions you want him to repeat, such as jumping in to your hands.Reward your gerbil with treats such as seeds or fruit., Your gerbil may occasionally nip you or won’t want to be held. It’s important to react to your gerbil’s behaviors promptly. You will reinforce taming by doing this, and also ensure that your gerbil doesn’t fear you or other people because you disciplined him improperly.


It is counterproductive to verbally or physically punish your gerbil. This will only cause him to be fearful and confused and may even discourage him becoming tame.For example, if your gerbil nips you, use a firm “no” to let him know this isn’t an acceptable behavior.Never hit, yell at, or blow in a gerbil’s face. Also don’t drench them with water. Not only are these measure counterproductive to taming your gerbil, but can also cause serious health issues such as seizures., Gerbils are sweet animals that can be a lot of fun. Making sure that you enjoy can help you tame your gerbil.

Consider why you want to breed gerbils.,
Research split caging.,
Make sure you have good homes lined up for all babies before you have a single litter.,
Save up money.,
Buy your gerbils from a breeder rather than from a pet store.,
Know the gerbils' health history.,
Introduce the gerbils using a split cage, which should be located in a quiet and calm area of the house where there is not a lot of traffic nor sudden loud noises.,
Monitor and record the matings so you know when to expect the litter.,
Keep the breeding tank very simple without the presence of wheels, or toys and should be one level only.,
Mom's diet should be supplemented with extra protein while pregnant and nursing.,
When the litter is born do not disturb the nest for the first week.,
Handle your pups regularly and sex them.,
Pups are weaned at 4 weeks but should stay with the mother until at least 6 weeks has passed.,
Never sell pups to someone who doesn't have a suitable cage or tank for them, and don't sell a pup singly because it'll be lonely, or any of different sexes.",How to Breed Gerbils," There are so many animals in rescue that need loving homes that you must have a good reason for making more.;
, Gerbils are difficult to introduce to each other, but should not be kept alone. If the gerbils have known each other since they were pups, this isn't necessary.

, Never advertise for free and be wary, some people see gerbils as a cheap meal for a snake.

, Rodent breeders rarely make any money from breeding and you'll need to cover vet costs.

, Buying two gerbils from the same pet store might give you two from the same parent and could be supporting rodent farms. Breeding from the same parent (called interbreeding) is harmful. The pups would have cotton both genes for any defects the parents might have had. They would also have less immunity against any diseases they were prone to get. It is best to locate a good gerbil breeder who knows the history of their pups, as well as genetic background. Some breeders will cull so make sure their ethics match your own. You will need a network of ethical breeders to rely on so you can swap gerbils to keep your lines clean.

, Gerbils with a history of having fits or respiratory illness should never be bred from. Gerbils born with obviously severely crooked tails may have a congenital condition and should also not be bred from. Your breeding pair should be of good size. They should also have friendly personalities. Gerbils seem to inherit behaviors like pup neglect, it is worth knowing how your gerbils' mother coped with her pups. It is useful to know their genetics, enabling you to predict what color pups you will get.

, You do want the pups to get used to people and sounds, though. Place the tank so that your gerbils have some privacy from other tanks and animals., Remember that gerbils can mate within minutes of giving birth so you must be prepared for two litters. Its very stressful for a gerbil to raise a litter on her own so you should leave Dad in.

, The tank should contain only a water bottle and bedding (about 3 inches of Care fresh and unscented toilet paper - no material or fibers or ""fluff"" that is usually sold in pet stores). You might want to toss in a half toilet paper roll for the parents to gnaw up every day., This can be in the form of egg biscuit, cat biscuits, scrambled egg, dried or fresh meal-worms, whole nuts (crack the shells but leave the gerbils to remove them) or various other sources.

, This can stress Mom out and potentially cause her to eat her young. Leave Dad in to help raise the litter. If you must separate Mom from Dad, consider leaving an older daughter from a previous litter to help out.

, You can use the nipple method from 8 days but this is not 100% reliable.

, All pups your gerbils produce are your responsibility. If you can't care for them don't produce them. Three plus litters in a row puts stress on your mother gerbil, so remove the father before the birth of litter 3 (or even litter 2) so you do not exhaust your gerbil, but make sure an older daughter helps with the litter.

, Don't sell more than two, as this could be risky.

Listen: respect others' right to complete their thoughts before you interrupt to say what you want to say.,
Take notes while listening so as not to lose track of your thoughts.

,
Opinions are valuable; however, know the difference between thinking you know something and actually knowing it.,
Listen carefully, then repeat the same sentences to check whether you have received the right sentence or not.

,
Understand the importance of recognizing that just because you think you know what you're talking about doesn't necessarily make it so, and if you recognize your point of view is flawed, apologize and let the conversation continue.,
Recognize others' contributions and points of view by nodding and verbalizing that you've heard them and can see their point.,
Stay focused; unless we narrow the parameters of a subject, our points are seldom recognized and appreciated as required elements of a broader understanding of the subject matter.

,
Always thank each participant in a group for their contributions, be they right or wrong, and your group will flourish and grow.

,
Be a leader and exercise humility, because too much strength and dominance leads to weakness.

,
Keep the conversation on track; it's fine to let people ramble a little, but unless we stay on topic, the chances of resolving or tying up a group conversation are minimized.

",How to Create Relationships Through Careful Communication,";
,, And remember that an opinion doesn't equal a fact.

,, Being right is never as important as recognizing when we're wrong; learn and grow, to argue a weak flawed observation only hinders any chance of orchestrating a meaningful conversation. Suck it up - it's fine to be wrong.

, Be specific when offering constructive criticism by giving examples that make sense.

Gather treats that are not part of your gerbils natural diet.,
Start by putting your fist in the cage.,
Start feeding your gerbil.,
When your gerbil is used to taking it from your hands, try holding it tighter and tighter each time.,
When you come to a tight enough grip to where your gerbil is unable to take it, it will eat it from your hand.

,
When your Gerbil trusts you enough to eat from your hand, take it out of its cage and try.,
Have fun trying different treats and seeing what ones your Gerbil likes and Dislikes.",How to Give Your Gerbil Treats," Don't pick out things from their food dish. Be creative.


You can use cooked pasta, grains, nuts, cheese (small bits), cereal/flakes (make sure there isn't much sugar in it), almonds (Chopped), fruits and veggies (make sure you watch your gerbil eat these. If they don't eat them in 2-3 minutes, take it out so it doesn't moisturize the cage), dry bread. Do not give them anything citrus-based like oranges or limes it can cause death or upset stomachs.;
, It will smell it and even taste it. Your gerbil will gain trust to your hand. If it bites, don't tug your hand out fast. Do it in a slow motion. The bite was a friendly bite. Take care of it right away.

, Take 1 treat and softly hold it in your hands. Make sure the Gerbil sees it. It will come up to you and grab it. let the Gerbil take it.

, It will be harder for it to take it.

,, 2 different environments are good to try.

, Your gerbil will enjoy treats A LOT.

Be honest with yourself.,
Be honest with your spouse.,
Communicate with your spouse, but give them their own private space.,
Embrace your alone-time.,
When together, fall in love again and again.,
Try being content without the physical appearance of your loved one.",How to Cope with a Spouse That Travels for a Living," Your spouse will be out there, with other people trying to create a better life for your family. He won't stop doing his job so he can come back to you, so stop torturing yourself with that sweet fantasy. They will be with you only for a small amount of time and you will feel lonely from time to time. This will become less and less painful as long as realise it is happening.;
, Open up about your feelings. When you are lonely, tell them, don't go through it alone.

, You can't be too clingy or it will hurt you both.

, Instead of fantasizing about the moment your spouse walks right into your home, know that you are still alive. Your spouse doesn't make you feel alive, living does. Have a great time alone! Speak with friends, go out, do things you love, try new things out. Don't let loneliness get to you.

, Your spouse is the person you fell for, the person you love. When together, cherish the moments! Have great sex, sleep together like it's the first time you're ever doing it, cuddle, give your spouse something to think about when he's back on that plane.

, You can talk on the phone with somebody and feel like he is next to you just like you can talk to one next to you and wonder if he is even listening. It is all a manner of communication. If you can communicate with your spouse deeply, don't worry, you are closer to him than anybody.

Begin by making a plan.,
Develop some steps.,
Try to get into their heads.,
Plan out what you are going to say and how you will say it.,
Practice.,
Set up a meeting.,
Prepare to be surprised.,
Offer reassurance.,
Don't ask for their permission.",How to Convince Your Parents to Give You Space As a College Student," Asking your parents to change the way they relate to you is likely to be one of the first major issues you will face with your parents on an adult-to-adult basis. It will go better if you take the time to become so familiar with your plan that you will come across calm and confident when you approach them with it.;
, Plan to wean yourself from their constant parental involvement a little at a time, so they won't freak out or go through withdrawal. Put a timeline in your plan--for example in Week One, you will talk to your parents on the phone three times instead of eight. Maybe in Week Two it will be one phone call and two emails. Let them get used to the change gradually.

, Remember that parents don't get a lot of guidance from the world at large on how to gracefully let go of their children as they near adulthood. Write down (for yourself) your best predictions, based on your years of knowing them, what each parent will say to a request for more space. Then write down your best guess as to how each of them will feel while he or she says it. This is all preparation for fielding any resistance they offer.

, Start by a matter-of-fact statement of what they are doing and how it makes you feel. For example, ""Mom, when you call me every single weeknight, I feel like you don't trust me to be managing my own study time."" Or, ""Dad, when you ask for so much detail about my weekend plans it feels like you think I'm going to take dumb risks.""

, If you find you have your dorm room to yourself for an hour on a Saturday afternoon, stand in front of the mirror and run through your planned arguments until you can say them smoothly, with conviction, and in a calm and reasoned tone. Look at your body language, your facial expressions. Are you projecting the calm appearance of a confident young man or woman, or are you hunched up, waiting for the hammer to drop on your head? The more independent and assured you appear, the more likely your parents will be to take your discussion points seriously.

, Talk with your parents about this. Keep practicing right up to the time of the meeting.

, When they learn they've been overdoing it, and especially when they see the mature way you are handling this, they may be able to loosen up more easily than you thought.

, First express your appreciation for their caring - it doesn't hurt you to say, ""Mom, Dad, you've been so great to be there for me, and I love you for it."" But set firm boundaries: Let them know how often you would like to call, email, write, or text message them, and what days and times fit with your class and activities schedule. Make it clear that you are not cutting them off; instead assuage their anxiety and feelings of rejection by letting them know how often they can count on hearing from you.

, You are an adult. No matter what anyone says to you, there's no such thing as an ""adult kid"". You may always be their child, but your parents need to understand that you are not requesting their cooperation. You are stating your needs and wishes and hoping they will respect them. Go into your discussion confident in the one fact that can't be disputed: You are legally & physically an adult and not a minor. While you should always respect and value your parents' input, you do not need their approval or permission - for anything. Stating calmly that you want to be respected as the adult you legally are, while also being respectful of them, and mindful of the fact that they may be paying your way through college (therefore, you need to respect them as well) will help you make your case with a minimum of drama.

Be grateful that he still shows an interest in his child.,
Have someone at home if you feel scared, nervous, or worried about anything.,
Select a neutral meeting place.,
Try to keep in touch with his family.,
Be strong.,
Minimize the direct contact with your ex if it really upsets you (see step above on arranging drop off or neutral zones) and keep all your conversation at the level of civility.,
If you must discuss your relationship, get a babysitter and go and sit down at a specified time in a local cafe to work things out – your child should not be subject to the likely upset and pain such discussions will bring.

",How to Cope with Your Ex Visiting Frequently to See Your Baby," Many dads who leave find this a great opportunity to let go altogether and not stay involved with the raising of the child. You are in a lucky situation from that point of view at least.;
, If there was abuse (verbal, emotional, physical) prior to the break up, it is a good idea to have somebody at your place every time he arrives to see the baby. That way you have support and he knows to behave. If you cannot trust him at all, you need to seek a restraining order and not allow him around at all, but this article is presuming that he isn't that untrustworthy. All the same, have somebody there to help shore up your sense of support and safety.

, If you don't like him coming to your place, choose another place where both of you can meet in public, such as a cafe, a child's playground, etc. Alternately, drop the baby off at his place, with the only time you need to connect being the handing over and collecting times. This will all depend on what you feel most comfortable with and know you can trust to be OK.

, Let them know that you appreciate their responsibility toward their grandchild too. That way, they can keep an eye on his behavior and suggest tips for helping to raise your baby.

, If your ex wants a part of rearing your child, as already stated, you are in a lucky position. Try to maintain your own sense of strength even if you want your relationship back. Accept the things as they are and don't pine for the past; your baby needs to grow up knowing she is loved and not used as a barter or a tug-of-war in a relationship that is either messy or full of unrequited hope.

, Focus on the child, and discussing her rather than discussing each other.

Buy or clean out your aquarium.,
Get the right sized aquarium for your gerbils:


10 gallon (38 Litre) tank for 1 or 2 gerbils
15 gallon (57 Litre) tank for 3 gerbils
20 gallon (76 Litre) tank for 4 gerbils
30 gallon (114 Litre) tank for 6 gerbils.

,
Buy or acquire a lid for your aquarium.,
Acquire a large piece of plexiglass.

,
Cut the glass so that it fits like a shelf in one side of the tank.,
Squirt a line of aquarium sealant or silicone where you wish to have a level.,
Add another line of the sealant on top.,

Add something fun!",How to Make an Aquarium Into a Gerbil Cage," If you do not own an aquarium, you'll need to buy one or acquire one somehow. You could ask a family member, friend, or neighbor if they have an old fish tank they're not using, or you could go to garage sales to find an inexpensive one. You could also look on-line on websites such as Ebay or Craigslist. Finally, you could simply go to a pet store and pay retail price for a brand-new aquarium.


If you've owned fish previously and have kept the aquarium, clean it out using some bleach or cleaner. Make sure to rinse out the cage very well afterwards to avoid leaving bleach residue or residue of other chemicals that may be harmful to your gerbils. Finally, make sure to dry out the cage very well.
Distilled White Vinegar is also safe and can remove any lingering smells from the previous tenants.;
,, Obviously, unless you want your gerbils to escape, having a lid on your aquarium is a must. You can't use those bulky plastic lids that usually come with fish tanks, as your gerbils won't be able to breathe. Instead, buy or acquire a wire or mesh lid for your aquarium. If possible, it should have a removable ""door"" so that you can reach in and feed your gerbils. These lids are also frequently used on aquariums containing snakes. You could also attach chicken wire or mesh to a wooden frame that is the correct size for you tank.

,, Cut as many pieces as you want to use for shelves. Get help if you've never cut glass before; it is easy to hurt yourself if you don't know what you're doing. Also use a sharp cutter; blunt cutters are dangerous.

, Push the newly cut glass shelf on the line. Press and hold until it is in place. Let dry.

, This will secure the shelf well. Let dry.

,, Gerbil bedding is usually simply wood chips, however there is also pellet-style bedding available. Gerbil's feces do not have a strong odor, so there is no need for perfumed bedding.

If you're buying wood chip bedding, it is strongly recommended to use Aspen wood chips.







Do not use pine or cedar bedding. Cedar bedding is prickly and cuts your gerbil's feet, and when it's urinated on, it releases bad chemicals. Pine is soft, but also releases bad chemicals. Both pine and cedar bedding may cause respiratory problems as well as liver damage in gerbils.

Never use shredded newspaper as bedding, except for nesting material. , In order to hydrate themselves and have something to drink, you'll need to buy your gerbils a water bottle and a water bottle holder. These are sold at every pet store in various sizes. You do not need to buy one specifically made for gerbils - ones made for hamsters, rats, or mice work just as well. Also, because you're using an aquarium, you'll need to buy a water bottle holder/shield to go inside your gerbil cage in order to keep it up. These are also found at most pet stores. There are two ways to attach a water bottle to a tank - a suction cup to side or a wire through the lid.

, You can buy a food dish for your gerbils or simply use a small dish you have at home. Make sure to wash it out before putting it in the cage. Use a glass, ceramic, or metal dish, as your gerbils will chew through a plastic one. Some people like to play up a gerbil's natural foraging behavior by just scattering the food around the tank.

, Gerbils are very active creatures, and will love having some type of entertainment to play with. Again, avoid anything plastic as they will chew it up. The most popular gerbil toy is the wheel. When buying a wheel, make sure to buy a mesh one and not one with metal rungs. Wheels with metal rungs are easy for your gerbil's tail to get stuck it and pulled off, which you don't want to happen but mesh wheels can cause your hamster to get bumble foot and this is very painful to them. You can also buy gerbil toys and chew toys from pet stores.

Select an enclosure.,
Cover the bottom of the gerbilarium with substrate.,
Include bedding in the gerbilarium.,
Create separate play and sleep areas.,
Place a water bottle and food bowl in the gerbilarium.,
Create a dust bath for your gerbils.,
Place environmentally enriching objects in the gerbilarium.,
Clean the gerbilarium.,
Situate the gerbilarium away from direct sunlight and drafts.,
Place the gerbilarium away from busy and noisy areas of your home.,
Keep the gerbilarium out of reach of other pets.",How to Set up a Gerbilarium," Picking the right type of enclosure for your gerbils is very important. The gerbilarium should be an aquarium, which is made of glass and has a wire mesh top.Plastic enclosures are not a good choice because gerbils can gnaw through the plastic.For a pair of gerbils, the tank should be at least 10 gallons.You will probably need a larger tank if you plan to house more than two gerbils in the gerbilarium.
Keep in mind that bigger is always better when it comes to setting up a gerbilarium.Two-tiered aquariums are ideal. One of the tiers would contain a deep layer of substrate for burrowing. Your local pet store may have two-tiered aquariums available.If you are concerned about your gerbils escaping, you can purchase locking clips at your local pet store that you can attach to each corner of the mesh lid.;
, Gerbils have a strong natural instinct to burrow, scratch, and dig.Because of this, your gerbils will need plenty of substrate in which to burrow. Ideal substrates include non-toxic damp peat,dust-extracted wood shavings,and potting compost.Recommendations vary on how deep the substrate should be. One recommended depth is 20 to 30 centimeters.Another recommendation is to have the substrate as deep as the height of the gerbils when they stand on their hind limbs.Several types of substrate are not recommended for gerbilariums, including wood shavings and sawdust. These may damage your gerbils’ livers and lungs.It is a good idea to place a small, sturdy cardboard box in the substrate, along with an empty toilet paper tube by which the gerbil can access the box. The box would give your gerbils a dark and safe place to sleep when they burrow.Sturdy objects within the substrate can also act as scaffolding as your gerbils create burrowing tunnels., In addition to substrate, your gerbilarium will need bedding that your gerbils will use to create sleeping nests. Timothy hay is an especially good bedding material, since gerbils can also gnaw on it to keep their teeth filed down.Chopped natural barley straw is another good type of bedding to use in your gerbilarium., Your gerbils will appreciate having distinct areas where they can play and sleep. However, it is important to note that some gerbils may become territorial if their gerbiliarium is too sharply partitioned.Consider placing several cardboard boxes in the gerbilarium to provide your gerbils with sleep areas without creating partitions.

, Water bottles with a spout are ideal for gerbils and create less mess in the gerbilarium. They are available at your local pet store. When you set up the water bottle, make sure to fill it completely with water to create a vacuum and prevent water from leaking out.The water bottle will likely have a ball bearing in the spout to control the amount of water that comes out when your gerbils sip from it.You may need to purchase adhesives to attach the water bottle to the side of gerbilarium. Make sure the water bottle is low enough for your gerbils to sip from easily.
The food bowl should be stainless steel or ceramic.Plastic food bowls are not recommended, since gerbils could chew on them.

, In the wild, gerbils will take dust baths to remove excess oils from their coats.You can make a dust bath for your gerbils by placing fine-ground, absorbent sand in a stainless steel or ceramic bowl.Do not leave the dust bath in the gerbilarium permanently, though—your gerbils may start to use it as a bathroom., Environmental enrichment is important to any pets’ health and well-being. For example, toys are a great way to enrich your gerbils’ environment in the gerbilarium. Untreated wicker toys would give your gerbils something to gnaw on.A wooden gnawing block will also keep your gerbils physically stimulated and keep their teeth filed down.Empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls also make excellent toys.Exercise wheels are great for physical exercise. Try to find solid exercise wheels—your gerbils may get their feet stuck in exercise wheels with bars, causing injury.Do not give plastic toys to your gerbils.
Make sure not to overcrowd the gerbilarium with toys.Two to three toys at a time should be sufficient.
Your gerbils may also enjoy climbing branches, which you can find in the reptile section of your local pet store., Although gerbils do not produce much waste,you should still maintain a regular cleaning schedule of your gerbils’ enclosure. Recommendations vary on how often you should clean your gerbilarium. Keep in mind that you may need to clean it more or less often than what is recommended, depending on how many gerbils are in the gerbilarium.


Recommendations on thorough gerbilarium cleanings with pet-safe disinfectant include once a week,once every two weeks,and once every three months.Pet-safe disinfectant can be purchased at your local pet store.
When you do a thorough cleaning of the gerbilarium, save a small amount of the substrate and bedding. This will provide a familiar scent to your gerbils, which have a sharp sense of smell. The familiar scent may prevent fighting between your gerbils.Schedule a daily general tidying up of the gerbilarium., Direct sunlight and drafts can create fluctuations in the gerbilarium’s temperature, which could negatively affect your gerbils. The gerbilarium should be at a constant temperature of 68 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 22 degrees Celsius).Although gerbils are fairly resistant to heat stress,direct sunlight can cause heat exhaustion in gerbils.If you notice clinical signs of heat exhaustion in your gerbils (e.g., panting, weakness), move them to a cool and dark room.Place the gerbilarium away from a window and out of the path of vents and/or fans.

, Gerbils can become irritated and even distressed by loud noises (e.g., televisions, stereos) and vibrations.Therefore, it is best to put the gerbilarium in a quiet and calm area of your home.


The high frequency sounds from televisions and stereos and can also be bothersome to gerbils.Your bedroom may be an ideal place to keep your gerbilarium.
Your kitchen or family room may be too loud and have too many distractions for your gerbil.

, For your gerbils’ safety, their gerbilarium should be placed high enough so that other pets (cats and dogs) cannot get to them.Consider placing the gerbilarium on top of a table or dresser.


If you have a cat who likes to jump on furniture, you may want to block her access to the room that houses the gerbilarium.

When you're finished with toilet paper and paper towel cardboard tubes, get ready to reuse them!,
Once you have 3-5 tubes, or enough tubes that you can build the tunnels you want, you can begin the very first steps to making an intricate tunnel system.,
Cut gerbil-sized holes every here and there, so they can come in and out as they please.,
You will want to empty the cage of the bedding, and put it aside if it is still clean.,
Watch your gerbils as they examine the openings, pretty soon they will disappear into the ground!",How to Make a Tunnel Playground for Your Gerbils," You'll need around 3-5 of them to make a tunnel playground.;
,


To join tubes together, use scissors to cut 4 little slits around the very end of the tube, by the hole. Put the other tube in between these slits to join them. If it isn't fastened on tight enough, make the slits deeper. Make the system however long you want, but it has to fit inside the cage.







, If you don't do so, the Gerbil may get the feeling he or she is stuck, or that he or she is losing air. It is always good to have little escape windows every few inches.


Connect the tunnels to make the playground more interesting.






You can add them in different places.







, Adjust the system how you find appropriate in the bottom of the cage, and then add back the bedding. You will want to make sure at least 2 escape routes are showing, because if one Gerbil is trying to get in the same way as another Gerbil is trying to get out, it may end up in a fight. This may still happen, but 2 openings decreases the chance of that.

, Now, remember, don't be alarmed if one day you come home or approach the Gerbil's cage and they are not in sight, check the tunnel system before you panic. Have fun, and I hope you enjoyed making your Gerbils a tunnel playground!

Gerbils should not be kept in a hamster cage - these are useless and boring to them.,
Modular systems such as Rotastak and Habitrail are really not suitable for any rodent.,
Gerbils should be kept in an aquarium with either a mesh lid or ideally a wire topper on the top.,
Make sure that the lid and/or cage door are tightly closed, and even try testing them by nudging them a little.",How to Make a Comfortable Home for Your New Gerbil1," The wires are also unsafe as some of the dimensions are too small. It is vital that gerbil have room to dig, with a minimum of 6 inches (15.2 cm) of a good substrate such as Megazorb, Finacard, Carefresh or Bedexcel. Don't use a cage that is all plastic; these little animals will chew right through it!;
, They have a host of serious health and enrichment problems as well as being vastly too small. In addition with gerbils, you run the risk of one gerbil deciding to 'claim' a section of the cage which can lead to serious fighting, separation, declanning and even death.

, Since gerbils must be kept in pairs a good minimum for a pair is 20 gallon (75.7 L) glass tank with a wire topper. A special tank for a gerbil is called a gerbilarium. The topper means you can fill the tank section solely with substrate and the wire section allows a place for a medium sized silent spinner, hammocks and rope toys and most importantly, gives a place for water and a dust bath where it will not become contaminated or buried.

, This is important, because gerbils can jump and will leap right out of their cages if there is no lid.

"
"
Add at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) of bedding to the tank floor.",How to Make a Comfortable Home for Your New Gerbil2," In their natural habitat, gerbils dig complex burrow systems, and gerbils (like any animal) are happiest when they can emulate natural behaviors demonstrated in the wild. Aspen wood and Carefresh make excellent substrates, although Carefresh must be mixed with hay to support burrows. It doesn't hurt to also provide small disinfected stones, as the gerbils will use these to provide further support to their burrows. For nesting material, rip facial tissues or toilet paper into strips. (toilet paper works best)

"
"
Provide them with something to chew on - cardboard and wood work well, but do not let them have plastic to chew on as this can make them sick.

,
Add a medium sized exercise wheel.,
Attach a water bottle to the side of the cage.,
Add toys.,
They will bury their food in their substrate anyway, so skip the bowl.",How to Make a Comfortable Home for Your New Gerbil3,", Do not get a wheel with bars. Gerbils tend to get their tails caught between the bars. Rather, get a mesh wheel or a silent spinner. Silent spinners are made of hard, durable plastic that most gerbils cannot chew. Watch for signs of wear, though. If your gerbils do begin to chew on it, switch to mesh.

, Refill it everyday with fresh water, or sooner if needed.

, There must be an all-day accessible block of chewing wood, because a gerbil's teeth are always growing. Make sure you add a little 'hiding place' because even if they're the best of friends, gerbils need a little privacy from their companions. Pet stores offer many plastic hideaways, but gerbils will chew them through quickly. A very inexpensive toy would be to use the cardboard toilet paper roll or paper towel roll. Though they will chew it up within a few hours, they provide lots of entertainment! Don't get any plastic toys, though!

, Just spread the food directly on the bedding, and watch them to make sure they are eating. This is called scatter feeding and encourages their natural instinct to forage. You can string small veggies on a metal Kebab stick made especially for rodents (but avoid ones with plastic tops).

Put your gerbil in a safe place while you clean the cage.,
Remove litter, the food dish, water bottle, and toys from the cage.,
Gather the necessary cleaning supplies.,
Wash and rinse the cage.,
Clean the food and water dish.,
Change the bedding.,
Reinstall the other materials.,
Change wet or soiled bedding and litter each day.,

Periodically check your gerbil's teeth and nails.",How to Clean a Gerbil Cage," Your gerbil should not be in his cage during cleaning as the chemicals can be harmful to his skin and fur. Before cleaning the cage, gently take your gerbil out of their cage and put him in a safe place where he cannot escape.


Find a secure area where your gerbil will not get hurt. Keep him away from other animals, especially cats and dogs as they might be predatory towards gerbils.A bucket is a good choice, as the gerbil will not be able to jump or climb out. You might also consider purchasing a running ball for your gerbil, which can be found at most pet and department stores, so your gerbil can ran and play while you clean his cage.If your gerbil seems nervous, move something from his cage, such as a toy or a piece of bedding, to the new location. That way, he'll have something familiar as comfort.;
, Any equipment in the gerbil's cage, especially items he eats or drinks from, should be removed before you begin the cleaning process.


Litter should be periodically cleaned, but when you do a thorough cage cleaning you should remove all litter and replace it with fresh litter when you're done. Remove the litter before you begin the cleaning process.Soap suds in a food bowl or water bottle can easily harm your gerbil and cause stomach issues and general discomfort. While you should clean these items, they should be cleaned separately as you'll be using less soap then you would on the cage in general., Make sure you have cleaning supplies ready before you begin the cleaning process. Being in the cage can be stressful for your gerbil and you do not want to prolong the cleaning process.


All you need to clean a gerbil's cage is mild soap and water. No special cleaners are necessary and might actually be harmful to your pet.Never used ammonia-based products. These can be harmful to your gerbil, even when rinsed off thoroughly., Your gerbil's cage should be washed once a week. It is not necessary to wash the cage more than this. Using your mild soap, clean the cage using lukewarm water.


Use a soft cloth to clean the cage. Wipe it down with soap and water, until all odors are removed and any stains are gone.When you rinse, make sure all soap suds are gone. Make sure to check that the sides or bars of a cage are free of suds, as gerbils may chew or lick.Pat the cage dry with paper towels when done and let any excess water air dry., When you clean the gerbil's cage, use this as an opportunity to clean the food and water bowl.


Gerbils, being desert animals, do not drink often. However, they do need clean, fresh water every day. Make sure you rinse out the water bottle and clean it with a mild soap if it seems particularly dirty. Be very vigilant about cleaning out soap suds afterwards, as ingesting even trace amounts of soap can cause digestive issues.Give the water bowl a wash, once again using mild soap and rinsing thoroughly., Gerbil bedding gets dirty fairly easily and should be swapped out once a week when you clean your gerbil's cage.


Bedding options for gerbils vary. Aspen bedding made from recycled newspaper can be bought at most pet stores. You can also mix a variety of bedding types for your gerbil.Do not use cedar chips. These contain certain chemicals that may be harmful to your gerbil., Line the bottom of the cage with newspaper and reinstall the materials. Return toys, water bottles, and dishes to the proper spot. Add new litter and bedding. You can now put your gerbil back in his cage.

, In between cleanings, check on the bedding and litter to make sure it's dry. Droppings, spilled food, and spilled water should be removed.


You do not have to clean the entire cage or remove all the bedding when this occurs. Simply do a spot check once a day. Using a kitty littler scoop or spoon, remove any droppings, spilled food, or water., It is rare that your gerbil would become infected with fleas, but if there's a heavy infestation in the house you should take precautions.


If other pets, such as dogs and cats, bring in fleas they could further infect your home. They may bite your gerbil or infest his bedding and cage.If you find you have a flea infestation, ask your vet about flea powder. This can be placed in your gerbil's bedding, eventually making its way to his fur to protect him from bites., When cleaning your gerbils cage, check to see if he needs any basic grooming.


Gerbils do not usually need their nails trimmed. However, if you notice his nails are curling under or that he's scratching himself during grooming, schedule an appointment with an exotic animal groomer. Do not attempt to groom your gerbil's nails yourself as they are very small and you can easily slip up and cause your gerbil physical harm.Gerbil teeth do not stop growing, which is why your gerbil needs wood blocks and toys to chew on to prevent overgrowth. If his teeth look overgrown, schedule a visit with an exotic groomer. Once again, do not attempt to file down the teeth on your own. This could cause your gerbil harm if you're inexperienced. It's best to hire a professional."

Take some time to plan ahead and figure out what you want to say.Make a list of your main points. This list should include an apology, an acceptance of responsibility, and a statement of how you plan to make amends.
Practice what you want to say. You can try the apology out loud while looking in the mirror.
Ask for time to talk. Try saying, ""Lauren, I know you're upset with me. Is there a time this week when we could sit down and have a conversation?"";
, If you want to regain someone's trust, you have to have a serious talk with them. If you have wronged someone, the appropriate thing to do is apologize. Begin by stating how you feel.If you are trying to rebuild a friendship, tell your friend how you are feeling. You can say, ""Sue, I feel very bad that I betrayed your trust. I know it will be hard, but I would like for us to work on repairing our friendship.""
State your intentions. If you are communicating with a romantic partner try saying, ""I want us to be able to trust one another and I will do what it takes to make that happen.""
Be sincere. Whatever you say during your apology, make sure that you mean it. The other person might be able to tell if you're lying, and that will only further damage your relationship.

, If you are apologizing, than you have something to be sorry for. In order to regain someone's trust, you need to demonstrate that you know what you did wrong. Your apology should include an acknowledgement or your actions.Make it clear that you know what you did wrong. If you are trying to regain trust in a professional relationship, you should use specific examples.
Try saying, ""I made a mistake when I did not carefully proofread those documents. I know it cost the company money."" This shows that you understand the ramifications of your actions.
You should also use specific examples when talking to a friend. For example, you could say, ""John, it was wrong of me to lie and say I had to work late. If I'm going out with other friends, I should just be honest and tell you that.""

, A constructive conversation is one that has more than one participant. After you have said what you want to say, give the other person a chance. Take steps to show that you are listening.Use your body language. Nod your head and make eye contact while the other person is talking.
Rephrase the main points. This will show that you are retaining what is being said.
For example, you can say, ""I hear you saying that you have lost faith in me and that it will take time to rebuild that trust.""

, A face to face apology is always the best option. Unfortunately, that is not always possible. Maybe you live far away from the other person, or maybe they are not willing to speak to you. If that is the case, you can try an apology letter.Write a hand written letter. This is more personal than an e-mail. You should never make an important apology via text.
Edit your letter. It might take you a couple of drafts to get the right tone and content.
Your letter should be concise and to the point. Try to make it about 3 paragraphs. Your first paragraph can offer the apology, the second should acknowledge responsibility, and the third can describe how you would like to solve the problem.

, Your words are very important when trying to reestablish trust. Your actions are equally important. You can demonstrate that you are trustworthy by being dependable.Do what you say you will do. If you promise to stop being late all the time, show that you have changed by being punctual.
Call when you say you will. Remember, you're trying to rebuild trust. Make a point to stick to everything that you say you will do, even if it's just making a phone call.
Show that you can be counted on. If your boss asks you to file some important papers, get the task done right, and on time.

, When you break someone's trust, that can cause both of you to become emotional. You might be feeling guilty, and the other person might be feeling sad or angry. Remember that they might need some space to heal.It's understandable that you want to resolve the situation quickly. But respect the other person's need for space.
You can try saying, ""Amy, I really want to start working on our relationship. But I understand if you need to take some time.""
Be respectful of boundaries. If someone asks you not to call for a few days, then allow them to have the time out that they need.

, If you are trying to mend a romantic relationship, you can take some extra steps to show your partner how much you care. The three A's are Affection, Attention, and Appreciation. Figure out ways to demonstrate these feelings daily.There are many ways to be affectionate. For example, make it a point to offer a hug when your partner comes home from work.
You can give attention by being mindful of the little things. If you notice that your partner needs more coffee, get it without being asked.
Use words to illustrate how much you appreciate the other person. You can say something like, ""I really appreciate how caring you are.""

, One way to show that you are trustworthy is by going the extra mile. Whether you are rebuilding trust in a personal or professional relationship, taking extra responsibility is a great way to rebuild trust. It shows you are willing to work hard.Maybe you are trying to convince your boss to trust you again. Volunteer to stay late if he needs someone to help with the end of month reporting.
If you are trying to rebuild trust in a friendship, consider going out of your way to do something nice. For example, bring lunch to your friend when you know she's having a busy day at work.
Perhaps you are working on your relationship with your partner. Try doing the dishes or taking out the trash without being asked.

, When you are working to rebuild trust, it is important to show that you are willing to make changes. However, it is also important to demonstrate that you are genuine. Don't try to completely change your personality.Changing too much won't seem sincere. For example, if you're trying to regain your parents' trust, don't suddenly begin acting like a different kid.
For example, maybe your parents want you to help out more around home. That doesn't mean you should stop hanging out with your friends completely. It just means that you should work to find a balance.
Don't attempt to change your personality. If you've always been able to joke around with friends, don't stop now. Becoming completely serious all of the time will not seem sincere.

, When you first started this relationship, trust was not immediate. Trust has to be earned over time. It is natural that when trust is broken, it will take some time to repair.Try not to rush the process. Acknowledge that the other person might need time to start trusting you again.
State your point. Try saying, ""I know that this process might take time. I understand. Take all of the time you need.""
Try not to dwell on the situation. It's important, but once you have apologized and started taking steps to repair the trust, you don't need to think about the situation constantly.

, If you are trying to repair a personal relationship, it might feel like a very complicated process. You are likely going to feel a wide range of emotions. Remember that the other person might be emotional, too.It is normal for you to feel guilt, grief, sadness, and frustration. Give yourself permission to feel a wide range of emotions.
Acknowledge your emotions and move on. Say to yourself, ""Today I'm feeling pretty guilty. But I know I'm taking steps to fix it, so I can't be too hard on myself.""
Understand that your friend is probably experiencing a wide array of emotions. They might be hurt, angry, or sad. That is normal.

, When trust has been compromised, it is possible to repair the relationship. However, it is important to understand that the dynamics might change. Be prepared to have a different relationship than before.Maybe you have violated your boss's trust. Be prepared to accept a lower level of responsibility at work for awhile.
If you have compromised the trust in your romantic relationship, you might not be as close as you were before. Your partner might not trust you with intimate feelings for a while.
Perhaps you are dealing with a damaged friendship. You might have to accept the fact that your friendship is more superficial than it was before.

, If you break someone's trust, there is a good chance that you can make amends. But you should know that the relationship might be damaged beyond repair. Try to mentally prepare for a variety of outcomes.Accept the fact that you might have to move on. If someone doesn't want to be your friend anymore, you can't force them.
Try to find something positive in your life to focus on. Make a list of all of the things you have going for you.
Spend time with other people. Focus on enhancing the relationships that you still have.

Consider getting a large fish tank.,

Keep your gerbil at the right temperature.,
Clean your gerbil's cage regularly.Gerbils cages should be lightly cleaned daily.",How to Make A Comfortable Gerbil Home," The most highly-recommended homes for gerbils are large fish tanks. A fish tank allows you put in plenty of bedding for them to bulldoze and burrow into without worry that they'll kick it out like they would with a wire cage. Wire cages can work in a pinch, but are not recommended for the long term.


A gerbil will chew the wires of a wire cage and this can hurt their noses and muzzles.
The most important part of your gerbil's environment is room to dig, a minimum of 6 inches (15.2 cm) of substrate. So never go solely with a wire cage, as this can limit the gerbil's ability to dig and tunnel.;
, Plastic ""hamster homes"", or any cages with plastic trays or components, are highly discouraged. A gerbil will easily chew through the plastic and escape.Modular systems, such as Rotastak and Habitrail, are also not recommended for any rodent. As well as causing serious health and enrichment issues, in the case of gerbils you run the risk that one of your gerbils will 'claim' a section of the tubes and this can lead to major fighting and even death.

, Adding a topper to your large glass tank means your gerbil will be secure in its home but the tank will still get the ventilation that it needs. If you are buying a wire topper that is not made specifically for the tank you have, just make sure that it will fit the tank securely.Make sure the top is tight, as gerbils can jump!
If you only have a topper that is a bit loose, you can make sure your cage topper is secure by placing heavy objects on the edge of the topper.

, Remember gerbils must be kept in pairs but you cannot introduce an adult to an adult without a split cage. A divided cage allows the gerbils to slowly acclimate to each other, otherwise they may fight and once can kill the other.Instead of dealing with a slow introduction, consider getting several gerbils at the same time that were raised as pups and litter mates.

, Place food and water away from really deep sections of bedding. Also keep spinners, hammocks and rope toys away from water and food. In addition, the area where your gerbil takes a dust bath should be far enough away from food and water that it doesn't contaminate them.


Keeping food and water away from areas of heavy bedding and activity will make your life easier. It will make cleaning up food and water spills much easier.

, This can consist of recycled paper bedding, plain shredded paper or corncob, or various kinds of wood shavings. However, avoid pine or cedar wood shavings, as they have harmful wood oils that can hurt your pet's respiratory system.Gerbils must have a minimum of 6 inches (15.2 cm) of a decent substrate to burrow in. Add hay for support and essential chewing and you'll soon see your gerbils construct an impressive array of tunnels.
Use aspen shavings if you feel the need for wood shavings. Avoid using sawdust. This should not be used as bedding for any rodents.

, Buy a healthful, nutritious food formulated for gerbils. Some pellet foods provide the full spectrum of vitamins and minerals your gerbil may need. However, pellets may not provide your rodent with enough variety to keep them eating an appropriate volume of food. If you buy this kind of feed, be sure to combine it with another food mix that contains more diverse flavors.


Give your gerbil little bits of vegetables daily and bits of fruit every other day. Vegetables can include peas, broccoli, and carrots. Fruits can include apples and bananas.Gerbils eat a lot of small meals throughout the day. This means that they should always have access to food in order to keep a healthy eating schedule.Gerbils need access to clean water at all times. This is best provided with a water bottle that attaches to the cage, so that water is not spilled all over the cage.

, Your gerbils need plenty to chew. They should always have hay and thin cardboard available.


A gerbil's teeth will grow continuously for the entirety of their lives. If you don't get your gerbil something to chew on and wear down their teeth, they can grow too long and inhibit their ability to eat, causing your pet to starve and die.
Empty paper towel rolls, tissue, and cereal boxes can be put in their cage. They will have fun shredding the boxes up into little pieces.
It's fun to also watch them stuff their cheeks with tissue paper to bed out their bedroom.

, These busy creatures need exercise and fun, so don't let them be bored for the entirety of their lives. A bored gerbil can become antisocial and aggressive. If you can't afford more costly toys engineered specifically for gerbils or rodents in general, try a few toy balls, like those you might buy for a cat. If you need something cheaper, try toilet paper rolls.Be aware, however, that you will need to replace most toys you buy for your gerbil on a regular basis, as they are avid chewers and will eat their way through plastic and wood.

, Instead, give the gerbil a shade if you need to put it in an area that gets a lot of light.

, Gerbils do well when kept in a room that is between 65 degrees and 85 degrees. This temperature range will assure that the gerbil does not get too hot or too cold.It should also be put in a place where it is not exposed to drafts. This can cause the gerbil to get sick.

, This light cleaning should include removing bedding covered in waste, and removing old fruits and vegetables.


A more thorough cleaning, in which all bedding in replaced, should be done weekly.During this cleaning, the cage should be cleaned with soap and water, left to dry, and then filled with new bedding, items to chew, and food and water.

Communicate effectively.,
Spend quality time together.,
Learn about each other.",How to Control Your Man1," Honest and open communication is one of the foundations of a healthy relationship. If you and your partner can effectively bond, you will find that it is easier to work together to solve problems. It will lessen your need to control him.Choose your timing. If you want to have an important conversation, choose a time that is good for both of you. Don't try to have a deep conversation right as he is walking in the door from work, for example, or if you know you have to leave for the gym in five minutes.
Watch your body language. During important talks, try sitting side by side with your man. This makes you both feel equal, and is more effective than if one of you is standing over the other. You should also try to maintain eye contact, as that conveys trust and respect.;
, In the early stages of dating, the two of you probably had plenty of romantic dates. But as a relationship progresses, it can become easy to fall into a rut. Perhaps you're spending all of your time together watching tv rather than actually enjoying each other's company. Make sure to get some quality time together each week.Having alone time with your man is very important for your relationship. It helps you connect to each other as adults. Set aside some time each week that is just for the two of you--no kids, no friends, no one but you.
Do activities that require you to interact. For example, try a fun activity such as bowling. This will help you relax and feel more comfortable with one another. If your man enjoys your company, you will need to worry about controlling him.

, Of course your know your boyfriend or husband, but that doesn't mean that you know all of the important things about each other. The healthiest relationships are those where the couple makes a real effort to understand one another on a deeper level. During your quality time, make an effort to learn new things about each other.The best way to get to know each other better is to ask questions. These questions can be as simple as saying, ""How was your day?"" The important part is that you both give detailed honest answers, and that you both actively listen to the other.
You could also try asking more creative questions, such as ""If you could be any character in a book ,who would you be?"" These types of conversations will allow you to learn more about each other. The more you know, the more you will trust each other. You will be able to communicate instead of controlling.

Describe your needs.,
Make relationship rules.,
Set boundaries.",How to Control Your Man2," If you can guide your man to behave in a way that is positive, it will become less and less necessary for you to feel the need to control him. All of us want a romantic partner who fulfills our needs. What we need to remember is that our needs are not always readily apparent. Try telling your partner exactly what you need from him.Try saying something like, ""I am having a frustrating day. I really just need to vent right now. Can you please just listen quietly for a few minutes?""
Maybe you feel like your man is not making enough time for you. Instead of yelling, maybe you could try saying, ""I know you're really busy lately. Could we schedule a time for us to go to a movie together?"" By explaining what you need, you are more likely to get it.

, Even though you are both adults, your relationship could likely benefit from some ground rules. Work on these together, and make sure that you both agree to stick to the guidelines you are creating. For example, if it is important to you that you two never go to bed angry, make that one of your relationship rules.If you feel like you need to control your man's actions, try setting some guidelines in advance. For example, ask that he only spends one or two nights away from home with his buddies. He'll appreciate that you are flexible, and you'll know when you can count on him to be home.
You can also set some rules about how to communicate with one another. For example, if you aren't morning people, you can agree never to discuss a serious subject before you've had your coffee.

, Setting boundaries is a very effective way to guide your man towards the behavior you'd like him to show. The first step in setting boundaries is to acknowledge your own feelings. This will help you figure out what is important to you in the relationship. You'll be better able to articulate your needs.For example, maybe your boyfriend is constantly borrowing money from you. This might make you uncomfortable, especially if he doesn't pay it back in a timely manner. Set boundaries that dictate exactly when and how much he can borrow. Also indicate that it should be paid back.
Make it clear that crossing boundaries will impact your relationship. Articulate that these boundaries are important to you, and you will be unhappy if they are not observed.

Be more socially connected.,
Feel more secure.,
Improve your health.",How to Control Your Man3," There are many proven benefits to being part of a healthy, loving relationship. When you have a partner, you will automatically feel more socially connected to the world. You will have a built-in person to talk to about movies, work, current events, or anything else that is on your mind. This helps you feel more in tune with the world around you.Being socially connected can help you feel more confident and happy. The connection deepens if you live with your long-term romantic partner.

, Being in a healthy relationships means that you have a deeper sense of security. For instance, you know that you have someone to celebrate with when you get a big promotion. You also know that you have someone to comfort you when your long-tme pet passes away. Feeling secure is crucial to your emotional well-being.Research shows that being in a long-term relationship has great benefits on a woman's mental health. The sense of security you get is a large part of that.

, You will also get physical benefits from being in a loving relationship. People in happy relationships tend to have less stress. Low stress rates mean that you are less likely to have high blood pressure, heart problems, or symptoms of depression.People in long-term relationships also benefit from having regular sex. Sex can help improve your mood, and also decreases your stress levels.

Make a habit of socializing.",How to Connect With Anybody," One of the easiest ways to connect with people is to radiate a positive energy. Smiling conveys that in the most simple way possible and it takes very little effort. If you’re not the kind of person who smiles a lot, you may be giving off negative energy to people who don’t know you without even meaning to. The next time you see a person you don’t know or pass an acquaintance, make an effort to smile a bit more, showing those pearly whites. Not only will people be more likely to connect with you, but research shows that smiling actually makes you happier, so everybody wins!Make a goal of smiling at 10 people today and take it up from there. Not only will you be projecting more friendliness, but you’ll be making other people smile and feel happier in the process.;
, Another way to connect with new people is to have body language that makes you look approachable and easy to talk to. If your body is open to new people, your mind will be, too, and they’ll be much more likely to connect with you and to enjoy a conversation with you. Just make eye contact with people, smile at them, and turn your body toward them instead of away. Keep your hands at your sides instead of folding them over your chest, and look straight ahead of you more than at the ground.


Also, maintain good posture, whether you’re sitting or standing. This makes you look more energetic and accessible to others.

, When you first meet people, the best way to connect with them is to make them feel like they’re remarkable. This doesn’t mean you should lie and give them false compliments, but that you should look out for whatever makes the person unique and stress that to him or her. It’s not about being fake, but about finding opportunities to make people feel unique. If people feel special in your presence, they’ll find it easier to connect with you because they’ll be less self-conscious.


If the person mentions having four children, for example, you can say that you’re impressed he or she is able to balance his or her family with her career; if someone tells you he just ran the San Francisco Marathon, mention that you’re amazed that he was able to run up all of those hills.
Give people lots of smiles, laughter, and affirmation. You don’t want them to think of you as a tough audience or they won’t be likely to open up to you.

, Another way to connect with people right away is to find something you have in common. Though you may not want to question new people about all of their favorite interests too much, you can listen carefully to see if hear the person mention something that you have in common. This can help you find something to bond over and to get excited about together — what’s more, if you do find an instant connection, then the person will remember you and will want to spend more time with you the next time you see each other.


You can bond of sports, music, hobbies, backgrounds, TV, film, traveling, pets, favorite neighborhood spots, favorite comedians, or many other subjects.
If you happen to come across something you and the person deeply disagree about right off the bat, whether it’s your political persuasion or your sports affiliations, try to steer away from these conflicting feelings until you know the person better. Of course, if you think you can have a jovial argument about your favorite sports teams, then that can help you connect, too.

, Studies show that people are forming real connects less than ever in today’s world — in fact, in one study, 25% of Americans said that they have no one to confide in.Part of the reason this may be happening is because, with all of the technology we have, many people are much more focused on checking their phones or emails than in engaging with the person right in front of them. If you want to break this mold and stand out to people upon a first meeting, then make sure to be present in the moment and to give them all of the attention they deserve. They’ll be impressed that you care so much, and will feel happy to be in your presence.


Don’t talk about the meeting you have to go to or the dinner you’re having in an hour. Focus on enjoying what you’re doing in the moment.
Making eye contact is key to being present in a conversation. Don’t let your eyes dart around the room or it’ll look like you have something better to do.

, People are drawn to people who have a positive energy surrounding them. Everyone wants to feel happier in their lives and they naturally want to spend more time with people who are happy about who they, where they are, and what they do; on the other hand, people don’t typically enjoy being around people who are constantly complaining or only talking about the worst things that happened to them that day. If you want people to feel like they can connect with you, then focus on talking about positive goals, positive mutual interests, or just the random, funny things that happened to you today.


If you hear yourself making a negative comment, counter it with two positive comments.
Talk about the good things around you, from the weather to the sandwich you’re eating. Never forget all that you have to be grateful for.

, Another way to connect with people at first is to learn how to quickly read people. You should really pay attention to what people say and do when you first meet them, so you can try to figure out as much as you can about them from their body language, sense of humor, or any indications of their background or where they came from. This can help you get a sense of whether or not they’d like to talk about sports, work, children, or whatever it is you bring up. It’s important to tailor your comments to the person you’re talking to so you show them a side of yourself that would be most appealing — and least offensive.


You should also be able to read whether or not the person you’re talking to is getting bored. If he’s shifting on his feet, not saying much, and looking around, then you better change the subject.
Study how people react to others. If the new person you’re talking to laughs loudly at a raunchy joke someone else makes, then you’ll know it’s okay to exhibit your bawdy sense of humor.

, As you move past the first impressions, you should work on actually showing that you care about the people you’re connecting with. This means that you should care about the person and his goals, hopes, and interests. Being genuine is the most important thing you can do to make a real connection; talk to people because you want to know how they’re doing, not because you want to use them to get ahead, and they will be able to see the difference.


Let them see that you really care who they are and what they’re about. Spend much more of your time talking about other people instead of yourself.
If people are telling you about something that happened to them, whether it’s a job interview or a camping trip, ask a few follow-up questions to show you’re interested.
If you read a news story about something a person was talking about, send him an email with the link to say he might find it interesting.

, As your friendships with people progress, you should work on asking them questions to show that you really want to get to know them. While you may want to stick to easy topics such as hobbies or pets at first, you can move on to asking people about their jobs, or even about their backgrounds or their relationships with other people. Let your relationships progress at a natural pace and ask questions when they seem relevant.


It shouldn’t feel like an interview and you shouldn’t ask too many questions at once. As your relationship progresses, you can ask more and more questions to get to know the person better.
You should open up about as much as the other person if you want to connect. While the person should feel like you care about him, he shouldn’t feel like you won’t reveal anything about yourself.

, One way to build deeper connections with people is to find something that you can do together to strengthen your bond. If you know that three of your co-workers are voracious readers just like you are, start a monthly book club with them. If a few of the guys in your class love watching football as much as you do, invite them over to watch the game next Sunday. If the neighbor you’re starting to build a friendship with loves yoga as much as you do, suggest that you attend a workshop together. Finding an interest to bond over can take your relationship to a new level.


You may have to take the initiative to invite the person to explore the interest with you, but don’t be shy about it. If the person likes you and cares about the mutual interest, it’ll make for a fun time where you can connect.
Once you explore one interest with a person, then you may find that you have two or more other things in common, and your bond will continue to grow.

, You want people to feel like they can come to you if they’re struggling, and like they’re not competing with someone who is perfect. While you don’t have to complain about all of your insecurities or problems at once, as you get to know people, you can open up to them about things like your current questions about your job as well as your latest fight with your sister. Making the effort to reveal things about yourself will show people that you’re a person who is open to connecting.


You may think that people will like you more if you seem perfect, but in reality, they’ll be much more open to connecting with you if you prove that you have flaws. It’ll make you seem more human.

, Another way to connect with people is to make sure to stay in touch with them. Check in with them about hanging out over the weekend, or call or text them to see how they’re doing if you knew that they had a big event coming up, like a job interview or a big exam. This shows that you’re thinking about people when they’re not around and that you really want to know how they’re doing. While you don’t want to check in on them so much that they feel like you’re on their case, do it often enough that it deepens your bond.


Checking in with people builds a more natural and more lasting rapport and will make easier for you to keep hanging out.
Just a simple text message wishing a person good luck the evening before a big event can help him or her feel like you care.

, Another thing you can do to make people connect with you is to really pay attention to the things they tell you. From remembering their names from your first meeting to remembering where they’re from, what their hobbies are, or what their favorite book is, committing these things to memory will make you a more caring friend who is easier to connect with. If people feel like everything they tell you will go in one ear and out the other, then they’ll be less likely to want to open up to you.If you can remember the name of the person’s sister, where he went to college, where in Florida he lived as a kid, or any number of details he only mentioned once or twice, then he’ll see that you really care.
You should also focus on a person’s facial expression and body language to see how he or she is really feeling. The person may say that everything is fine, but you’ll know that something is wrong, and you’ll be a better friend for knowing.
Make the effort to listen when people tell you when their birthdays, anniversaries, or other special events are so you can congratulate them at the right times.

, Another way to deepen your connections with people is to make an effort to really listen to them when they talk to you. You should look them in the eye, put away your phone and other distractions, and make an effort to really absorb the words they’re telling you. Let them finish talking instead of interrupting and offering your own opinion. Hold back your judgment and reserve your advice unless it is asked for. Listening to people shows them that you really care about them instead of just talking about yourself.


People are notoriously bad listeners in today’s world of technology and multi-tasking. You can make yourself stand out by making an effort to really care.
When people talk to you, turn your body toward them and have open body language so they are more comfortable talking to you.
You don’t have to nod or say, “Uh huh” every two seconds to show that you’re listening, either. Your eye contact, body language, and focus will do that for you.

, Another way to connect with anybody is to find people who have similar interests. Join a hiking group, a road-runner’s club, a short story writing workshop, a local theatre, or a number of other organizations geared toward people with similar interests, and you’ll be surprised by how quickly you’ll connect with new people. Since you’ll already have a common interest and have made an effort to commit to it, you and the people in these organizations will already have a lot to talk about.


If there’s nothing you feel really passionate about, try a beginner’s class in something completely new. You’ll be able to bond with people over your goals to try something new and exciting.
People tend to be friendly in clubs and organizations because they’re there by choice. It may be easier to connect with them there than it would be in school or on the bus commute home.

, Another way to put yourself out there and to connect with people more is to make the effort to introduce yourself to new people. Whether there’s a new co-worker in your office or you and the girl next to you at the coffee shop are reading the same book, don’t be shy about reaching out your hand and introducing yourself. A lot of people are shy and they’ll feel connected to you because you made the effort to speak to them. Just be friendly, make some small talk, and ask the person a question or two to get a conversation going.


If you get in the habit of introducing yourself to new people, then you’ll find it easier to meet new people because you’ll let go of your reservations. Though you can’t connect with everyone, helping get your guard down will make this much easier.
If you’re in a group setting and there’s someone you don’t recognize there, take a chance and introduce yourself and you may find that the person you’re talking to has a lot in common with you.

, People love connecting with people who are disarming. If you act like you take yourself too seriously or like you’re Mr. or Mrs. Perfect, then people won’t feel like they can really talk to you or open up to you. Instead, show that you know who you are, and you’re okay with laughing at your own foibles, whether you spilled coffee on your pants or managed to lose your cell phone for the third time this year. If you can laugh at yourself a little without being too self-deprecating, then people will think you’re easygoing and will be more comfortable talking to you.


Though you may feel like you’re too insecure to go out on a limb like this, take a chance and make a joke about yourself. You’ll see that other people will be impressed that you’re putting yourself out there and they’ll be more likely to connect with you.

, A lot of people don’t connect with others because they’re full of excuses for why it won’t work. You may think that you’re new to a neighborhood and no one will want to be your friend because you have no idea where to go or what to do there. You may think that no one will talk to you because you’re a teacher living in a neighborhood full of lawyers. You may think people won’t talk to you because you’re shy. Whatever excuses you’re making, if you want to connect with people, you have to toss them aside and get out there.


If you spend your life making excuses for why people won’t like you, you’ll be missing out on some incredibly meaningful connections.
Of course, not everyone will be able to connect with you and vice versa. But you have to at least be willing to make an effort if you want it to happen.

, Another way to put yourself out there is to help people. You can volunteer in your community, help your neighbor carry her groceries to her home, or even help an acquaintance study for an exam. As long as you’re not letting people completely take advantage of you, people will appreciate the effort you’re putting in and will want to help you out in return. This is a great way to connect with people because you’ll be showing a selfless side of yourself and will be open to new experiences and connections.


If you help people, even in a small way, then they’ll think you’re a kind, friendly person who is worth knowing.
Of course, you should help people because this is something you really want to do, not just because you think it’ll help you get friends.

, The best way to put yourself out there is to get in the habit of connecting with people or trying to connect with them on a regular basis. Make sure you have at least a few social events on your social calendar at all times, and that you’re friendly and open to new people and new experiences. If you don’t close yourself off and always look for the next opportunity to socialize with people, then you’ll be much more likely to connect with them.


Think of it as a rule of numbers. It’ll be harder to connect with people if you only interact with a handful of people, won’t it?
Connecting with people is all about being in the right mindset. If you believe you can connect with them, and have gained experience socializing and meeting new people, then you’ll be much more likely to build deep, lasting bonds.

Check in again.",How to Comfort Someone Who Is Sad," Let the person know that you see that they are upset and that you are available to listen. If you don't know the person very well, you could identify why you're trying to help.For instance, if you know the person, you could say, ""I see you're having a hard time right now. Do you want to talk about it?""
If you don't know the person very well, you could say, ""Hi, my name is Jean. I'm another student here, and I saw you were crying. I know I'm a stranger, but if you want, I'll listen to what's upsetting you."";
, That is, you may be tempted to dance around the issue if you already know what's wrong. If the person had a loved one die or if they broke up with someone they cared about, you may find yourself not wanting to say what the problem is because you don't want to hurt the person more. However, the person knows what is wrong and is probably already thinking about the situation. Asking about it in clear terms shows you care and are willing to deal with the issue as it is without sugarcoating it, which will likely come as a relief.For instance, you could say something such as ""I heard that your father died. That must have been really tough. Do you want to talk about it?""

, One way to help get the conversation going is to ask the person how they are feeling. In any situation, a person is going to feel more than one emotion, even in sad situations, so letting them open up about all their emotions can be helpful.For instance, if they had a parent die after a long and complicated illness, of course they are going to feel sad. But they also may be feeling some relief that the illness is over and some guilt on top of that for the relief they are feeling.

, It's tempting to compare what they're going through with something you've gone through in the past. However, when someone is upset, they don't want to hear about what you went through, necessarily. They want to talk about what's happening in the present., It's a natural tendency to want to help the person feel better by having them look at the positive side. However, when you do that, they may feel like you are glossing over what's wrong; that is, they may feel like their feelings aren't important. Just listen without trying to show them the positive side of things.For instance, try not to say things like, ""Well, at least you're still alive,"" ""It isn't all bad,"" or ""Cheer up!""
Instead, if you must say something, try phrases such as, ""It's okay to feel bad; you're going through a tough time.""

, Most of the time, people who are crying or upset just need someone to listen to them. Don't try to talk over them and offer them solutions.You may be able to offer solutions near the end of the conversation, but at the beginning, focus on listening., One way to listen attentively is to repeat what the person is saying. That is, you could say, ""What I hear you saying is that you are upset because your friend wasn't paying attention to you."", Keep the conversation on them. Turn off the T.V. Drag your eyes away from your phone.Part of staying focused is not daydreaming either. Also, don't be sitting there trying to think about what you want to say next. Actually take in what they're saying.

, That is, make eye contact with the person. Nod along to what they are saying. Smile at the right moments, or show concern with a frown.Also, keep your body language open. That is, don't cross your arms and legs, and point yourself towards the person., Most people feel helpless when faced with a friend going through a tough time. It's a natural feeling, and you likely won't know what to say to the person. However, just acknowledging that fact and telling the person that you're there for her is often enough.For example, you could say, ""I'm so sorry you're going through this. I don't really know what to say to make it better, and I know no words really could. But I want you to know that I'm here for you when you need me.""

, If you feel comfortable doing so, offer the person a hug. It's always better to ask first, though, because some people may not be comfortable with physical contact, especially if they have been through some kind of trauma.For example, you could say, ""I'd like to give you a hug. Would you like that?""

, While there's not always a solution to what's bothering a person, sometimes just making a plan can help them feel better. Therefore, now is the time to gently offer solutions if the don't seem to have any ideas; if they do, encourage them to talk about and plan out what they want to do next., If your friend is going through a lot, it's fine to ask if they've thought about seeing a counselor. Unfortunately, seeing a counselor comes with much social stigma, but if your friend has been having trouble for awhile, it may be worth it to talk to someone who knows what they're doing professionally.Of course, the stigma around seeing a counselor is unjust. You may even need to convince your friend that it's perfectly fine to see a counselor. You'll be helping to combat that stigma by letting your friend know you'll still see them as the same person even if they need a little help.

, Whether someone wants to talk weekly or just go out for brunch once in awhile, you may be able to help. You may also be able to help by offering support with difficult tasks, such as supporting the person if they're obtaining a death certificate for a loved one. Just open up the conversation to see if the person needs anything in particular.


If the person seems uncertain about asking you for help, offer up concretes suggestions. For instance, you could say, ""I'd love to be able to help. I can drive you somewhere if you need me, or I can help by bringing food over, for example. Just let me know what you need.""

, If you offer support or help of any kind, make sure you are willing to follow through. For instance, if you say, ""Feel free to call me, and talk anytime,"" actually be willing to drop what you're doing to talk. Similarly, if you offer to do something, such as drive the person to therapy, be the person who actually shows up to do it., Most people have trouble reaching out to someone when they need help, especially emotional help. Therefore, don't forget to check in with the person from time to time. It's important to be available if she needs it."
"
Be her friend on Facebook.,
Get her phone number.,
Use other social networks.",How to Communicate with a Girl when She Is Not Around," This is an appropriate way to get closer to a girl you don't know very well, or stay connected with a close friend.


Like her status updates, photos and covers.
Send her messages. If you bonded over something you do together, such as a sports team or tutor group then start off with something like ""Well done at tennis today!"" If you share interests then post something about that, such as ""I though you might like this video about soccer! *link*"" If you want to maintain a friendship, or are interested in her romantically then just talk to her like you would if you saw her at school, e.g. ""How are you?"" ""I had a great time at the movies with you yesterday!"" etc.
Post funny pictures/videos, links to websites or in-jokes to her wall.;
, Text her asking her about her day, or with a funny joke, or asking her to do something together. Talk about stuff that you have in common such as shared interests and school.

, Get Snap Chat, Skype, etc.

Pay attention to their opinions.,
Consider what they say when you’re gone.,
Notice if/when they stand up for you.,
Talk to the person.,
Consider the permanence of the split.",How to Deal With a Friend Who's Become an Enemy1," Friends will often share their opinions on a host of things, from your clothes to your significant other. These opinions come from a genuine interest in your life, whether it’s good or bad. If your friend offers you constructive criticism that has a positive intent, that is acceptable. If they consistently bring you down with negative and overly critical opinions about you and your life, then it might be time to have a conversation with them about where the friendship is going wrong.A friend offering constructive criticism might pull you to the side and say something like “Have you noticed that the shoes you are wearing have a hole in them? You might want to put on something else before we go out.”
Someone who is being overly critical may address the same situation by calling you out in front of everyone and saying something like “Seriously? You are wearing shoes with holes in them. Don’t you have a better pair?”;
, People discuss other people all the time. Doing so is not inherently bad, but when someone takes the opportunity to paint an absent person in a negative light, that’s not a good sign. If one of your friends is talking about you in a bad way, you will probably hear about it from other people. What they have to say about you when you aren’t around is a fair reflection of what they think about you overall. Knowing what they think about you can help you salvage the friendship if you are interested in doing so, but it will require cooperation on both ends.Do not overreact to a friend making a lighthearted joke or stating something that is true. For example, say you aren’t on time for a get together and one of your friends says something like, “I’m not surprised. They probably lost the car keys.” This isn’t something to be offended by (especially if you commonly lose your car keys).
Personal and demeaning comments rarely, if ever, fall into the lighthearted joke category. Take the same example of being late for an outing and imagine one of your friends says something behind your back like, “I can’t stand them. All they do is complain about how bad their life is and bring everyone around them down. I hope they don’t show up at all tonight.” In this case, this person is likely not a friend anymore.

, Friends advocate for one another. This means that a real friend will support you when you need it whether it is in public or private. If you notice a friend sticking up for you or helping you out, they are likely a genuine friend. This can be a good sign that they are interested in repairing the relationship, even it if it is currently on the rocks.For example, if someone says something rude to you and your friend diffuses the situation by saying something like, “That’s not necessary. Let’s all be mature,” then they are taking up for you.
If your friend joins in and says something unkind to you, they might not be as good of a friend as you thought.

, If your friend has flipped sides and become your enemy, there must be some reason. Have a conversation with them and see exactly why the animosity has developed in your relationship. Be direct and clear with your old friend, especially if you want to be friends again.


For example, you could say something like “I’ve noticed that we don’t get along as well as we used to. It seems like you aren’t very fond of me anymore. Is there a reason?”
This conversation might be best had alone.

, Once you deem a friend lost and an enemy gained, you have to decide whether this is what you want. If you want to rekindle the friendship, you will need to cooperate with the other person and create active steps. If you aren’t interested in rebuilding the friendship, then the two of you will most likely remain enemies.


You could take active steps like having breakfast together once a week to reunite.
Before deciding that the friendship isn’t worth fixing, you might want to consider things like mutual friends involved. You might spend a lot of time around this person whether you want to be friends or not. In this case, it might be best to at least be on speaking terms.

"
Explain that the venue can only accommodate the previously agreed upon number of people.,
Ask your friend before making plans if he/she will be bringing others to the venue.,
Tell your friend how his/her behavior impacts the evening.,
Reconsider your friendship if your buddy consistently brings extra people to events without telling you.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Invites Others to Come Along Without Telling You," Although some restaurants or parties can find a few extra chairs for guests, make it seem as though where you are going cannot accommodate more folks.


Tell your friend that everyone agreed upon the guest list when you made the reservation. The list was set in stone days or weeks prior and bringing more people is not possible.
Remind your friend that if you would have known beforehand you could have accommodated more people, however your hands are tied at this point.
Explain to your friend that if the situation were different and you were going to a house party or the movies, perhaps everyone could join you, however these plans will only allow the previously agreed upon guests.;
, Make a preemptive strike by remembering that this pal likes to add a few more people to your gatherings and ask in advance.


Remind him/her that whenever you get together and/or make plans, the guest list always seems to change. Perhaps your friend isn’t fully aware of his/her behavior. Remind your pal that this is something that has been done in the past and instead of being surprised, you are asking up front if others will be coming along so you can accommodate extras and be prepared.
If your friend shows up with a few extra party-goers, but told you ahead of time that he/she would not be bringing more people, tell your friend that the extra people are not going to be able to attend and that you asked him/her ahead of time. While this may put you in an awkward position, remind your friend that you did open the door for more guests but he/she said no one else was coming. You did your part, but he/she did not.
If time permits, ask your friend right before the event if he/she is going to bring an additional person. If you’ve asked days/weeks before and your friend said he/she is flying solo, try one last time immediately before you are meeting or going to the party to provide an extra opportunity for your friend to add a “plus one (or more).”

, From having to accommodate more people to the simple rudeness of not bothering to tell you, make sure you pal understands how his/her behavior makes the evening awkward.


If you don’t like the people your friend typically brings, let it be known. Your friend may not realize that you and his/her friend(s) don’t mix well, which may help him/her make a better decision in the future.
Let your friend know that you wanted to keep the evening or encounter exclusive to the set list of friends. Perhaps it is your birthday and you only wanted to see faces you knew in the crowd instead of strangers that your friend decided to bring along. Try to explain the situation from your perspective in order to get your friend to see the light.
Make your buddy understand that showing up with extra people puts everyone in an awkward situation. From the party host to the group dynamic, sometimes people would like to know who they are spending the day or evening with instead of being surprised. Plus adding guests at the last minute puts the venue or restaurant in a bad position trying to accommodate extra people on the fly.

, Perhaps you can overlook one or two times, however if you detect a pattern it may be time to re-think your level of friendship.


Don't invite your friend ahead of time to events. Instead let him/her know at the very last minute. If your friend can attend, great. If not, at least you don’t have to worry about the entourage.
Only invite your friends to large parties or events where it won’t matter if he/she brings more people. Avoid an awkward situation where you have to be the one accommodating extra folks and only extend an invite to an event where the number of attendees won’t matter.
Stop doing things socially with this friend, especially if he/she shows up with people you don’t like. The situation may become more sour if you are constantly confronted with people you do not like. Tell your friend that you see him/her going in a bad direction with the “influence” around him/her and then back away. Hopefully your friend will realize that the group he/she is associating with is bad news and drop them.

Seek closure for yourself.,
Stay focused on the present.,
Be prepared to encounter them later.",How to Deal With a Friend Who's Become an Enemy2," If you have a friend that you have decided is now an enemy, you need to let go of the friendship. This means releasing the good times and the bad. This process will likely come with a mix of good and bad feelings that you will need to sort through. There are several ways to help yourself do this:Create some kind of ‘moving on’ ritual. Do something that symbolizes the end of the friendship for you. Common versions of this would be to burn or bury something that the friend gave your or that you two shared.
Write out your feelings. This could be in the form of a letter to your friend (don’t send it), a poem, or even just a list of the things you are thinking and feeling.

, Dwelling on the past will drain the energy and excitement out of your life. Instead, focus on enjoying your life as it is right now. To do this, spend time with your current friends, or go make new ones. You can also find things that you enjoy doing alone and spend time doing those.Practicing mindfulness can help you let go of the past and focus on the present.
An example of something you might enjoy doing alone could be exercising, art, or reading.
You can go out to movies, coffee shops, or the park with your friends to enjoy yourself.

, If your new enemy is an old friend, you are likely to cross paths from time to time. Whether you still have several mutual friends or just live in the same neighborhood, social situations could force you to tolerate each other. It is best if this situation does not catch you off guard. Some things you can do to prepare for an encounter are:Think about how to respond if they are rude to you.
Consider what you should do if they want to be friends again.
Practice saying what you think you will need to say. For example, say something in front of the mirror like “I’m well. I hope you are well, too.” If you don’t want the conversation to go any further, you can excuse yourself.

"
"
Handle the situation yourself.,
Overlook as much drama as possible.,
Be polite in social situations.,
Set clear boundaries.",How to Deal With a Friend Who's Become an Enemy3," Unless you plan to lose more than one friend, leave mutual friends out of the drama. No one wants to be forced to pick between you and your new enemy. They also aren’t likely to enjoy listening to you talk badly about someone that they still consider a friend. If you need to talk to someone about the situation or vent your frustrations, do so with a friend that doesn’t know your former friend. You could also talk to a family member, counselor, or other supportive figure.If your mutual friends bring up your new nemesis, simply change the conversation and say something like “That situation is between the two of us. I think it’s best that I don’t involve our friends.” Anything you say could upset your friends or find its way back to your former friend.

, An enemy that was made from a friend is likely to be holding on to some sort of grudge. They may try to upset you or entice you to argue and bicker with them. The best thing that you can do is ignore any immature behaviors and focus on conducting yourself in a respectable way. Otherwise, you will be seen as being just as childish as your enemy.For example, if your enemy does something like leave a nasty note in your locker, just throw it away. There is no need to write a note back or confront them about it. Actually, you don’t even have to read it at all.

, When a social situation forces the two of you to interact, not only should you be prepared, but you should also be polite. Being rude will only invite your enemy to do the same. It can also ruin the event for everyone else. Avoid as much conversation as possible, but keep any conversation that you do have pleasant.For example, if you go to a mutual friend’s birthday party, you might have to say something like, “Hi. How have you been?” After a short exchange you can move on.
If you are rude to the other person or complain about them being invited, you might make the whole situation stressful on your friend who’s having the party. This will make things tense between you and your friend.

, When you do interact with your old friend, make your boundaries clear. Though you may have to exchange pleasantries, you do not have to entertain your enemy for long conversations or reminisce about the ‘good old days.’ If you have no interest in rekindling the friendship, do not agree to meet up for coffee or hang out. Politely decline the offer and move on.For example, your enemy might say something like, “We used to have a lot of fun together. We should grab coffee sometime and catch up.” You can politely respond with something like, “I’m not sure that’s a good idea. We had a pretty rough falling out, and now we can be in the same room peacefully. I wouldn’t want to mess that up.”

"
"
Remember that you can handle this.,
Ask questions to your partner, and listen to the answers.,
Remember that your thoughts and feelings matter.,
Decide how you would like to pursue and operate in relationships.,
Find help.,
Don’t be too quick to judge yourself harshly.",How to Communicate With Your Partner when You're Autistic," At times, you may fear that no amount of effort on your part will ever allow you to understand your partner. The best strategy may be becoming an expert on yourself. This can serve as a foundation for learning new skills, having compassion for yourself, and even learning to laugh at how different you and your partner may approach problems and issues.;
, Remember, your mind works differently than your partner’s. Rather than relying upon logic or assumptions, use your best source of information: your partner. For instance, instead of assuming that your partner is ready to end the relationship over a fight, ask for clarification. Pick a casual, low-stress time: doing dishes together, driving in the car, setting the table. (Having something to do will also make eye contact less of an issue to your partner.)


""How do you feel about ____?""
""Could you tell me more about that?""
""So you're feeling pretty frustrated with your mom."" (People usually agree and then elaborate when given this sort of statement.)

, Though they may be expressed differently, your feelings and perceptions are valid, and are worth just as much as your partner’s feelings and thoughts. This can be a difficult perspective to maintain, especially if your partner is articulate and quick. Remember, working out a problem should be a collaborative project, not a verbal jousting competition. Here are ways you can assert yourself:


""The sound of banging pots and pans is really painful to me. Maybe next time when you unload the dishwasher, you could give me some warning, so I could move my laptop to another room?""
""I don't think I can handle that.""
""I don't want to discuss this now. Let's talk about it later.""
If you have a difficult time verbalizing your thoughts, especially in stressful situations, then you may want to write a letter to your partner, and give it to them. This allows you to adequately express your feelings.

, This takes thought. Do you want to strengthen the relationship, and be together more often? Decide for yourself if you do. If you decide to work to strengthen your connections, you may benefit from learning to monitor your “togetherness tolerance” – Aspies often are helped by frequent breaks, shorter visits, etc. Your level of need in connecting with others may differ vastly from that of your partner. This is fine, and may serve as a great balance for your relationship.

, Communicating with neurotypicals is difficult, and there is no shame whatsoever in asking for advice. Build a close circle of people whose judgment you trust, and ask them for input when you don't know what to do.


Ask a trusted person for advice: a parent, a friend, a sibling, etc.
Talk to a therapist or communication coach.
Read books about communication. The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People may be a good start.
Talk to your partner about how you're feeling.

, Autistic people often provide wonderful advantages to their relationships, such as “grounding,” logic, a refusal to become violent or aggressive, a heightened desire to do the right or moral thing, a refusal to participate in the emotional “games” so many adults struggle with in relationships, and an intense sensitivity (buried or not). As always, self-acceptance is the best position to take as you navigate the wonderful – and sometimes terrifying – frontiers of intimacy.

Modify your expectations.,
Prepare a “Plan B.” One of the biggest sources of frustration in dealing with a flaky friend is the fact that you’re always getting “stuck”: stuck waiting at the restaurant, stuck without a ride home, stuck not knowing if the ski trip is really going to happen or not.,
Try to understand the problem.,
Don’t “bend over backwards.” When it comes to unreliable friends, sometimes the truth is as simple as this: “People are flaky because they can be.”That is, your friend may keep blowing you off because she experiences no consequences for doing so, and thus senses no reason to change.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Constantly Blows You Off1," If you’re tired of always being late to the movies, having plans fall through, or being stuck at a party alone, you need to make a change. Sometimes, though, the easiest way to make this change is by adjusting your own perspective.Even in the best case scenario, you’re never going to completely change your friend’s flaky ways. So you’re going to have to make some modifications on your part whether you confront your friend or not (assuming you have no desire to end the friendship).
Consider, for instance, whether you are making too big a deal out of at least some of the instances of being “blown off.” Is it really that big a deal to miss some of the half-hour of previews before movies? Did you have a good time at the party anyway? Did you make good use of your unexpectedly-free Saturday afternoon?This isn’t to say that your frustrations about your friend’s unreliability can’t be completely justified. It does mean that preparing for this disappointment and looking for “silver linings” when plans go awry may be part of the “cost of doing business” with this friend.;
, By always establishing a backup plan in advance of dealing with this friend, you can help minimize your frustration.Avoid making plans that hinge on the unreliable person showing up on time or making the key arrangements. Always let someone more reliable be the driver or the organizer. Envision the plan with or without your flaky friend’s involvement and make sure it works out either way.
Don’t let yourself get stuck alone waiting for a ride from your unreliable friend. Have a backup “lift” in mind at all times, and try to ensure that you can at least wait around with some other friends.
While you’re waiting (and waiting) to be picked up by your flaky friend, keep working on something useful — homework, cleaning, exercise, etc. Sitting there doing nothing and stewing over being late yet again will not do you any good.

, If your friend is consistently unreliable, your first instinct may be to think she doesn’t care about you or has better things to do that spend time with you. By taking the time to consider why she may have this problem with reliability, you might find being blown off by her less grating, or perhaps have a bit more compassion for her efforts.It is true that some people are simply fickle, unreliable, or indecisive by nature. Sometimes people “flake” with regularity because they say “yes” when they are not truly interested in or capable of following through, due to an innate fear of confrontation or rejection. Others may have every intention of following through, but are sabotaged by social anxiety — that is, they would rather not show up than to mess up.
Whether caused by nature or nurture (or both), some people simply have bad time management and organizational skills. Working on improving those skills may help address the problem of unreliability.
Your friend may come from a family or community where notions about what it means to be “on time” or to “follow through” on a plan differ from yours. They may see “meet me at 7” or “let’s do lunch tomorrow” as more of a general suggestion than an appointment.

,


Basically, you want to walk the fine line between being accommodating and understanding and being an enabler. There’s only so much change you can make on your part, and at some point your unreliable friend is going to have to accept some responsibility for making changes as well.While it may be comforting to think that you can deal with an unreliable friend without having to raise the awkward topic with her, in the end the solution to the problem — and the larger relationship — needs to be a two-way street.

Figure out if they’re actually copying you.,
Think about how big of a problem it is.,
Consider if something else is bothering you.,
Ask them about it.,
Talk about their originality.,
Point out what you like about them.,
Let them talk.,
Help them discover their uniqueness.,
Force them to do their own thing.,
Build their confidence.,
Make sure they do things they like to do.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Copies You," We all have egos, and sometimes they get over-inflated. It’s part of human nature to believe others perceive us the same way that we do and that they want to be like us. This may not be the case. Ask your other friends to see if they’ve noticed copying. If they haven’t noticed anything, drop it. If it becomes a more serious situation, they’ll bring it up.;
, Reframe the situation: instead of thinking of your friend as copying you, you could take it as your friend admiring your good judgment and taste. Maybe they simply need someone to look up to—especially if they’ve just lost one—and they’ve chosen you. While it might be annoying, it may be a temporary thing. Don’t be too quick to react on this situation because it may result in the loss of a friend., While copying can feel a bit like identity theft, there might be something else bothering you. If this other problem is being projected onto the copying problem, the copying problem seems worse than it truly is. If something else is bothering you, don’t take it out on your friend. Let them have their moment and focus on yourself. Just because they wore the same color shirt as you did to school, or said they had the same favorite meal, doesn’t make them a copier.

, Discuss it with them. They might not even realize that they’re copying you. Sit down with them and make sure they’re aware of it and divulge into potential reasons for it. Don’t attack them, make it a discussion.


”Did you notice that we’ve been matching a lot lately?”

If they say no, give them examples.


”Do you think it’s funny that we always end up doing the same thing?”
”Why do you think these things happen?”

, Ask them how they describe their style or personality. If they have trouble doing so, it’ll help them see that they’ve been copying you. Remember, it’s likely there will be similarities between you—that’s why you’re friends—but they should also have some original ideas.


”The whole point of clothes is to highlight your own unique style, how do you think you’d describe your style.”
”How do you see yourself?”

, Give them examples of things they’ve thought of on their own that you liked. Show them that they also have good, original ideas. Be vague when you do this, so that you don’t give away all of your preferences., This is going to be the turning point to make them stop copying you. Once you make them aware of the situation, you need to let them carry the conversation. This will show them that they have the ability to form their own ideas and that will carry over into whatever aspect of life they’ve been copying from you.

, If they’ve been copying your outfits, go through their closet with them. Have them create outfits without your help and point out good things about them. If they’ve been copying the way you act, leave it to them to make the first move and agree with whatever they choose. Give them confidence in their decision-making, and they’ll be less likely to copy you., If they truly seem to have difficulty understanding that they’re copying you, don’t tell them your plans. Secrets are never good for a friendship, but you may have to keep some so that they make choices for themselves. Make them decide on upcoming plans and purchases. Don’t give them an answer about where you want to go or what you want to do. Let them do it.

, Continue to point out what you like about their style or ideas. Keep in mind that people that copy chronically typical suffer from extreme insecurity. They have low self-esteem. Get your mutual friends in on it to help build their confidence. Support them in every choice they make, even if it seems over the top. This will help them become a confident, independent person., This is an easy way to build self-esteem. When you do something you enjoy doing, it’s something that gives you comfort and confidence. Help your friend do something they like to do every single day."
"
Talk to your friend about it.,
Meet your friend in the middle.,
Create consequences.,
End the relationship.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Constantly Blows You Off2," Why should your friend ever change his flaky ways if he doesn’t know it bothers you? He may not even know that it is an issue at all unless you tell him so. A healthy friendship, like any good relationship, requires honesty and openness.Calmly but clearly explain to your friend that his unreliability causes you distress and inconvenience, and is having a harmful effect on a friendship that you highly value. For example:

""I know your life is very hectic right now, and you're trying to be a good friend by making all these plans with me, but the fact that you're always having to cancel at the last minute or don't show up at all is a problem for me. I love spending time with you as much as ever, but maybe we can work together on being more realistic about how often we can get together, until life settles down some for both of us.""
""I know we all joke around about how you're always late for everything, but sometimes it causes real problems when we're late for something important. Can we work on finding some ways to make sure we're on time when it's important to be?""


Don’t raise the issue in a fit of anger after missing the beginning of yet another sporting event or concert because of his lateness. This is more likely to simply devolve into a shouting match with back-and-forth accusations that may imperil the friendship.

, One you’ve raised the issue, you can expect your friend to be a bit defensive and possibly hurt. Immediately discuss ways you can work together to address the issue in a way that will benefit the both of you. Make him feel like he is not the only problem and you are not somehow immune from blame.Can you find ways to build more time flexibility into your time spent together? For instance, can you start your plans with a “buffer” activity without a set starting time (like playing video games or running in the park) before going to a movie or social gathering that does have one? Can you work together to set up concrete plans for that road trip you keep talking about?
You can’t expect your friend to change completely, going from Mr. Flake to Mr. Reliable. By offering to take part in the necessary changes, you improve your odds of achieving some movement on his part.
For instance: ""Whenever we come up with one of our road trip ideas, maybe we should look into it right then as a group to see if it's realistic or not. You shouldn't have to get stuck trying to set up everything, and neither should any of the rest of us.""

, Especially once you’ve clearly expressed the problem and tried to work out mutual solutions to your friend’s unreliability, you may need to be more particular about ensuring that future episodes of being “blown off” do not go unmentioned or free of consequences.Establish a time limit for how long you’ll wait for him to show up — twenty minutes, an hour, whatever seems fair and sensible to you. If he doesn’t show, you go.
If your problem is a friend who never seems to return your calls, texts, posts, etc., then you may need to stop initiating contact for a period of time. Let your friend assume responsibility for initiating contact; if he refuses to do so, you may have exposed a fundamental weakness in the friendship.
For instance: ""I'm sorry I wasn't there when you finally showed up. I waited for half an hour, and I don't think it would be fair to expect me to wait around any longer than that.""

, This should be the last resort, but whenever it becomes clear that your friend has no intention of addressing his unreliability, even when he knows full well that it hurts you, it may be your only option and for your own good.If it is clear that your unreliable friend takes from the relationship without giving and does not truly care about your needs and concerns, then you are likely in a “toxic friendship” built on inequality and hurtfulness. Such toxicity can be bad for your emotional and even physical health.Breaking up with an unreliable friend is often no easier than breaking off a romantic relationship, but it is equally important to do so when the so-called friendship is a drain on your well-being. In both cases, present a calm, clear, honest assessment of why the relationship needs to end, told directly to the person.

How to Break Up focuses primarily on romantic relationships, but it may offer you some helpful advice on ending a relationship with a ""toxic"" friend as well.

Consider seeking professional help.",How to Communicate Better With a Girlfriend," Asking questions is one of the best ways to improve conversation with your partner. You should ask each other questions every day about how work went, how you both are feeling, and other day-to-day ""updates"" about one another's lives. You should also ask questions to clarify something that was said, or to dig deeper and get your partner to open up more.Use prodding questions. Start out with larger, more general topics, and work your way down to more specific revelations.
You might start by asking your girlfriend how her day was, then ask about an incident that was unpleasant or a happy moment at work.
Once your girlfriend starts to talk about the specifics of her day, you can try applying the things she says to other conversations you've had. For example, you might ask, ""That's happened before, hasn't it?"" or ""Wow, I can't believe that happened after _____ told you something different last week.""
Ask your girlfriend how she feels about the events she describes. Let her know you care, and offer her your support.;
, A big problem in relationship communication is one partner not feeling heard or understood. Rephrasing what your girlfriend just said in your own words shows that you are listening to and processing everything she's saying. It can also be a useful way to help mentally ground yourself in the conversation if you find that your thoughts are racing and you're having a hard time focusing on what's being said.Use a natural conversational tone. If your partner interprets your rephrasing as mocking, the conversation can go bad very quickly.
Try to limit your use of rephrasing. If done too often it can be distracting or irritating.
Put your girlfriend's words into your own words when you rephrase them. This shows that you're processing everything she says, and not simply repeating it word for word.
You might try using a transitional phrase to begin your rephrasing. For example, try saying something like, ""So what you're saying is..."" or ""I think I understand where you're coming from. You're saying ________. Is that right?""

, Body language often speaks just as loudly as words. The way that you and your girlfriend position yourselves during the conversation can send signals that may be unintentional, or may reflect your subconscious mood. Try not to read too obsessively into your partner's body language, but if it seems like there is a problem, try asking her if she's upset and let her know that you noticed her body language.If your girlfriend crosses her arms, she may be feeling defensive, distant, or emotionally closed off from you.
Avoiding eye contact may indicate a lack of interest in what you're saying, shame over something that was said or done, or feeling distracted or uncommunicative.
Turning the body away during a conversation may suggest that your partner feels disinterested, frustrated, or emotionally closed off.
A loud, aggressive tone might indicate that the conversation has escalated or is about to escalate, and emotions are running high. Your girlfriend may also feel that you're not hearing her or understanding her.
Some body language positions are incidental, so don't ""accuse"" your girlfriend of secretly being upset or closed off. Ask in a caring way by saying something like, ""I noticed your body language seems to suggest that you're upset, but your words are contradicting that. Is something on your mind?""

, Being honest means not lying to or misleading your girlfriend, which should be easy enough. But being open requires you to make yourself vulnerable on some level, which many people struggle with. If being open and honest doesn't come naturally to you, you'll need to work on it with your partner for the sake of your relationship.Open, honest communication is the foundation of a strong relationship. If you cannot be open and honest with one another, you will inevitably encounter problems down the line.
Tell your girlfriend the full truth. Don't hold back or withhold your feelings, because she may be upset if she finds out about it.
If you're struggling with being open, let your partner know about the problem and try to explain the reasons why. If she knows you struggle with it, she can be extra supportive, and may learn to ask you prompting questions or request elaborations.

, Many people are in such a hurry to get all their thoughts/feelings out in the open that they fail to pause and reflect on what's being said. This is true of both speaking your mind in general, as well as speaking in response to something your girlfriend has said.Think carefully about what it is you want to say before you speak.
Be aware of what you're feeling when you talk to your girlfriend.
Speak as clearly and directly as possible.
If you're responding to something your partner said, give her a second to make sure she's finished talking. Then take a brief second to process what she's said and think about how to best articulate your response.

, You should always strive to be as respectful as possible in every conversation you have with your girlfriend. Respect may be an obvious requirement for many people, but it's important to be aware of your words, your tone, the subtext of your conversation, and your body language to always convey mutual respect for one another.Take responsibility for what you say and do during a conversation, even if it escalates to an argument.
You should both fully express your thoughts and feelings, but you need to do so respectfully.
Validate your partner's feelings. Try to understand why your girlfriend feels the way she does, and at the very least respect the fact that she feels that way.Convey a respectful posture. Don't slouch, avoid eye contact, or do other tasks while listening to your girlfriend. Face her and give her your full attention.
Be respectful in any responses you give. Don't interrupt your girlfriend, and never say that she's wrong to feel a certain way.
If there's any kind of misunderstanding between you, don't get mad or upset. Instead, you should calmly ask questions and try to get your girlfriend to clarify what she means.

, When emotions rise, especially during a fight or after you've been hurt somehow, it's easy to slip into declarative statements (such as ""You are a liar and you hurt my feelings.""). But psychologists agree that using ""I"" statements are far more effective and cause less tension. Using an ""I"" statement simply means framing your hurt feelings as a way that you feel, rather than as an accusation or an absolute about your partner.A good ""I"" statement should include the following components:


A statement of emotion (""I feel _____"")
A fair and unemotional description of the behavior causing you to feel the way you feel (""I feel _____ when you ______"")
An explanation of why the behavior or conditions at hand cause you to feel the way you do (""I feel ____ when you _____, because it _________"")

, If you haven't been dating for a long time, or if you are new to sharing your feelings in general, it's best to take things slowly. You should still work on communicating with one another every day, but you and your partner should have a frank conversation about how comfortable you are with divulging your personal thoughts/feelings, and what kind of time frame you might need to get to that point.Don't rush into deep, troubling, or difficult conversations. Let them come naturally when you're both ready to talk about such things.
Don't rush your partner, and don't let her rush you.
Go by what you are both comfortable with, and know that any effort at improving communication will help strengthen your relationship.

, Self-disclosure statements can be very useful in a relationship, especially if you're new to sharing your feelings or talking about deeply personal things. They're a way for you to reveal yourself incrementally but candidly to your partner, with the assumption that she will talk about herself as well.Try building off of the following self-disclosing cues to get started:


I am a person who _____.
One thing I wish people knew about me is _______.
When I try to express intimate feelings, _____________.

, There are many different ways of communicating, and there are no absolute right or wrong methods. However, some methods can be more productive than others for some people, and it may take some experimentation to find a style of communication that works best for both of you.Try being expressive. Let your partner know how you feel, and ask her how she feels.
Use task- or fact-oriented communication. Some people are more comfortable conveying facts instead of emotions, like saying, ""I feel like I'm not making enough money at my job"" instead of saying, ""I'm sad and I'm worried about my finances.""
Be assertive. Assertive communication involves the clear and direct communication of your feelings, opinions, and needs, without infringing on the rights of your partner.
Avoid passive communication. This communication style involves a failure to assert yourself or express your thoughts/feelings/needs, and can be very damaging to the relationship.Minimize emotion before talking about important things. Take a few minutes to calm down before discussing anything significant so that your emotions do not direct the conversation, but make sure you do acknowledge the way you and your partner feel., Small talk is tremendously helpful in any relationship, and it helps build a day-to-day level of communication within your relationship. You can reminisce or laugh about shared experiences, talk about what you each did that day, ask about plans for the weekend, or simply share observations that you find interesting or funny.Small talk about your day-to-day lives helps you and your girlfriend get closer and know each other more intimately.
Ask your girlfriend to elaborate and give more details.
Make sure that your follow-up questions convey a genuine interest in what your girlfriend says and does not come across as suspicious or distrustful.

, Many people with busy lives or different schedules find that the lines of communication get strained in a relationship. This can easily be remedied, though, if both partners make time for communication. Even if you have very hectic lives, it's important that you make some time for open, honest communication, the same way you make time for meals, sleep, or your daily commute.If having a rigid schedule helps you both maintain your day-to-day lives, try scheduling alone time. Set aside some alone time at least once every week to keep a healthy, open line of communication.
Try to limit interruptions when you're talking with your girlfriend. Turn off the TV or radio, and silence/put away your cellphones so you won't be distracted.
Talk to one another while doing day-to-day activities, like while driving in the car or doing chores around the house.
Notice when your girlfriend acts troubled or otherwise seems to have something she wants to talk about. Ask if something is wrong, or if there's anything she'd like to talk about.
Make sure your conversations convey commitment, trust, and intimacy from both of you., You might find that communication doesn't come easily in your relationship, or that the lines of communication have been strained by life events. There is nothing wrong with this, and it does not mean your relationship won't work - it simply means you might need to try a little harder. That's where a professional may be of service.A licensed couples therapist can help you and your girlfriend find ways to be more open and communicative.
You may also work on being more honest, taking more of an interest in one another's lives, and finding more time to spend alone together.
You can find therapists in your area by looking through the phone book, using a search engine online, or by consulting a therapy-based index like Psychology Today has on their website."

, Your family members can be great friends, even if you don't think of them that way. Spend some time hanging out with your parents or siblings, or check in on them as often as you can.

Initiate conversations.,
Pursue your interests with others.,
Find like-minded people online.,
Volunteer.",How to Cope With Having No Friends4," There may be tons of great candidates for friends around you, but you may not know how to approach these people and get connected. Great conversation skills can help you bridge a bond with others and figure out what you have in common. A great rule-of-thumb is that people enjoy talking about themselves and their interests, so look for cues that can help you get them talking.For example, you’re in line at the grocery store and you see a teen in front of you who is playing on their smartphone. You might say, “You seem to be really good at that. What’s the goal of the game?”
Try to ask an open-ended question that requires the person to expound on their answer rather than just replaying “yes” or “no.”

, Even if you don't want to make friends, being around other people can improve your mood and outlook. If you've taken up a sport or hobby, go to club events, sporting meet-ups and competitions. Engage with people at these events to make connections.


Don't be afraid to join a club for something you've never done before, like Improv or bowling. You may meet many other people who are equally inexperienced, and you can bond over that.
Take it slowly if you're hesitant, but allow yourself to connect and potentially click with people who like the same things that you do., Even if you don't find friends in real life in any hurry, you can find many people online who share your thoughts, ideas and dreams. Online friendships are not as intimate as those in real life and usually won't solve loneliness completely. But they are still a good way to feel connected and pass time.Just don't let your online friends keep you from making friends in person, and be careful about meeting up or connecting with any people you meet online.

, Doing things that benefit your neighborhood like community service projects are a great way to meet people. Helping the less fortunate also allows you to step out of yourself and put things into perspective. You'll find that you may be even more grateful for what you have, and will feel more worthy after putting yourself out there and doing meaningful work.Help adults and children learn to read at your local library, volunteer at your local soup kitchen, or help clean up a park in your community.

Identify if your friend is a copycat.,
Rule out that this is a normal part of friendship.,
Get an outside opinion.,
Consider current trends and popular culture as an explanation for your friend’s actions.,

Nurture your friend’s individuality.,
Avoid being passive aggressive.,
Talk to her about specific incidents in which you think she's copying you.,

Keep your inner most thoughts to yourself.,
Mark your creations and your personal style and thoughts as your own.,
Create a social circle independent of your copycat.,
Put some distance between you and your copycat friend.",How to Deal With a Copycat Friend," You don’t want to just plain out accuse your friend of being a copycat. The first thing you need to do is think about her actions, your relationship, and the situation in order to properly identify if your friend is really a copycat. Consider the following:


Does your friend dress the same way as you?
Has your friend incorporated mannerisms like your own?
Does your friend talk like you?
Has your friend ever stolen your ideas and tried to pass them off as their own?
Does your friend like to date the same people as you, or has she tried to steal crushes or romantic interests?;
, Perhaps your friend is not simply copying you, but you are also copying your friend. Often times friends sort of feed off of and influence each other. It might be that you have a reciprocal influence where you are both copying each other to an extent. If this is the case, you might be able to stop mimicking your friend and embrace your own style. She might do the same.

, Find someone you can confide in, maybe a relative, or a very close friend of your own. Avoid involving a friend you both share—this will just put that person in an undesirable situation.


Ask the person to evaluate the situation to see if she agrees that your friend is a copycat.
Your confidant might agree with you, or she might disagree with you.
This will give you more perspective before you take any further steps to deal with the copycat., It might be that while you think you’re very cutting edge and hip, that you are following current trends (you might not be trendy, just avant-garde). Your friend could also be taking the same cues from TV, radio, and other forms of media, and trying to stay cool. It could also be that your friend is taking cues about “coolness” and popular culture from you – you are her barometer for what is currently cool., You could choose to approach your copycat’s actions as a compliment. After all, you are the best judge of how harmful her actions are.


If you think she is just complementing you, then it might be ok.
Consider if her imitation is undermining her own individuality.
Consider if her actions are undermining your own individuality.
Decide how frustrating your friend’s actions really are for you.

, Do what you can to encourage your copycat friend to embrace her own style, taste, and individuality. You can do this several ways:


Compliment her on original things she does.
Talk about her good features.
Ask her about ideas that she comes up with.
In a subtle way, discuss how important it is to be an individual., Don't take out your frustration with your friend instead of actually communicating with her. Dropping hints or challenging her on things she does might just frustrate her. Avoid the following:


Using the tone of your voice to show that you're mad at her.
Being sarcastic in order to show your frustration.
Telling mutual friends that the person is nothing but a copycat.

, If you don’t want to confront her about her overall copycatting, there are some smaller steps you can take to maybe let her know that specific things she does frustrate you or makes you unhappy.


If she's copied your style or the way you dress, mention that you were trying to stand out that day.
If she's talking the way you talk, tell her that you’re trying to be an individual.
If she's trying to steal your ideas in work or school, tell her that you’ve worked really hard and you’d prefer that the work remains your own.
Make sure to do it in a polite, and non-offensive way. Remember, she might not even realize what shes doing.
If she gets overly defensive, back off and reassess the situation.

, Let her know that it either frustrates you or makes you uncomfortable. Make it clear that this a serious problem for you. Talk about your feelings and how her actions upset you.

, If your friend hasn’t really taken any of the cues or suggestions you’ve been dropping along the way, you need to talk to them.


When you’re alone, tell her you’d like to talk about something that concerns you.
Tell her that you feel that her actions are undermining your individuality.
Tell her that it is a good thing for everyone to have their own taste and personality.
Tell her that she's an awesome person and you think she is really cool and smart., If you find your friend is copying the way you dress or other aspects of your personal style, switch things up a little bit. This might show your friend that it’s okay to embrace different styles. Maybe she'll even experiment with different styles on her own., If your friend is wearing the same fashions and hairstyles as you, don't give them the information she needs to continue copying you. This might push her in the direction of developing her own style.


Suggests places and styles that might encourage her to develop her own style.
Be vague about where you get your stuff.
Don't go shopping with your friend.

, If your friend hasn’t really taken other cues from you, hold back a little bit. Don’t share everything that you think and feel. Especially don’t share the things that you think she might try to make her own. This will hopefully encourage her to think for herself and to embrace her own uniqueness and individuality.

, Some of the worst copycats will try to steal your creations and make others think that they are her own. There are a number of things you can do to avoid this problem.


If your copycat is the one who steals your writing and art, sign it and date it.
If your friend copies your room styles and belongings, be creative. If you want to, buy stuff and wear stuff they won’t be able to find. But don’t let this go too far, you don’t want to lose your own unique style.
Announce ideas or anything you’ve produced on social media so that everyone knows who is responsible for them.

, Part of the problem you have with your copycat might be the fact that you share the same social circle. This could lead to a series of problems, including your copycat wanting to date the same people as you or steal your crush. But if you create a social circle independent of your copycat, it will be much harder for her to imitate you and steal your show.


Rely on friends and family from different parts of your town or community to introduce you to a different social group.
If your copycat and you go to the same school, find some friends at another school.
If your copycat tries to steal your crush or wants to date the same people as you, try to find romantic partners from an outside social circle, and avoid introducing them.

, If the situation is really bad, and other steps have failed, you should consider distancing yourself and spending less time with your copycat friend. You might even want to cut her out of your life entirely. But consider the following before you take this extreme measure:


You’ve tried to nurture them and push them toward her own individuality.
You’ve explicitly communicated your frustration with her actions.
She's done little or nothing to remedy her copycatting.
The person’s copycat actions have turned malicious or harmful."

Identify the reasons for your envy.,
Practice what works.,
Change your thinking.,
Practice gratitude.,
Focus on caring for others.,
Accept how things are.",How to Deal when You Are Jealous of Your Friend1," Envy is when you want something that someone else has. Understanding what you are envious of and why can help you better deal with your feelings.


Think about what influences your desire. Are you envious of her hair or her car? Why are you envious of it?
Realize that the reason you are envious of a friend might be because you like something that she has (such as a characteristic or material item).;
, Once you know what makes you envious, try to think of what would make you feel better.This may be different for each person.


For example, if you like someone's hair color, you could try dying your hair too. Just make sure you aren’t completely copying the person and that you make it your own unique style.
If it helps to let it go, then do so. This might mean that you remind yourself of all of the positive items and traits you have instead of focusing on what you don't have.
Continue to try other techniques to cope with your envy. Distancing yourself from the person, focusing on your own responsibilities, or setting positive goals are good examples of helpful coping skills. Read on to identify new ways to cope.

, Understand that just because something looks good on someone else doesn't mean it'll look good on you. You may like someone's haircut, but the style might look wrong depending on your face type. Find something that works for you and nobody else!


Keep a record of your envious thoughts.Come up with reasons why having what that person has will not be good for you.For example, perhaps having the car you want will lead you to driving dangerously or even feeling superior to others.
Realize that a keeping up with the Jones’ mentality, or trying to be like your friends or neighbors, will get you nowhere. Unfortunately, someone will always have something better than you, whether it's a better car, home, or a better phone. Accept this as reality and you might not be as focused on trying to gain what others have, which can lessen your jealousy.

, If you are grateful for what you already have, this thought goes against the feeling of envy. Being grateful can protect against envy and increase positive feelings.You may be less envious if you believe that you already have everything you need. Be thankful for the things you have, material or otherwise.


Focus on the ways you are privileged. For example, the country you grew up in can have a large influence on your way of life.
Make a list of everything you are thankful for such as: family, friends, a roof over your head, medical treatment, and anything else you can think of.
Try making a gratitude journal or creating one online.

, Envy can lead to selfishness, so pay attention to how others are struggling instead of on thinking about yourself and what you are lacking. For example, some parts of the world do not have clean running water, enough food, or the internet.


Helping others in need can help reduce your envy and increase positive mood. Volunteer at a non-profit organization, donate to a good cause, or give food to the needy.

, Let go of what you can’t change. This can help you deal with feeling envy and can increase your overall mental health functioning.If all else fails, try to get over it.


Accept things as they currently are, whether or not they are how you want them to be.
Learn to let things go. If it helps, try visualization. For example, close your eyes and visualize that you are next to a stream with leaves falling and flowing through the water. Place things you want to change (or do not accept) on leaves and watch them float away down the stream. This can help increase your ability to let go of things you can't change.
To increase acceptance you can do a writing exercise to focus on acceptance. For example, you could make a list (either written or in your head) of the things that you think could be better in your life. Instead of focusing on how you can change them, think about how you can accept them. Say to yourself, ""I accept this part of my life. It is fine for the moment and I can deal with it."" This act of proclaiming your acceptance can help you learn to appreciate what you have.

It may be helpful to write down your thoughts and edit the list so you know exactly what you need to say.Remember that it is the behavior that is negative; your friend is not necessarily a bad person. There may be reasons behind the behavior, but it doesn’t change the hurt feelings you feel.;
, While it may be tempting to lash out via a text or make a quick phone call, it is better to have the full attention of the friend in person.


Whether you wind up ending the friendship or coming to an agreement about how it can be fixed, meet face to face unless you are in fear of a physical reaction. If you have even a hint of fear about getting physically hurt, protect yourself and seek help..

, Use “I” statements to minimize defensiveness. You are asking this friend to own the behavior so you need to own how it makes you feel.An “I” statement could be: “I feel scared when I am screamed at, I need you to talk in a normal volume and indoor voice so I can focus on what you are saying.”

, Remind this friend that you like him or her and want to reconnect in a positive way. You can help resolve the mean behavior by offering an example of how you would like to be treated.For example, you might say: “It hurts my feelings when I am laughed at because of the way I talk. Instead of laughing if I make a mistake you can help me fix it. I would appreciate knowing what I can fix about the way I talk.”
Be aware that you can make suggestions, but the friend is the only one who can change the behavior. If he or she is not willing to change, there may not be a friendship worth saving.

, Once you establish a boundary you cannot simply ignore when it is violated. Remember to always call out a specific behavior and not just someone being “rude”. The only way the friend can change assuming he or she wants to is if there is a clear definition of what you find rude when the behavior is happening.

, You are the only one who gets to make this boundary. You do not have to defend your feelings. You have every right to draw the line as far as behaviors you do not like. Drawing boundaries means this is not a negotiation. You expect for your boundaries to be acknowledged and considered.Be sure to make these boundaries known and establish what crosses the line with you. This is the only way you can hold the friend accountable if the boundaries are crossed. Think about what makes you feel disrespected and hurt and compile these behaviors to share with your friends.

, Everyone has a different sense of humor. Your friends may have been being light-hearted, but something that was said or done rubbed you the wrong way. If this behavior makes you feel bad about yourself, you need to speak up.For example, if you do not like this friend laughing at you when you fall down, say “Hey, my falling isn’t funny. Please don’t laugh.”
If you feel uncomfortable with him or her making jokes that go against your own morals like those that are based on race, make it clear you will walk away from that type of joke and do exactly that.

, Regardless of why the friend is being mean, you have every right to feel hurt by the behavior. Minimizing or ignoring your own feelings can put a great deal of stress on your health. You need to attend to your own well-being first.Do not let the friend make light of your feelings and do not try to hide them in order to keep the peace. That is not fair to you or the friend.

, You may need help from another person so do not be afraid to ask for help. Getting support is even more important if you feel afraid for your safety at any time. Do not be afraid to take a gut feeling of fear seriously and seek help immediately.., You also have the right to maintain clear boundaries about what types of negative behaviors are not acceptable to you.Part of setting a boundary is following through with consequences if they are violated. Be clear about what breaking your trust looks like and what will happen afterwards.
You are not being mean if you stand your ground and end a friendship because of this broken trust.

, There are no hard and fast rules as far as how long any friendship lasts. Sometimes, friendships just end for one reason or another. If you seem to have outgrown your friends because they are often engaging in bullying or immature behavior, you may choose to distance yourself.The biggest part of self-care is taking ownership of your happiness. There is no friend that is more important than your own happiness and security.
Learn to tap into your own measure of stress and see what patterns cause you the most stress. If there is a friend at the center of much of the stress, move on., This may be another friend, a coworker or even your parents. Explain to this person what’s been going on and ask for his or her sincere advice.


You might say “Hey, Mom. Were you ever friends with someone who sort of picked on you?...What did you do?”

, Recognize friendships that have changed into challenging and draining battles. Use strong personal boundaries to step away from those negative relationships and spend time with people who are supportive and value what you bring to the table."

Take ownership of your feelings.,
Set positive goals.,
Avoid negative ways of coping.",How to Deal when You Are Jealous of Your Friend2," Avoid a victim mentality. Believing you are a victim can lead to increases in negative mood states such as jealousy, anger, and resentment.Know that you can work toward controlling your emotions. You are not a passive participant in your emotional state. If you are jealous or envious you can learn to cope. Remind yourself of this fact and that you can distract yourself, set goals, process your feelings or work toward another positive coping strategy.
Understand that no one can make you feel a certain way. How you choose to react or behave is yours to own.
Empower yourself by using positive self-talk and saying or thinking to yourself, ""I am in control of how I react to this. I can cope with this and choose a healthy option.""

, Use your envy and jealousy as information on what you want to achieve. This can help reduce your negative emotions by replacing them with hope for future change.


If you are envious over something substantial, such as intelligence or a personality trait, think how you could be more like that person. Perhaps you could read books on a particular subject or learn how to be more outgoing.
For example, if you want to seem smarter in school, study or do extra work.
If you like that someone is outgoing, try starting conversations at parties or meetings.

, Some people may resort to negative ways of coping, such as spying on others, being aggressive, or engaging in risky situations, in order to try to reduce jealousy or envy. However, these options pose a threat to relationships and cause even cause legal ramifications.


Avoid social media if you are feeling envious or jealous. Looking at other people happy, on extravagant vacations, with pictures of their expensive meals can increase your envy overall. Looking at Facebook can also increase your jealousy of people that interact with your romantic partner.Avoid aggressive behaviors. Jealousy can lead to acts of aggression against others.Don’t bully others. Cyber-bullying has become more of an issue with the extensive role technology now plays in everyday life.Limit alcohol and avoid drugs. These substances can cause you to lose your inhibition and make poor decisions.
Avoid being too clingy on your partner if you are jealous.This can turn him off.

"
"
Embrace your unique qualities.,
Keep your own views.,
Try not to be a copy-cat.",How to Deal when You Are Jealous of Your Friend3," Jealousy can threaten your sense of self.Jealousy can sometimes occur because you have thoughts that someone will figuratively steal your loved one (friend, family member, romantic partner). Envy may happen if you believe that you are not good enough because you do not have certain characteristics or items. Both jealousy and envy come from feelings of insecurity.Increasing your sense of self-esteem can help protect you against both negative emotions.Make a list of everything you like about yourself. For example this might include: brown eyes, tall, funny, spontaneous, compassionate, and lively.
Use positive self-talk. Remind yourself how you are unique by saying something like, “I like who I am. I like that I am fun and spontaneous. I am good enough for myself. I don’t need to change to feel good about myself.”
Be proud of yourself and your accomplishments.Make a list of your positive achievements.

, Sometimes people change the way they think or act in order to fit in with someone else or a group of people.However, this can lead to difficulties in being authentic. Don’t alter your views or thoughts to match someone else.


One way to make sure you maintain your own values is to first understand what your views and values are. You can identify your values by thinking about what is important in life. For example, some of your personal values might be: honesty, integrity, love, family, friendship, health, and fitness.
If you feel like you are going against your values, ask yourself, ""Am I in line with my values?"" If the answer is no, make a change to make sure you do not compromise your morals or intentions. Stick to your guns and say no to others when you need to. For example, if you are envious that someone is popular because she uses alcohol or drugs, remind yourself that these actions go against your personal values. Say, ""No thanks, I'm not into that,"" if you are pressured to do something you don't want to do.

, It is okay to like someone's clothing, but you shouldn't buy exactly the same stuff.


Think of what makes you envious. Is it the color? Is it the style?
In this example, you can buy similar clothing but make sure it reflects your own personality and style.
Whenever you feel the urge to copy someone in order to fit in, remind yourself that it is better to be yourself and to stand out. Be creative.

Don’t compromise your personal values for friendships.",How to Cope With Friends Who Turn Against You," It hurts to have someone turn against you or to find out someone you thought was a close friend may not really be who you thought. It's normal to be upset and there is no need to hide the fact that you are hurt.Acknowledge the pain by stating it aloud. Name the emotion that you are feeling and own your reaction to it. ""I am disappointed because I placed my trust in someone who backstabbed me.""
While you can acknowledge the feelings, remember you are the only one who controls how you react to this disloyalty. In some cases, this person may be treating you a certain way with the hope that you will react in a big way. It is far better to take a step back and reflect on how you are feeling, instead of acting out in the moment.;
, Just as some romantic relationships benefit from a break, friendships can also benefit from time apart. Take this break to think about any major choices like confronting the friends or completely ending the friendships. You may find that you calm down after a few days, or you may find that during the break you actually feel better without the friends.


You can also use this time to consider opening yourself to making some new friends who are more supportive. Spend time with a few other acquaintances, classmates, or coworkers. Do you notice yourself liking being with these people over your other friends? Do you notice good qualities in these people that your other friends lack?
Another way to engage in reflection is to journal. Writing down the experience and your thoughts and feelings associated with it can be incredibly freeing and empowering.You can even brainstorm ideas as to how you want to deal with the aftermath of a friend's betrayal.

, Before you can even think about rebuilding trust with your friends, you have to first take care of you. We often put our own feelings on the back burner to avoid feeling bad ourselves or to avoid making others feel bad about their actions against us. Denying yourself time to care for your own needs does not lend itself to creating long-term, healthy friendships.Forgive yourself for taking a chance on the friendship and to have whatever feelings you had in the moment after you found out about the betrayal. When someone steals from you or goes behind your back to do something it is easy to beat yourself up over letting anyone have the chance to use you.
Treat yourself kindly during this time. Do things you like to do—whether that is binge-watching your favorite TV series, getting a manicure, or spending time with family.

, Don’t entertain urges to get revenge or hold grudges. Try to forgive those that do you wrong, if only so you don’t have to carry the burden of anger. You may feel like you are letting the other person off too easy if you let go of the anger and move on. This is not the case. Holding onto the anger hurts you first and foremost. In many cases, the person you are angry with has already moved on. You take back your power by being the bigger person and not reacting in a vengeful way.Keep in mind that you can't control what other people do or say about you. Getting angry and nasty will not make you have any more control than you have now. And in the end, if your actions are not in line with your character or beliefs, you will likely feel ashamed or guilty for have acted outside your values.
For example, if a friend or classmate is spreading rumors about you, you can choose to not make the situation uglier by doing the same. Step back and come up with a less vindictive manner to handle the situation instead.
The old saying “fight fire with fire” really makes little sense in reality. You normally fight fire with water or something else that puts out the fire, right? Don't fuel the fire with attention or your own negative actions because all that happens then is a much bigger fire.

, It can be extremely comforting after betrayal to surround yourself with positive people who want nothing but the best for you. This not only helps you process and cope with a betrayal, but it also reaffirms your value as a person and a friend.For example, if one friend let you down, be sure to cherish your other friends who have consistently been loyal to you. Let these people know how much you appreciate them.

, When a friend who knows you well turns against you, it may affect your personal, social, or career standing. Depending on how much of an impact the rumor or betrayal may have had, you must decide if it’s better to ignore it or address the issue.

If the problem is simply with the one friend involving a minor issue, it's probably pretty safe to just ignore the friend. On the other hand, if your job is at risk or there are allegations that go beyond a small rumor that will blow over, you may need to take other steps to prevent the situation from getting worse.
Is everyone talking about the issue? Are there legal ramifications? How many people are aware of what happened? Asking these questions can help you discover the scope of the problem.
It may be helpful to talk with an unbiased party about what you can do to resolve this issue. In the end, you must trust your own judgment about how to handle it, but getting some sound advice could be beneficial.

, If the friend who turned against you spread rumors or bad-mouthed you to others, try to do what you can to counteract those negative perceptions of you.You can try defending yourself or approaching certain people and trying to explain your side of the story with something like ""Those rumors are not true..."" Be aware, though, that there is always a chance people won’t want to listen.
Actions speak louder than words and may help you to repair your reputation much faster. Instead of wasting time trying to talk your way out of a rumor, use positive actions to show those around you the rumors are simply not true. If people called you a cheater, try to be transparent about your everyday operations to shut down the rumors.

, There are going to be times when you need to say something and there are going to be times where you can just let whatever happened go. Use your judgment of your friend and the situation to determine if a response is necessary.Think about the positive and negative consequences of confronting someone who hurt you. If you just drop the person as a friend, you will never have a chance to hear his side of the story and potentially clear up what may be a simple misunderstanding. You will also have the opportunity to express how you feel. On the other hand, the person may become verbally abusive or combative, leading to more hurt feelings.
If whatever happened between you and your friend seems out of character for him, this might be a time to practice some compassion and just let things go. This will be even truer if you know the friend is going through something and may have turned against you out of desperation.
If you do decide to address the issue, say something like “I heard you told our boss I cheated on the project. I’m really hurt by these accusations. I did my part fair and square. I'd like to know why you said those things.”

, This process is usually tied to balancing how much value you place in the relationship and what actually occurred. You may need to take a close look at this friendship and see if it’s worth fighting for. If the friend is not someone you consider to be close, it might be less stressful to walk away. If, on the other hand, this is a friendship you value, find a way to address the issue in a constructive yet firm way.Even if this is a friendship you really value, there may be actions so unforgivable that the friendship will not recover. Before you take matters into your own hands, you must be absolutely sure the friend is responsible. Gather evidence that supports your findings before deciding to end the friendship. For example, if there is talk that your best friend is involved with your significant other, you would want to be almost 100% sure before making an accusation.

, Make recommendations for how the person can prove her loyalty again. Take a step back and look at what caused your friend to turn on you. Was a friend at work feeling jealous of your accomplishments so she lied about the credit for your work? Take this as a compliment and create an opportunity for the friend to come clean and acknowledge your work.Let your friend know that you do not take forgiveness lightly. Say something like ""I forgive you and want to move on from this situation. But, I want you to know that you really hurt me and I may not be able to continue the friendship if this happens again.""

Set clear boundaries with your friend so he or she understands why you are putting whatever happened behind you. She should know that going forward you expect total loyalty so there is no opportunity to let it happen again. For example, if this was a work project, going forward use a new system of dividing up the work so each team member clearly has his or her own “part”. If the issue came up at home, change the level of access this friend has to your home so there isn't a way for this to happen again.

, Strive to be a better friend so you attract more loyal friends. Look at the healthy friendships you have mutually enjoyed and learn from those. Learn to be a better you by not allowing yourself to get caught up in drama at work or at home. Let go of unhealthy relationships.Do not get caught up in a toxic circle of doing negative things because others do them. You will not find friends that are trustworthy if they cannot trust you. When you say you’ll do something, do it. If you make plans with others, follow through with them. Doing small deeds can go a long way to helping you build trustworthiness.

, The only thing you have absolute control over is you. You get to decide how you react to certain people and who gets space in your life. You do not have to remain friends or even friendly with someone just because you were friends since you were kids or you happen to work in the same office.If you find work friends are harder to trust because of competition at work, make clear boundaries about not bringing work home. You do not have to be friends or social with co-workers if it is only leading to problems at work.
The same goes for friendships you make in other settings. Are these people positive influences? Are they using you? Look at the types of friends you have and the kind of friendship obstacles you encounter. Maybe it’s a good idea to reevaluate all your friendships to see if you are making smart, healthy choices in your relationships.

, This includes hiding things about yourself or family just to keep certain friends. You may find friends act differently in certain contexts and that you cannot always depend on certain friends to be consistent. If you lose a friendship because you need to focus on family, then it wasn't a healthy relationship to begin with.This also includes ignoring the actions of a friend in the name of friendship. You have the right to stand up for your beliefs. In addition, you should not be pressured to look the other way if a friend does something you feel is wrong or violates the law.

Put yourself out there.,
Decide if your expectations are realistic.,
Show appreciation.,
Pay attention to your partner.,
Have fun together.",How to Develop New Relationships1," If you are looking to meet a romantic partner, you can increase your chances of finding a good match by being more social. Saying ""yes"" to party invites, signing up for a class, or attending community events may help you meet other singles.Challenge yourself to try new things like salsa dancing or wine tasting. But, don't go too far out of your comfort zone, if you won't be able to keep it up. For instance, if you're not much for the party scene, it may not be a good idea to search for mates in clubs. Try out activities you are actually interested in.
As you start this process, try to identify some of the qualities you like about yourself and that you would also like in a partner. Be on the lookout for these qualities when you go on dates and when you meet new people. Pay special attention to how the person treats their family and friends as well because this can give you insight into how they might treat you.;
, Once you're dating someone, discuss your relationship. You may have an idea of what your ideal romantic relationship is. However, when it comes down to it, it may not be very realistic. Expecting someone to meet needs that are outlandish can result in disappointment and heartache.


Talk to your partner about whether or not the expectations you have are attainable. Being open about what you need and expect—and their ability to meet those needs—can prevent confusion and misinterpretation., One of the biggest obstacles couples face is feeling like they are unappreciated. One may feel like they are putting a large amount of effort into the relationship while the other one is just sailing through.


Prevent this from happening by taking the time to tell your partner you appreciate their efforts. For instance, you could say, “Thank you for making dinner tonight. I know you’re busy and I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.” Little things like a “thank you” can have a huge impact on the relationship., It seems like people are constantly trying to occupy themselves these days. You are more likely to find someone looking at a phone at a restaurant than actually talking to the people they are dining out with. Your partner may feel slighted if this happens with you. Stop this by making a conscious effort to put the phone and other distractions away when you are with them.


For instance, you can make a “no technology” rule when you are spending time together. You can turn off your phones or other gadgets and decide that you’re not going to turn them back on until you are apart. This gives you plenty of time to listen to what the other person has to say and to give them your full attention., Just because you want a serious relationship, it doesn’t mean you have to be serious all of the time. Laughing, joking, and having fun together can make your bond stronger. It can also give you something to look forward to.


Set aside a time once a week to engage in a fun activity together. You could go to a comedy show, play a sport together, or simply watch a funny movie. You’ll find that you’re happier in your relationship if you are able to lighten up."

Present these facts to your friend, pointing out how much this has cost you so far and over what period of time. Tell your friend that you need to get the money back now as you owe money for X bill or a payment on something etc. Provide facts and back up with your pressing need.;
, When you go out with your constantly begging friend, start refusing to pay the entry fee, for drinks, for a cinema ticket, for the meal. Warn your friend in advance that you are only paying for yourself. You can ease it by saying you can't afford it this time (likely this is true anyway) and that you only have enough money for yourself.

, You might feel like a Grinch and a little mean but you're going to be even grouchier if this money scamming keeps going on and you end up paying for everything. Look it as a favour to your friend; until your friend learns to stand on their own two feet and pay their own way, they are not going to learn the true value of things and what the real cost is in having money (e.g., hours at work, commitment to saving etc.). Tell your friend is becoming a real strain on your own finances and that their constant need for you to give them money or cover their expenses is making you feel obliged rather than part of an unconditional friendship.

, If your friend lacks understanding and gets angry or whines about your requests, and doesn't stop pestering you, it might be time to reconsider your friendship. A friend who always needs money will always be a friend; is this friend truly one or not is the question you should be asking yourself and putting to the test.

Ask your partner questions, rather than making assumptions.",How to Form a Strong Bond in Your Relationship," A lot of times we fail to ask how our partner is because we often times so wrapped up in ourselves that we neglect each other. When you notice any differences in your partner's behavior, ask how they are; are they happy, tired, etc.? Relationships provide countless opportunities to learn from and encourage each other, and this ability will increase with time and intimacy.;
, Openness is crucial to a relationship; building emotional walls will weaken a relationship and shut your partner out of important aspects of your life. It’s important to be emotionally vulnerable with your partner; be honest, share your sincere feeling, hopes, and concerns.You should also expect the same level of openness and vulnerability from your partner. You can start a vulnerable conversation by saying something like:


“I’ve been having a hard time at my job lately; can I talk to you about it?”
“I’m worried about a direction that our relationship is taking. Can I talk to you about us?”
“I haven’t been very happy lately; it’s a struggle to get through the day & I’m concerned about it. Do you mind if I open up to you about this?”

, Rather than idealizing your partner or holding them to unrealistic standards, enjoy and respect them for the human they actually are.

Every person has flaws and strengths, and it is important to understand and accept all the parts of your partner’s personality., Treat your partner with the same patience and respect that you would like to be treated with, and forgive them when they offend you. Holding grudges and records of offense will only create suspicion and mistrust in your relationship.

, Although healthy physicality in a relationship will often include sexuality (which should develop in a way comfortable and fun for both partners), physical contact can be much more than sexual acts. Even the slightest physical touch can show affection and dedication, and makes a relationship feel fresh and exciting. You can try some simple ideas like these:


Hold your partner's hand.
Put your arm through theirs when you're walking together.
Rest your head on their shoulder when watching a movie.
Make direct eye contact while you're talking with your partner.

, Don't waste each other's energy on the things that don't matter. It’s easy to let the day-to-day concerns (which are part of any relationship) drown out the pleasurable, fun parts of being together; they can even detract from your commitment to the relationship. Maintain your relationship health by focusing on long-term goals and permanent aspects of your relationship, like:


Things that first attracted you to your partner.
Fun activities that you and your partner have done together.
Long-term goals and plans for your future.
Ways you and your partner have grown closer, and ways you can continue to grow closer.

, Don’t strive for an idealized relationship—based off of romantic films, novels, love songs, etc.—or expect your partner to be perfect or more than human.Show one another grace and forgiveness when your partner makes a mistake or annoys you, and expect the same treatment from your partner.

, One of the most important aspects of any relationship is to take plenty of time to genuinely understand who your partner is as a person. Often relationships start on a superficial level; they can be spurred by a common interest, a random meeting at a bar, or a common friend. To maintain and strengthen the bond of your relationship, you need to understand your partner on a deeper, more personal level. Continue to ask and learn more about their deep-seated beliefs, desires, and plans for the future.This will also allow you and your partner to grow and develop together as a couple. Try activities like:


Ask your partner about their childhood. You could say, “What are some of your favorite memories from growing up?”
Share thoughts about your family with your partner, and ask about theirs. Try asking, “What are some of the things about your family that make you the most happy? What about them makes you the least happy?”
Tactfully ask your partner about their political and religious beliefs—and be prepared to share yours, as well.

, In any relationship, people will make mistakes and occasionally annoy one another. When these situations arise—which they inevitably will—be patient with your partner; give them space to make mistakes and grow from them.


Rather than jumping in with an angry response, try saying, “What you said yesterday hurt me, but I’d like to hear your side before I jump to a conclusion.”
You could also say, “You may not realize that you offended me; I’d like to explain why I feel the way I do.”

, Communicating often is the best, and most necessary, way to maintain a strong, deep connection in a relationship.Check in with your partner about their needs, and make sure that your personal needs are known as well. Discussions and conversations can include:


Ask about your partner’s day. You could try saying, “Did anything interesting happen at work today?” or “Did anything happen today that you’d like to talk about?”
Share a story or something that happened to you.
Flirt—even years into a relationship!
Find out something new about your partner.
Make your partner laugh; keep it light sometimes. Try telling a joke or being silly with your partner.

, A great way to do this is by taking time to understand your partner’s plans, ambitions, and goals, and finding ways to encourage them. Supporting your partner in their plans and goals will help you understand them better as a person, and will bolster their emotions.A relationships partner is often the first place that people look to for emotional and personal support; let your partner rely on you to encourage them, and look to them for support as well.

, Acts of kindness do not need to be grand romantic gestures; they don’t need to be expensive, or particularly unique. Rather, focus on small, meaningful, intimate acts that will show your partner you’re thinking about them and that you care about them throughout the day.

Acts of kindness can include:

Buying your partner flowers or chocolate.
Sending your partner love notes—or love emails, texts, etc.
Do a household chore for your partner.
Make your partner breakfast in bed.

, If your partner is behaving or speaking in a way that bothers or confuses you, do not leap to a conclusion about what their actions mean. Instead, ask them—directly but politely—about whatever is concerning you.

This will help you better understand how your partner works emotionally, and increase intimacy and trust in the relationship."

Get to know each other.,
Discuss your expectations.,
Set up a roommate contract.,
Create a chart on a whiteboard or chalkboard that lists rules and guidelines.,
Create designated spaces.",How to Live with a College Roommate Who Is Your Total Opposite1," If you decide from the very first time you meet that you’re too different to possibly like each other, you will certainly set yourself up for a miserable situation. You don’t have to be best friends, but getting to know one another will help you at least establish friendly conversations.


Figure out what you have in common. You might be total opposites on most things, but you will have at least one thing in common. Find out what it is and embrace it. Whether it’s a hobby, or a movie, or a shared love of a particular food, try to do it together every now and then.
Accept your roommate as is. If you are total opposites, it may be difficult to understand where they are coming from in many situations. If you accept things about their personality, interests, taste, etc. you are much less likely to come into conflict. Laugh and admit any quirks you have, and learn about your roommate’s.;
, Be clear about what what you both expect from each other. This is the time to discuss your needs and compromise on what you’re willing and not willing to contribute. Don’t make any assumptions about what is considered a “normal” or correct way to do things. Discuss your definitions of “clean.” This can go a long way to prevent future arguments and misunderstandings. You might clean the kitchen, only to discover your roommate upset because you didn’t clean under the stove burners.
Discuss your general outlook on dorm life or apartment living. If you are expecting a 24 hour party, it may come as a shock to find that your roommate expects peaceful, quiet solitude. This is something you’ll need to discuss up front.
Be flexible and open to change. If this is your first experience living with someone else, it may be a culture shock as you adjust to the habits of someone new. Treat it like an adventure into a new country where everyone speaks a different language and has different customs.

, Make a set of rules to address a few core issues that might come up during the coming year. This will give you a chance to talk, laugh, and discuss all the nit-picky items of sharing a home. Decide if you will pool resources and share groceries, or if you will have separate food items. You could shop for groceries together once a week, or take turns replenishing staple items such as milk, bread, and cereal. If you have a specialty item, write your name on it so your roommate knows not to touch it.
Discuss how you will handle overnight guests. If you are sharing a dorm room, reate a system to indicate when you need privacy, such as the classic sock on the doorknob, or a symbol written on a whiteboard on the outside of the door.
Establish an agreement on quiet times lights-out times. If you are early to bed and your roommate likes to stay up late, come to a compromise. Perhaps agree to an earlier time during the week and a later time during the weekend.

, This will ensure that you each know how to be a good roommate, and eliminate any future conflicts regarding the rules. Make a list of bills and due dates. Decide who will be responsible for which bills and how each roommate should contribute.
List recurring chores, as well as how often they should be performed and who will do them. Decide who will wash the dishes and how often, who will clean out the dishwasher, who will take out the garbage, and how often the floors should be cleaned.
Leave a space on the board for notes so that you can let each other know in advance if you’ll be out of town, if you’re expecting guests, or if grocery items are needed.

, Decide early on which spaces will be common areas, such as a living room, kitchen, and bathroom, and which spaces will be private. Agree to protect each other’s privacy; make it a point to ask each other’s permission before entering private spaces or borrowing items. Discuss rules or guidelines for how any common areas will be used and maintained. "

Decide if the event was a one off or if you would like it to lead to more or, unfortunately, if your friend took advantage of you when you were compromised in some way.,
Decide if you wish to continue your friendship in just the same way as it was before you had sex.,
Try to get over the awkwardness that is going to occur the first time to meet up again after sex.,
Talk about becoming more than friends if you think that what suit you both.,
Reach a decision about whether either of you want it to happen again without getting into a relationship.,
Think about the possibilities.,
Keep up with other activities.,
Try not to let the fact you had sex ruin your friendship.,
Consider avoiding alcohol, recreational drugs use and any other behaviors that may lead to the pair of you hopping into the sack again.,
Let time take it's course.",How to Maintain a Friendship After Sex,";
, It will be difficult, letting your friend know you are sexually attracted to them will almost certainly alter your friendship. If you were both totally hammered or stoned you could just both pretend it never happened?

, Remember why you and your friend became such good pals to begin with. Talk about the fact you had sex and be honest with one another about why it happened. If the sex wasn't very good, be careful about discussing this. You might hurt your friend's feelings. If you both thought it was rubbish, that could be a good way to realize you're destined to be best friends and not lovers.

, Sometimes, friends make the best lovers and vise versa. There might be more to this friendship than you think.

, Make sure you're both, ""on the same page"". If he or she isn't, then immediately stop the sex before things get more complicated. If you both want to go the Friends with Benefits route, it might be a good idea to talk about what will happen if either of you meet someone you want to have a sexual relationship with. Also think about what you'll say to other friends and family. If you are sleeping together, do you want to be treated as a couple or are you happy to make sure everyone else thinks and / or acts like you are just friends.

, Your other friends may think the you'll be okay having sex with them. Your friend would probably be happy so see you flirting with another person you are attracted to, the person you are sleeping with may not. One of you may have stronger feelings than the other. Don't string along a person who's hoping eventually you'll fall in love with them when for you it was just a sh*g, even if it means you'll have to give up your friendship.

, There is more to your friendship than sex. You probably liked to go bowling, talk and text on the phone, gossip, hang out, etc. Keeping your minds focused on other activities will always remind you that you are friends no matter what else has happened.

, Sex itself doesn't ruin friendships. The lack of communication and admission of feelings ruins the friendship. Face the facts and accept that you just had sex with your friend. Sex is a normal activity among all living creatures. Just stop having it with each other, change your relationship, or carry on as before.

, If you're committed to putting it behind you and maintaining the friendship like it was before, don't put temptation in your path.

, You'll never know what will happen. You two can end up in a relationship, you two can just carry on a friendship, but this one (or few) encounters will blow over and just become a thing of the past if you want it to be. You two obviously care about each other and that is what's the most important about maintaining a successful friendship.

Place your trust in friends.,
Plan nights out on the town.,
Accept invitations.,
Join hobby-focused clubs.,
Take classes to learn something new.,
Volunteer your time.",How to Live a Good Life Without Good Family1," After you’ve been hurt by those close to you it is important to recognize that other people out there do have positive, good traits. Take a moment and think about times that people have been there for you. Maybe write these down and revisit them to start to restore trust in people. Then, look for friends who share your common interests and who will support you in achieving your life goals.It is okay to tell your friends, after you get to know them a bit, that you are wary about trusting people. And, if your friends or significant other ask to meet your relatives you might just say, “I’m not sure if that is a good idea and when we have more time I will tell you why.”
If you live at home with family, make plans to meet your friends elsewhere. This will keep some distance between the two groups as well. Or, you can always just chat with your friends online and blow off some steam that way too.;
, Go have fun doing new activities as a group. These experiences will bond you all together and will give you more things to talk about in your down time. If your friends are busy, feel free to go out to dinner or a movie yourself. Enjoying one’s own company is important as well.


If you came from a large family and are used to being surrounded by people it may be a good idea to force yourself to do some activities solo. This will build your confidence and demonstrate that you can handle almost anything on your own.
Plan some one-on-one or small-group activities as well, such as meeting a friend for coffee or going for a walk together. These activities are quieter and more focused on conversation. This can help build and strengthen relationships by promoting sharing and helping you assess if this is someone you can trust.

, If a friend asks you to do an activity or take a class with them, just say yes. Showing that you are available for the good times will make them more likely to confide in you when situations are difficult as well. Also, saying yes will help you stay on their radar as someone to call when they want to hang out or do something fun. Reinforce them reaching out to you by saying yes. If you can't make it, be sure to reschedule the activity (or another activity) in the same conversation to let them know you mean it. And, this means that you may be able to rely on them as a confidante and emotional resource as well.Be sure to reciprocate. If you are invited out, try to find some way that you can issue an invitation to that person as well. Maybe invite them to try out a new restaurant with you. Or, perhaps go on a shopping adventure together. Staying busy will keep your mind off of your family situation.

, If you live with your family and are in school, participating in clubs will give you an excuse to spend some positive time away from home. And, once you are out of school, it is up to you to find ways to socialize and expand your social circle beyond your family. Look online for groups of people in your area who get together to pursue common interests or hobbies.For example, if you love horses, consider joining a riding group at a local stable. Or, contact your local recreation center to ask about adult intramural sports teams. These types of activities can occupy those evening and weekend hours outside of work.
You can also join a local church group for extra support. This has the added benefit of providing a safe space for personal contemplation as well.

, It has long been known that performing a new task keeps your brain lively and engaged. However, it also benefits your emotional well-being by boosting your confidence and problem-solving abilities. Look online for various adult or senior classes being offered in your area. Or, if you are a young adult, consider taking rec classes specifically offered for teens or youths.Enrolling in an athletic class, such as yoga, also has the added benefit of helping your body to stay fit and active. Asking for help from more experienced class members is yet another way to expand your social circle beyond family.
If you don’t think your family will support your new adventures, don’t tell them. You are quite vulnerable when trying something new and you need to hear positive, uplifting comments.
If you are young and currently live with your family, you may need to get a part-time job to cover the cost of some of these extra social experiences. This can actually be a good thing. A job can help to give you some space and time away from your family, and you can make friends with your coworkers!

, This will help you to see that everyone, at one time or another, faces difficult circumstances. You may also find a new passion while volunteering, such as cooking or painting. For volunteer opportunities in your area search online and then contact the agencies directly for additional information.Be aware that volunteering with certain groups, such as persons affected by family violence, may hit too close to home for you at this point. Instead, look for a volunteering activity that will uplift your mood while also allowing you to help.

Be approachable to new friends.,
Expand your horizons.,
Focus on the other person.,
Commit to the relationship.,
Show respect.,
Show support.",How to Develop New Relationships2," If you are trying to hit it off with new people, make yourself more approachable. Go out more to where others who share your interests hang. Smile at people when you meet their eyes, and try to strike up a conversation. Act interested in people and you will come off as more friendly.Another way to ensure that you are approachable is your body language. Don't cross your arms and lean against the wall at the back of an event. Relax your arms at your side, smile, and walk around to meet others.
Continue to be approachable after the first meeting. If you meet someone new, send them a friendly email or text the following day and suggest another outing or an event you might attend together.

, Don’t limit yourself to just people who share your interests. Try to go outside of your comfort zone now and then and meet someone who does not exactly fit your idea of what you want in a friend. This will give you the opportunity to meet someone who you might really click with despite your differences.

For example, your older neighbor may have some amazing stories and recipes to share with you.
Or if you are quiet and reserved, you might meet someone who is a bit more outgoing. Being around this person may even cause you to let loose once in a while.

, Not many people want to be friends with someone who only thinks of themselves. Show the friend that you are interested in them and their life by asking questions and showing up. They’ll likely appreciate the time and effort you’ve put into the friendship when you do this.


For example, you can ask them their opinions about different topics, allow them to decide where you are going to hang out, and ask them about previous life experiences. You can learn a lot about your friend this way, and they will likely appreciate the interest., Friendships last when the people involved actually spend time with one another. You’ve likely noticed that friendships end when the people in them drift apart. Staying in contact can make your relationship strong.


For instance, you can remind yourself to call or text the person daily or every other day to stay current with what is going on in their life. You can also commit to having lunch together once a week or engaging in some other activity together on a regular basis. , It’s possible to have friendships with people who don’t have the same values you do. The key to this, however, is respecting each other, no matter what. Sure, you can have a difference of opinion about something, but never go below the belt when this happens. Staying respectful can keep your friendship intact.


If you’re afraid you’re about to have a fight or disagreement over a certain topic and don’t think it will end well, speak up. Say, “I value your friendship and I’m worried that if we continue this conversation, we may hurt each other’s feelings, and I don’t want that to happen.”Make sure to listen carefully to the person and validate any concerns that they have. Don’t judge them for what they share or for who they are.

, Friendships that last usually do so because the people involved feel safe. They don’t think they will be judged or criticized by their friend when they show weakness or make a mistake. Stand behind your friend and offer encouragement and support when they need it.


For instance, avoid telling your friend how stupid they were because they let something bad happen or don’t judge them for choices they made in the past. No one is perfect, including you. Remember this when your friend is in their time of need."

Participate in professional organizations.,
Do your research.,
Be respectful.,
Respond in a timely manner.,
Volunteer without being asked.",How to Develop New Relationships3," If you are looking to expand your professional network, one way to do this is by joining local clubs and organizations. You might sign up for a professional association in your industry or simply participate in a local Meetup for professionals or small business owners.When you join, make a commitment to attend the meetings and events. Ask open-ended questions to show that you are interested in the group and its members.

, Clients and potential business partners are impressed when they see you’ve spent time learning about them. This relationship will likely become successful and last if you put in the effort into keeping updated about what is going on with their companies. Check in often and perform research to show this person that you are invested in the relationship.


Making yourself aware of the new partner’s business also gives you something to talk about and can help you understand each other better. Researching also helps you understand what this person needs, which you can both benefit from professionally., It is important to respect yourself and the other person to create an effective business relationship. Make sure to show trust and respect to your customers, other business owners, employees, and investors.

Make sure to listen closely to them so that you will better understand their needs, ideas, and how they function.
Validate their concerns and acknowledge areas of interest or excitement to them.
Let them know that they are doing everything they can and avoid judging them for any issues that may arise.

, People want what they want, and they want it now. Your potential new business connection may find they can get what they need faster from someone else unless you follow up with their requests quickly. Putting in that little bit of effort can make all the difference in the relationship and your business., Business relationships are all about dependability. Work partners want to know that you will be there and can anticipate their needs. Do this by going the extra mile, especially when you aren’t asked. This shows that you are dependable and are able to determine what is needed without being told.


Pay close attention to your relationship and the other person’s business. Doing so allows you to see a problem before you are told about it. As such, you can volunteer to help without being asked first."
"
Talk about problems as soon as they come up.,
Have a plan.,
Take advantage of mediation resources.",How to Live with a College Roommate Who Is Your Total Opposite2," Don't assume that your roommate can read your mind. Nothing can change unless you acknowledge it. It's possible that your roommate may not even be aware of the problem. Discuss any issues with your roommate in person and directly—no texts or emails, and don’t bring it up through a friend of a friend. Don't be afraid to speak your mind. If something's bugging you, your roommate deserves to know.
Bring up behavior, not personality. It's not reasonable to ask people to change who they are, but you can ask them to tone down behaviors that are making life difficult for you. For example, it would be unfair to criticize someone for being ""perky,"" but you can ask someone not to talk so much while you're studying.
Focus on one pet peeve at a time. There are probably tons of things your roommate does that get on your nerves. Don’t nag your roommate about every little thing that aggravates you—only bring it up if it’s really bothering you. Invite your roommate to discuss any pet peeves with you.

, When you are preparing to discuss your problem with your roommate, thinking through what you need to say and considering how you'll say it will prevent you from getting flustered and forgetting what you wanted to say, especially if you struggle with standing up for yourself.


Start by asking, “Can we talk?” This will usually get a person’s undivided attention. Give your roommate the option to set the conversation up at a later time and place, so that she doesn't feel cornered and immediately get defensive.
Write down a list of the things you plan to bring up, as well as a few examples. This will help you stay on track with your point, and will also make you prepared to answer any questions your roommate may have. If your complaint is that your roommate leaves dirty dishes around, be prepared to give examples of when this occurred. Examples will help her to see your point.
Be positive and kind, and be patient. Don't make the situation bigger than it is. It is hard to hear that you’re doing something that’s bothering someone, so your roommate may be hurt, surprised, or even angry to hear the news. Soften the criticism by speaking kind words. Tell your roommate anything that she is doing right, so she doesn’t feel like she's doing everything wrong. This will also help you see the good in your roommate even when you are exceptionally agitated. For instance, you might say, ""Hey, I appreciate how much effort you put into keeping the kitchen clean. But it really bothers me that you never take out the garbage.""

, If you live in a college dorm, contact your RA. Roommate conflicts are common, and your residence hall staff members are trained in how to help you through conflicts. Sometimes simply having someone to mediate the conversation and help you take turns expressing yourself is incredibly helpful. "
"
Make a mutual decision to move on.,
Research the rules of moving out.,
Stay friendly.",How to Live with a College Roommate Who Is Your Total Opposite3," If reconciliation is absolutely impossible, and you’ve made every effort to resolve the conflict with your roommate, it may be necessary to agree to find a new living situation. This may involve moving to a new dorm room or apartment, or allowing your roommate to leave so that you can find a new one.

, Whether you live in an apartment or a dorm, there are policies in place that govern who is responsible for the property. If your names are both on a lease, or you are both assigned to a dorm room, then there are definitely rules that determine when and how you can move out. If you live in a dorm, make sure to understand the residence hall policies regarding roommate conflicts and changes. Some colleges will require you to go through the steps of mediation before requesting a roommate change, and others have trained students who will help you through the process.
If you live in an apartment and both of you are on the lease, notify your landlord or leasing office that one of you intends to move out, and inquire about whether or not a new roommate can move in. Most leases will allow for this, but have different procedures and policies.
If you live in an apartment and you split the deposit with your roommate, discuss how the deposit will be repaid to the tenant who is leaving. The leasing office may need to be involved in this process, so definitely check into this.

, Once you’ve separated from your roommate, try to remain on friendly terms. You may look back on your time together with fondness one day. Even though it didn’t work out, you shared a significant time together. Besides, sometimes even the best of friends simply don’t live well together.

Put some distance between you and your relatives.,
Remember to say “No.” Part of establishing boundaries is learning what you are, and aren’t, willing to do for certain people.,
Take classes in parenting.,
Visit a counselor.",How to Live a Good Life Without Good Family2," If you live with your family, try to avoid common areas, such as the living room. If you live away, try to visit your family less often. Space out your phone calls or text responses more and more. Create physical distance from your family by no longer visiting or inviting them over. You only have so much energy to give and compartmentalizing the negative people in your life provides you with more energy to spend on the positive ones.If your relatives question your increasing distance, you might say, “I’ve just been really busy lately,” and leave it at that. Keep in mind that when people are used to getting a certain response from you, and suddenly they don't, it is typical for them to try harder before they give up. Be prepared for some push back when you try to distance yourself.

, If you must maintain a relationship with someone, you might consider setting up plans yourself. That way they occur on your terms, where you're comfortable, and last only for small lengths of time. If your family members ask you to do something that is harmful to well-being in any way, just say, “No.” Don’t feel the need to provide an explanation as your time is your own to spend.Of course, if you live with your parents, you are more subject to their rules and requests. So, choose carefully when saying “no” and your response will (hopefully) be taken seriously.

, If you are worried about what kind of family life you might create as a parent, lessen your fears and educate yourself by enrolling in a childcare or parenting class. The instructors will show you that a negative family cycle does not have to repeat itself. And, they will give you the tools to understand what parental actions are beneficial and which are harmful.You can find a parenting class by contacting your local hospital. They will, most likely, offer classes on a variety of parental topics. And, many of these classes are often free-of-charge for soon-to-be parents.

, If you are in school, you can go to the school counselor and it is usually free-of-charge. Sometimes it is just helpful to have an unbiased person listen to your concerns. Or, if you are concerned about modeling your relationship on that of your parents, you may want to investigate relationship counseling. You can meet with a counselor as little or as often as you like. You can attend solo or with your partner.Discussing your family history with a counselor will show you that it is not your fault that you have a negative or problematic relatives. You are only responsible for your choices and actions.
There are also lots of great books on this subject that can help you learn how to set and maintain boundaries and have healthier relationships. You can also join a support group.

Stay busy around the holidays.,
Recognize that some days will be tough.,
Pay attention to healthy ways of interacting.,
Identify positive role models.,
Repeat positive mantras on a daily basis.,
Focus on the future.",How to Live a Good Life Without Good Family3," Special events and dates, such as anniversaries and holidays, can be very difficult and emotional if you are separated from your family either by distance or emotion. To keep yourself in a positive state of mind during these times it may be helpful to take on extra hours at work. Or, maintain a full schedule of social activities. Being busy will remind you that you are a productive person with a good life.If your coworkers or friends learn that you will be alone over the holidays, they might invite you to spend the time with their family. Carefully consider your emotions before you accept this offer as it may trigger negative feelings for you, such as jealousy.
If you live with your family, you might arrange to spend part of the holiday at a friend’s house enjoying their celebration. Make these plans well in advance and, if getting to your friend requires a bit of travelling and you can afford to do that, even better.

, Whenever you are dealing with personal conflicts certain days will be better than others. Try to assess your state-of-mind on a weekly, not daily, basis. Don’t beat yourself up if you feel down one day. Honor your sadness that day by journaling about it, allowing yourself to cry, or talking to a trusted friend. This is a part of the healing process. Then, try to find a way to make the next day extra special. Go to your favorite restaurant, for example.


It may also be helpful to tell your friends if/when you have a bad day. They may spring into action to lift you out of your funk and provide a positive distraction. Make sure to return this favor when you have the opportunity to do so.
If you are in school, keep a close eye on your participation grades (and grades in general) during bad periods with your family. If you have a tendency to focus on yourself and get quieter, make a point to speak up and get those points.

, If you’ve been surrounded by dysfunction and negativity for your entire life, you may need to take a bit of time to observe and understand positive and supportive ways of treating people. Pick up some reading material on healthy interpersonal relationships. Be patient with yourself and expect to make a few errors on your way.


For example, you may want to figure out when it is appropriate to say, “thank you,” for something and how to best express that sentiment. Do you write out a full card or simply send a brief test message? You will need to experiment to find out what is comfortable for you.

, If you are a young adult, look around you to find other people who you can respect and follow. They can be someone who you already spend a lot of time around, such as a teacher. Or, they can be a person who you do not know personally, such as a professional athlete.


Try to learn more about your role model, including why they make particular decisions. For example, if your favorite football player is always volunteering you may want to follow that model.

, When you first wake up each morning, whisper a simple, positive phrase to yourself. You might say, ""Today is going to be a good day.” Or, “You will do great today!” Just keep it memorable and mix it up when the phrase loses its punch or effectiveness.You can also take a moment and visualize your day going really well.


At the end of the day, you are your own best cheerleader. Figure out a way to keep yourself on the positive track, whether it be through repeating mantras or practicing deep breathing.
Journaling positive affirmations and reviewing these can be helpful, as well as keeping positive phrases posted in a place you see often, such as on your mirror or computer monitor.

, You can’t control the past, but you can shape your future. Sit down and make a list of immediate and distant goals for your personal and professional life. Post this list somewhere visible, like on the wall in your room, and celebrate each time that a line is marked off.


A personal goal might be to hit the gym at least three times a week. Or, perhaps you want to watch one movie each week and revel in your downtime.
Break your goals down into steps that are small and achievable so that they are more likely to happen. This will reinforce your progress and keep you motivated.

Work on your relationships.",How to Keep in Contact with Your Grandkids," Technology is very helpful when it comes to staying in contact with your grandchildren. Grandparents can use FaceTime, Skype, and other video chat programs to not only talk to their grandkids, but see them, as well. Many of these services are free and are easy to use.


FaceTime is exclusive to Apple products, like iPhones and Macs. To use FaceTime, you have to have the other person’s email address or phone number. Skype allows you to speak with others through your computer or phone. Many of these features work through WiFi.;
, Texting is an easy and convenient way to keep in touch with your grandkids throughout the day. Like email, texts are messages that will pop up directly on a phone or other handheld device. You can also send pictures and videos this way, which allows you to stay in each other’s lives.


If you have difficulty seeing the screen or using your fingers to type, you can use voice-to-text features that can make texting easier. , Sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter allow you to keep in touch with your grandchildren, even internationally. These social media sites enable you to post pictures, share funny quotes with each other, and interact with each other. They are quite simple to activate and are user-friendly., If you would love to play chess with your grandchild, but live too far away to do it in person, you can play each other online. A variety of different websites allow you to choose the person with whom you play against. Thousands of games are also available, so you can select a game that is age- and skill-appropriate for you and your grandchild., Although you may think it’s obvious that you want to see your grandkids, your children may not know this. Be clear, but respectful, about the type of relationship you want to have with your grandkids, as well as your kids. Talk about how often you’d like to see them, babysit, and have one-on-one time.


Make sure you remain respectful when asking for time with your grandkids. At the end of the day, they are your children’s kids, not yours, and they have the ultimate say. The nicer you are, the higher the chances are that you’ll get to see them as often as you’d like.You might say, “I know you guys are moving soon, and I’m really worried about staying in touch with the kids. Is it okay if we start weekly Skype sessions so that I can see them more often?”

, You may have called the shots with your children while you were raising them, but you’ll have to back off when it comes to your grandchildren. This is especially the case if you aren’t exactly close with your children and their spouses. If they feel like you’ve crossed the lines with their children, you will most likely lose time with them., Of course spending time with grandparents is great, but you also want to make sure you let your children and your grandchildren know what you bring to the table. You want to play up your strengths so that your children have even more of a reason to let their grandkids spend time with you. When they see you bring a great amount to the relationship, they’ll feel good in their choice to allow them to see you.


For instance, if you enjoy painting or playing music, you can offer to do these things with them.Initiate the conversation by saying something like “I know little Johnny was always interested in the piano. Since I’m such a skilled player, I thought it would be nice to give him lessons. Is that okay?”

, It is first and foremost important to develop a strong foundational relationship with your grandkids early on in their lives. Do your best to physically be there with your grandchildren as they go through developmental milestones and celebrate birthdays and graduations. The more time they are able to talk to you and spend with you, the more comfortable they will be, which will make them more willing to maintain strong communication as they age., Send snail mail, or a letter, to your grandkids, particularly if you’re having problems being able to see them. Keeping this type of correspondence allows them to see what you are up to, even if you’re not getting a response. Hopefully their parents will allow them to see your letters, so you’ll need to make sure to keep things light and age-appropriate, particularly if there is resistance in seeing them.


Since you can expect that your kids will screen the letters, especially if they are keeping your grandchildren from you, avoid writing anything you don’t want your children to see and anything that could put them in a bad light. Instead, tell your grandkids how much you love them, talk about what is going on in your life, and ask what they have been up to., With decades in between you, even reaching out consistently can fall flat if you don't have a plan in which to truly engage your grandchildren. Everyone, young and old, enjoys talking about themselves, but kids are more likely to engage when you are talking about their interests. Zero in on a few topics you know each of your grandchildren enjoy discussing and use these as a starting place in your interactions.For example, if you have a grandchild who's addicted to Pokemon, you might ask them about any new games or shows they have watched. If you have a bookworm grandchild, it might be fun to read the same book as them depending on their age range. Then, during your Skype calls, you can talk about what's happening in the story.
Other ways to maintain the connection might be to send special gifts that have meaning to your grandchildren, such as buying a Harry Potter t-shirt for your grandchild or the new season of their favorite TV show. It may also help your conversations if you get involved with their lives. Ask about their friends (remembering names will give your extra points) and their daily activities when you talk to them.

, We live in a world where most of the younger generation connect visually more than through words. With the use of printed photos, you can reflect on memories with your grandkids.

Make a photo book of all the memorable pictures you had taken with your grandchildren from the day they were born up until the age they are now. Give this book to them so they can feel connected to you at any time, no matter how far away you are from each other.
Sit down with them and show them old pictures of you when you were near their age and tell them stories about those fun and interesting moments in time. This may help them feel like they can relate to you.

, Contact your grandkids’ parents consistently to offer your help. Parents will often jump at the chance to have a night out without the kids, so they may be delighted to have you babysit for them. Even if you are declined once or twice, keep asking, and you may get a chance.Say to your daughter, for instance, “It’s been such a long time since the two of you have been on a date. Why don’t I keep the kids for a weekend and you guys plan a nice getaway?”

, Instead of fighting against your grandkids’ parents if there are issues, try to fix the problems. Offer to undergo counseling, workshops, or therapy sessions. Putting in this extra work may get you to the place you want to be with your family.Approach the subject with something like “Look I know we have always had our differences, but I really want to be a part of my grandkids’ lives. Why don’t we attend family therapy and see if we can work out a solution to some of our problems?”

Show appreciation.,
Show interest in your friend's life.,
Build trust.,
Have fun together.",How to Maintain a Friendship1," Sometimes when you have known people for a long time, you can start to take them for granted. This doesn't have to be the case.


Always thank your friend when he or she does something for you.
Return favors when your friend goes out of his or her way to help you.
Do nice things like getting their favorite candy at the grocery store, buying them lunch, or getting them a card and gift for their birthday.
Tell your friend how much you appreciate them. This doesn't have to be an awkward or long-winded speech that you have prepared. It can be as simple as, ""Hey, thanks for always being there for me. I appreciate it."";
, A good friendship should be two-sided — and hopefully, you have a friend who shows interest in you as well.


Be a good listener. When your friend talks to you about something that's going on in his or her life, really listen. Good relationships are built on communication, so don't ignore your friend.

Take the time to really hear what they're saying, and offer advice only if they ask for it.
Don't fidget or play with your cell phone while they're talking to you.


If your friend is involved in an activity that they care about, show your support and interest. Offer to go to their events. For example, if your friend plays a sport or is acting in a play, go to a game or performance to cheer them on.

, This seems simple, but you have to both constantly show each other that you can be trusted and depended on as friends.


Don't gossip about your friend. Gossip spreads quickly, and you do not want to hurt your friend's feelings and damage the relationship.
Keep your promises, even if it's something as small as showing up when you are supposed to meet.
Don't go behind your friend's back. This includes flirting with their significant other or inviting other friends out without including them.
Keep secrets safe. If your friend tells you something personal, don't share it with other people. They need to know that they can trust you with their secrets.

, This might be obvious, but sometimes we can get into the trap of just using our friends for emotional support and not taking the time to enjoy their company. Do things that you both enjoy together.


Learn something new. Take a rock climbing or pottery class, go on a sailing trip, or try out Zumba together. The experience will bring you closer.
Make an open invitation. Call up your friend and ask them what they've been wanting to do. You can say, ""I think we should hang out this weekend. What do you think would be fun?""
Throw a party together. Celebrate your friendship, a birthday, or nothing in particular.
Plan a fun evening. Invite your friend over for dinner and spend the night eating, drinking, playing board games, or watching your favorite movies.

Stay the same, sometimes when you are no longer with your best friend on a regular basis, you may think that things have changed.",How to Maintain a Long Distance Friendship with Your Best Friend," Ask questions about their life, like their school/college/work. If they got new friends or even if they fell into a relationship, without sounding clingy or rude, try to always support them and help them by giving advice and talking out their problems.;
, Ask them about the circumstances, and listen to them when they complain about a problem, a friend, a teacher, or a crush. Help them with their work or studies, try to link them to websites that might help them in their daily work. For instance, if your best friend is a medical aspirant, remember to notify them about a new website which helps in preparations. Such actions will show them that you care for them.

, Do a handshake you guys did together or make a joke that'll make your friend laugh, seeing them laugh makes you happy because they are happy. Skype is also a well-known platform available on Windows and Android smartphones.In a while have a meal or snack together during the video call as if you are sitting side by side.


If you're both gamers, buy the same games and make sure to play at least once a week, especially multiplayer games that can be played together as a party.

, Writing a letter can be a lot more meaningful than a simple text. Don't you just love opening the mailbox and seeing a letter from your BFF? Of course, this can be done more effectively if your friend stays in your state or country.

,, It's always fun to receive a gift from a friend, and sending someone a something special shows the person that you care about them. A present is usually something personal. It's especially important to remember celebrations and birthdays.

, Even if it's only one time a year, the time you spend together will be very special and cherished.

, Try to show interest in each other's hobbies, for example: You can show and see each others' hobbies like drawing, painting, singing, dance, poems, origami, collecting things, etc.; by sending photos or videos to each other (for we're talking about maintaining a long distance friendship)

, Whether it's an event in your life, your friend's life, or something in the news, recent events are usually good to talk about, as it feels personal.

, Offering help when necessary can be much appreciated.

, Talk about things you could do together. This will keep you both positive and looking forward to the future.

, Just because you're apart doesn't mean you can't still experience something together. Find a book, TV show, movie, new type of exercise, anything that you can both partake in in your respective places. It will give you something to discuss that doesn't have to do with how separate your lives can seem at times.

, Although some have, how you talk/treat each other shouldn't change at all! You are both the same people, however you are probably not in the same place. But, it's up to you to keep your friendship as strong, or to make it even stronger than it used to be!

"
Consider why you have chosen to see this person as unlovable.,
Realize that love is a very broad concept.,
Look for the good in the person.,
Bear in mind that love isn't conditional.,
Be realistic.",How to Love a Person You Feel Doesn't Deserve to Be Loved," It may be because they have failed to return love to you on a number of occasions or consistently let you down. Perhaps this person is angry, unkind, rude or even violent. If this person reminds you of someone from your past who hurt you, it could be a case of transferring your dislike onto them. Whatever the reason, it's important for you to try to work it out, because it is part of what is making things difficult for you.


Realize that you are making a judgment when you decide that this person doesn't deserve to be loved. It's a harsh judgment to reach and if you wish to love this person, you'll need the courage to push past whatever discomfort or fears are causing you to dislike this person.;
, There is a love for humanity, a love for animals, a love for doing something you're passionate about, romantic love, parental love and so forth. Love is also subjective. When you are faced with someone you really don't feel deserves to be loved, it can help to broaden your sense of what love is, to realize that even if you don't like a person, it is still possible to draw on compassionate or general love and invoke this as the sort of love you can manage. Hence, you love this person in a general, abstract way, not a close, concrete way. Or, you may love the person through your faith's tenets, embracing all humankind.


For example, you may be dealing with a person who constantly lets you down. You have really started to dislike this person (or at least their attitude and actions) but you feel the need to show that you still love them enough to give them another chance or to be there at the end of whatever they're going through. In this instance, rather than forcing yourself to love this person like a sibling or friend, you might be able to find it possible to love this person's potential to be a better person, all while making sure that you don't suffer as a result of their unreliability or bad behavior again.

, In spite of bad behavior, reprehensible actions and thoughtless words, there is often a modicum of goodness hidden under the tough exterior, the devil-may-care attitude or the selfish approach to life. Consider looking for that as a way to help you care about what might be nurtured in this person if it's noticed and coaxed forth more. It can help you to balance the negative behavior with a ray of hopeful light.


For example, if this person is arrogant and selfish in your eyes, try to find the kinder, gentler and more considerate actions. Often arrogance is a cover for insecurity or fear about things and it may well be covering up this person's true talents and they're no longer able to access this part of themselves with ease. By noticing that Ms Arrogant or Mr Selfish is kind to children, always stops to pat a dog or draws amazing pictures during work meetings, you might just have stumbled on their softer, more lovable self. Bringing it out is a case of noticing, complimenting or commenting and making it clear it's something you'd like to see more of.

, In other words, saying things such as: ""If you loved me, you wouldn't do that"" is actually a form of attaching a condition to the person's love. Love happens as it happens, and doesn't make bargains. However, it is equally important to understand that love doesn't excuse bad actions or attitude. It is perfectly possible to love someone without condoning or accepting what they're doing or saying. In other words, if you have confused love with perfection or forgiveness, then you will continue to have a hard time finding love for someone you feel doesn't deserve it. Be careful of the standards you may be injecting into the concept of love and allow the love to be unconditional.


Make it clear that you will not put yourself in harm's way just because you have love for the person. This is not about making love conditional, for the love is a separate issue, while the desire to see a person improve is a form of care and respect. For example: ""I love you teen son. However, the impact your frequent partying is having on my life and your future concerns me a great deal. I have decided that if there isn't a change by next April, I will not be funding your next year at college. You are always my beloved son but I need to see a change in your attitude about your future for me to feel certain that you're going to be okay on your own.""

, Some people are unlovable precisely because they're set on a path of destruction and forcing others away. In this case, trying to love may be an unrealistic attempt and the best you can do is have compassion or seek understanding without judgment. In the worst case possible, where someone commits deadly crimes or commits violence, trying to love the person is likely to be unhealthy and counterproductive for your well-being and once again, the best you can do is to stand back and try to understand, in order to help yourself move on.

Support each other when things get rough.,
Help your friend find solutions.,
Handle arguments maturely.,
Maintain contact.",How to Maintain a Friendship2," Sometimes friendships can get rocky or friends can have a hard time dealing with their own personal problems. Though it may not be fun, these are situations where a real friend has to step in and be there.


Demonstrate your support. Tell your friend, ""I'm here for you. Just let me know what you need and I'll help you out.""
Offer to listen. If there are personal or family problems going on, tell your friend that you are always there when your friend needs to vent.
Provide distractions. If your friend is going through a breakup, come over and spend time with them so they don't feel alone. Take them out to do things that will take their mind off the problem. You can go out to eat, see a movie, or even just go for a walk.

, If you know your friend is struggling, do what you can to help! Even small gestures to brighten his or her day can make a big difference.


Call or drop by to check in on your friend regularly if they are having a hard time. Make sure they don't feel like they're alone.
Let your friend use you as a shoulder to cry on. Just let them get it all out and hand them tissues when they need them.
If your friend is sick, bring over soup, a good book, or fun movies that they can watch while they're in bed.

, When you and your friend have a conflict, don't lash out and yell at them. Instead, talk about your problems calmly and listen to both sides of the story.


Don't raise your voice or storm out when you're having an argument. Sit down and talk through the problems.
Don't complain about your friend to other people, especially before you've talked to them about the conflict. If they have no idea that you're mad at them, it will be confusing if they hear that you're talking about them behind their back.
Use ""I"" statements when you're talking to your friend. For example, you might say, ""I feel left out when you invite all our friends out to dinner but don't include me."" This makes the statement about your feelings instead of blaming them.
Apologize if you've done something wrong. If you have hurt your friend's feelings, take responsibility and say, ""I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.""

, If one friend moves far away, keep in touch. People often move far away to go to different schools or pursue a new career. That doesn't mean the friendship has to end.


Call your friend regularly. If you don't see each other often, it's important to check in so that you know what is going on in your friend's life.
Schedule video chats online. Use video chat to talk to your friend and see their face. You can even use it to show each other your apartments or homes and to introduce each other to people in your lives.
Try old-school letter writing. It might take longer to send than an email, but sending your friend letters or care packages in the mail will make him or her feel special. They can serve as mementos of your friendship.
Visit whenever you can. When you are in town, make the time to see your friend. Plan a day of fun sightseeing together, or ask them to show you their favorite things to do.

Remain hopeful.",How to Live with Someone with Dissociative Identity Disorder," To understand DID, you need to be aware of the symptoms, the underlying causes, and how you can help alleviate symptoms or reduce their impact in the home. To thoroughly understand the disorder, it is important to talk to a professional who can walk you through DID. Some basics of DID include:


When a person has multiple personalities that take over his original personality. Each personality has a different memory, so if your loved one does something while being controlled by an alter (which is another personality) he or she will most likely not remember it.
The usual cause of the disorder is some childhood abuse, trauma, insecurity or torture.
The symptoms of DID include auditory hallucinations, amnesia (memory loss), fugue episodes in which the person travels in search of something without knowing what or why, depression and anxiety.;
, That is, although it may be somewhat upsetting for you to be faced with an alter, do your best to avoid panicking. To stay calm, keep in mind that you are dealing with a (while somewhat mysterious) well documented disorder. As you learn about DID, get used to the idea that your loved one may have several personalities, or alters, within him and all of those alters might be completely different, in age, personality, maybe even gender. Remember that, while under the influence of an alter, your loved one is somewhat of a different person. It is possible that some of his alters may not recognize or even know about you. In addition, the person might suddenly switch to another alter even if in the middle of something like work, conversation or activity.Whether or not you acknowledge the alter or pretend that you do not know the person is under the influence of an alter will depend on the specific situation you are in (e.g., if you are around strangers for just a moment it may be better to avoid the subject or an unwanted and long conversation may ensue) and the specific alter (e.g., whether it is an alter that gets upset about those kinds of discussions) who is present.

, Your loved one is dealing with an extremely challenging situation. While you might find yourself at times frustrated or hurt by something she has done, it is important to remember that your loved one (i.e., the personality you most identify with as being his) does not necessarily know what she is saying. He has no control over when an alter takes over, so try to remain patient, even if an alter says or does something that frustrates you.


If it gets too overwhelming and you are losing patience, try to excuse yourself from the conversation and take a break.
Although it can be difficult to shorten a dissociative episode, one form of treatment is to intervene immediately following a traumatic event. So, if you can help the person overcome their trauma that might reduce symptoms of DID and speed up the process. That said, this generally needs to be done under the supervision of a qualified mental health professional., Along with having patience, you must also have empathy. Your loved one is experiencing a very scary situation. He will need as much love and support as you can possibly give him. Say kind things to him, listen to him when he wants to talk about his situation, and show him that you care.

, Stress is one of the largest factors in triggering a personality switch. Do your best to relieve any stress that your loved one may be experiencing.It is also important to avoid causing stress through conflict or argument. If your loved one does something that makes you mad, take a moment to yourself to breathe and control your anger. You can then talk with them about what made you mad and the ways that they can avoid doing that in the future.


If you disagree with something that your loved one said or is doing, use the “Yes, but…” technique. When he asserts something that you do not agree with, say “yes, but…” so that you avoid directly conflicting with him.

, While some people with DID can manage their own time and schedule activities for themselves, other people will not be able to manage their time as well due to memory loss and different personalities pulling their goal-directed behaviors in different directions.If your loved one has a hard time keeping track of what he is supposed to be doing, help him along by reminding him of the activities he has planned.


You might try creating a chart that you keep in a specific place he can easily see it. On the chart, right down important things he should be doing, as well as suggestions for other fun things to do.

, Whether it is medication for other disorders that often co-occur with DID, such as depression or anxiety, or whether it is making sure that your loved one goes to his appointments with his therapist, you will need to help him with both of these things. Keep track of what medications he is supposed to receive everyday and make a schedule for therapy sessions and other appointments he may have.If your loved one is having trouble keeping a schedule, try creating a calendar with his appointments in it. If he has a smartphone, you can add a calendar to his phone that will give reminders of his upcoming appointments.

, While each person is different, there are some signs that nearly everyone with DID experiences before an episode or personality switch occurs. It can help to detect these signs so that you can prepare yourself mentally to deal with this person's alter. These signs include:


Recurrent flashbacks to abuse or bad memories.
Depression or extreme sadness.
Frequent mood swings.
Memory loss.
Aggressive behavior.
Feelings of numbness.

, When your loved one experiences a personality shift, memories from his other personalities do not necessarily carry over. This can make it very hard to keep track of important items like wallets, cell phones, etc. Create an inventory of your loved ones important items and place notes or stickies on or inside the items with your name and phone number on them. That way, anyone who finds your loved one’s item can call you to return them.It is also important that you have a copy of all of your loved one’s important documents, including social security card, medical information, passwords, etc.

, People suffering from DID have almost always experienced abuse during childhood. Self-harming behaviors, such as suicide, violence, substance abuse and risk-taking, are common in people who have DID. These behaviors tend to occur in those who have suffered abuse because they are used in an attempt to end their feelings of shame, horror, and fear spurred on by past abuse.


If you notice that your loved one has started developing self-harming behaviors, call your therapist or the police right away.

, It is of the utmost importance that you take time to care for yourself, since taking care of someone with DID can be very stressful. You should take steps to maintain a healthy diet; it is also important to allow yourself some rest and relaxation time. Sometimes, you will need to put your needs first in order to keep up the mental and physical strength required to support your loved one.

, Schedule alone time where you do not need to worry about anyone else’s time management. Stay connected with your friends and make sure that you go out and have fun every week. Taking a break can help you to regain your strength so that you can continue to be patient and empathetic to your loved one’s situation.Join a yoga class to help you center yourself and restore inner peace. Yoga and meditation can be two great ways to help yourself relax and let go of any tensions and worries that you have.

, There are family therapy sessions specifically for the family members of people with DID. It is very important that you attend sessions so that you can learn about other ways to help your loved one to overcome this disorder and ways to help keep yourself strong.There are also support groups you can join where you can meet other people who are also living with someone who has DID. You can talk to your therapist about support group options or run an internet search to find one near you.

, While some days may seem bleak, you must always keep the hope alive. With your support and the help of a therapist, your loved one can overcome this disorder and eventually integrate all of their personalities.To maintain hopefulness you can:Remind yourself that you will become a stronger person in dealing with the situation you are in.
Think about something that you are grateful for to remember that although some aspects of your life are tough, there are good things to look forward to, also.

Watch for symptoms of hypersexual disorder.,
Express your concerns.,
Encourage your partner to seek help.,
Get help for yourself.,
Set boundaries.,
Encourage your partner to find non-sexual outlets.,
Tell your partner that you are okay with masturbation.,
Consider other ways of meeting your partner’s needs.,
Build emotional intimacy.",How to Live With a Nymphomaniac," Unequal sex drives between partners is a common problem in relationships, but a high sex drive does not always mean that someone has hypersexual disorder. To be diagnosed as someone with a hypersexual disorder, the person must have repeatedly experienced three or more of these criteria over a period of six months or longer:Not being able to complete goals, activities, or other obligations due to sexual fantasies or a preoccupation with sex.
Using sexual fantasies as a way to escape from a boredom, anxiety, or depression.
Using sexual fantasies to deal with stress.
Having a hard time controlling sexual urges or behaviors.
Harming others or putting others at risk of harm (physical or emotional) while responding to sexual urges.;
, If you think that your partner is engaging in behavior consistent with hypersexual disorder, then the first thing you should do is have a conversation with your partner about your concerns. Tell your partner what you have noticed and explain why you are concerned about his or her behavior.


For example, you might say something like, “I am concerned about you and your recent behavior. I have noticed that you have been using sex to deal with stress. I am worried that this behavior might not be healthy.”

, Hypersexual disorder has not been well-researched research, there are no researched treatments, and the professional community disagrees on where to draw the line between normal and abnormal sexual behavior.However, there are therapists who are willing to help. If your partner is showing signs of hypersexual disorder, then advise your partner to seek help.Help your partner find a therapist to begin treatment.

Keep in mind that hypersexuality can also be a symptom of a different mental health condition, such as bipolar disorder. However, seeing a therapist will still be necessary to determine if this may be the cause.

, You may also benefit from some one-on-one support from a therapist while your partner seeks help for his or her problem. This may be especially true if your partner’s behavior has made life difficult for you. For example, you may have suffered if your partner has cheated on you, spent money to feed his or her sex habit, or pressured you into sex.

, If you live with someone who has an overactive sex drive, then he or she may want to have sex at odd times of the day or even multiple times of the day. It is important for you to express your feelings about this behavior and set clear boundaries about when you are willing to have sex. Keep in mind that your partner may feel rejected or think that you don’t like to have sex with him or her at all.Make sure that you emphasize your attraction to your partner to minimize conflict.


For example, if your partner often wants to have sex in the morning when you are trying to get ready for work, explain why this is inconvenient for you. You might say something like, “I love all of the affection that you give me in the morning, but I have been late a few times because of it. I think that we need to keep these encounters to the evening when I have more time to spend with you.""
Or, if your partner wants to have sex multiple times every day, then you might say, “I am glad that you are attracted to me. I am attracted to you too. However, my sex drive is not as high as yours, so I can’t keep having sex two or three times every day.”

, People with high sex drives may benefit from incorporating vigorous exercise and other activities into their daily lives. If your partner does not exercise much or if he or she does not have any hobbies, then encourage your partner to do these things.For example, your partner might take up running, cycling, dancing, or swimming to provide an outlet for sexual desire and frustration. Your partner might also take up an enjoyable hobby, such as knitting, cooking, or playing an instrument.

, Some people might feel like it is not appropriate to masturbate when you are in a relationship, so you may need to discuss your feelings about this with your partner. If your partner is interested in having sex every day or multiple times per day, then he or she may need to masturbate once per day or every other day to control his or her sex drive.Talk to your partner about masturbating on a regular basis. For example, you might say something like, “I enjoy having sex with you, but my sex drive is not the same as yours. Would you be willing to masturbate a few times per week or more to help make up for the days that I am not in the mood for sex?”

, If your partner just has a high sex drive, but does not feel as though sex is a compulsion, then you may need to try some new things to satisfy your partner sexually. Although you may not be up for sex as much as your partner is, there are still ways you can satisfy his or her needs.For example, you could:


Incorporate more oral sex into your lovemaking.
Try out some sex toys.
Watch pornography together.
Try phone sex when you are apart.

, Some people who have overactive sex drives may use sex as a way to feel closer to their partners on an emotional level. If your partner is using sex as a way to feel emotionally close to you, try to find other ways you two can feel emotionally close other than through sex.Look for other ways to build emotional intimacy with your partner, such as:


Asking about your partner's day and sharing about your day.
Confiding in your partner when you have a problem or concern.
Telling your partner how much he or she means to you.
Going on romantic dates.

Ask yourself, ""Do I really care?"",
Monitor how people respond to you.,
Consider how you behave.",How to Know Whether You're Insensitive1," One of the main traits of insensitive people is a lack of empathy. While empathy exists in varying degrees, and some people are simply more sensitive than others, having very little empathy can make you come off as cold or uncaring.


There are two types of empathy: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy. Cognitive empathy involves the ability to logically understand someone else's perspective by seeing things from their point of view. You may not have a strong emotional reaction to another person's perspective, but you will at least understand it to a degree. Emotional empathy involves being able to pick up on the emotions of others. If someone gets bad news, for example, you will feel sad.Consider whether you possess either types of empathy. Do you try to understand another person's point of view when they're explaining something to you? Do you make a conscious effort to ask questions, understand information, and listen? When another person is sad or frustrated, do you experience the same emotions? Can you easily pick up on how a person is feeling? If a friend or co-worker looked upset, would you feel compelled to ask them what's wrong?Oftentimes, insensitive people are simply not tuned in to the needs and emotions of others. Consider how often you actively try to understand the perspective of another person. If you spend the bulk of your time thinking about yourself, you may be insensitive.;
, People tend to be put off by insensitive people. You can often tell if you're insensitive by observing how others tend to respond to you.


When you're in a social situation, do people initiate conversation with you? If you're the one usually starting a conversation, people might be wary to talk to you because of the way you're coming off. Do people want to remain engaged in conversation with you or do people tend to make excuses to leave?
Do people tend to laugh at your jokes? Oftentimes, insensitive people make jokes that come off the wrong way to others. If people do not laugh, or only offer quiet and somewhat uncomfortable laughter, you may be insensitive.
Do people seek you out when they're in need? If you're an insensitive person, others might be wary to ask for your help and open up to you about their problems. If you're consistently the last person in a group to hear about, say, a friend's divorce or a family member's job loss, it may be because you consistently say the wrong things in these situations. This is a sign of insensitivity.
Has anyone ever outright told you you're insensitive? While it might seem obvious, many people disregard such criticisms as the result of the hypersensitivity of others. However, if someone's made the point to call you out on your behavior, or if multiple people have, you may be insensitive.

, Insensitive behaviors vary from person to person. However, certain identifiable behaviors are generally considered rude or crass. You may be an insensitive person if you've ever engaged in any of the following:


Talking about a topic that bores others or that others do not understand. For example, going on about the details of your PhD if you know others in the room have no understanding of the subject matter.Sharing opinions at inappropriate times, such as complaining loudly about the obesity epidemic in front of a co-worker you know is struggling with his weight.Bringing up topics inappropriate for the audience or group, such as telling stories of recreational drug use in front of your significant other's parents.Getting annoyed if someone does not understand a topic you're explaining.Passing judgments on others for their mistakes or circumstances without considering their background or personal struggles.Being rude and demanding to serving staff at restaurants.Being too blunt or critical of others. For example, if you dislike an item of clothing on someone you might say, ""You look fat in that"" rather than avoiding commenting altogether or offering more tactful advice, like, ""I think a different color would flatter your features more."""

Practice reading other people's emotions.,
Learn to show concern.,
Understand the necessity of emotions.,
Become aware of your own emotions.",How to Know Whether You're Insensitive2," You may struggle to identify the physical cues that are signs of different emotions, but all humans are born with this ability. Just like any other skill, if you take the time to practice reading people's emotions, you will get better at it.Observe people in a crowded place (like a mall, nightclub, or park) and try to identify how they are feeling. Try using context, body language, and expressions to figure out who is feeling shy, stressed, excited, and so on.Read up on body language, especially facial expressions, and how it corresponds to different emotions. Sadness, for instance, is characterized by drooping eyelids, a slight pulling down of the lip corners, and a raised inner brow.Put on a soap opera and try to identify the emotions the actors are portraying. Use context clues, facial expressions, and body language. Mute the television so you can't get clues from the dialogue. Once you feel you've got it down, move on to more subtle dramas in which the actors use nuanced expressions to convey emotion., You may come off as insensitive because showing emotion makes you feel uncomfortable an awkward. Instead of saying something that might sound stilted or insincere when you see someone is upset, you remain quiet. Accept that it might sound forced when you offer condolences to your friend, ""I'm so sorry to hear that..."", but know that it will become more natural if you push through and keep trying., To you, sadness may seem pointless, illogical, and self-indulgent. You may wonder why the person doesn't just think through the issue and figure out how to make it better. But emotions are an essential part of decision making, as is logic. Emotions can motivate you to change your life, as emotional discomfort is often an impetus to get out of a rut.Emotions are essential to making connections and healthy, successful social interactions.Remember that emotions are simply part of being human. Even if you don't understand them or think they're pointless, be aware that most people don't feel that way.Sometimes it's okay to fake it. You may not understand why someone is upset or overjoyed, but playing along a little bit is sometimes the most sensitive thing you can do. You may not personally feel any joy that your coworker is going to be an aunt, but it shouldn't cost you much to congratulate her and smile., Feelings may cause you discomfort or confusion, or you may have been taught to hide and suppress your emotions, or maybe you only listen to the logical side of your brain. For whatever reason, you may have cut yourself off from your own feelings, which can make it difficult to feel empathy.If you are suppressing your emotions to cope with trauma or you are prone to anxiety attacks, you may need a counselor or therapist to help you work through those feelings.Begin asking yourself, ""How am I feeling right now?"" throughout the day. Stopping and checking in with yourself can help you begin to identify feelings as they come up.Identify any devices you use to avoid your emotions, such as: distracting yourself with video games or watching television, focusing only on work, drinking or using other substances, over-intellectualizing the situation, or making jokes about it.Allow yourself to feel the emotion. When you're in a safe, private place, don't suppress your feelings. Allow the emotion to come and try to observe how your body reacts. Making note of these physical changes (like that your eyebrows furrow and your lips narrow when you feel angry) can help you identify the emotions when the reoccur – both in yourself and in other people."

Learn the symptoms of narcissism.,
Consider autism, including Asperger Syndrome.,
Read about various personality disorders.,
See a therapist, if necessary.",How to Know Whether You're Insensitive3," Narcissistic personality disorder is a psychiatric disorder in which people have an unrealistic sense of self importance and tend to lack empathy. Narcissistic personality disorder is relatively rare with prevalence ranging from 0% to 6.2% in community samples.Of those diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, 50-75% are male.The symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder include a large sense of self importance, the need for recognition or admiration, the need to exaggerate achievements or talents, being envious of others or believing others envy you, and expecting special favors from those around you. People with narcissistic personality disorder tend to think of the world solely in terms of themselves and their own needs.Basic criticism or setbacks can cause major episodes of depression in those suffering narcissistic personality disorder. This is, in fact, often what first prompts those suffering from the disorder to seek help. However, you do not have to wait that long. If you're worried you may show symptoms of narcissism, make an appointment with a therapist., Autistic people often have difficulty understanding social cues and figuring out how to respond. They tend to be straightforward and honest, which can accidentally come off as insensitive.


You may be autistic if you care deeply about others' feelings, and hate to see them get upset, but are called insensitive. The ""insensitivity"" in many autistic people is called by cluelessness, overwhelm, and misunderstanding, not by lack of caring.Other autism symptoms include strong emotions, stimming (unusual fidgeting), dislike of eye contact, sluggishness, passionate special interests, need for routine,and general clumsiness..While autism is often identified in childhood, it is possible for symptoms to be looked over or hidden, and some people are not diagnosed until teen or adult years. Talk to a therapist if you think you have symptoms of autism., Many personality disorders cause insensitivity to others. Personality disorders are a group of mental illnesses that cause long-term behavioral and thinking patterns that are unhealthy. While nearly all personality disorders can cause some degree of insensitivity, the following are most often associated with a lack of empathy:Antisocial personality disorder, which involves an inability to distinguish right from wrong, hostility, aggression, violence, a lack of longterm relationships, unnecessary risk taking behavior, and a sense of superiority.Borderline personality disorder, which involves difficulty regulating emotions or thoughts, frequently engaging in impulsive and reckless behaviors, and an inability to maintain stable relationships longterm.Schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders are defined by a lack of social relations, delusional thought patterns, and excessive social anxiety., If you feel you may be suffering from any of the above disorders, talk over your concerns with a professional therapist or psychiatrist. While many online questionnaires can tell you if you display symptoms of certain disorders, only a professional can diagnose your properly. You can find a therapist by going through your insurance to see what clinics and doctors are covered under you plan. You can also ask for a referral from your regular physician. If you're a college student, your school might provide free counseling.

Always make time for date night.,
Maintain your appearance.,
Make time for romantic getaways.,
Maintain a romantic atmosphere at home.,
Always show love and affection.",How to Keep Your Wife Happy1," No matter how busy you may be, you should always make time for a date night with your wife, ideally once a week or at least twice a month. If you spend all of your precious time together hanging out with friends or just lounging around the house, then you'll forget that spark that makes your relationship so special.


Mix it up. Do something different during every date night, whether it's checking out a new movie or going to a restaurant you've never been to before.
If you're staying in to cook, dress up just as nicely as you would if you were going out.
Make time to talk. Activities like mini-golfing or watching movies are great, but make sure there's a portion of the evening when you have time to just look into each other's eyes and talk.
Give your wife a card that tells her how much you love her during date night, even if there's no special occasion. Every occasion with your wife should be special.;
, Though it's tempting to let your scruff grow and to lounge around the house in your workout clothes, you should try to be presentable at all times and work to maintain your handsome looks. If you two don't care how you look anymore, then you're slacking in the romance department.


Unless you're rocking a beard or some scruff, make sure to shave every day and to keep your face smooth.
Take a shower every day and continue to smell fresh. Don't let hygiene get in the way of you and your wife.
Even if you're just hanging out around the house, make an effort to wear clean and matching clothes.
Of course, you can't look amazing every day. You and your wife can decide on a more casual day, such as Sunday, when you can wear whatever you want, but don't let your old ratty sweatpants become the standard.

, Though a romantic vacation is not a long-term solution for any problems in the romance department, taking a short getaway is a perfect way to spend time with your wife in a fresh environment and to learn to appreciate your relationship even more.


Make a goal of going away somewhere exotic together at least once a year, if your budget allows for it. Book your trip well in advance so when the time comes, you can't say you're too busy as an excuse.
Try to go to a new place every time. Not only will this keep your romance fresh, but it will also strengthen your bond when you explore the world together.
If your budget is really tight or if it's difficult for you to find a sitter, have a goal of at least going away from the weekend together from time to time even if you're only going an hour's drive away or just checking into a hotel in the closest city.

, You can still make room for romance even if you're just sitting around the house. Though it may feel impossible to create a romantic atmosphere when your house is cluttered with dirty dishes and toys, there are a few things you can do to make your time at home feel more romantic.


Bring roses or other flowers home to your wife once a week and put them in a bouquet on the dining room table.
If the two of you are just having a normal dinner or watching TV, dim the lights and light a few candles.
If you're just engaged in a quiet conversation, turn up some jazz or romantic music.
Try to keep the house as clean as possible, so you'll feel more relaxed and happy in your own environment.
Make your bedroom a sex sanctuary. No matter how cluttered the rest of the house may be, you should keep your bedroom clean, neat, and smelling fresh at all times. Don't use your bedroom as an office or a place to throw your dirty laundry.

, If you want to maintain romance in your relationship, you should never take your wife for granted. Though you know you love her, and she should know how you feel, you still have to take the time to tell her how much you value your relationship. She's a wife, not a psychic.


Tell your wife that you love her every single day. No matter what.
Take the time to not only tell your wife you love her, but tell her why you love and appreciate her so much. Remind her why she's special.
Don't just be affectionate in the bedroom. Take the time to hug, caress, and kiss your wife as often as you can.
If you're leaving the house while she's away or still asleep, leave a post-it note that tells her how much you love her and wish her a good day.

Give yourself permission to say no.,
Establish your personal boundaries.,
Be aware of potential persuasion techniques.,
Practice saying ""No."",
Ask for more time before committing.,
Start with a compliment or gratitude.,
Give a clear ""No."",
Thank and encourage the person.,
Examine any reasons you avoid saying ""No."",
Keep in mind that you do not need a reason to say “No.” Some people feel like they have to have a good reason to say no, but this is not the case.,
Accept that boundaries are personal and subjective.,
Don't look back after giving an answer.,
Understand saying ""No"" can help you avoid resentment.,
Work on building up your self-worth.",How to Learn to Say No," Many people have a knee-jerk reaction to say ""Yes"" when they're asked to do someone a favor. Keep in mind, you are never required to say ""Yes."" It's actually okay to say ""No"" sometimes. Accept this as you prepare to say ""No"" to someone. This will help you say ""No"" with ease.If you never say ""No,"" this can have negative consequences. You can enable someone who relies too much on you for favors. You can also burn out on your own end and lose focus.
If you say ""No"" too often, you may miss out on things that may be good for you. If you're overcommitted doing things you don't want to do, you won't have much time left for yourself.
Make time for the things you really enjoy rather than saying ""Yes"" as a knee-jerk response. If you, say, agreed to help a friend move all weekend, you may have to turn down an invitation to go on a weekend hiking trip with another group of friends.;
, It's always easier to say ""No"" if you have a reason. However, that reason does not have to be concrete. Many people think if they can do something, they should. Your reason for saying ""No"" can be a simple matter of your own personal boundaries. Think about what boundaries you have, and embrace the fact you're allowed to stay true to them.Consider what you are reasonably able to do, and what you actually enjoy doing. You can say ""No"" to things that drain you or distract you. You can set specific boundaries regarding what you will and will not agree to do.
For example, maybe you value solitude. You can set a boundary that you won't go out two nights each weekend. You can use this boundary as a reason for saying ""No."" For instance, ""I would love to go out with you Saturday, but I have plans Friday. I never go out two nights in a row because I get too tired.""
You can also set boundaries in regards to personal commitments. You can, for example, have a rule that you only volunteer for two charity events per month if this is reasonable for you given your schedule.

, People often won't take ""No"" for an answer. If you say ""No"" to someone, they may use persuasion techniques to try and change your mind. Be aware of potential persuasion techniques so you can establish a firm offense.People may try to guilt you into doing something to reciprocate a favor. Remember, just because someone did you a favor does not mean you owe them. Friends do not keep score.
People may also ask twice. If you say ""No"" to one thing, they may try to get you to agree to a smaller commitment or favor. Remember to be firm. Keep saying ""No.""
A person may also try to get you to do something by comparing you to other people. They may say another person agreed to help. You are not another person. You do not have to do something simply because someone else did.

, It may sound silly, but you can actually practice saying ""No"" alone. Try standing before a mirror and looking at yourself. Practice giving a firm, ""No"" to someone so you get comfortable with the words. Many people are nervous about saying ""No"" and may say ""Yes"" due to anxiety. Practicing can help quell some of this anxiety., Your knee-jerk response to being asked for a favor may be to say ""Yes."" Make a habit of not giving an automatic ""Yes"" all the time. When asked to do something, instead respond with, ""I'll think about it"" or ""Can I get back to you on that? I'd like to, but I might have something scheduled.""Saying ""I'll think about it"" will usually get the person off your back. This will give you time to genuinely consider your response.
After agreeing to think something over, you can decide later whether or not you agree. If you decide against doing something, you can give a firm ""No"" later.
For example, a friend asks if you'll watch her cat over the holiday weekend. Say, ""I have to look over my schedule. Let me think about it.""

, While you should be firm when saying ""No,"" you'll also feel better if you're polite. When letting someone down, soften the blow by starting with a compliment. Express gratitude at having been asked or invited.For example, ""I'm glad you feel comfortable asking me to watch Bella. It means a lot knowing that you trust me with your cat because I know how much you care about her.""

, After the initial kindness, you can say ""No."" Be firm here. You want to make it clear you are giving a firm ""No"" so the person does not press the issue or ask you again.For example, ""I just don't really have the time to run back and forth from your place this weekend. I already have a lot of plans with family.""

, You want to leave things on a good note. You can be firm without being rude or aggressive. Thank the person for thinking of you, and wish them good luck.For example, ""Again, I'm glad to know you trust me with Bella. Good luck finding someone else to watch her.""

, If you need to learn to say ""No,"" you may avoid it by habit. Think about any underlying reasons you may be uncomfortable turning someone down. This can help you identify how your inability to say ""No"" may be irrational.Maybe you're a people pleaser by nature. You may not want to upset other people.
You may also avoid confrontation. Even a small confrontation may be stressful for you.
You may also worry about making people angry. You may irrationally feel people will not like you if you say ""No.""

, If you do not want to do something, then you don’t have to do it. Try to remind yourself of this in situations where you can’t think of a reason to say no.


For example, if a friend invites you to see a concert with him or her and you simply don’t like live music, then say so. Try saying, “No thanks. I am not a fan of live music, so I am going to sit this one out.”
Or, if someone invites you out on a night when you just don’t feel like going anywhere, then try saying, ""You know, I really don't feel like coming out tonight, maybe another time.""

, You need to embrace your own boundaries to work on saying ""No."" Boundaries are personal, and usually subjective. It's okay if your boundaries are different from someone else's. Be comfortable with your own boundaries and allow yourself to stand by them.Boundaries are a projection of who you are. Therefore, there is no inherent value in boundaries. Your boundaries are not better or worse than another person's.
Never compare your boundaries to someone else's. You may, for example, feel guilty that a co-worker is more eager to go to noisy bars for work parties. This is simply off limits to you.
Your co-worker may be more extroverted or less shy than you. This is okay. It's okay for you to say ""No"" to such events, even if others don't, as they violate your personal boundaries.

, If you tend to ruminate over decisions, this can make saying ""No"" more difficult. After saying ""No,"" accept your decision and move forward.Focus on how good you feel. If you said ""No"" to something potentially draining or stressful, you should feel relieved.
Prioritize your positive feelings about saying ""No."" Try to push out feelings of guilt.

, Saying ""Yes"" too often could lead to resentment. If you're a people pleaser by nature, you may say ""Yes"" more frequently than is healthy. If you, for example, agree to help every time a friend needs a favor, you may begin to resent that friend. While you may feel temporarily guilty over saying ""No,"" it's better to deal with momentary guilt than to risk tanking a valuable relationship., Part of the reason why some people struggle to say “no” is because they don’t feel like their wants and needs are as important as other people’s wants and needs. To avoid feeling guilty from saying “no,” try to work on building up your self-worth. Some strategies that you might try include:Writing a list of your strengths.
Using positive self-talk to encourage yourself.
Exploring your interests and making time for yourself.

Avoiding comparing yourself to other people.

Setting realistic goals for yourself.

Think about her age.,
Ask your parents about ending conflicts.,
Learn more about your sister.,
Be nice to her.,
Let her get her way.,
Try to agree.",How to Learn to Love Your Little Sister," You both simply have needs that differ, so your parents handle each of you in unique ways. Sometimes it may seem that your parents give your little sister more attention, but she may just be less independent than you are. Smaller children need more of everything – including more attention., You may feel that people like your little sister more than you. She may have different afterschool hobbies that make her seem more popular. The fact that she is different from you is what makes both of you so unique. An important step toward loving your sister is accepting that you can be different people.

, It can be hard in a large family household to find a space that is entirely your own. An important part of learning to love other family members is having a place you can be on your own. This could be a treehouse, or a closet you keep your games in. Just make sure you don’t claim a shared space as your own. Ask your parents before deciding a corner of the house is all your own.


As time goes on, you may feel comfortable inviting your little sister in, and sharing your special space with her. This will be a bonding experience for both of you.

, If you are a boy, it can be frustrating seeing the kind of attention a little sister gets. Your father may be gentler with her and tougher on you. This isn’t because your parents love you less than her – it is a common parenting style. It is important for you to recognize that they don’t necessarily mean to act differently toward you, but it is an aspect of the society in which you live., Your little sister may young enough that she still needs more love and attention than more mature siblings. This is an important part of childhood. You had the same level of attention when you were her age, but probably didn’t realize it. It is important for you to accept that you two are in different stages of childhood. Pitch in and help your parents give your little sister the love and attention she needs, and you will feel it on your end as well.

, It is not always easy to grow up with your little sister, and fights are likely to happen. Your parents have been handling conflicts for a long time, and they will have some tips for moving past disputes. It is often a matter of seeing the conflict for what it is, and removing it from the context of who is fighting.


It is important for you to learn to settle disputes between yourselves. However, know that your parents are ready to step in if one or both of you can’t let put down your defenses.

, Find out what she likes and what her hobbies are. You can ask her, your parents, family, and/or her friends to learn how you can share experiences with her. You might also just watch her to see how she likes to spend her time. You may not share all the same interests, but connecting with one or a few hobbies can go a long way in cementing a friendship.

#Ask your little sister to hang out. Doing what she likes is a good way to make connections with her. If she is young, she may not have developed the recognition that she should try to do things others enjoy. Help her gain this skill by joining in on her activities, and then gradually introducing her to yours.

Come up with lots of suggestions of things to do. Like drawing, watching a movie, having a tea party, etc. and let her pick.

, You want to be a role model to your younger sister, not an enemy. Modeling friendly behavior is a good way to teach her adult life skills as well as make you two closer. It may not always be easy to be nice to her, but it is important to show that you are able to take her mood changes in stride.


If she is acting up, it may not be about you. Learn to recognize when your sister just needs someone to talk to.

, Although you may not like this or think this is fair, young children don’t always have the mental capacity give in to others. By letting her have her way she will like you more because she is getting what she wants. Once she is your friend, you can gradually show her the rewards of letting others get their way sometimes.

, You and your sister have varying interests and opinions. Though you may not always agree with her, try to see her point of view and accept it. You come from the same background, so you should be able to put yourself in her shoes to understand her. Make a point of finding things to agree on to build the foundation of a great relationship.

Stay honest and open.,
Continue to compromise.,
Learn to give and accept an apology.",How to Keep Your Wife Happy2," Honest communication is the key to any long and stable relationship. If you want to keep your wife happy, then you should always share your feelings and be happy to listen to what she has to say. You should feel comfortable sharing your feelings with your wife and being open about your thoughts, even if you have a hard time expressing them.


If there's something on your mind, say it. Don't deal with a difficult situation alone.
If you're upset about something your wife did, bring it up. It's better to talk about your feelings than to be passive-aggressive.
If your wife asks you about your honest opinion about a new outfit or haircut, don't be a fool and say she's looked better -- just tell her she looks beautiful no matter what. She obviously just wants you to confirm that she thinks she looks great.
Time your honesty. If you have something important to say to your wife, do it when she's relatively stress-free and can give you her time and energy.
You may be worried over a recent flirtation with a colleague at work, but you should tell her the truth, not deal with it on your own. Open, honest communication is the key to a relationship. Your wife is your partner in life and deserves to know the whole truth about you and your activities.

, Compromising is a major part of strong communication. You should be able to compromise and to make decisions as a unit instead of always looking out for yourself. You should work on being able to discuss an important decision and finding a resolution that will make you both happy.


First, take time to listen. Each of you should say why your opinion is important to you and what it would mean to make the decision.
Be thoughtful. You can even make a list of pros and cons when you're making a decision together.
Take turns compromising. Sometimes a decision will only make one person happy (such as choosing to live in one city over another), but the next time a big decision comes, make sure the other person gets his way.
Make sure both people are actually compromising. Don't guilt your wife into always doing what you want because you'll be so upset if you don't get your way.

, If you really want to make your wife happy, then you should know that being happy is much more important than being right. You need to swallow your pride and step up if you've made a mistake, and be reasonable enough to accept your wife's apology if she is the one who erred.


When you apologize, be sincere. Maintain eye contact and let your wife know that you're really sorry. She won't accept your apology if you sound like you're just doing it because you don't have a choice.
Learn to accept an apology. You can still be mad, but make it clear that you do accept your wife's apology even though you need some time to cool off.

Understand the difficulties of her career or occupation.",How to Keep Your Wife Happy4," If you're lucky enough to have kids, then you should try to spend as much time with them as you can, instead of waiting for your wife to get tired and then taking over. Your wife loves your kids, but she would love it if you helped out as much as you could.


You don't have to take turns with the kids, either. You can cement your bond by taking the kids to the park or having a family movie night together.
If you work while your wife stays at home with the kids, try to make as much time as you can to see them when you're home.
Pick some weekends when you hang out with the kids to give your wife some time to rest. Motherhood is a beautiful thing, but it's also exhausting.

, Part of keeping your wife happy means giving her some time to herself. Though it may seem nearly impossible to give her some space when your lives are so entwined, letting her do her own thing once in a while will make you appreciate each other even more.


Let her visit her family without you from time to time. You don't have to be there at every single family event -- unless she insists.
Let her have a girls' night with her friends once in a while. You don't have to be there at every social event, either.
Let her pursue her own hobbies and interests. You don't have to do all of the same sports, love all of the same television shows, or read all of the same books.

, Take the time to talk to your wife about her career and give her advice when necessary. Remember how hard it is to be a wife, a mother, and a career woman all at the same time.


Let your wife vent about her job from time to time. She needs your love and support.
If she's having a tough week at work, you should make her lunch or drop in with some coffee, and take over the chores at home for a little while.
If she's a stay-at-home mom, remember that this is a full-time job too, and not an easy one. Be sympathetic to her needs and the difficulties of her daily life.

Listen for his use of the word ""we"" rather than ""I"".,
See if he apologizes when he's wrong.,
Check out whether his words match his actions.,
Remember that saying ""I love you"" isn't enough.",How to Know That Your Boyfriend Really Loves You2," When someone loves you, he considers you when he's thinking about his daily life. When he makes plans for the future, he includes you.Does he include you in his plans, or does he make plans for himself alone?
When he talks to his friends or family on the phone, does he mention things you've done together? Does he let them know when he's with you? Or does he avoid talking to his friends when he's with you?

, Some men have an easy time saying they're sorry, but their actions might not change. Some men refuse to say they're sorry, even when they're clearly in the wrong. Notice how your boyfriend reacts when he's done something hurtful or insensitive. Does he apologize?If someone apologizes easily, but seems to repeat the same behavior patterns, his apologies aren't very meaningful.
A boyfriend who is stubborn may have a hard time apologizing for when he's wrong, but if he loves you he'll be uncomfortable until things are right between you again.

, The boyfriend who says things that his actions don't back up is essentially untrustworthy. Someone whose actions and words doesn’t match has a disconnect with his thinking. This disconnect is demonstrated through his actions and words.When someone's words and actions don't match up, he isn't trustworthy. Even if he loves you, you won't be able to trust him.
Many times, a boyfriend will try to explain away this disconnect through confessing his negative life experiences. This often has the result of girls feeling sorry for him and trying to help.
Other times, someone caught in a disconnect will try to blame you. He'll turn your conversation around to accuse you of negative thinking. This is a warning sign.

, Someone who says, ""I love you,"" but doesn't act in loving, caring ways doesn't really love you. The words ""I love you"" are sometimes used in dishonest, manipulative ways. When someone says, ""I love you,"" consider if their actions match their words.If you aren't sure whether you should trust someone's words, ask a trusted person for help figuring it out. Maybe they've noticed something that you haven't.
If you feel convinced your boyfriend really loves you, then you're ready to think about whether or not that's good enough for you. If your boyfriend loves you, it doesn't mean that you have to love him back.

Evaluate your long-term goals, both personally and as a couple.,
Think about the things you can and cannot talk to her about.,
Make sure you're comfortable sitting in silence, or just relaxing together.,
Introduce her to other important people in your life.,
Look for a woman who helps you become better.,
Note if you think about her when making decisions.,
Consider how she makes you feel.,
Note if you think about her when she isn't around.",How to Know if She's Right for You1," Marriage or long-term commitment affects more than your love life. It is a financial and physical union, requiring compromise and sacrifice in order for both people feel happy and fulfilled. You want to talk about the future together: as a ""we,"" not as an ""I"" to be sure this is the right on for you. Some questions to ask include:


Where do you plan to be in the next 5 years? Is she in that plan?
Have you shared your goals and dreams with each other? Does she support yours, and do you support hers?;
, Communication is the foundation, flooring, and soil of a strong relationship, and you should be able to talk about almost anything with your potential life partner. Feeling like you're holding back parts of your past, your desires, or your concerns will only lead to festering issues and arguments that will, in time, explode. If you are going to share the rest of your life with someone, make sure you're actually sharing it.


This doesn't mean she knows 100% of everything you've ever done. It just means that you feel comfortable sharing it if it were to come up.

, When you're first meeting people, silences can be awkward and uncomfortable. But those quiet moments where you don't feel like you need to impress or entertain her are incredibly important for the health of a long-term relationship. If you can just exist together for a few moments, without goals, anxiety, or worry, then you're allowed to be yourself. Feeling like you can be both yourself and still with her is a sure sign she might be right for you.Try doing co-puttering activities, such as reading or watching TV in the same room.
Make sure that you maintain your independence as well, such as by doing things on your own or with your friends., If you're unwilling to bring her around to meet those important to you, it is very unlikely that she's the right one for you. You should want to ""show her off,"" not trying to hide her from other people in your life because you're afraid they will disapprove. If you can't wait for for her to meet everyone, then chances are good she's a keeper.If your friends and family all don't like a person, chances are she isn't right for you. Remember that your friends know you well, and they're looking out for your happiness, too., Does she challenge you to get better, helping your along your path? Do you help and challenge her to be the best she can be too? The right couples see everything as a team, even if that just means providing encouraging words when you or her goes through tough times. Does she inspire you to go out less and work on that passion project? Does you get excited for her when she publishes a new article or poem? This sort of support is obvious when she is the right one for you.


Ask yourself if you admire her. It is pretty important for couple to admire each-other. You need to like what she does and who she is in order to maintain a great relationship.

, She should be a major part of all of your major decisions, not an afterthought that you think will just go along with whatever you say. When offered an opportunity or making important choices, the right woman for you will naturally flicker into your mind. You make decisions and work together as a team naturally, becoming stronger and happier as a result., She's the right person if you feel happy, safe, and loved with her. At the end of the day, all of the other tips -- from communication to planning -- come from this simple feeling. If you feel comfortable in her presence, like there is nowhere you'd rather be, then you should stay with her. If you feel happy at the idea of spending a life with her, then pursue that life. And if you feel safe against problems, issues, or stress with her by your side, chances are good that you will be.Long relationships are never easy, but the right woman will feel like she is easy to be with. This open comfort is often the only clue you need to know she's right for you.

, Though she may feel like the best and most obvious decision you've ever made, you should still take some time and space to think through this alone. Even if she is the right girl for you, it's a lot easier to go with the flow and feel happy when you're together. But a strong relationship usually means you're thinking about her all the time -- alone and together, at home and abroad. If you don't miss her when she's gone or feel the passion fade when you separate, then it is going to be difficult to live with her 24/7.

Express honesty and openness.,
Empathize with your partner.,
Appreciate your partner.,
Listen actively to your partner.,
Watch for nonverbal cues.,
Ask open-ended questions.",How to Keep Your Relationship Healthy1," When you talk to your partner, tell them about your day. Be completely open with what bothers you and what you enjoy. Be specific about your emotional wants and needs. By opening yourself up, you’re expressing vulnerability and trust in your partner. Furthermore, by being so open with them, you invite them to be just as honest with you.


If something is bothering you, express it in a gentle way, but you should make your voice heard. For example, you can say, ""I love you very much, but sometimes, I feel frustrated when I come home to a dirty house. Can we come up with a solution?"";
, When your partner expresses a secret or insecurity, they are entrusting you with a very deep part of themselves. Don’t laugh at your partner or dismiss their problems. Express empathy. You may hug them, or reassure them that you still love them. Tell them that you understand, and thank them for being honest with you.

, Make a daily habit to thank your partner for what they do. Compliment them on their strengths. When they do something for you, thank them. This will make your partner happier, and it will make sure that neither partner is taken for granted., Communication is a two-way road. When your partner speaks, listen and remember what they say. Active listening requires your full attention on your partner. Keep steady eye contact, and do not interrupt them as they are speaking.Occasionally, you may repeat back what they just said to reaffirm that you were listening and that you understand their problems. For example, you may say, “I understand that you are frustrated at work” or “What I am hearing is that you have been depressed lately.”

, Your partner might state that nothing is bothering them, but you should pay attention to their body language to know whether or not they need comfort. While you should not use these to pry into your partner’s life, you can take steps to make them feel better if they are grumpy or tired.


Folded arms may indicate that they are defensive or insecure.
Lack of eye contact may mean that they are bored, ashamed, or evasive.
Turning away from you can be their way of ending the conversation.
If their voice becomes louder, they may be thinking that they are not being heard in the relationship, or they may be trying to escalate an argument. If their voice becomes softer, they may be uncertain of something., Broad questions can give your partner room to express themselves. By inviting them to answer a question, you are asking your partner to communicate with you. Allow them time to answer the question.Examples of open questions include:

“How do you feel about your job?”
”Where do you see yourself in five years?”
”If there is anything you could change about this house, what would it be?”

Know what you'd like out of the relationship and be upfront about it.,
Discuss your ideas about money, saving, and bill-paying.,
Search for compromise or compatibility on your future together.,
Work together on strong sexual chemistry and compatibility.,
Talk about major life events.,
Consider seeing a marriage counselor.",How to Know if She's Right for You2," Say you've been with her for a few months now and are ready to move in together. Don't try and beat around the bush, hoping she'll ask to move in or offer you a place -- be upfront and honest about your desires. Even if the first conversation is difficult or awkward, this will save you much harder discussions later on, you have little to gain by hiding your desires and relationship goals: if she agrees, you can figure out how to make it work, if she disagrees, then you saved several months of miscommunication and cross-talk.


If you can't have this or the following intelligent, but difficult, discussions with her at all then you already have your answer-- she's not right for you., If you're going to be moving in together, taking things to the next level, or getting married, then you need to talk about money as soon as possible. Few things get between couples so completely as unresolved money issues, and it has more to do with if she's right for you than many other trivial facts like star signs and siblings. Discuss:


What would she do if she won the lottery? In other words, where does she prioritize spending?
Would she rather, in general, spend money on a slightly better life now or save that money for a better retirement later?
If you were down on your luck financially (fired, sick, lower-paying job, etc.), would she support you? Would you do the same thing for her?, If Ms. Right really wants to live near her family in the Southwest while you can't see yourself ever leaving NYC, you'll need to work out some form of compromise if things are going to work. Unfortunately, the right woman for you is not just a matter of personality but your careers, goals, and circumstances. Don't avoid them, especially if you're worried about these differences causing strife. If she's right for you, you'll find a way to work through these geographic differences in a way that is fair and enjoyable for both of you.


How important is it to life close to her family? To yours?
Are there places she must be for her career? Are there places you must be for yours?

, Sex is important in a long, committed relationship -- not just having it, but having it equitably and happily. Talking about your sex life is difficult, but there are few marriage counselors who don't point towards its importance. Finding compatible sex lives is mostly about how frequently you'd like it, how comfortable you are with kink and adventurous sex (including if it is important to one of both of you), and how to find compromise where you don't match up.


How often would you like to have sex?
Are you willing to try new things, or do you like to keep things romantic and simple?
If your sex drives don't match up, how can you make sure you're both happy?, There are a thousand different choices that face couples, and you'll never be able to discuss all of them before they happen. But there are some major moments to consider before jumping into a committed, long-term relationship with someone, avoiding these major potential conflicts before they can blow up:


Do you both want kids? If so, how many?
Do you see yourself getting married at some point and ""settling down,"" or is that still too far in the future? Does this line up with her?
If a parent gets sick or needs support, are you okay with supporting them or having them move in?

, Marriage counselors are not just for when you are having problems in a relationship. If you are still not sure if you want a long term relationship with your girlfriend, then a marriage counselor can help you and your girlfriend to assess different areas of compatibility. This might be a helpful way to find out if you are both on the same page about major life decisions, such as careers, kids, and other goals.

Consider why you're in the dating game.,
Ask yourself what you want in a partner to be happy.,
Get to know her as a friend before asking her out.,
Look for compatibility rather than similarity.,
Trust your own judgement and take the plunge.",How to Know if She's Right for You3," You can't know if a woman is right for you if you don't know what she is right for. People date for a variety of reasons, and it almost always goes over more smoothly when you find people with similar dating goals. Are you looking for someone fun but low-key, or are you searching for the special someone to live the rest of your life with? You could even be in the middle, staying open minded and just hoping to meet someone fun-- but you should think about it first to help find the right girl for you.

, Have you always thought that the right girl has to be intelligent? Has to like dogs? Has to have brown hair? While no woman is perfect, there are some things that just feel important to you in a significant other. The more of these things your potential date matches up to, the more you should take the risk and ask her out.


Ask yourself about the ""big picture"" things, not the small facts: would she ever go camping or does she need to love the city,? Does she spend money freely or save frequently? Are their hobbies you feel like your special someone must share with you?
Don't think of this so much as a checklist for women to reach as much as a map to help your find people you're compatible with.

, This doesn't mean you need to spend months courting someone before asking them on a date. Rather, it means to get past the surface with some pleasant conversation before paying for dinner. If you can't strike up a conversation with her, she probably won't be a fun date, so this is your chance to see how compatible you really are.

]

It is important for you to admire and respect her and off course like her for who she is. And if she is the one you used to dream about when you were a little boy then you are good to go.

, This is a classic dating ""mistake:"" confusing similar interests and ideas for chemistry or compatibility. Think about it -- there are plenty of people you've met at work, school, on sports teams, etc. who share many similar interests as you, but who you profoundly don't get along with. While having shared interest is important, feeling compatible is far more enjoyable. While compatibility takes more than a date to determine, some important things to look for include:


Accepting and openness to your hobbies/interests that you don't share.
Willingness to try new things with you, or learn about your interests/hobbies.
Does not try to convince you that they are ""right,"" and accepts differing viewpoints.
You feel comfortable being yourself, not trying to think of the ""perfect"" thing each time., When determining whether or not to ask a girl out, never forget that this is a low-risk, high-reward game. If she says no, then you both move on about your lives with only a brief moment of awkwardness. If she says yes, then you both get the exciting beginning of a new relationship.


A date should not be well-researched and ""perfect."" That's what the date is for -- seeing if she actually is the right one moving forward.

"
"
Go on dates.,
Surprise each other.,
Do household tasks together.,
Spend time apart.,
Talk about sex.",How to Keep Your Relationship Healthy2," Even if you have been together for a long time, it is important to still plan activities with your partner. Ideally, you should have one night a week that you spend together, but if you have children or other responsibilities, this may be difficult. Try to have a date night at least once a month.

, Relationships can become routine quickly. To keep the spark going, you may have to think of fun and creative ways to surprise your partner. Surprises can include fun activities, small gifts, or even a romantic night together. Some ideas include:


Cook their favorite meal
Buy their favorite treat after work
Give a romantic massage

, The healthiest relationships are ones in which there is an equal distribution of household work. Unfortunately, in most relationships, chores and household tasks fall disproportionately on one partner. Try doing your chores together to make it less of a burden and more of a couple activity. When there are bills to be paid, sit down and go over them together. By enforcing responsibility between the two of you, you will increase trust and strengthen your bond while spending quality time together., Being in a relationship does not mean you are glued to your partner permanently. Balance your time spent together with time spent apart. Go out with your friends; engage in personal hobbies; read a book. Most importantly, encourage your partner to do the same. The time you do spend together will be so much more precious, and you will not grow bored of each other., No matter what stage of the relationship you’re at or what your sexual situation is, you should be honest with your partner about your needs, desires, limits, and expectations. Encourage them to tell you as well. While this may seem awkward at first, it is an important aspect of every relationship.Sex should never be withheld as a punishment, nor should either partner engage in sex if they don’t want it."
"
State your expectations.,
Maintain boundaries.,
Avoid lying.,
Let go of grudges.",How to Keep Your Relationship Healthy3," Do not assume you and your partner have the same idea of what trust means. It is good to establish what each of you would consider a violation of trust. Some, for example, would see physical cheating as a breach of trust but not emotional cheating, whereas others believe that emotional cheating is as bad as physical cheating., Set certain boundaries and parameters for your relationship. These can sexual, personal, social, or financial. Both partners should agree on these boundaries and respect them. By talking through such limits, you will avoid conflict, and if someone does cross the line, you will have established a basis for discussing it. By respecting your partner’s boundaries, you are signaling that you trust them completely to act on their own without betraying you.


Common boundaries include understanding each partner’s expectations and limits on intimacy, public displays of affection, and confidentiality.

, Even small “white” lies can create a rift in your relationship. Start a habit of being completely honest with your partner. Even if you don’t want to bother them with your problems, it is healthier in the long term to be upfront. Encourage them to be just as honest.

, Holding onto anger or conflict only worsens the problem. If they did something to you months ago, you should forgive them for it and move on. Don’t use what they said or did in the past against them.If you having trouble letting go of something that happened in the past, remind yourself of the good things they are doing now. Purposely focus on the nice and pleasant things they do instead of the things that annoy you."
"
Avoid complaining about your partner in public.,
Keep your partner’s secrets.,
Respect their parents.,
Maintain boundaries with family members.,
Debate, do not fight, in front of your children.,
Honor your partner’s parenting style.",How to Keep Your Relationship Healthy4," While there are things you may find annoying about your partner, it is not helpful to tell everyone you know about it. While you may have a confidant or two outside of your relationship, you should not complain at work, social events, or family gatherings. Your partner might find out, and it will hurt them, damaging the trust they have in you.

, If your partner has told you something confidential, you should not share it with others, even your closest friends. While they may swear to never tell, you have already broken your partner’s trust.

, No matter how difficult your in-laws are, they are still your partner’s parents. Partners can feel defensive when their parents are insulted, and it could sour your relationship. Try to accept your in-laws’ different way of life. You do not have to let it intrude on your relationship, but you should understand that they have their own special relationship with your partner.If you do not get along with your in-laws, discuss the problem with your spouse in a gentle manner. Do not insult your in-laws or call them names, but do point out which behaviors are troubling you and why.

, While your relationship may have united two families, you may find that your families are causing divisions between you and your partner. Establish with your partner certain boundaries that apply to both of your families. Do not favor your own parents over your partner’s, and make sure that they act accordingly.Should family members call before they visit, or can they drop by unannounced?
Which holidays will you spend with which members of the family?
Are you comfortable with taking in any of your parents when they grow old, sick, or feeble?
What kinds of gifts are acceptable for family members to give your children?

, Children are extremely receptive to their parents’ behaviors. Disagreeing or settling a difference of opinion calmly in front of your children can teach them conflict resolution skills. That said, you and your partner should never raise your voices or physically fight in front of your children. This can hurt your children and impair their social development. If you do fight in front of your children, be sure to apologize in front of them as well to show them how healthy reconciliation occurs.

, If you disagree with how your partner parents, you should not undermine their authority in front of the children. If your partner has already told your children one thing, do not disagree and tell them another. This only reduces the authority both you and your partner have over your children. When alone with your partner, bring up the questionable tactic. Tell them why you’re uncomfortable with it, and ask them if they are willing to avoid it in the future.

Find a private space.,
Handle the issue when it occurs.,
Maintain a calm demeanor.,
Avoid blame and name-calling.,
Cooperate to find a solution.,
Apologize and forgive.",How to Keep Your Relationship Healthy5," Arguing in public will only worsen your conflict. You or your partner may feel embarrassed, and you may not want others to overhear sensitive topics. As soon as possible, try to find a quiet, private space where you can both discuss your feelings openly.

, Do not let your anger stew inside of you. It is important to confront conflict as it arises. Bring up the issue to your partner in a calm, level tone, and ask them if you can take a few minutes to discuss the issue before you go on with your day.

, Arguing can be emotional, but to avoid escalating your fight, try practicing some calming techniques before and during your argument. Close your eyes and breathe in deeply. Visualize a calm, happy place. Step back from your partner to create some space between you. Slow down your speech so that you have room to breathe and think., It is key to remember that you are arguing about an issue, not about each other. While your partner may have contributed to the issue, it is unproductive to blame them for the issue. This will cause them to become defensive, and they may blame you right back, instead of working to solve the issue. Furthermore, do not call your partner names like “slob” or “idiot.” This will only make both of you angrier., Both you and your partner should submit ideas for a solution to the problem. These solutions should be practical steps both of you can take to solve the problem. Both of you must commit to these solutions. Do not place the entire burden on either yourself or your partner.


If your partner is being hesitant or stubborn, ask them open-ended questions to draw out answers. You can try asking, “What would be an ideal solution for you?” or “how do you think this would be best handled?”

, Recognize when you are wrong and apologize for it. Be specific in your apology. This will increase trust between you and your partner while opening up room for your partner to apologize as well. It is important to forgive your partner if they apologize, just as you would want them to forgive you.


After the argument, let go of your anger. If you both have reached a solution, honor your promise to do better. Don’t go to bed angry!

Identify what was romantic about your vacation.During your vacation, you probably had moments when you felt more connected to your partner, such as during a beautiful sunset or while listening to your significant other order dinner in a foreign language.,
Explore interesting sites in your area.,
Eat exotic cuisine at home or in a local restaurant.Trying new foods is often a part of vacation romance.,

For example, if you felt more connected to your partner during a nature hike, then you might start taking long walks with your significant other or go on hikes at a local park over the weekend. If watching the sunset every night was part of your vacation romance, then try watching the sunset together from your living room window or backyard.;
, New experiences can ignite your passion while you are on vacation with your significant other.Exploring mysterious ruins, touring ancient castles, or visiting historical sites can be exciting and this may translate into a deeper connection with your partner. To maintain this type of excitement, you might consider exploring interesting places in your own community.


For example, you might take a drive to a local historical site, visit a local art museum, or go on a walking tour in your community. Look for the kinds of activities that people do when they visit your town or city and try some of them out.

, The experience of eating exotic cuisine can bring you closer with your partner. You can easily include exotic cuisine into your normal routine.


For example, you can try cooking something new together. Try getting a cookbook from somewhere you have visited (or always wanted to visit) and prepare a meal using the recipes. Or, if you are not a fan of cooking, then you can also try out a local restaurant that has exotic cuisine.

, Sometimes people learn new skills while they are on vacation and the experience of learning with your partner can be romantic.If you enjoyed learning new things with your partner, then you might consider taking a course together somewhere in your community or working together to learn a new skill at home.


For example, you could take a cooking or wine making class. Or, you could work together to learn a foreign language by borrowing some language instruction materials from your local library. You could even try to learn the language of a place you hope to visit on your next vacation, such as French if you want to go to France.

, Dreaming about the next vacation that you take can also be a good way to keep the vacation romance alive. Try setting aside a time when you are both feeling relaxed, enjoy a nice dinner, and discuss where you would like to go for your next vacation.


You can look up activities, hotels, and restaurants you’d like to try. Just have fun dreaming about the vacation and don’t worry about logistics (costs, timelines, etc.) for now. This activity should leave you feeling more connected to your partner and looking forward to your next romantic vacation.

Touch her often.,
Learn her likes and dislikes.,

Practice self-disclosure.,
Listen.,
Tell the truth.,
Lift her mood when she is sad.,
Engage in open communication.,
Let her meet your family as your connection deepens.,
Maintain separate interests beyond the relationship.,
Support her.",How to Keep Your Girlfriend Interested in You," Being yourself in your relationship is one of the biggest steps you can take to maintaining your girlfriend’s interest and being satisfied in the relationship. If you are constantly having to adjust who you are to please your partner you will have trouble developing intimacy with this individual. Knowing that you can be true to yourself and still be accepted is important in sustaining your happiness and your girlfriend’s long-term.Don’t mistake being authentic and genuine to being resistant to change. Everyone has some traits in which they can improve, and relationships can be a great vehicle for us to better ourselves. If you do change, just be mindful that you are sticking to your life values and priorities.;
, In the early stages of a relationship, keeping interest revolves around developing a strong bond. Making an effort to spend time together alone allows you to forge a connection with your girlfriend. Time together doesn’t have to involve pricey dates. This shared time can be any activity that the both of you like and that enables you to enjoy one another, such as hiking, working out, or trying a new dance class., Starting at infancy, touch becomes one of our most basic needs and first forms of language.We are comforted, soothed, and excited by the touch of another.


Physical intimacy of any kind is vital to the health of a relationship. However, non-sexual touching, such as cuddling, hugging, or rubbing her back can induce a positive mood in your partner and strengthen your bond., Knowing what your girlfriend is passionate about can deepen your bond.Talk to her about her hobbies and interests. However, it’s also important to know her dislikes, so that you can avoid doing things or discussing topics that make her uncomfortable. Ironically, acting interested in her can help her to maintain interest in you.

, Laughter has a long list of benefits for physical and mental health. Research also shows that the social benefits of laughter can strengthen your relationships, help defuse conflict, and attract others to you.To maintain the interest of your girlfriend, make her laugh by playing games, watching funny movies or YouTube videos, or just doing silly things together.

, Vulnerability feels scary, but it actually links us to others in a positive way.A great way to be vulnerable with your girlfriend is to share your personal thoughts, ideas, values, goals or secrets. This improves the intimacy you share with your girlfriend and can provide you with a sense of support.


Carefully judge between high-level and low-level self-disclosures until you feel more comfortable sharing. For example, you may not be quite ready to share the details about your parents’ divorce, but you may want to tell your girlfriend about your career aspirations or silly beliefs you had as a child.

, Having a lack of communication is one of the main reasons a relationship fails.Sharing with your girlfriend is important, but so is allowing her to share. Effective communication with your girlfriend begins with being an effective listener. During a conversation, try to use the LARA method:Listen by attuning to her body language, tone, and words. Receive what she is saying without striving to respond. Listen without judgment. Your whole goal should be to understand how she feels and the message she is trying to convey.
Affirm or acknowledge her message. Show that you have heard what she says by responding with “I understand” or “I see what you are trying to say.”
Respond by asking a clarifying question or summarizing what you think your girlfriend said.
Add your own thoughts and feelings in a constructive manner. Use “I” statements, such as “I am happy that you can talk to me about things like this. I hope we continue to communicate with each other in the future”.

, Honesty is an integral aspect of all relationships. If your girlfriend mistrusts you or doubts the sincerity of your words or actions, she may begin to lose interest in the relationship. What’s more, even if you stay together the dynamic of the relationship is damaged by lies. Strive to be honest in your communications with your girlfriend (even if you worry it will hurt her or she will not be receptive) since lies build up walls rather than tear them down., When your partner is sad, you might try anything and everything to “fix” her. Of course, you want her to be upbeat and normal. Women, however, want to feel supported and understood. Instead of trying to fix your girlfriend, work on comforting her. This will help her to feel more connected to you. Ways to comfort a sad girlfriend include:Ask her what you can do to help.
Talk to her about what’s going right or positive parts of her day.
Do uplifting and positive things together
Tell her you care about her.
Give her space and time alone when she needs it.

, Being receptive to feedback about the relationship, and being willing to provide your own can really make a difference in a healthy and lasting relationship. Tips for maintaining positive interactions include the following: Stick to the 48-hour rule. If one of you is still angry about a situation after 48 hours, talk about it. If not, let it go.
Be wary of body language. Crossed arms or legs indicate anger or defensiveness. Face your partner with an erect posture and open arms and legs. Unclench your hands.
Refrain from attacking. Take a moment to think and carefully select your words before speaking. Strive to use “I” statements that minimize your partner becoming defensive.

, After the courtship has endured for a length of time, you should show your girlfriend you are serious and committed to the relationship by bringing her home to meet your family. Failing to introduce her to your parents after too long sends her the message that you don’t see this partnership going anywhere. Keep her interested by further opening up to her and letting her meet the other important people in your life.


Since your girlfriend and your parents will interpret this as a meaningful move that symbolizes your commitment to the relationship, you should only take your girlfriend home if you are truly serious about her., Being in a healthy, happy relationship means that both partners have the opportunity to enjoy life together and separately. Ensure that both you and your girlfriend have friendships, interests, and hobbies apart as well as together., Your girlfriend will likely experience many ups and downs during the course of your relationship. Feelings like she has you as a source of support can strengthen your bond and actually make her want to reciprocate being supportive to you. Supporting your girlfriend means creating a safe place for her to feel at home with being herself, sharing with you and even making mistakes.

Being supportive might include standing by your girlfriend during tough times, challenging her to do and be her best, giving her the space to explore her identity and grow, and never judging or placing constraints on her.

Don't wait for your friend to feel hurt or angry that you've grown apart.,
Learn more about your friend's allergy.,
Think about what your friend's life looks like.,
If you're part of a bigger friend group, you can even get together with your other friends - with or without the allergic person - and make a list of animal-free social spaces in your city, especially homes.,
Talk to your allergic friend about your relationship post-pet.,
Don't forget to call and make plans with your friend.,
Try to spend some of your time together in homes, instead of restaurants, bars or cafes.,
Go on vacations together!,
Be aware of which events and parties are pet-free, and try to make as many accessible to your friend as possible.,
Give your friend a way to see you easily, and to get access to you, since remember, they can't just drop by anymore.,
Discuss your future with your friend.,
If your future together doesn't look promising, or you do resent the changes to your life (or your family or partner does), be straightforward about it - there are other potential BFFs out there who don't have pets, and your friend might be better off cutting his or her losses and finding other people who will fill his or her life in an easy, happy way.",How to Keep Relationships With People Who Are Severely Allergic to Your Pet," Be the first one to take action: severe allergies are considered a disability under American law, and you can be an ally to your friend by treating the problem as a serious issue of access.;
, Some people get uncomfortable, itchy eyes and skin; others have severe asthma attacks that can send them to the hospital. Don't assume that allergies aren't real or that your friend can just take a Benadryl before coming over. Ask your friend if he or she minds talking to you about their allergy and explain that you're trying to understand more about how to change your habits. Learn about the symptoms, and support your friend in learning more about his or her health by visiting an allergist. If there's a kind of cleaning or air filtering you can try to make your house accessible to your friend, try it!

, How many of their other friends and family have pets? How many people can they visit aside from you? Try to understand how your decision to get a pet will, or did, make your friend's life more restricted, and consider how much she or he relied on your home as a place to hang out and connect with their social scene.

, See whether some of your pet-free friends would mind hosting extra dinners, brunches and parties so that your allergic friend can come too. Talk about whether you can occasionally use other friends' homes as ""emergency"" places to meet the allergic friend, even if the homeowner isn't there (in cases of breakups, crises, or other times when you or your allergic friend really want to see each other and not in a public place). You could even consider splitting the cost of ""renting"" a friend's pet-free living room or spare room for a small amount (someone who needs the cash!), getting a spare key, and using that as a home-away-from-home every so often for you and your allergic friend.

, How do they feel? Give the friend a chance to be angry and sad, and take their feelings seriously - while you do love your pet, your decision to have it in your home is keeping a beloved human out of your home. This can be especially sad if you're very close and/or have known each other for a long time. Don't let them feel like you're just paying lip-service; let them know that their reactions and worries are changing how you approach the situation. Act on what they say. Come back with ideas and thoughts on how to adjust. Ask them for their own ideas.

, Do it more often than you would have pre-pet, since no one succeeds in making contact, or making plans, every time they try. Try to actually talk to your friend and see your friend as much as you did pre-pet, even if it means harassing them a bit (in a friendly way, of course!) Your friend will be much happier if you harass them for hangout time than if they have to harass you. Let them know you still love and care about them, despite the new obstacle.

, Go to the friend's house to make dinner and watch movies. Hanging out on a couch or in a kitchen can be irreplaceable for close friends, especially friends you've known since you were young. Sometimes you want to listen to music, work in the same room, do projects or watch TV - all very different activities than face-to-face conversation over a meal or drink. Even though you may still have this type of socializing in your life and may not miss it (with people who aren't allergic to your pet) your friend might find him or herself going to a lot of dinners and coffee dates, and will really appreciate the home time.

, Get out of town for the weekend sometimes and get out of your pet-avoiding patterns. Make an annual tradition of going to a cabin, a nearby city, etc.

, If something is off-limits to your friend, consider hanging out with your friend before or after, or even skipping the party. See if the allergic friend has plans or will be home alone. If there's nothing you can do, at least you can tell your friend that you're sad they can't be there!

, Sometimes they might need to talk to someone, or might just be lonely, especially if there are a lot of people they can't visit. Talk to your friend about ways to do this - maybe a system where you distinguish between making normal plans and more 'urgent' plans. Or find a place near your house if your friend is in the neighborhood and wants to 'drop by.' If your friend invites you out, make an effort to go.

, Close friendships are just as important (if not more!) as dating relationships and family. Make life plans! Tell your friend if you plan to have pets for the rest of your life, and discuss how that changes the way you envision your friendship. Did you always talk about raising kids in the same city? Going on family trips? Visiting each other if you have to move apart? Hopefully you can work it out. Don't leave your friend wondering if you're going to get sick of dealing with the allergy, or too busy.

, Unlike many other relationships, friendships are based entirely on unconditional love, trust and support; without those things, the friendship doesn't really exist. So if you can't provide those things, now or in the future, talk to your friend about it. It's up to you to make that decision, and it's ok that you really love your pet: just give your friend a chance to make his or her own life decisions in a respectful, timely way.

Establish a relationship on Facebook and other social media platforms.,
Strike up some light-hearted online conversation.,
Ask your vacation fling about their non-vacation lives.,
Propose regular conversations via phone or Skype.If it seems the continued interest is mutual, act on it!",How to Keep Post Vacation Romance Alive2," If you’re considering making this a more serious relationship, this is an inevitable step. Especially if you’re unsure about the life your fling leads when they’re not on vacation, establish these relationships early on, to expose one another to the facts about one another's non-vacation lives, and to facilitate multiple new mediums with which the two of you can stay in touch moving forward.If your friend requests go unanswered on multiple platforms, take this as a sign that there may be something you don’t know about your fling. If you’ve kept in contact privately via phone or email, ask your fling why they haven’t been receptive through different mediums.

, Assuming you’ve kept in touch a bit, and there are not red flags about a potential unmentioned marriage or a basement torture chamber, initiate casual conversations every few days. This is the best way to gauge whether a connection between you naturally persists. If your fling is also interested in potentially continuing a romantic relationship, they will be excited to hear from you, and the romantic banter you shared while on vacation will likely continue without much effort.Don’t be too concerned if your fling doesn’t have a vibrant online personality. Not everyone does, and it doesn’t mean they aren’t interested. Still, you shouldn’t assume they are, either.

, An important step to take in establishing whether your vacation romance may turn into something more is determining whether it is realistic to hope for more. This may even require that you ask some direct questions about issues that were not addressed during your time together.


Get important questions out of the way as soon as possible. Though it may have seemed unnecessary to talk about it during the vacation, it may be time to admit your curiosity by saying something like: “I’ve been wondering if you’re involved in any other romantic relationships?”
If they don’t respond directly or their answer leaves something to be desired, don’t feel silly about checking for evidence yourself. You have a right to know about something that may affect your emotional well-being.

, Propose that you speak with one another regularly, even if distance demands the use of technology to facilitate these conversations. You already know you’re attracted to one another, and have enjoyed the time you’ve had together. In order to determine whether that might lead to a sustainable relationship, start to have the conversations that will lead to getting to know one another better."
"
Ask if they’d like to see you again soon.,
Assess whether the logistics are feasible.,
Tell each other about what you value.,
Consider what you both want from a relationship.",How to Keep Post Vacation Romance Alive3," If you stay in contact and the continued interest in one another seems mutual, convey your interest in potentially maintaining a romantic connection. Look for a chance to say something along the lines of “I had a great time on vacation and have still been thinking about you.” Your fling’s response to a statement such as this will strongly reflect the potential for a more serious relationship. If they don’t respond receptively, remind yourself that they may have viewed your time together as simply a fling after all., If your fling is located geographically far from you, you need to assess whether you have the budget and time to visit one another regularly. You may also both be willing to have a relationship with an extremely limited amount of time spent in one another's physical proximity, though this may prove more challenging than you anticipate. The point is to be honest with yourself: if it's more work than it is fun, you should consider letting your vacation romance just be a fling after all.

, Another important way to determine whether the relationship is worth pursuing is establishing whether your values are compatible. Some people have an entirely different approach to life when they’re on vacation. The point is, you may have only seen your fling’s vacation side. If you stay in touch and the affection for one another persists after the vacation, you should start to talk more about what matters in each other’s lives. There are a few topics in particular that matter quite a bit to a couple’s compatibility.Ask about family and friends. Have a discussion about how each of you feel about your family members, and about other meaningful relationships in your lives. You can learn a lot from someone when listening to how they speak about those they care about.
Discuss your careers. Each of your lives will in part be determined by what you both do professionally. It’s important to know where each of your stand regarding your career goals and intentions.
Mention any strong political or religious views that you hold. If it’s important enough to you that it affects whom you interact with in daily life, or how you treat other people, your fling should know about it, for both of your sakes! While it’s understandable not to mention your affection for Dick Cheney while letting your hair down, you should be honest about things that are important to you if you’re hoping for a longer-term relationship.

, People’s relationship goals may make them perfectly compatible – or may simply prevent a more serious relationship from being possible. Take the time to assess what it is you’re looking for in pursuing the romantic fling a bit further. For instance, can you see yourself settling down within the next few years, or is it more likely that you may move across the country for a new job?Be honest with yourself – and with your fling, about what you want. Maybe you’d both like to visit one another from time to time, but keep your relationship as an ongoing, albeit intermittent, fling.
Know that it’s also totally fine to want to wait and see what happens! You don’t have to be exactly sure about what you want to know you’d like to see where your affection for one another takes you. You can simply continue to stay in touch and bring up the possibility of reconnecting when-so-ever the moods strikes.

Commit to the reality of a long distance relationship.,
Get a webcam.,
Define the relationship early on.,
Reconnect in person.,
Establish a timeline to reduce the distance.",How to Keep Post Vacation Romance Alive4," If you’re considering entering into a long distance relationship, make sure you’re prepared for the reality of what that will entail. If you know you’re at least willing to try it out, remind yourself that the distance may also facilitate your ability to get to know your fling for who they really are without the pressure and potential logistical challenges posed by dating someone you live near.Believe it or not, putting effort into making time for one another to stay in touch and having periodic, heartfelt conversations may actually allow you to learn a great deal about one another’s aspirations and sense of themselves in the world.
Often, the opportunities for the level of depth often found in intentional conversations passes people by when they’re spending time together face-to-face. In this sense, the distance may even be a blessing in disguise.

, All of the other media platforms aside, the utility of a webcam to a long distance relationship cannot be understated. They are also surprisingly cheap and easy to use. Further, plan specific times to video chat with one another – just as you would plan a date if you lived closer together.In fact, you can even treat a video chat as though it is a date. Ask them out, make a plan, and agree to get the same sort of food or beverage to “share” together.
You can really get into it by dressing up and lighting candles. As silly as it seems, it can go a long way to show how excited you are about spending time together – even if it is through a webcam.

, Long distance relationships often have slightly different parameters of exclusivity compared to people who are able to see each other more frequently. Talk about what the ideal relationship would be for each of you, and figure out an agreement that you’re both happy with. At the very least, discuss the degree to which your relationship is open or monogamous to establish the trust and communication that are necessary to maintain a long distance relationship of any sort.Consider allowing some openness within the relationship when you are not visiting one another, for instance. Complete monogamy isn’t for everyone – especially when you’re living far apart.
Don’t hesitate to bring up the specifics – open communication is vital. Talk about whether you’re comfortable with one another dating and potentially being physically intimate with other people.
If your feelings about the understanding you two have changes, be sure to articulate how and why you feel differently.

, It will likely be easier to see one another than you think. While longer distances will make it harder, you can always find an excuse to see one another. Extend your business trip and stop wherever they live on your way back home. Even better: go on vacation again, this time knowing you’ll be going together. Especially if distance or finances make visits less frequent, plan trips in advance so you can talk about them and have something especially exciting to look forward to together.If you're still living at home and unable to make your own travel plans, reconnecting might be tricky. Perhaps you can ask your family to make travel plans that will allow you to share another vacation rendezvous with your fling.
Visiting one another in person also helps in another extremely important way. When you’re only every communicating through technology, and especially if these conversations are infrequent at times, you may end up filling the gaps with your imagination. Getting together reminds you of the real person with whom you have a relationship – the good, the bad, and the just plain true.

, If your relationship continues to go as well as it had when you first met in vacation land, don’t miss the opportunity to see if living closer to one another is an option. If you never talk about the potential of removing the long distance from your relationship, the distance itself is likely to slowly come between you. As soon as you feel inclined to do so, simply ask about how your romantic partner feels about starting to plan to live closer to one another.Most importantly, be open about how you’re feeling every step of the way. All relationships take work, and those that happen unexpectedly may require a touch more effort initially – but may also lead to a romance that keeps you feeling as though you’re living in a permanent vacation.

Notice if you have missed out on important moments with family.,
Check if technology is getting in the way of your personal relationships.,
Watch for drops in productivity.,
Check your personal habits.,
Watch for an increase in arguments or agitation.,
Ask your friends and family if you have a problem with technology.",How to Know if Technology Is Helping or Hurting Your Relationships1," You should consider how your use of technology affects your home life, including your ability to be a part of special moments with family. Consider if your computer or smartphone use is getting in the way of you spending quality time with your family and witnessing meaningful moments at home. You may have a hurtful relationship with technology if you tend to opt out of family time for more time on the computer, your smartphone, or online.For example, perhaps you missed your daughter’s first steps because you were too busy looking up funny videos on your smartphone. Or maybe you were distracted during your mother’s birthday speech because you were too busy texting a friend or checking your email.;
, You should also think about whether or not your technology use is getting in the way of relationships with a partner or with friends. You may notice that you avoid talking to others in person and opt for texting instead. This could then have a negative effect on your personal relationships with friends or a partner, as you avoid connecting face to face with them.You may have a hurtful relationship with technology if you use your phone or your computer as a convenient distraction to avoid addressing issues or problems you may have in your relationships. You should consider if your only meaningful relationships are online and not in real life. This could mean you have a damaging relationship with technology.
For example, maybe you go on your phone when your partner is talking to you to avoid discussing a touchy subject. Or perhaps you often stay in and go on the computer instead of going to hang out with friends in person.

, If you are not being as productive at work or school because you are spending more time on your computer, phone, or gaming system, then you may have issues with technology. This may be because you are spending more time using technology, or it may be because you are lacking focus because you are preoccupied with thoughts of when you will next be able to use your devices.

If you are not being as productive, this may cause other people in your life to have to pick up the slack. Ask your friends or family, ""Do you feel like you're doing more work around the house since I got my new computer/phone?""

, You may find that you are neglecting your personal care, your care duties for others, or your responsibilities around your home. You may spend less time with friends and family than you used to and be less reliable than you have been in the past. This could also spill over to your work or school habits.

Notice if your home is messier than usual.
Watch for changes in your personal care habits. For example, are you showering less, sleeping less, or neglecting yourself?
Are you properly caring for your pets, children, parents, and others who rely on you?
Are your bills late?

, If you are getting in more arguments with friends or family than you usually have, it may be a sign of poor technology habits. This is also true for if you are more agitated than usual. Spending too much time using technology can alter your mood and how you relate to others, creating a negative impact on your relationships.

Pay attention if you're having fights over minor issues.
Notice if arguments are happening either while you're using your device, over your device issues, or because of issues that occurred because you were using your device. For example, you may have an argument if you forget to do the dishes on your night because you were playing a game on your phone.

, If you are not sure if you have a good or bad relationship with technology, you may ask your friends and family for their opinion. They may be able to tell you if they think you have an issue with technology and need to address it. Be open to their feedback and consider their perspective.For example, you may ask a friend, “Do you think I'm on my phone too much?” Or you may ask a family member, “Do you feel hurt because of my technology habits?”

, In a relationship individuals are drawn to one another by physical attraction. It is extremely important to be comfortable in your own skin and understand that attraction is rooted from within. Whatever you think or feel about yourself inwardly will manifest outwardly.

, The quality of clothing you wear is imperative. You must purchase clothing that suits your personality best. In addition, you must make sure the clothing you buy makes you feel good wearing it or else it will cause you to be uncomfortable. Feeling uncomfortable will affect the connection between you and your partner.

, In addition to physical appearance, health and fitness are also prime factors evaluated between two individuals seeking intimate relationships. Find a gym that’s most suitable for your needs as well as your schedule.

, Fitness and health are synonymous, both require professional or trained advice. When joining a gym make sure to inquire about a licensed or trained fitness person as well as a nutrient specialist to ensure a well-balanced regiment for your fitness and health goals.

, Sexual consistency and gratification between two individuals create a deeper connection that would either build a stronger bond or brake it. Talking to your partner and gaining understanding of their pleasures is vital. Encourage people to always approach the situation face on and begin by first asking your lover questions such as: “What pleases you?” or “what can you do differently to make sure that their climax is reached?

, Honest communication within a relationship is a valuable asset for numerous reasons. Couples who frequently communicate tend to have a higher success rate than those who do not. Continuously communicating with your partner will allow you to discuss and deal with things such as financial struggles, each other’s health status and even future plans (marriage, kids etc.). So aside from physical requirements, communication serves as the one of the most important contributions that one can bring to a relationship.

, Identifying roles will allow one to understand the responsibility that their partner holds. For example, if one individual in a relationship choose to be the “bread winner” and the other one makes the decision to stay home and watch the kids, there is a common understanding between both and the relationship continues to run smooth. Knowing and communicating your partner’s role will also provide you the opportunity to appreciate all what they do for the relationship.

, In same sex relationships there’s often discrepancies of roles. There are various categories that women and men identify with sexually and often the sexual roles are predicated upon the sexual role therefore defining the dominant or submissive counterpart.

, Discussing future financial stability is one of the most efficient things that a couple can do. A relationship filled with financial stress, can really have a strand on the two people’s personal standing with each other. This strand can lead to health issues, disputes and even failure in the relationship as a whole. That’s why taking a few moments to talk with your partner about finances (who’s working? Who’s responsible for which bill, etc.?) Is extremely valuable and can save your relationship from enduring some pretty horrific occurrences.

, It is very difficult to keep your partner stimulated solely using your intellect. Most relationships are built upon some form of sexual lust. When stimulating your partner you must engage the mind in self-evaluation, reflection, and transparency. Sparking deep thought on various topics with your partner will caused them to them to appreciate and value the relationship.

, In a relationship it is extremely pleasing to know and have a deep understanding of your mates belief system. When two people join together in commitment their beliefs play a major role in how they make decisions and treat people. If there’s any lack of understanding on the basis of religion or faith it could be detrimental to the relationship. In any relationship there should always be a standard of respect, and also an understanding of customs and culture.

Check if you only communicate with colleagues through technology.,
Notice if you are appropriate and professional online.,
Consider if technology is getting in the way of completing your work.",How to Know if Technology Is Helping or Hurting Your Relationships2," You should think about how you use technology at school and at work as well as the impact this has on your relationships in these spaces. Consider if you only ever talk to your coworkers or your colleagues through technology like a computer or a smartphone. Though this can be an efficient way to communicate, it can also prevent you from connecting with others in person. This loss of face to face connection can make you feel isolated from others.For example, you may notice that you only ever meet with a particular coworker over video chat, even though you work on the same floor. You may worry that you are not building a meaningful relationship with your coworker by only communicating through technology and never in person.
You may also notice that you only text certain friends at school but you do not talk to each other often in person. Over time, you may start to feel isolated from these friends and feel like your relationship is superficial or not as meaningful as it could be if you spent time together in person.

, You should pay attention to your computer and smartphone habits to ensure you are being professional and appropriate towards others. You may scroll through your social media pages to make sure none of your posts could be considered offensive, rude, or disrespectful towards others. Having hurtful, offensive posts on your social media could harm your professional relationships at school or at work, especially if your social media is set to public.You should also consider if you tend to overshare online. You may post status updates every five minutes on Facebook, for example, or post new images on Instagram that are personal every hour on the hour. If you tend to overshare, you may cut back on your postings or adjust your postings so they are more appropriate and professional.
You may also create a private social media account that is only for friends to see. You may then add coworkers or school colleagues on your professional account and limit the private account so it can be viewed by personal friends only.

, You may have a hurtful relationship with technology if it becomes a major distraction in your life, getting in the way of school or work. Notice if you find yourself spending too much time on your computer or your phone, and not enough time on your school assignments or your clients at work. If your use of technology is distracting you from your deadlines at work or at school, you may be using it too much.For example, maybe you notice that you are behind on a client briefing for work because you spend too much time playing games on your computer. This may be a sign that you have a harmful relationship with technology.
Alternatively, you may notice that you spend so much time posting updates on social media, you forget to do your assignments for school. This may be a sign that you have a hurtful relationship with technology and may need to reconsider your online habits.

Put limits around your smartphone and computer use.,
Have meaningful conversations in person.,
Adjust your online habits.",How to Know if Technology Is Helping or Hurting Your Relationships3," You can create a more helpful relationship with technology by placing limits around how often you can access your smartphone or your computer. You may limit yourself to looking at your smartphone for a set period of time in the day so you are not on it all the time. You may also try to cut down on the time you spend on your computer so you have a more balanced relationship with technology.For example, you may try to only look at your smartphone in the morning on your way to work and then on your lunch break. You may avoid looking at your smartphone during work hours so you are not distracted by your phone.
You may also try turning off your internet connection during the hour you are doing homework on your computer. This way, you can focus on your work without getting distracted by social media or surfing the web.
Plug in your phone in a room other than your bedroom. Set a deadline for yourself to plug in the phone at least an hour before bedtime.
Keep your computer in an open area in your home, and set limits for how long you will use it each day.

, Create a more balanced relationship with technology by having meaningful conversations in person, rather than over text message or web chat. If you notice that all of your conversations, meaningful and otherwise, are done through your computer or your phone, you should make an effort to have more in person talks. This will ensure you are not spending too much time using technology and not enough time connecting to others face to face.For example, if you notice you tend to argue or have deep discussions with your partner over text message, try to set up a time to talk in person with them instead.
Alternatively, if you notice that you often connect to friends over web chat, try to arrange an in person hang out with them at least once a week. This way, you can balance chatting with friends online with hanging out with them in person.
Set ""no phone"" and ""no tech"" times to spend with family. For example, you could designate dinner time or a shared movie as your ""no phone"" time with your partner, family, or friends. It's important for you to spend time face-to-face without interruptions from technology.

, You can have a more helpful relationship with technology by maintaining online habits that are healthy and fulfilling. This means spending quality time online so your time there does not feel wasted. You should also try to maintain online relationships that feel meaningful and fun, rather than superficial online relationships.For example, you may avoid oversharing online and only share posts that you feel are meaningful or useful to others. You may focus your postings on causes that you are passionate about, such as social justice articles or images, so your social media feels more useful and purposeful.
You may also try to use your online time to connect one on one with others, rather than simply be a passive observer on social media. You may chat with friends online or share images with then that you think they will enjoy.

Tell her you love her.,
Give her compliments.,
Email and call her regularly.,
Surprise her with gifts.",How to Keep Your Girlfriend1," She may know that you love her, but she’d like to hear it too. Using the actual words will go a long way to communicating that she is a meaningful part of your life., Give your girlfriend praise. Show her that you’re noticing her and you appreciate her. Don’t just compliment her on her looks. Congratulate her on getting a new account at work, or tell her you admire her rock-climbing skills., Send a quick email or text to let her know you’re thinking about her. Don’t forget to call on the phone too; she’d love to hear your voice.

, Surprise her with little presents every so often. If she mentioned a band that she really likes, surprise her with tickets to their concert. Have flowers delivered to her workplace. Keep yourself at the forefront of her mind by showing her that she’s at the forefront of your mind too.

Cultivate some common interests.,
Do some of her favorite activities.,
Spend time with her friends and family.,
Turn off your phone.,
Cuddle together.,
Plan date nights.",How to Keep Your Girlfriend2," Doing things together will keep your relationship active and interesting. When you have some common interests, whether it’s cooking together, skiing together or learning a new skill together, your relationship will have more longevity.

, Does your girlfriend really like dancing but you don’t? Make an effort to do some of her favorite activities, even offering to do them without her asking first. She’ll probably do some of your favorite activities in return.

, Get to know the important people in her life. Don’t assume that she will spend all of her time with you or your friends. Offer to invite her friends or family over for dinner or on an outing. If you want to be in your girlfriend’s life, then you need to accept the other people in her life as well.Be friendly and good-natured with her family and friends.

, Put down your phone and actually spend time with her. Shut out the external distractions, such as friends sending you texts or sports scores. Show her that she’s worth your attention by giving her your full attention.

, Spend time being affectionate, cuddling up to her in the morning or when you go to bed. Being physically close doesn’t always mean sex, and snuggling while you watch a movie or when you’re talking can be a good way to make your girlfriend feel special and loved., Make romantic gestures by scheduling date nights and making them special. These don’t always need to be expensive dinners or moonlight strolls, and they don’t even need to be in the evening. But they should show that you are making an effort, whether it’s planning a hike and a picnic, or going to see her favorite band in concert.


Even date nights spent at home can be romantic if you’ve put some effort into them.

Listen to her.,
Be honest with her.,
Talk about what’s bothering you.,
Practice positive body language.",How to Keep Your Girlfriend3," Don’t just hear her speaking to you, but really listen to what she’s saying. Put aside your needs and pay attention to what she’s telling you. Once she feels like you’re really interested in hearing what she has to say, she’ll be more likely to tell you her true feelings.Be an active listener by maintaining eye contact and nodding or responding as she talks.

, As you spend more time with your girlfriend, you’ll both get to know each other more, and you’ll be able to trust each other with your feelings and thoughts. Don’t be afraid to be open, honest and vulnerable with her., Being in a solid relationship means communicating effectively and meaningfully. When something is bothering you, talk to her about it. Broach the subject in a calm manner, and leave judgment and insults aside.Set a good time and place to have a talk if necessary. Don’t bring up a major issue just as she’s heading out the door for work. Rather, plan a time to talk when you both have some time to devote to a meaningful conversation., We communicate with our words as well as the way we hold our bodies. For example, folding your arms in front of you conveys defensiveness. When you’re in a discussion with your girlfriend, keep your body language open, especially when you are having an argument.Try these steps to communicate effectively with your body language:


Maintain eye contact.
Use a moderate voice level; don’t shout.
Sit facing each other.

Talk about a future together.,
Support her in her endeavors and goals.,
Make compromises.,
Make her feel secure.",How to Keep Your Girlfriend4," Keeping a girlfriend means beginning to think about how you will share your life with her. As you plan your own future, think about how she’s going to fit into it. Share some of your thoughts with her, and she will share some of her thoughts about the future with you too., Your goals aren’t the only important ones in this relationship. Since you’re equal partners, give her support as she works towards her own goals. She has things she’d like to accomplish in her life too, and having your love and support will help her achieve them., Inevitably, you’ll have to sacrifice some of your own needs and wants to accommodate hers. Be ready to make some compromises – and know which things you absolutely won’t compromise on. Sharing your life with someone is a balance, but be honest about your top priorities too.

, When your girlfriend feels safe, she will trust and respect you, and she will be more committed to staying with you. Whether it’s feeling secure in terms of your love for her, financially secure, secure in working towards her goals, or secure about herself, help make her feel safe."
"
Be a good person.,
Work on your own issues.,
Improve yourself.,
Be healthy.,
Make sure she can count on you.",How to Keep Your Girlfriend5," Be kind and friendly, instead of an insensitive jerk. Be moral, ethical and trustworthy, not just with your girlfriend, but in your interactions with other people as well. She’ll notice these interactions, and if you’re berating a waiter at a restaurant or shouting at someone on the street, she may reevaluate whether you’re worth her time.

, You might have trouble managing your anger, or you shut people out when you are down. Take the initiative to work on your issues. This might involve making a conscious effort to open up to your girlfriend, or even seeing a counselor to talk about your issues.

, Keep developing and evolving as a person, finding new hobbies or working hard at your career. You can’t remain the same person for your whole life, so make some active choices to grow. How do you want to evolve as a person, and how do you want her to be involved?, Keep yourself in good health by exercising and eating well. You don’t need to become a fitness fiend or suddenly become completely self-involved with your looks, but caring for your own body and making healthy choices will keep you active and ready for anything., Do the things you say you’ll do, and show up when you say you’ll show up. If she can count on you for the little things, she’ll trust that she can count on you for the big things too."
"
Appreciate your past but don’t idealize it too much.,
Relive your early relationship as you are now.,
Flirt, kiss, and be a bit naughty.,
Show gratitude for your partner’s very presence.",How to Keep a Relationship Fresh1," Studies indicate the couples in stagnant relationships tend to have less accurate recollections of their history together. They often overemphasize or exaggerate the good times to avoid the difficulties and disappointments that have always existed and are more serious now.


For instance, replicating the dinner-and-a-movie pattern of your early relationship and expecting to fall head-over-heels all over again is unrealistic and ignores the ups-and-downs that certainly accompanied the getting-to-know-you period. Using those memories to think about the qualities that brought you together in the first place, however, is a good use of your past experiences.
Relationships always start full of energy and excitement, and working to recapture some of that early magic is a good way to freshen things up further down the line. Trying to recapture an unrealistic idealization of your past, however, will only lead to further disappointment.
The goal should be to recreate some of your early, happy memories together while remaining aware that each of you and your partnership are very different now. The past needs to be a spark for progress moving forward.;
, It can be a nice touch to replicate your first date, from the flowers to the so-so dinner at the best restaurant you could afford to the awkward kiss goodnight. Use it as a reason to look at your partner as he or she is now with fresh eyes.Planning regular “date nights,” and pulling out all the stops when you do, can be a fun way to spend some one-on-one time together reconnecting. This may be especially helpful if you have kids.Take turns planning the dates, so each of you can enjoy trying to one-up each other by crafting the ideal night.

, Not all routines have to be dull. Make a point of kissing your partner daily — not a peck, but a real, early relationship kind of passionate smooch.Try out your flirting technique, which has probably been on hiatus for a while. Even if the result ends up with the two of you laughing together instead of heading to the bedroom, it’s a fun and easy way to liven up the day for a bit.
Love can become assumed over time. Make sure you don’t just say it, but show it, even by simply holding hands or making deep eye contact. Make a point of saying and showing your love during your sexual encounters as well, be it by cuddling, “dirty talk,” or whatever works for the two of you., Early in a relationship, you tend to cherish each moment together. Once you get stuck in a rut later on, though, it can be easy to lose sight of all the reasons you have to be thankful for each other.Say a meaningful thank-you for even small tasks that you appreciate, like taking out the trash or balancing the checkbook. Or leave a nice note on the fridge or in your partner’s work bag.If you need help spurring your gratitude, try to think about what your life would be like if your partner either never entered your life or vanished from it.If you feel like things would be better this way, you have bigger problems in your relationship than some stagnation.

"
Acknowledge your commitment.,
Write the promise down and set a reminder.,
Create a concrete plan to fulfill the promise.,
Communicate with the other party.,
Ask others for support and encouragement.,
Focus on keeping your promise.,
Apologize and find another solution if you break your promise.",How to Keep a Promise," Before you make the promise, for example, to clean your father’s car on the weekend, or to finish a report for next week, make sure you have the time and skills to follow through on the promise. To do this, you should listen to the request and consider:Do I understand what I am promising to do? It’s important to confirm that you understand the other person’s request, for example, can you clean my car on the weekend? or Can you complete this report by next Monday? This will ensure you know what you are committing to, which will allow you to better fulfill the promise.
Can I fulfill the promise within the specified time? Think about if you have other plans on the weekend that conflict with cleaning the car, and if you can move or change these plans to make time for your new commitment. Consider if you have other duties that may prevent you from completing a report for your boss within the specified timeframe, and if you can get these done another time or work overtime to get it all done. Make sure you can commit the time needed to fulfill the promise.
What do I need to fulfill the promise and can I access these needs/skills? Analyze your existing skills and determine if they are a match for the request or commitment. If you need to clean the car, make sure you have access to a hose, a bucket, soap, a towel, and a driveway. If you need to complete a report by next Monday, make sure you have the skillset to complete the report and the reading materials or resources to do it properly.;
, Rather than simply telling the other person you are going to do something or verbally agreeing to do a task, get it in writing. Put it down on your calendar, mark it on your to do list, and set a daily reminder in your phone so there is no way you will forget the promise.


Putting the promise in writing shows initiative to the other party, and ensures you cannot use the “oh, I forgot” excuse when the deadline for the promise approaches.

, Even the smallest promises can be neglected or unfulfilled if you do not set aside the time in your day to complete the promise and are equipped with all the tools and skills needed to keep the promise. Draw up a step by step plan so you don’t fall short on your commitment.For example, to complete an assignment for a class, you may block out two to three hours one week before the assignment is due for research and brainstorming. Always overestimate your time so you do not end up shortchanging yourself.
You may then set aside one to two hours several days before the assignment is due to write a first draft of the assignment. Avoid planning right up to the due date or deadline, as this can lead to a rushed assignment and a rushed completion of your commitment or promise.
Finally, set aside one hour the night before the assignment is due to proofread the draft and polish it into a final draft. You can then be assured you can meet the deadline, and fulfill your promise to your teacher to complete the assignment by a certain time.

, If you start to realize there are obstacles or challenges that may cause you to miss the agreed upon deadline, let the other person know ahead of time. This will give the other person, or invested parties, time to adjust their expectations or timelines on their end and to work with you to help you try to still keep your promise. No one likes unwelcome surprises, especially the news that an action they were expecting to be completed, like the cleaning of their car or the completion of a report, will not be done within the expected timeframe.


Being honest about your inability to keep a promise, as agreed, before the deadline has passed shows you respect the other person’s time and are trying to act with integrity. Doing this will ensure your relationship with the other person remains healthy and open, whether it’s the relationship between you and your partner or a family member, or the relationship between you and an employer or authority figure.
Keeping the lines of communication open will also give you the means to negotiate for a new timeline or due date for the promise. The other person will likely appreciate your honesty and might be willing to adjust the timeline for the promise so you can meet it.

, If you have a hard time staying motivated and following through on an assigned task or commitment, tell other people around you about the promise. This will force you to be accountable to the expectations of others and keep you focused on completing the task.Telling a close friend or family member about the promise may also motivate them to offer to help you complete the promise. They may be willing to pitch in their time so you can get your dad’s car cleaned on time, or offer to help you brainstorm and outline to get a paper done by the deadline.

, Follow your plan and stick to the timeline. If you get easily distracted by the constant text messaging and online chats with friends, turn off your internet and focus for the allotted amount of time on the task. Find a quiet, secluded area so you can work without distractions.Time yourself as you complete the task or promise so you don’t waste any valuable time. This also ensures you don’t go over or under the allotted time for the task and are motivated to fulfill your promise within a timeframe.

, Despite your best efforts, you may end up breaking your promise. Rather than simply giving up or getting upset at yourself for not fulfilling your commitment, tell the other person you are sorry and come up with a new plan.Start by explaining why you were unable to fulfill your promise. This could be because you were asked to do another task that felt more important than your existing commitments, or because you had other deadlines that ate up all your time. Be honest about the reasons why you missed the deadline, and avoid making excuses.
Ask the person how you can make it up to them. Put yourself at the mercy of the person you let down and show humility by asking how you can remedy the situation.
Make a new commitment that you can fulfill. Re commitment yourself to the promise and ensure the other person you will fulfill the promise this time. Show them your renewed sense of commitment by creating a new plan, with stricter time management, and follow through on your promise. Avoid letting down the person again, as they may not give you a third chance.

Act respectful when you are with her.,
Compliment her and be genuine about it.,
Let her know she is on your mind.,
Surprise her with romantic gestures.,
Have fun and make her laugh.,
Be affectionate.,
Keep your promises.,
Confide in her about things.,
Be sensitive to her feelings.,
Be willing to compromise.,
Communicate effectively.,
Balance your time together.",How to Keep a Girl Forever," In order to make her feel like she is a special girl to you, be sure you aren’t treating her like just another friend. Don’t completely change your personality, but try to be polite and incorporate a few polite gestures whenever you are with her. Being respectful is more about small courtesies than it is about huge gestures. When you’re with her, try doing some of these:


Hold open doors for her so she can go in first.
Give her your jacket if she’s cold.
Put some effort into your clothing choices and be sure to have good hygiene.
Avoid any offensive actions in public, like swearing or belching.
Carry her books and backpack for her between classes or after school.;
, Compliments are much more effective when they are thoughtful and meaningful.Don’t constantly compliment her, as this will come across as insincere and needy. You should also try to avoid complimenting her about only one thing, especially her looks, as this will make it seem like that’s the only thing you value in her. Instead, give meaningful and unique compliments a few times a day. For example:


“I wish I could make you laugh like that more often. You have the best laugh ever.”
“You are so supportive, no wonder all of your friends love you.”
“It’s so impressive how much you read. You must be really smart.”

, It’s important to let the girl know that you are still thinking about her even when you’re not together. This will make her feel secure in your relationship and like you are really interested in her. You don’t need to call or text her every 5 minutes, but check in at least once a day to say hi and ask how her day is going.

, In order to keep the relationship fresh and loving it is important to be spontaneous and surprise her so she feels swept off her feet. This doesn’t mean you have to spend a lot of money either. Make your gifts, like your compliments, thoughtful and unique. Make her feel special and loved by trying one of these:


Surprise her with a playlist full of love songs that make you think of her.
Pack a picnic, bring a blanket, and take her to a park for a romantic lunch.
Write her a love note and slip it into her locker without her seeing.
Get her something she can wear everyday to remind her how much you care about her.

, A good relationship doesn’t always have to be so serious. Make sure you have fun together, both in the beginning of your relationship and moving forward. Continue having fun together by doing activities you both enjoy or by trying something new and crazy. Be sure to playfully tease her daily and kiss after any competitive game is finished., It is important to show her how much you care in your actions as well as your words. Many girls like to be showered with affection from their partner because it is very reassuring. This doesn’t mean you should try to grab her or kiss her at an inappropriate time. Instead, use a little bit of physical touch during more private moments and follow her lead.


Give her a kiss on the cheek to say hello or just because.
When you are holding her hand, give it a little squeeze occasionally as a flirty gesture.
Switch it up and try linking arms or putting your hand on the small of her back instead of holding hands.

, In order for your girl to feel safe and secure with you, you have to be a reliable and trustworthy partner. Being an upstanding partner is one of the best ways to show her that you are invested in being with her for the long term and take the relationship seriously. Some ways you can show her you can keep your word include:


Keep your promises to her, but also keep your promises to other people. This will help her to see you are a trustworthy person.
Be responsible with your schoolwork and work responsibilities.
Always be on time to things and show up when you tell her you’ll meet her.

, Another way to show her you are a good partner is to open up to her about things you are normally private about. If you trust and love this girl, then show her how much you trust her by sharing things you would otherwise keep secret. This will really help build trust and emotional intimacy in your relationship, which will help your love last., It is important to always be mindful of her feelings and take care to avoid hurting them at all costs. Different girls are sensitive about different things, but take note of subjects she doesn’t want to talk about or negative things she says about herself. For example, perhaps she doesn’t like something about the way she looks or gets upset when she feels like she’s been left out. Try to use your words carefully and always be respectful!

, Disagreements will happen in even the most loving relationships, and it is important to address these disagreements maturely.Try not to see disagreements as having a “winner” and a “loser” and instead learn to meet somewhere in the middle on issues.


If you don’t want to see a particular movie, try coming up with one you can both agree on or decide that the next time you go to the movies you can choose what to see.
If she wants to meet your parents but you feel it is too soon, be honest and suggest an outing where she can meet your sibling instead.

, Just because you talk to your partner frequently doesn’t necessarily mean you are communicating well. Communication in a relationship is not just about having things to talk about; it’s about being an active listener and sharing your fears, frustrations, and hopes. When your partner is talking about an issue or you’re working through a disagreement, be sure you are really listening to what your partner has to say before you respond. If you are upset about something, it is equally important that you speak up, just try to remain emotionally calm and always be respectful. Stay away from aggressive nonverbal cues like crossing your arms or avoiding eye contact. Always try to resolve the issue, but remember that some important topics may take more than one conversation to resolve., When you’re in love it’s natural to want to spend all your time together; however, it’s really important that you don’t overwhelm each other or smother her. Giving her space is important. Showing her that you have a social life outside of your relationship will help her feel less pressured to be your sole source of happiness and she will appreciate your time together more."

Build positive experiences together.,
Boost your knowledge of your spouse.,
Improve your sex life.",How to Improve Your Marriage1," On average, happy couples have a ratio of 20 positive instances for every one negative. Of course, during times of conflict -- which all marriages will have -- this ratio can be lower, but in general, the good should outweigh the bad.These positive experiences don’t have to be a grand vacation or huge romantic gesture. Communicating with your spouse on a variety of levels, from the big issues to the quick “I love you”s, will help let your partner feel appreciated and acknowledged.Not making these small “bids for connection” can put you on a path to ruin.
Taking time to acknowledge moments together can also be helpful. Humans have a bad tendency to ignore the positive things in our lives and remember only the negative things. Practicing active gratitude for your time together will help you remember those positive experiences later.Leave little reminders of your love for the other person. Stick a note in your spouse’s wallet or send a sexy email. Offer to make her or him lunch for tomorrow, or surprise your spouse by doing a chore you know s/he hates. These little things may seem cheesy or too small to make a difference, but they’re vital ways of connecting the two of you.;
, Everyone wants to feel understood, but it can be easy when you’ve known someone a long time to believe that you know everything about him or her. It may feel like you have nothing left to discover. This is rarely true. Make an effort to share your thoughts, concerns, favorite memories, dreams, and goals with your spouse -- and invite him or her to do the same with you.Ask open-ended questions. Dr. Arthur Aron’s famous list of 36 questions could be very helpful for you to explore your partner’s views on life, dreams, hopes, and fears. Questions like “What would constitute a perfect day for you?” or “What is your most treasured memory?” are specifically designed to promote intimacy and “interpersonal closeness.”Dr. John Gottman’s Relationship Research Institute also has many “conversation starter” tools available.Listen. Don’t just hear your spouse’s words. Listen to them. Paying attention as your spouse talks will help you remember important information later. For example, if your wife told you about the awful conversation she had with her sister the last time they spoke, you’ll have a better understanding of why she might not want to visit at the holidays. You’ll be able to offer better support if you really listen when your spouse talks with you.

, It’s natural for the heady excitement of sex to wear off as you spend more of your lives together -- your body can’t keep up that same chemical rush nonstop forever.However, exploring you and your spouse’s sexual needs and desires can reinvigorate your marriage and help you feel more connected.Be open and non-judgmental when you talk about sex with your spouse. It can be a frightening, guilt-inducing subject to discuss. Let your spouse know that you really are interested in knowing what his/her fantasies are and what turns him/her on.
Studies show that couples have a more fulfilling sex life when they are interested in fulfilling their partner’s sexual needs -- even if those needs aren’t things they need themselves. This is called “sexual communal strength,” and it’s a hallmark of couples who keep a healthy, active sex life.
Explore together. Discuss your fantasies together. Try a new technique or sex toy. Watch pornography together or read erotic stories together. Focus on sex as a shared experience that brings both of you pleasure.

"
"
Try new things together.,
Celebrate each other’s triumphs.,
Surprise each other.,
Carve out time around the kids.",How to Keep a Relationship Fresh2," Reliving old memories is unlikely to be enough of a relationship-freshener. You need to create new memories together as well, in order to build a sense of excitement and unpredictability.Do something new as a team, be it skydiving, a cooking class, or a bowling league. If it makes things easier, take turns picking the next new thing you both will try together. Try to stick to things you both can enjoy, however. “Trying new things” can extend to the bedroom as well. Try oils, candles, new positions, role-playing, or whatever else might add some spice to your sexual routine.

, Use good news for either of you — a promotion, a community service award, even saving big money on your car insurance — as a reason to show your appreciation for each other and just have a good time.Never assume that your partner knows how proud or happy you are for him or her. Tell and show him/her. But keep in mind that an achievement for one of you is a victory for the team.
Celebrate strong efforts as well, even if they don’t come to fruition as intended. Nearly finishing a marathon or reaching the final interviews for a dream job can be worthy of a night on the town.

, An encouraging note taped inside your partner’s laptop, or a sexy message left on his/her voicemail can serve as little reminders of your ongoing affection and appreciation. Any little jolt out of the regular routine can help keep things fresh and interesting.While texting back and forth about dinner plans or work woes, a surprise expression of love or appreciation can go a long way.Of course, more old-fashioned moves like sending flowers, getting tickets to the sold-out event, setting up a surprise date, or just cleaning the house while your partner is away can still work as well.

, Having children fundamentally changes you and your relationship with your partner. Even if you treasure every moment with them (or most moments, anyway), the changes they cause and time they consume often exacerbate relationship troubles.Something as simple as getting more sleep can make a difference. This may seem like a pipe dream if you have small children, but being more rested and refreshed puts everyone in a better mood, and makes it easier to see existing positives and to make positive changes.
Take some time to commiserate about your stress from shuttling the kids around or dealing with them fighting over the toys, the TV, etc. Share your good experiences as well, of course. Demonstrate to each other that you’re in this together.
Make time for fun and for romance. Have your in-laws come over for a while, or pay the babysitter to stay a bit longer. Snatch up free time when you can, or schedule it ahead of time (anticipation can serve as foreplay for harried parents!).Don’t feel guilty about dedicating some time just for the two of you, because a strong, healthy, fresh relationship between you will benefit your kids as well.

"
"
Consider your committment.,
Examine your “emotional transparency.” Healthy relationships are built on honesty, of course, but how one presents that honesty is important as well.,
Study how you share responsibility.,
Analyze your expressions of appreciation.",How to Keep a Relationship Fresh3," People usually point to specific causes like stress or disagreements regarding money, work, the kids, or sex as the reasons for a faltering relationship. Deeper down, however, general issues like an unbalanced level of commitment are usually at play.If one party lacks an adequate commitment level to an important aspect of the relationship — such as pinching pennies to pay of debts or setting aside time for family activities — the resulting friction can make every day seem like a recurring battle.
By talking to each other and working together to identify weak links for either or both of you, you can begin the process of smoothing out these spots of friction. So yes, you both have to commit to work on your committment.

, A shortcoming in either area can spoil a fresh relationship.Ask yourself if you are hiding things from your partner, be it out of selfishness, fear of hurting him/her, or whatever other reason it may be. Is the constant evasion and excuse-making causing strain on your relationship?
If being honest is not your problem, then consider whether your manner of truth-telling is too blunt or judgmental. Can you speak your plain truths with more kindness?

, While it is important to retain an individual identity and sense of self within a relationship, both parties also have to be willing to share many things, including the problems facing you. Most of the time, it cannot be “my” problem or “your” problem, but “our” problem.If your partner is between jobs, for instance, a money problem can seem more like his problem than yours, especially when addressing his spending habits. Regularly assigning fault and blame, however, will sour just about any relationship.
Like a baseball club, when there is an “error” in a relationship, the entire team has to deal with it and work to overcome it.

, Whether you are six months, six years, or six decades along the line in your relationship, the odds are good that you don’t look longingly into your partner’s eyes and say either “I love you” or “thank you” as often you did at the start. Over time, the focus in relationships tends to shift from showing affection and appreciation to solving problems — shuttling the kids around, paying the mortgage, etc.Solving problems together is indeed essential to keeping a relationship functioning, but be aware of whether this focus is getting in the way of expressing the true appreciation each of you feels for the other.

Make time for the other person.,
Create rituals together.,
Find a new hobby together.,
Introduce First-Date February.,
Play some games.,
Create a hangout night.,

Cook each other meals.",How to Improve Your Marriage2," If you or your spouse (or both of you) are constantly distracted, you won’t feel like a priority in the other person’s life. Not making time for your spouse, whether it’s time to share a fun evening at the movies together or time for sexual intimacy, can lead to feelings of disconnection and frustration.Sexual intimacy is often the first thing to go when you’re busy. If you’re finding that you don’t have the type of sexual connection that you used to have, try scheduling time for sex. It might seem like that’s a sure-fire way to kill the romance, but studies suggest just the opposite. 80% of married couples schedule time for sex, and it can actually help give you something to look forward to., A ritual can be a shared experience between you and your spouse. This type of shared experience is very important, as it fosters the sense that you have an intimate, familiar relationship with this particular person.Rituals don’t have to be elaborate, but they should be reliable and allow you and your spouse to connect. Be intentional about these rituals, and hold them sacred. Don’t skip out on them unless it’s really an emergency. Remember, your marriage is an investment: you’ll get out what you put in.


Try giving your spouse a hug at the end of the workday and asking about his or her day. Convey something about how you value your spouse, such as “I really love it when you pick me up from work” or “It was so nice of you to grab dinner.”
Think about all the rituals you probably went through when you were first dating. You had to arrange on a time to see each other, plan an activity, prepare to see each other, and interact with each other in ways that might not be routine. See if you can bring some of that back into your daily interactions.
Start a “date night” tradition. This doesn’t have to be high-pressure. It’s just a time when you come together and spend time appreciating the other person.

, Finding something that you both enjoy doing together can give you a valuable way to spend time together and relax at the same time. Try activities that also have other benefits, like exercise, or activities which help you feel exciting and youthful, like gaming.

, Once a year or so, you should take some time to fall in love with your spouse all over again. Review how you've changed as people and where you're now wanting to go in your lives. Spend a few weeks acting like you're dating each other for the first time all over again. You'll be surprised how much it helps your marriage.


Of course, it doesn't have to happen during February. Do whatever works for you!

, Board games are seeing a comeback and they can be a great way to bond and have fun with your spouse. There are the classics of course (Scrabble, Monopoly, etc) but there are also some great newcomers. Try Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan, or Once Upon a Time.


You don't have to play just the two of you either. Get your friends together for a weekly or monthly game night!

, Make some mutual friends and then all get together for a game night, a dinner party, a movie, or other fun hang out. This will let you have fun together and feel social and renewed! You can also have separate hangout time with just your friends and (them with theirs).

, Read a book together, either just at the same time or literally from the same book. This can give you something to talk about and open up conversations that you may not have had otherwise. You can read books on current events, parenting strategy, history books, or even just an exciting fiction!


If you love TV or the movies, watch some of the other’s favorites. Go to see new movies or talk about what’s going on in your favorite show. You’ll have common ground to talk about something you’re passionate about.

, Whether it's taking a dance class together, learning how to play instruments, or learning to draw, this can give you not only a way to bond but a great creative outlet. Learning new skills such as these will make you proud of yourself and proud of each other.

, Travel together if you can. It doesn't even have to be out of the country; you'd be surprised what adventures you can find in your own backyard. Anything that gets you out of the house will do, really. This will create new experiences that you can share and bond over.

, Take turns cooking a nice dinner for each other. If you're both terrible cooks, take a cooking class together, or get some online help. This is a way for you to bond that also fits nicely into a hectic schedule (you have to eat, right?).

Learn to handle conflict.,
Share your needs.,
Address each problem individually.,
Avoid blaming.,
Repair conflicts immediately.,
Accept that there are things you can’t change.,
Ask questions.,
Learn to compromise.,
Consider an example.",How to Improve Your Marriage3," Conflict is normal within any relationship. Conflicts can even be a way to bring you closer together by encouraging you to collaborate on your relationship and get at something better in the end. It’s all in how you handle conflicts when they arise. Developing habits to help you manage conflict in a healthy, helpful way will definitely improve your marriage.Don’t talk when you’re angry. Despite the conventional wisdom that says you should never “go to bed angry,” trying to discuss something when one or both of you is upset can just make the situation worse. This is because when you’re upset, your body triggers a “fight or flight” response by flooding your body with adrenaline. This really puts the damper on your ability to think and speak calmly and rationally. Be aware of your body. If you notice that your heart rate is elevated, you’re having trouble breathing, or you’re “seeing red,” take a time-out.Take a break yourself, and respect your spouse’s needs. Either one of you can call for a break if you’re feeling too upset. It’s important to do this in a respectful way. Instead of saying something like “I can’t even talk to you when you’re like this,” talk about your own feelings and acknowledge that this issue is important and you will talk about it later. For example: “I am feeling very upset right now and I need a little time to collect my thoughts. I agree this is an important thing to discuss. Let’s talk in an hour when I’ve cooled off a little.” This way, your spouse knows you’re not trying to ignore the conversation. Similarly, if your spouse calls for a break, respect it. Don’t try to chase him or her down or talk over your partner.

, It’s important not to sweep your concerns under the rug -- they’ll trip you up eventually. Bring up what is bothering you or what you need in an open, kind way. Don’t expect your spouse to “just know” what you need. S/he isn’t a mind-reader, and neither are you!


Don’t use sarcasm or guilt when you share your needs. Make a simple statement of the problem using “I”-statements when possible. For example, “Lately I have been feeling lonely because we’re not spending much time together. When we don’t have that connection, I feel like I’m not as important to you, and that makes me sad.”Once you’ve shared your need, invite your spouse to do the same. Don’t let this become a one-sided thing. Instead, ask your partner for his or her opinion. “What do you think?” or “How do you feel about this?” are excellent questions to get you started. #* Look for “common concerns” that you may share with your partner. It’s possible that you actually share a need that you didn’t even know about. Or, you may each have a need that isn’t being fulfilled.
Don't “keep score.” Don't hold whatever your spouse did last summer against them right now or keep a running catalogue of all the minor annoyances. Keeping score instantly turns your partner into your opponent. You're on the same team! Never forget that.
A weekly “conflict processing” conversation can be very helpful. It can be a place where you feel safe to present your concerns and you know you will be heard with respect and kindness. You can use this space as a place for both of you to collaborate to address these issues.
Find the right time and place. You won’t always be able to find the ideal time and place to have a serious conversation, but try to avoid distractions as much as possible. Don’t try to have a deep conversation about a concern when one of you is exhausted or distracted by something else. Find a time when both of you can focus on listening and sharing.

, If your partner brings up something that s/he has a problem with, don't try to turn it around with a ""Well, I might ____ but yesterday you ______ed..."". If you have a problem with your spouse, you can bring that problem up at another time. Unless one is directly related to the other, more than one problem should not be brought into an argument.


Similarly, if you want to share a concern, don’t overwhelm your spouse with a whole litany of complaints. Focus on one thing that’s got you concerned. This will help both of you feel like you can actually tackle the issue.

, Blaming language puts your spouse on the defensive, and s/he’s not likely to hear even valid suggestions when s/he thinks s/he’s being attacked. When you bring up concerns, make sure you don’t resort to “guilting” or blaming your spouse.


For example, instead of saying “Why don’t you ever snuggle with me anymore?” say something like “I really enjoy snuggling with you. I’d like to do it more often. What do you think?” The first way blames your spouse and feels like an attack. The second way says that you enjoy something about your spouse so much that you want even more of it.

, It’s crucial that you be mindful of how your interactions evolve, especially when you’re discussing a sensitive or upsetting issue. If you notice that one or both of you is getting “flooded” by emotions, take a step back. Paying attention to your conflicts will help keep you from unproductive or hurtful fighting or avoidance.Pay attention to what works for you. Every couple is different, and what works to repair conflicts will also be different.
Using humor is a common way to deflect anger. Be careful not to use sarcastic humor, though, which will generally make things worse.Validation is acknowledging that something about what your partner is saying makes sense. You don’t have to completely understand or agree with your spouse to let him or her know that you “get” why s/he feels a certain way.For example, you could say something like “It makes sense to me that when I didn’t kiss you goodnight because you felt unimportant to me.” Remember: you don’t have to agree that your spouse is “right” or that you meant to hurt him or her. You’re just acknowledging that s/he did feel a certain way. This simple gesture can help your spouse feel cared for even during conflict.
Ask for a “redo.” If your spouse says something hurtful, ask him or her to rephrase it. Don’t get angry, just communicate your feelings: “That really hurt my feelings. Can you please say what you’re meaning in a different way?”
Take responsibility. Problems and issues are almost never one-sided. Taking responsibility for even a small part of the problem you’re facing can go a long way toward helping your spouse feel acknowledged.

, If you and your spouse keep experiencing the same conflict, it could be due to things about your personalities that simply aren’t likely to change. For example, if you’re an extrovert who loves to go out with friends and your spouse is a deep introvert, you could end up having the same conflict about what to do every weekend.Some of these things are just the way things are, and you will both have to develop an accepting, flexible attitude to keep them from becoming sources of conflict.


Depersonalize. One reason our spouse’s actions can cause conflict is because we make them personal when they really aren’t. For example, if your spouse really doesn’t care about vacations and doesn’t seem to enjoy himself or herself when traveling, a personalization approach would make it about you: “If s/he really loved me s/he would have a better time on vacation.” This type of approach isn’t fair to either of you: it can lead to you feeling hurt by things that aren’t intended to hurt, and can encourage you to blame yourself for things that aren’t your fault., Don’t assume that you “know” what your spouse is thinking or feeling. It can be very tempting to “mind read,” where we read into a situation our own interpretations and biases. This is extremely damaging to the relationship.Rather than attempting to be “right” or “defend” your position, be curious about your spouse’s thoughts and feelings. Recognize that almost all situations are subjective and you and your spouse may have very different interpretations. Neither of you is probably “right” or “wrong.” It’s important to listen to each other to avoid gridlock.
Questions are also very useful as a form of active listening. When your spouse is sharing feelings or thoughts with you, take some time to reflect what you just heard back to him or her. Ask for clarification. For example, “I heard you say that you feel angry because I didn’t remember our date last night. Is that what you meant?”, Too often, people view compromise as a “they win, I lose” situation. In reality, compromise is a crucial element of a solid, happy marriage. Compromise is the search for common ground between the two of you, and it’s necessary to address problems.Compromising doesn’t mean you give up on things that are truly important to you -- that would result in resentment and regret. It means finding out what you can live with and what are the “dealbreakers.”


Dr. John Gottman recommends that each spouse draw two circles, one inside the other. In the smaller inside circle, write the things that you absolutely need. These are the things that your core values demand, that you just can’t live without. In the bigger circle, write things that you could live with.Share your circles with your spouse. Look for points where the big circles overlap. Those are places where you can probably find ground to compromise.
Talk with your spouse about your negotiables and non-negotiables. Sharing with your partner may inspire you to grow your negotiable areas bigger, or may help your spouse understand why something is so crucial to you., As a way to illustrate these communication techniques, consider the following example. You want to focus your free time on developing a nonprofit project that’s very important to you. Your spouse wants to spend free time going on vacation. This divergence in desires could cause conflict, but handled in a healthy way, it can help you work together to understand each other and find a solution.Begin by telling your partner that you’d like to have a conversation so that you can both understand where the other is coming from. Don’t make accusations or use blaming language. Instead, say something like, “It sounds like we have a difference of opinion here. Let’s talk about why we feel so strongly about these things.”
Invite your partner to ask you questions about your views. For example, your partner could ask open-ended questions about why you want to work on this project, such as what it will accomplish for you, what it means to you, what worries you may have about it, etc. Your partner can practice active listening skills and describe to you what s/he heard, checking to make sure it was heard right. S/he can summarize what s/he took as the significance of this project to you, and you can offer your opinions on that.
Next, ask your spouse about his/her views. Explore the position of wanting to take a vacation. Use questions and active listening skills to listen to his/her opinions, just as s/he listened to you.
Once you have a good grasp of the other’s position and what it means, try to figure out a way for both of your needs to be met. This may mean you reach a compromise, or it may mean that one or the other of you decides to put your plans on hold for the other person. What matters is that you work together to discuss what you’ll do, and that your spouse knows you are always there to support him/her.

Be specific.,
Avoid negative words.,
Skip the backhanded compliments.,
Use your eyes.",How to Make a Girl Feel Beautiful1," It's easy to say, ""You're pretty,"" and it's just as easy to brush that off. But if you're more specific, you show you notice what makes her beautiful, and she may start to believe what you say.So instead of saying ""You're beautiful,"" try something like ""Your smile lights up a room"" or ""I love how your hair turns red in the sunshine."";
, Don't criticize her appearance, of course, but also help her to stop talking negatively about herself, too. When she starts complaining about her appearance, point out what she's doing and replace it with a compliment.For instance, if she says, ""I can't stand my love handles. They're so chubby."" You can say, ""Don't take yourself down. I love your body with all its curves.""
If that doesn't work, help her examine how often she talks negatively about herself. Maybe she doesn't realize she is saying negative things so often, so if you gently point it out, it may help her take control of the situation. If you can, turn it back on her. That is, encourage her to talk positively about her body when she starts talking negatively., For instance, saying something like ""You're skinny for your age"" implies that a person old. Also, try to not use compliments that imply she wasn't as beautiful in the past, such as ""You look so lovely now that you've lost some weight!""

, You can show someone you appreciate her beauty by how your eyes light up when she comes near or when she catches you looking at her when she's distracted."

Collaborate on finances.",How to Improve Your Marriage4," Having some ground rules can nip a lot of problems in the bud. Discuss together how you'd like to handle problems like choosing who to stay with for the holidays, who should be in charge of cleaning what, etc. Discussing hypotheticals before they happen (and maybe even writing them down) can help you know how your spouse will react to decisions and save you both the trouble of accidentally upsetting the other.


Household responsibilities are a particularly sore spot. Many households have dual breadwinners, but strong social norms mean that women are usually still considered responsible for things like chores, cooking meals, child care, etc. Studies suggest that women in heterosexual couples perform 67% of chores and cook 91% of meals.Achieve a healthy balance by talking with your spouse about what each of you will do.
Research has shown that couples who create a system to govern responsibilities are significantly happier than couples who don’t. This could be because both partners share responsibility so they feel more like a team.Approach this as collaboration, not one of you bossing the other. Decide what you’ll do based on your abilities, skills, and availability. You could also decide on a rotation, where you take turns doing chores that neither person likes. This will help either of you from feeling unfairly burdened.

, This is especially important when you have kids. Talk things out and decide how you want to handle different situations, so that you can be united in the things you do. Feeling like your spouse openly overrules you can be embarrassing and cause tension.Your parenting styles may not always be on the same page, and that’s to be expected. What’s important is that you coordinate your approach so that your child doesn’t feel confused by conflicting information or perceive you as not working together.

, It's important for both of you to remember that you are still separate people with needs that you may only be able to fulfill on your own. Getting alone time to focus on yourself and your own needs is important. Make sure both of you get an opportunity to do so.


For parents, this probably means one of you will have to babysit so that the other can get some downtime.

, Money problems are one of the most commonly cited reasons for divorce.Work together to lay out some ground rules that everyone can agree on. Work to keep yourselves at a point where money is less of a concern and you'll have fewer problems.


Arguments about money aren’t restricted to people of a certain income level. How much money you make or how much debt you have doesn’t predict your marriage’s success. How you approach collaborating on your finances and how you talk about money will determine whether it’s something that causes damage.

Fortunately, marriage counseling from a trained professional can help you learn how to handle conflict and disagreement, talk productively without fighting, and show your love and appreciation for your spouse.If you experience any of the following issues, you will likely benefit from professional counseling.Criticism. Criticism is a personal attack on someone’s character, such as “You always do this wrong” or “You never remember to do this.” Counseling can help you learn to express your needs with kindness.

Defensiveness. Defensive tactics include indignation (“I can’t believe you’re saying that!”), counterattacks (“Well, you’re just as bad at X as I am at Y”), or whining (“It isn’t my fault!”). The antidote to defensiveness is validation, such as “I can see where you’re coming from” or “I could have done better at X.”

Contempt. Contempt is abuse and has no place in happy relationships. Eye-rolling, sneering, insults, or condescension kill a relationship. Instead, express love and appreciation.

Stonewalling. Stonewalling happens when the listener has stopped listening because s/he is flooded with adrenaline and can’t focus. Counseling can help you learn how to process conflict so that you’re able to listen and learn from each other.
Several types of professionals can offer marriage or couple therapy. Common providers include psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, and licensed marriage and family therapists. Make sure that your provider is licensed and has experience in marriage counseling.
Retreats and weekend workshops can be expensive, but they could be a helpful way to “jumpstart” some new habits. Just don’t rely on a weekend to fix all of your issues. You’ll need to continue to work and learn.

, Researchers are beginning to understand how much of a complication past trauma can be in a marriage. If one or both of you is carrying around trauma that you haven’t processed, it can trigger rage or anxiety and make communicating in a healthy way very difficult. Seek help from a mental health professional.


PTSD can cause particular difficulties for couples, especially those in the military.However, marriage and family therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment in helping couples and individuals deal with this trauma. , Addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and substance abuse, do not mix well with marriage. Addictions are progressive diseases, and will get worse with time. Seek help from a medical professional and/or professional counselor. If your spouse’s addictive behavior puts you or your family in danger, you have the right to be safe. Take steps to protect your health and safety, and don’t allow your spouse to make you feel guilty for protecting yourself.
There are several programs available for the family of loved ones suffering from addiction. If your loved one is refusing to get help, these organizations may help you. Al-Anon has “family groups.”The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence has a range of services for family members.

, In some cases, it wouldn’t matter how well you implement the skills and tactics in this article. If your spouse is abusing you, it is not your fault. You did not “make” your spouse abuse you, and you cannot “fix” it by staying. Seek help. Abuse can be emotional, mental, and/or physical.Contact a hotline or trusted person you can confide in. If you are in an abusive relationship, you must be careful about your personal safety. Abusive partners will often monitor their spouse’s activities very closely, so search for resources at a public library or use a friend’s phone.
The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence is a good place to start. You call call their hotline 24/7 at 1-800-799-7233. A list of international numbers is available at HelpGuide.org.Domestic abuse is about as common in gay and lesbian relationships as it is in heterosexual relationships."

Sing her a song.,
Write her a poem.,
Give her a card with a positive quote in it.",How to Make a Girl Feel Beautiful2," It can be a dress, a ring, or something more intimate, just make sure you get the right size. Pick something you know she'll love, or ask for help from a friend if you don't feel confident doing it. Buying her something pretty will help her to feel more beautiful, and it will show you appreciate her beauty., Tell her to get dressed up in something nice, and go take photos. You can take them yourself or hire a professional. Help her see herself the way you see her by capturing her beauty.Pick a pretty outdoor setting on a sunny day. The light near dusk can help bring out a person's natural beauty.
Try taking pictures with flowers, near trees, or on low tree branches or bushes. These props will help you to create beautiful shots.
Once you've taken the pictures, take some time to pick the best ones, and edit them if you have the skills. That is, pick the ones that really show off her beauty, and then do crop them and adjust the color to make them even more beautiful. If you don't know how, ask for some help from a friend.

, Pick a song that celebrates a woman's beauty, and one that relates to her particular style. For instance, you could pick ""All About That Bass"" by Meghan Trainor if your friend or girlfriend is a curvy lady or ""What Makes You Beautiful"" by One Direction if she has a hard time believing she's beautiful. Pick a moment she's down to have an impromptu concert.For instance, maybe she had a bad day at work. Try cooking her dinner and singing to her as you cook.
Some other options for songs are ""Flawless"" by Beyonce, ""Just the Way You Are"" by Bruno Mars.

, It doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to say how you really feel about your friend or girlfriend. Try to be as specific as possible about what you love about her, both her personality and her body.


For instance, you could write: ""You are the light of my life. / I love all your curves, / and the way your hair / flows down your back. / More importantly, / I love who you are, / the way you make people / feel like they are noticed and important, / the way you help when no else notices. / You are a star in a midnight sky.""
If you don't have it in you to write a poem, you can use someone else's to express how you feel, though you should give them credit. For example, you could use Lord Byron's ""She Walks in Beauty Like the Night."", Many celebrity women have commented on what makes a woman truly beautiful. You can use one of those quotes to help your friend or girlfriend feel beautiful by including it in your card. Just be sure to say where it came from.For instance, you could use this quote from Audrey Hepburn: ""The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair. The beauty of a woman is seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides. True beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It’s the caring that she lovingly gives, the passion that she shows. The beauty of a woman only grows with passing years."""

That is, let her know you value who she is on the inside and out. Often, body issues arise because a person has low confidence, so helping her to feel comfortable with who she is can go a long way to helping her feel beautiful.Encourage her interests and hobbies, and show you appreciate the things she does for you. For instance, maybe you can take her out to dinner to show her how much you appreciate who she is and what she does.

So ask her to go for a walk with you or take a dip in the pool., Even if you're not talking about your friend or girlfriend, talk positively about other people's bodies.

Pay attention to body language.,
Ask questions.,
Talk with a counselor.",How to Overcome Language and Culture Differences in a Relationship1," Look for a course at your local community college. You could also get a personal tutor or take an online course. The goal is to learn, at least partially, independently. You do not want to turn your relationship into a full student-teacher scenario.With that in mind, be careful when correcting your partner. Try to be calm when they correct you as well.;
, Be prepared to jump between languages pretty regularly in conversation with your partner. You may find that a certain language takes over when you are discussing particular topics, such as finances. Or, you may notice that you both go back to your native language when emotions are high.After you’ve become more comfortable with your partner’s language, you may switch back and forth between languages without making a conscious choice to do so. For example, you may start to speak in German when hanging out with your American friends. This is perfectly normal.

, You can download a dictionary app onto your phone. You can also buy a small paper one to keep in your pocket. Then, when you are unfamiliar with a certain word, take a moment to look it up.After you’ve found the word, you might try using it in another sentence to make sure you understand. Ask your partner if what you are saying sounds correct.

, You can communicate a great deal by simply watching how someone holds and uses their body. Observe their hands and how they are gesturing. Watch their eyes to see where you should be looking. See if their arms are crossed in a more standoffish way, or open and excited.Facial expressions are obviously a huge clue as to how someone is feeling. Are they smiling? Frowning? Do they look as if they are concentrating? About to laugh? Use your observations to guide how you respond to your partner.

, If you aren’t sure what your partner is saying, take a moment and ask them. Silence is a real danger in cross-cultural relationships as you may want to nod and agree to everything to keep things simple. However, you are not fully communicating when you do this. Watch for cues when you can jump into conversation.For example, if your partner looks at you with their eyebrows raised and palms in the air, they are probably waiting for a question or response. Go ahead and jump in.

, If you want additional communication tools, it may be a good idea to schedule an appointment with a relationship counselor. You can even find one that specializes in working with cross-cultural partners. They can also help you work through any deeper differences that may act as roadblocks to your relationship.You can find a counselor by entering your location and “therapist” into a search engine. Narrow your search by looking for a person with high positive reviews online. Call each therapist’s office and ask about their areas of specialty.

Understand that polyamory is not always open.,

Be honest and open with your partner(s).,
Respect your partner(s).,
Be aware of jealousy.,
Understand that this is often frowned upon by society.,
Be open about your lifestyle choice when socializing.,
Learn to manage your time.",How to Practise Polyamory," How you feel about one person does not have to affect how you feel about another. Similarly, if your partner finds that they love someone else, their feelings for you may not change. The latter can be hard to accept, but with time you can become more comfortable with this idea. It's important to have an abundance mentality about love.;
, Most people associate polyamory with open relationships, in which people can initiate relationships with anyone else without needing permission from their partner. It is also possible, however, for more than two people to be involved in an exclusive relationship, where they limit their relations to that specific group.

, Are you willing to date someone whose partner doesn't know you're seeing them? Are you willing to treat all partners equally, or would you prefer to have a ""primary"" partner? Do you feel that you or a partner can/should be given the right to veto? These questions will probably come up along the way, and should be considered seriously to avoid hurting yourself or your partners.

, Communication is essential to an open relationship. If your partner knows what you're up to and who you're seeing, they can tell you about any problems they might have with it and you're both less likely to get hurt.

, Their feelings must be important to you, and with a complicated arrangement such as this you will have to be more aware of how they feel about situations. Try not to assume that you know how they will react, and be willing to compromise.

, To say that it is unnatural to get jealous in an open relationship would be unrealistic - everyone gets jealous sometimes. Bear in mind that jealousy is often a sign of a deeper problem that needs to be considered, and you will have to learn how not to be jealous.

, In choosing the polyamorous lifestyle, you are going against the grain and you could come up against some opposition. Relationships where there is one man married to more than one woman (polygamy) are associated with cult leaders. Relationships that involve same-sex relations will encounter an extra layer of scrutiny. If there are children involved, learn to expect criticism.

, That way, no one can get the wrong idea, and problems at the start of relationships will be easier to navigate.

, Some partners may be happy to see you every couple of months, and some will prefer to see you every couple of days. You'll need to be good at giving your time to each of your partners, so that you're all happy.

Initiate the fight.,
Play Tag.,

Wrestle.,
Play a Prank.,
Wrap it up.",How to Play Fight with Your Girlfriend," Start by playfully pushing or bumping into your partner on purpose. Whether she’s concentrating profusely on a task, or just simply standing idle, approach her and nudge her gently. Carry on with this action until she responds with either pushing you away and telling her to leave her be, or she joins in on the fun. Either way, do this in a style that shows you’re only clowning around and want her to participate – she’ll hopefully get the gist and engage.


Be mindful not to nudge her in areas that she has been complaining are tender or sore.;
, Now that the combat has started, it’s time to attack or retreat. Tap her somewhere on the shoulder and say “Tag”, immediately run from her or motion that you’re going to chase her. By inducting a game of tag, your hope is to either get her or the both of you on the floor in a comfortable position to continue the tussle.

, While you’re both romping on the floor, recall the areas that she is most prone to responding to touch like her stomach, back of the neck or feet. Once you’ve spotted this area, go ahead and tickle her.


Beware, you’re certainly not immune to her planning her defence.

, Depending on the state of the flooring and the safety of your location, try scuffling with each-other’s strength by wrestling one another to the ground. It’s a given that you might have more strength than her, so ensure that you aren't too rough and imperious when it comes to this more physical step. Change roles for a while and let her have a crack at dominating you.


Avoid sitting on her with your full weight.
Also be cautious of items around you that could potentially be damaged or injure you both.

, This will be just as entertaining to you as it is for her when she realizes how ludicrous you are as a playful boyfriend. Playing pranks are extremely effective when it comes to play fighting. It can initiate the skirmish from the start, or aid in compelling the harmless exchange to more demanding feats.


You could try purchasing mock insects from a toy store and plant them around the house before she comes home to set up the scare. This might eventually end up in a full blown warfare with each-other, which, is exactly what you're aiming for.

, Once you both have agreed on a champion and are recovering, give one another a kiss and a hug to share a mutual remission for each other’s foray. If you feel the time is right, take the opportunity to let her know just how much she means to you.

Go on a trip to each home country. Try out one another’s cultural foods. Go to celebrations or holidays.This means that you will need to be open to trying new things and meeting new people. It can be uncomfortable at times, but it is often worth the extra effort., Like any couple, talk about your day-to-day routine. Go over what you eat and when. Talk about how you like to shop for clothing and where you go. Once you get to know your partner better, discuss how you feel home tasks and chores should be divided. In an established relationship, it is a good idea to go over one another’s ideas regarding money management as well., Different cultures can express love, and discuss it, in varying ways. Open up a conversation with your partner about what you expect in a loving relationship and how you’d like romance to be expressed. If you are at the start of your relationship, you can discuss all of these things in the abstract, to make it less awkward.For example, you might say, “In my culture we do not hug our loved ones chest to chest in public. We save that gesture for private.”
You can also talk about how exactly to say, “I love you.”, Go over each other’s upbringing and the role that religion played in each of your early lives, if it did at all. Talk about how you view different religions. Outline how you’d like to proceed religiously in the future, if that is a factor for you. Be aware that religious differences don’t have to be a deal breaker, if you keep communicating.For example, if you go to church every Sunday morning and plan to do so into the foreseeable future, then you may want to let your partner know of your plans. You may need to come up with a compromise.

, Sit and map out each other’s dreams and aspirations. Talk about how you both feel about marriage and if you want children. If you would like to have children in the future, how would you raise them? This can also give you an idea regarding the other person’s romantic pacing, which will help you to determine if your personal goals align.For example, if your partner would like to move back to their home country sooner rather than later, then you may be faced with the possibility of relocating.

, You are bound to find areas in which you have vastly different opinions. Instead of viewing these as deal breakers, look at some of these moments as learning opportunities. You now have the chance to get an inside view of a culture from someone you trust. You and your partner can also use your differences to become a stronger team unit., It is easy to focus solely on the obvious differences between you and your partner. Push back against these distancing feelings by sitting down and making list of all of the things that you both share. Spend some time on this project and include cultural commonalities, but also any shared personality traits as well.


For example, if you both have the same sense of humor, then that is a very good sign in a relationship.

, If you choose to have children, you’ll want to discuss how you plan to mix both heritages together in order to benefit them. Would you like them to attend religious events for both cultures? Do you plan to send them to a school with a particular cultural bent? To start with, teaching your children both languages is usually a good idea.Also, be aware that the plans you make for your children will likely not work out exactly as intended. That is okay as long as you and your partner have the same parenting goals in mind.

Be flexible with cultural taboos.,
Expect some discomfort.,
Keep your sense of humor.,
Stay connected to your values.,
Be patient.",How to Overcome Language and Culture Differences in a Relationship3," It is very easy to offend someone from another culture by mistake. You and your partner will undoubtedly do something “wrong” at some point, but the key is how you both react. Try to develop a bit of a thick skin and realize that an accident is an accident.For example, if your partner is from Nepal, then they will likely frown upon sharing food or touching one another’s plates while dining., No relationship is easy and a cross-cultural one may have many unique challenges. You will have some moments when you feel unsupported, angry, nervous, or scared. The key is to pay attention to how long these moments last and whether or not your partner offers you enough support during them., If your partner mispronounces something, just laugh and explain the joke to them. If you are the one making the mistake, be sure to keep a sense of humor, too. If either one of you accidently make a cultural misstep in public, then offer support and laugh it off. This is how memories are made., Being in a cross-cultural relationship does not mean that you need to jettison your own culture to make room for your partner’s. Instead, try to focus on those cultural traditions that hold particular meaning to you and make time for them. Incorporate them into your relationship, thereby creating entirely new traditions.


For example, if your family gathers together each year for an Easter celebration, you might consider inviting your partner or planning something afterwards.

, Realize that it will take time for you both to become in sync. Give yourself plenty of time to get to know your partner and their culture and language. Realize that you also may need some space every now and then to just decompress around your familiar culture, too."

, If you are feeling particularly stressed or drained about anything, take a moment to be aware that you are feeling that way. Locate where it is your body that you are feeling that particular tension. Is it your neck, your stomach, your jaw? Focus on that feeling by breathing into that tense area.Identify the way you feel by naming the feeling what it is. Acknowledge your emotions and accept them for what they are.
Don’t feel the need to fix yourself or correct the emotion. We like to criticize ourselves when we feel things that aren’t happy feelings, instead of that embrace them. Practice self compassion versus self judgment.
Engage in solitude by embarking in solo activities. Take alone in nature, create some art, cook a meal for one, or listen to music. Focus on how serene and calm you feel when in these alone moments., Setting boundaries does not stop at saying “no”, even if it sometimes starts there. Growing and learning means setting boundaries that are not rigid to the point of being inflexible and in a cocoon from others.Only say “no” when it’s something you want to say “no” to, not just for the sake of saying “no”.
Be aware of how it feels to be compliant with certain choices and towards certain people. Note how you feel about it and allow it to guide you with your choices and limitations.
Practice remaining open, but only as open as you feel comfortable being. Discomfort and how drained you feel will tell you where and how boundaries need to come into place.

, Become clear about the values you consider most important in life.


Asking questions that dig into your values guide the decisions you makes instead of the expectations and opinions others might unreasonably have for you.

Put yourself in the other person's shoes.,
Realize that a man or woman able to have an affair now is able to have an affair any time in the future.,
Stop watching too much TV.",How to Stop Being the Other Woman," Be aware yourself that you are involved in an affair; if you're making up excuses and calling the relationship anything but an affair, you will neglect to fix it because you haven't yet accepted the raw facts. Acknowledging your current situation for what it really is is one of the biggest steps you'll take to freeing yourself from the ties that bind you.;
, In order for you to start reclaiming your damaged self esteem, start listing the reasons why it's no longer wise to be involved in this love triangle. Some examples include:


You are failing to address the things that are not working in your life. Whether you're unhappy in your marriage, hating your job, exhausted raising your kids, or just unsure what to do with your life, an affair is a symptom, not an answer. Try treating the cause of your unhappiness front on, rather than hiding behind the thrill of illicit dating.
No matter how careful both of you think you are being, eventually something will leak and the affair will be discovered by someone. Even your attitude is giving you away to those attuned to changes.
Being ""the other woman"" is disrespectful to who you are. You have a right to be a whole person, not someone who is wearing many different faces and suffering from the tension of trying to juggle all the lies. Being true to yourself means being honest with yourself about what is really compelling you to be ""the other woman"". Perhaps you want more attention, more love or more money––whatever the reason, there are better ways to go about getting what you need, much more openly and without hurting others or yourself.
Sneaking around gets tedious with time. It might be fun to begin with but as time goes on, maintaining the lie can become exhausting and fraught with fear of discovery. Hardly the stuff of excitement that you might have felt when the affair started.

, Here's a thought: If he or she says that he or she loves you and you mean everything to him or her, shouldn't something have happened by now? Many times the other person won't leave his or her sanctioned relationship, despite making vague promises. Have you been given any real signs of the promise to divorce, move out and move on being actioned? Likely not, and that speaks volumes.

, Would you want to be dubbed as ""the girl who destroyed my relationship""? No one on in their right mind wants to be played on or cheated with. So do yourself and the significant other a favor, and stop the affair.

, What makes you think that what he or she is doing right now he or she won't do to you should you ever really get together? As they say, ""Old habits die hard"". Change does not happen overnight. Change comes to those who consciously choose to change.

, What happens in the movies don't happen in real life. The other woman doesn't usually get the last laugh, the riches and the man or woman. It happens but very rarely do those who have affairs end up this way. If he or she really loves you, he or she will choose you, but if this has been going on for years, he or she is using you as an emotional and physical substitute for his or her girlfriend.

Be honest.,
Start at the beginning, not after a boundary has been crossed.,
Talk to your partner about what your boundaries are sexually.,
Draw lines for interactions with the people in your life.,
Give space and take space as needed.,
Respect the needs of the person you’re dating.",How to Set Boundaries when Dating2," If you're afraid that some of your boundaries will scare that special someone away, talk to them about it before it becomes an issue.


Be self aware about your needs and express them to the person you are interested in.State your boundaries in a way that is not judgmental, shaming, or accusatory for the best results.If your special someone takes issue with a boundary you feel to be reasonable, then perhaps that someone isn't so special.

, Let the person you are interested in know from the get-go where the lines are drawn when it comes to what you need (and what you won't tolerate).


While you two are getting to know one another, let him or her know which boundaries are the most important to you, such as a monogamous relationship, sexual boundaries, or wearing shoes inside of the house.
You don't have to hand him or her a ten-page notarized booklet, but you shouldn't leave him/her in the dark and let your frustrations build up to an epic battle to the death.

, Decide when you’re ready to take things to the next physical level. Being physical is a form of intimacy that is common in dating relationships. If you’re only okay with physical contact like kissing, hugging, or hand holding, explain that to your partner. Sex is not a relationship requirement. If it is a dealbreaker for your partner, let them go and find someone who respects you enough to not ask you to compromise your beliefs.If sex is something that you want to do with your partner, do so when you are ready. This can mean 30 days, this can mean 90 days, or this can mean a year – decide what “ready” means to you and tell your partner what that boundary is.

, Meeting one another’s friends and families are important milestones in relationships. Set a boundary for when the appropriate time to meet important people in one another’s lives.Allow the quality of the overall relationship to act as your guideline for when to meet family and friends. If the relationship is new or off to a shaky start, it might not be a good idea to introduce more people into your relationship.
Set a boundary that you will follow his or her lead. If your partner invites you on a night out to hang with some of his or her closest friends, it might be an indicator that you can alleviate your boundary and let him or her meet your friends too.

, When you need it, take it. When he/she needs it, give it. Always be mindful that as much time as you need to take for yourself, so will your lover.


Coming home after a hard day's work to your significant other is often very rewarding, but the both of you still need other outlets of focus.
Keeping up with friends and maintaining healthy social activity is vital to a person's well-being. Humans have always been social creatures, and it's meant to be that way.
Cultivating other interests is important, too. Spend time doing things you enjoy apart from your relationship, and let your partner do the same.
Balancing your work life, social life, and love life are essential to success in those aspects.

, Mature communication is the best way to talk to your lover or spouse about boundary issues.


Don't be a hypocrite. When he/she needs to set boundaries with you, be understanding and open.
Respect his/her wishes and be upfront with any questions or qualms. Remember, any qualms do not have to be voiced with criticism or anger.

"

Be clear about boundaries while being clear about the love you have for your partner.,
Use “I” statements exclusively.,
Use the sandwich technique when communicating.,
End things with your partner if it feels like it’s not working.",How to Set Boundaries when Dating3," No insinuations, no hints, and no passive phrases of ""well maybe, maybe not"". Once you set the boundaries that are absolute, talk about the boundaries that are negotiable.


Set a boundary that you will not be emotionally bullied into saying things or making steps you aren’t quite ready to say or make. For example, if your partner is ready to say “I love you” and you aren’t, don’t feel that you have to. Instead, opt to be clear and direct about how you feel and your intentions with that important step.Take your time with the pace and the nature of the relationship. Set a boundary and communicate that the relationship progress at a pace you are comfortable with: making things official, becoming physical, etc.
Be clear and direct if no shoes are allowed on the carpet, ever, period. Be clear if phone calls every ten minutes are unappreciated. Be very, very clear about whether or not you two are mutually exclusive.
Every relationship has problems, however, a compromise allows more effective communication and an overall healthier relationship.

, Don’t sweep mistreating behavior under the rug or tread lightly against broaching the topic. Communicate to your partner that they have overstepped one of your boundaries but never lose the love in your voice.


Use the phrase: “I love you, but I need you to respect this boundary of mine. It is important to because ____”.
For example: “I love you and have every intention of us working through whatever issues we might have. But, I need you to respect the fact that you get verbally abusive toward me when you’re angry. It is okay to communicate with me in a respectful manner, but it is never okay to project anger and hurt onto me. It not only upsets me, but it is also makes me feel belittled and undervalued.”Express the behavior, the boundary it violated, and how it made you feel. Be open to hear how enforcing the boundary makes your partner feel. Talk things through, make sure things are understood, and that both parties involved feel cared for in the end., Communicate with the phrases “I feel…” or “I would appreciate it if…” instead of “You are a jerk” or “You are the problem” to your partner.


“I” statements allow you to retain responsibility over your emotions and allows your partner to be more open to your conversation without defenses.
“You” statements assign blame.

, The sandwich technique of communicating is to use a compliment, a criticism, and a compliment. When a compliment’s said, your partner’s defenses come down and they are primed to hear some criticism. Wrap it up with another complicate to reconnect., If you have tried every reasonable way to set boundaries and your lover simply can't respect them, you need to end the relationship.


Once you have done your best and upheld your responsibilities, but have not been repaid with the same, your loyalty is to above all yourself.
You deserve someone who will treat you with the same level of maturity and commitment as you will them, and you should never deprive yourself of this based on the hope that your lover will change.

Talk about everything.,
Listen to each other actively.,
Express your needs.",How to Protect Your Marriage from Adultery1," One thing you can do to strengthen your marriage, keep it strong, and protect your relationship from adultery is to talk with each other on a daily basis.Talk about the important things and the minor everyday things. Communicating on a regular basis will keep you and your spouse connected with each other. It will also prevent either of you from seeking someone else to share with.


Send your spouse an “I love you” text or instant message in the middle of the day just to let them know you care.
Share your successes and failures with your spouse. For example, call your spouse when you get the promotion you’ve been trying for.
Talk in the evenings about world and local events. For example, you might decide that each evening you two will discuss politics over dinner.
Try communicating via text, email, social media, or video chat. It doesn’t matter how you communicate with each other, so be creative with it.;
, Effective communication is one of the keys to making a marriage work.It is also one of the main ways that can try to protect your marriage from adultery. The better you and your spouse communicate, the easier it will be for you to resolve conflict and keep your marriage working.


Remove distractions when you and your spouse are having serious conversations. Cut off the TV, wait until the kids are asleep, and put your electronic devices on silent or vibrate.
Let your spouse know you want a distraction-free conversation. Say something like, “Hey, babe, would you mind cutting the TV off so we can talk about the situation at your mom’s last night.”
Look at your spouse and ask your spouse to look at you when you all are discussing things.
Listen when your spouse is talking instead of letting your mind drift or thinking about what you will say in response. Try to ask as many questions as you need to fully understand what they are saying. Reflect back to them what you heard so that they can confirm or clarify.

, One reason people have affairs is because their needs are not being met within their current relationship.You may turn to someone outside the marriage to fulfill your needs if you don’t feel your spouse is meeting them. You can protect your marriage from adultery, though, if you make sure that you and your spouse are both letting each other know what you need from the marriage and from each other.


Tell your spouse when your needs aren’t being met in the relationship. For example, you might have to say, “Honey, I know we’re both busy, but I need us to spend some quality time together.”
Give your spouse the opportunity to express their needs. For instance, listen and pay attention if your spouse tells you that they need more communication or intimacy. You can also heck back in periodically to see how you're doing, such as by saying ""How am I doing in this area?""
You might even say, “Sweetheart, let me know what you need from me and from our marriage.”

"
"
Show your spouse that you care.,
Make time for intimacy.,
Date each other.",How to Protect Your Marriage from Adultery2," You can help protect your marriage from adultery if you make sure that you are making an effort to show your spouse that you love them.Be sure that you think about what matters to ‘’them’’, not you. Your spouse may want you to take a chore off their to-do list, not buy them a gift, or vice versa. It doesn’t have to be anything big or major, but taking the time to let your spouse know you care can keep you and them from straying. It’s also a way of reminding yourself that you care about your spouse.


Leave your spouse a small note in the bathroom or the kitchen that says “I love you”.
Do something special for your spouse just to show them that you care about. For example, give your wife a massage when she comes home.
Make a list of all the reasons you love your spouse and all the things you like about them. Mail the list to their job or give it to them one day.

, One of the best things you can do to support a healthy marriage and prevent adultery is to make sure you are spending intimate time together.Although most people think of sex when they see the word ‘intimacy’, there are lots of ways you can be intimate with your spouse. Think of ways that you can spend together, enjoying each other’s company and presence.


If discussing intimacy is an area of anxiety or dread for you, consult a professional to discuss it. Not discussing these concerns is one of the fastest ways to deteriorate a marriage.
If you need to, then schedule a night for intimacy. It might be as simple as a few hours of cuddling or even a plan for a romantic sexual evening.
Take the time to do things like hug, kiss, hold hands, and hold each other. Try to do these things on a regular basis.

, Even though you are married, you can still (and should still) set up dates with each other.Going out together allows you to spend time with each other outside of the house. Spending this time together will also keep the ‘spark’ and excitement in your marriage and help prevent either of you from having an affair.


Schedule a regular date night with your spouse. For example, every other Friday night could be date night for you two. Schedule a babysitter if you have kids.
Don’t just go somewhere together. Instead, take the time to put on a special outfit, dress yourself up a bit, and make it feel like a date.

Be careful who you tell about conflict.,
Fight fair.,
Learn to apologize and to forgive.,
Seek counseling.,
Accept reality.",How to Protect Your Marriage from Adultery3," You may be tempted to rant or vent to your friends about the problems going on in your marriage, but this isn’t always a good idea.The friend that you are venting to may try to use the information as a way to tempt you (or your spouse) with an affair. Instead of letting other people know the intimate details about your relationship, protect your marriage from adultery by talking to your spouse about your issues first.


Turning to someone else to vent about your marriage may open the door for temptation. For example, you may start off talking to a friend about your marriage and then find yourself falling for your friend simply because you are angry with your spouse.
Consider whether you would want your spouse sharing your marital problems with their friends.
Sometimes talking to a professional, like a marriage counselor, can strengthen your marriage because of the objectivity they bring to the situation and problem-solving techniques they can share with you and your spouse. A good rule of thumb is to only talk about your marriage to parties that have been agreed upon by both sides.

, One thing that can cause problems in a marriage is when spouses attack each other during conflict instead of resolving the actual issue.When this happens it can create bigger problems that open the door for adultery. You can protect your marriage from adultery if you make sure that you are handling the conflicts in your marriage in a mature way.


Avoid calling each names. For example, calling your husband ‘stupid’ or ‘lazy’ because you want him to do some home repairs isn’t a good way to address conflict.
Don’t say things in order to intentionally hurt your spouse. For instance, bringing up the fact your wife lost her job when you know it bothers her.
Stick to addressing the problem or issue. For example, if the issue is finances then talk about ways to save instead of calling each other shopaholics.

, Holding onto anger, grudges, and resentment can tear any marriage apart – even without an affair. When you have done something wrong, be adult enough to apologize. And when you need to, be adult enough to forgive. Keep in mind that forgiveness does not necessarily mean that full trust is restored. That part often takes longer. Forgiveness is a choice - trust is something that takes work. However, the ability to say you are sorry and to forgive may be one of the most important things you can do to protect your marriage from adultery.When you have done something to hurt or disappoint your spouse, then tell them you are sorry as soon as you can. You could try saying, “Honey, I’m truly sorry for what I did. I know that I hurt you and I never meant for that to happen. Could you forgive me?”
Tell your spouse that you forgive them if they have done something wrong. Sometimes you have to do this even if they haven’t apologized. For instance, you might say, “Babe, I know I was upset and what you did hurt me. I do accept your apology and forgive you, though.”

, There may be sometimes in your marriage that communicating with each other, being intimate, and addressing conflict aren’t enough to protect your marriage from adultery. You may have unresolved issues, major conflict, or need a different perspective on how to keep your marriage intact. Seeking counseling from a family or marriage therapist can provide you and your spouse with the support and strategies you need to help prevent either of you from committing adultery.Don’t put off seeking marriage counseling either. Waiting too long can make it harder to deal with the issues. You can seek marriage counseling even for small problems in your relationship to help stave off major problems.
Consider seeking counseling from your religious leader if you all are active in a religious community.
Look into marriage support groups that can provide you and your spouse a way to seek support.
Talk to a marriage counselor or similar professional to address serious issues in your relationship.

, In some cases, there is nothing you can do to protect your marriage from adultery. It may be that you or your spouse are not committed to the relationship, or have problems with commitment in general. If you have done what you can to protect your marriage from adultery but still feel or know that an affair is occurring, you need to accept reality and decide how to address it.If you or your spouse has committed adultery in the past, it may take extra effort on both of your parts to protect the marriage from adultery in the future.
Remember that it takes two people to make a marriage work. You have to admit it and address it if either of you aren’t committed to keep the marriage free from affairs.

Offer your trust first.,
Build trust over time.,
Confide in people slowly.,
Have different levels of trust for different people.,
Observe a person’s actions and behaviors, not their words.,
Be a trustworthy person in return.,
Remember that no one is perfect.,
Trust yourself.",How to Trust1," Putting yourself out there is tough, but it is much easier to build trusting relationships if you are willing to take the first step. Try something small, like sharing a personal story, confiding a small anxiety, or asking someone to go on a date. If the person is rude or distant, then you can move on to someone else. But if they offer something back or sympathize with you, telling a similar story or agreeing to go on a date, then you’ve both taken the first step towards a trusting relationship., Trust is not a switch that you can switch on or off. Rather, it's built up over time, growing alongside your relationship. Begin trusting people with little things – getting to a meeting on time, helping with small errands – before trusting someone with big secrets.


There is no need to force a judgment on someone right when you meet them.

, Baring your secrets, fears, and insecurities requires a lot of trust. Sharing your emotions with someone often takes place later in a relationship, after you have already built up trust. Start confiding in someone slowly, seeing how they respond, before fully committing to trust them. Whenever you share stories with someone, ask yourself a few questions:


Do they seem interested in what I have to say? Trust requires that both parties care about each other.
Are they willing to share stories about themselves? Trust is a give and take, where both parties feel comfortable sharing.
Are they dismissive, condescending, or oblivious to my worries and concerns? Trust requires respect.

, There is no set “level” of trust that you need with people. There are going to be some people who you trust a little, like coworkers or new acquaintances, and some people you would trust with your life. Instead of putting people into two categories, “trustworthy” and “untrustworthy,” look at trust as a spectrum.

, It is easy to make a promise but hard to keep one. You should watch people’s actions to see if they are trustworthy, not follow their words. If you ask them for a favor, reserve your judgment until the job ends. By observing actions and not words you can view someone’s trust objectively, building trust based on facts.

, If you want to build trust with someone, you need to be trustworthy yourself. If you are constantly breaking promises, telling secrets, or showing up late, you will find that people do the same thing to you. Think about other people's needs. Offer your help and guidance, and listen to them when they talk to build a trusting relationship.


Never share someone’s secrets with other people unless they are in need of help. For example, a depressed friend may confide in you that they have suicidal thoughts, but you should share this with a counselor or professional even if they ask you not to tell.
Keep your promises, and don’t cancel plans once you’ve made them.
Be honest, even in difficult situations.

, Unfortunately, people are always going to make mistakes – skipping a meeting, letting a secret slip, or acting selfishly. If you expect every person to “earn your trust” they will all fall short from time to time. Trusting someone is about seeing through a person’s occasional faults at the bigger picture.When people make the same mistake time after time, or refuse to apologize for problems, they become untrustworthy.

, If you believe someone is trustworthy, then go with your instincts. Having faith in yourself not only makes it easier to build trust, it makes it easier to move on when someone breaks your trust. Know that you are emotionally stable and happy. This helps you feel comfortable taking a risk trusting other people."
"
Know that trustworthy people are reliable and on-time.,
Know that trustworthy people follow through on their words.,
Know that trustworthy people don’t lie.,
Know that trustworthy people will trust you back.,
Note how someone talks about other people.",How to Trust2," Someone you trust values your time and opinion, and won’t put their interests first all the time. Being late to meetings, dates, or events with you is a sign that they may not be fully trustworthy.


Apply this concept within reason – everyone is late from time to time. The bigger issue is with people who are never on time or constantly cancel or change plans with you.

, There is often a big difference between what some people say and what they do, but trustworthy people practice what they preach. To trust someone you have to know that they will do the things they say they will. Trustworthy people, for example:


Keep promises they have made.
Finish jobs, chores, or errands they commit to doing.
Follow through on plans made together., Liars are some of the most difficult people in the world to trust because you can never know what they are actually thinking about. If you catch someone making lies, even small ones, it is a major red-flag that they are not trustworthy. Make a mental note of any large exaggerations and white lies. If they happen every time you see someone, they are more likely than not untrustworthy.


Liars often fidget, have trouble looking you in the eye, and change the details of stories frequently.This includes “lies by omission,” when people hide information from you to avoid tension or anger., More often than not, a trustworthy friend is willing to confide in you as well. They know that having trust is a two-way street, and you must feel comfortable sharing things if you want people to share back. When someone trusts you it is a signal that they value your friendship and opinion, making them less likely to do things that would damage your relationship.

, If someone constantly tells you secrets or says things like, “Benny asked me not to say this, but...” then they will likely do the same with your secrets. The way people act around your is indicative of how they act when you are not around. If you think that other people shouldn’t trust this person, you probably shouldn’t trust them either.

Know that it is normal to have trust issues after trauma.,

Slow down your judgment.,
Know that people remember betrayal more than positive interactions.,
Look for sincere, meaningful apologies.,
Adjust your expectations.,
Know that you may never fully trust someone who has hurt you.,
Make a counseling appointment if you still have severe trust issues.",How to Trust3," After difficult events, most people will become defensive and have a hard time trusting people. This is a survival instinct – trusting someone leaves you vulnerable for future pain. Thus, avoiding trust can protect you from harm.Don’t blame yourself for having trust issues. Rather, acknowledge the pain and try to learn from the past.

, There are negative, mean, and untrustworthy people in the world. Most people, however, are kind and trusting, so don’t let one bad experience or person destroy your ability to trust again. Always remind yourself that there are good people around, too.

, Oftentimes, when we're hurt, angry, or upset, we react emotionally and make the situation worse. Before deciding that you no longer trust someone, take a few minutes to ask yourself rational questions:


What facts do I know about the incident?
What am I guessing or assuming about this person?
How did I behave in this situation? Was I trustworthy?

, According to a Cornell University study,our brains are hardwired to remember betrayal faster than good memories, even if the betrayal is small. Remember your positive interactions with someone as you rebuild trust. There are likely more good memories then you immediately remember.

, People make mistakes, even people you thought you could trust. What matters most after an argument or incident is how the person responds. Quick or curt apologies often show that the person is not really apologizing. Usually, they simply want you to stop being angry at them. Truly sincere apologies are ones that you do not demand, when someone looks you in the eyes and asks for forgiveness. A sincere apology is the first step to rebuilding trust.


Offer your own apologies for wrongdoing when applicable.

, Just because someone has lost your trust doesn’t mean they are entirely untrustworthy. Instead of returning back to where you started, try trusting someone with smaller, more manageable things. When a friend tells secrets behind your back, you may not confide in them again. That doesn’t mean, however, that you cannot still hang out, work on projects, or talk with each other., Unfortunately, though you can rebuild a lot of trust with someone, there are times when the wounds are too deep to be forgiven. If someone has proven to you that they are not trustworthy don't feel bad for cutting them out of your life. You cannot open yourself up to be hurt or abused again.

, Major trauma has a lasting impact on the brain, and you should consider seeing a professional if you cannot build trust with people. A symptom of PTSD is an inability to trust. If you do not want to see a therapist, try out a support group in your area first.


Remember that you are not alone with your issues – there are other people like you who are also struggling with trauma."

Communicate your feelings.,
Be a good listener.,
Ask her how she's feeling.,
Fight fair.",How to Treat a Woman1," Some men underestimate the importance of telling a woman how they feel. In many cases, men prefer to use actions rather than words to communicate their feelings. If that sounds like you, you should know that women need to hear ""I love you"" from time to time, so make it a point to express that sentiment. If you have trouble saying the words, try writing a note or getting a card to let her know how you feel.


The good news: turns out that men are more often the ones to declare feelings of love first in a relationship. Research has determined that men take only 88 days to tell their partner they love them (compared to a woman's 134)while another study says men say ""I love you"" first 70% of the time.Watch your timing. Women prefer to hear ""I love you"" after sex rather than before. It could be they distrust the words a bit if they're uttered before sex as it makes them wonder if your saying ""I love you"" simply to get some action.;
, Everyone--not only women--wants to be heard. If you know how to listen, your woman will greatly appreciate it, and the bond between you two will grow. Try these tips to be a better listener.


Get rid of distractions. That might mean turning off the ballgame or ignoring the text you just got. Try to keep from interrupting unless the question is crucial to your understanding of the situation. Putting your focus completely on your woman shows her that she's important and that you value and are interested in what she has to say.
Read non-verbal cues. Gestures, facial expressions and eye-movements can all be important. Don't just listen with your ears but also with your eyes so you can gain greater insight into what she's feeling.
See things from her point of view. Your girlfriend or wife may be upset about something that would never trouble you, or she might describe a scenario you can't imagine being a part of--but you have to try. Put yourself in her shoes to try to understand what she's communicating more clearly. Even if you don't agree with her reaction or her opinion, keep an open mind and let her know that in any dispute you're always on her side.
Refrain from solving the problem. When a woman is talking through a problem she's facing, a man's first response is to jump in and try to solve it. That impulse comes from a good place, but it's not what a woman wants. She simply wants to be heard, so refrain from coming to the rescue with a solution for the situation. If she does ask your opinion about what she should do, feel free to offer your suggestions, but don't be offended if she chooses a different course of action.

, In many cases, you'll know exactly how the woman in your life is feeling, but sometimes, especially when a relationship is new, you'll have to ask. Researchers in a study published in the journal PLOS showed men images of eyes belonging to men and women and discovered that it was twice as difficult for the men to accurately guess what women were feeling as it was for them to guess what the men were feeling. They also took longer attempting to interpret the women's eyes., Even the closest of couples will have arguments; what's important is how you talk to your woman during those disagreements. Do not call names or make threats or use physical intimidation. When the fight is over, don't hold on to hurt feelings; reach out and meet your woman halfway in making up. Do not discount her feelings by being defensive or try to end the fight by just cutting her off. We all need validation for our feelings.

Demand nothing in return.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You're Sorry," An insincere apology is usually more trouble than no apology at all. If you can’t convince yourself that you are sorry, you probably won’t convince him.Think about when you were a child. Whenever you were forced to make a half-hearted apology to your brother for some minor offense, did it really make either of you feel better?
If you can’t bring yourself to see (and say) that you did anything wrong, then you may need to be willing to lose the relationship. That may be the right choice, but be clear on the possible consequences as you decide whether you can and will apologize.;
, The time-worn notion of putting yourself in another’s shoes is appropriate here. Think closely about how your actions have impacted your boyfriend and why an apology is warranted. This will help you craft a sincere and effective “I’m sorry.”For example, a seemingly innocuous offhand comment on your part about how lousy your school’s basketball team is this year may seem like a bigger deal when you consider that your boyfriend tried out for the team and didn’t make it.
While you usually hear people say “don’t make a mountain out of a molehill,” this is a situation where you may want to do exactly that. Don’t succumb to our natural inclination to downplay the severity of our own actions; focus instead on the genuine hurt you have caused., If you’ve done something wrong and you know it, your guilt can get in the way of making a sincere apology that focuses on the aggrieved party (your boyfriend, for instance). Accepting and moving past your errors will enable you to direct your energies toward your partner’s needs.You may find that doing some self-affirmation exercises (repeating a mantra, doing yoga, writing down your thoughts) before apologizing helps relieve some of the guilt than can make you act defensively as you try to apologize.If you can’t let go, accept your faults, and move forward, odds are your boyfriend won’t be able to either.

, While an off-the-cuff “Sorry!” is appropriate when you accidentally step on your boyfriend’s toe or spill your drink on him, more serious apologies are best made with preparation and even practice.In order to ensure that you cover the “three R’s” — regret, responsibility, and remedy — that most good apologies include, it is best to think about exactly what you want to say. Practicing in front of a mirror or a friend may even help.
Face-to-face apologies are usually best, but written ones can be an option if your boyfriend refuses to see you (because you forgot to pick him up at the airport, for instance), or if you know your apology will come out much better that way.
While waiting until you can get your apology just right is normally preferable, it may sometimes be best to preemptively apologize before he expresses his hurt feelings. For example, if you know he’ll be mad you forgot his birthday, you may want to be ready with a good “I’m sorry” before he has a chance to express his disappointment., Whatever form your apology takes, make it crystal clear that you are the responsible party and he is the one who has been wronged. Don’t try to minimize, justify, or share blame.Even if there is blame to share, this is your apology, so you should focus on what you did wrong. Don’t focus on the apology you think you deserve (right now, anyway), but on the one you deserve to give.
Think about using sentences that follow the form “I … you,” where you fill in the specifics of what you did to hurt him, and what you will do to either fix the damage of prevent a repeat., If you’ve ever been disappointed by the non-apology “apologies” that many politicians and celebrities seem to excel at giving, it may be the lack of specific admissions of guilt and remorse that bother you.


More often than not, it is best to specifically say “I’m sorry” and “I was wrong.” Such simple phrases can be incredibly difficult to say, but they are the foundation of a good apology.Throwing in a “because” as well — where you clearly express why you are at fault — is also a good idea.Compare, for instance “My bad. My friends and I were having so much fun that I totally lost track of time and forgot about your show” with “I am sorry that I missed your band’s show. I was wrong to not make it my first priority for tonight, because I know it was important for me to be there to support you.”

, You may hope that he will immediately accept your well-crafted apology and forgive you on the spot, but hurt feelings don’t always heal so quickly. While you don’t have to accept verbal abuse (and certainly not any other kind), give some leeway for him to vent his frustrations or disappointment.It can be difficult to make apologies, and it is tough for many people to receive them. Some may use the apology as an excuse to unload a whole host of hurt feelings. Or he may clam up and say nothing, or try to ignore or avoid listening to you. Focus on what you can control, and listen patiently if he wants to speak.
Don’t demand or expect forgiveness, at least not right away. Instead of putting it on him by saying “please forgive me,” instead state “I hope that you can offer me your forgiveness at some point.”

, As indicated by the previous steps in this article, the best apologies are well thought-out, get to the point, and are explicit about your culpability, remorse, and dedication to healing the wound.Consider the following sample apologies, which utilize the “three R’s” of regret, responsibility, and remedy:

""I'm sorry, I realize that by being late I made us miss the first part of the movie. Next time the movie is on me.”
""I'm sorry. I know it is difficult for you to trust people and my lying to you hasn't made it any easier. I shouldn't have lied no matter how afraid I was of your reaction. I promise to be truthful to you from now on.""
""I'm sorry for talking to you like that. I shouldn’t have said those words to you. I'll work on letting you know when I don't like something instead of holding it all in and then exploding like that.""



, If you’ve offered a remedy with your apology, then be sure you are willing and able to back it up. Think of your apology as being incomplete until you follow through with this final part of it.If you’ve promised not to be late anymore, change your routines in noticeable ways so that you can be on time. A recognizable change in behavior is a good sign of sincerity.
Each time you have to make the same apology over again, it will become less believable and less acceptable. Maybe you can’t completely change your tendency of saying hurtful things when you’re stressed out, but a demonstrated effort to change will make the next apology more likely to be accepted.

, An apology paired with hand-holding or a hand on the shoulder, or followed by a hug, can prove even more effective. Touch expresses intimacy (you know and understand him) and sincerity (you really mean what you are saying).Rely on your judgment, of course. If you’ve really hurt someone, he may recoil at your touch. Don’t try to force contact when it is not welcomed. But you may be surprised by how often even the most stoic of boyfriends will want a hug when his feelings are hurt.

, A good apology demonstrates that you know this other person well, and including an act that you know will be appreciated can further amplify it.Write a poem or song about him. Paint a picture or assemble a photo collage of happy times you have shared. Make his favorite meal. Volunteer to help out at his favorite charitable organization.
The act doesn’t necessarily have to be related to your offense, but that can be particularly effective in some circumstances. If you forgot his birthday, throw him a surprise “Happy Belated Birthday” party a week or two later. Pull out all the stops to make it his kind of party.
Not to generalize on all boyfriends, but some may particularly welcome caring acts of a more physical nature. If you are comfortable with it, that is your decision to make. Never let yourself be forced to do anything you don’t want to do — of any sort, physical or otherwise — as part of an apology, however. Apologizing is not an invitation to be taken advantage of.

, Remember to focus on your role and on what you need to do as part of your apology. You can’t control how he will respond, or what he will say or do.All you can do is show yourself to be a good partner by demonstrating that you can admit when you’re wrong and work to remedy the situation. It is up to him to demonstrate his true nature in how he responds and whether he can admit his role (if he has one) in the problem.
Freely-given apologies (and offers of forgiveness) are important to the long-term success of a relationship. Coerced apologies and demands for forgiveness are shaky ground to build a relationship upon.

Improve your relationship with your boyfriend.",How to Understand Men," Research has shown that men are more likely than women to take jobs in which pay is dependent on outperforming their peers, and you probably know from personal experience that men tend to be more interested in sports (playing or watching).A lot of men act this way because they thrive on competition, and take satisfaction in having skills or traits that dominate others. If you're playing against him in a game, don't be surprised if his mood suddenly turns intense and merciless if he starts losing. Accept it with good humor and move on.


Encourage his competitive hobbies. You'll notice that a lot of stereotypical men's activities - such as gaming, watching or playing sports, and extreme sporting - are focused on some element of competition. Because succeeding in competition can be more important to men, support the activities that can bring your guy this sort of satisfaction in a relatively safe way.;
, Eyesight is one of the strongest senses, and processing all the things you may see takes up a large portion of day-to-day cerebral processing. Men, however, are even more apt than women to respond to visual cues.As a result, you might find that men prefer to view a map to understand directions over hearing the directions read, or they might insist that they need to see a problem in order to fix it. Try not to be annoyed at this tendency, and accept it as an inborn trait he may not know how to control.


Don't be too offended if he looks at other women. Being more attentive to visual stimulus means that a guy might be more inclined to look - or even stare - at attractive people. But don't get bent out of shape - just because he looks at a woman in a low-cut shirt doesn't mean he automatically wants to sleep with her. These small glances are generally harmless, and are more of a reflex than an indication of a doomed relationship.

, Research indicates that this difference begins in childhood, when little girls form bonds by sharing secrets and discussing problems while boys bond over shared activities and interests . If you expect your boyfriend or husband to be like your best female conversation partner, only better, you might be surprised - men tend not to build strong relationships through conversation, and they switch topics more frequently than women do.In addition to this, men also don't make as much eye contact when they're talking to someone. Instead, their gazes wander to other objects in the immediate area as they talk.


Instead of punishing him for this difference and complaining that he never listens to you, choose your battles. If you really want to discuss an important topic with a man, frame it in a way that doesn't leave him guessing. Say, ""It's important to me that we talk about this, and it would mean a lot to me if you could listen closely."" If he cares about you, he'll make the extra effort to up his participation to your level.
Expect to hear a solution. Another side effect to the way men have conversations is that they tend to focus on how to fix a problem. If you just want a man to offer you comfort and reassurance instead of instructing you on what to do, tell him that at the beginning of the conversation. Remember that he's trying to help you find a solution because he cares, and that's what he thinks caring people do in a conversation, not because he wants to boss you around.

, Think of the old stereotype of a husband who has no idea what he's done to enrage his wife. It's possible that he's not just being deliberately clueless - he might genuinely have no idea why she's upset, or whether she's upset at all. Because women have more developed limbic systems, they're better at classifying and reading emotions, a skill that was useful when women were primarily in charge of maintaining social connections in ancient cultures. Men, on the other hand, lag behind women in studies of how the sexes identify and control emotions.Don't expect him to read your mind. If you're upset at a man, tell him in a way that's as calm and reasonable as possible. Once he's aware of how you feel, he can take measures to remedy the problem. If you don't tell him, though, you can't necessarily count on him to pick up your cues.
Give him space. Because men aren't accustomed to discussing their personal problems at length with a buddy, you might find that they tend to process such problems on their own. If a man shuts down when you try to discuss his personal issues, back off gracefully and give him space to get over it. Most men will let you know if they want to talk about it.

, Studies show that men in seemingly platonic relationships with women are more likely to be attracted to their female friends, and also more likely to have the misguided belief that the women harbor sexual feelings for them. Though women have also shown signs of having sexual feelings for their male friends, they are more likely to back off when they know the men are in relationships; men are less deterred when their female friends have boyfriends and still show signs of wanting to pursue them.This doesn't mean, however, that every male friend you have really has a crush on you, deep down.

, Though men and women may be completing the same task or inhabiting the same office, men and women take a different approach to getting work done. Men tend to be more focused on completing a specific task while women are more focused about the process used to get the job done; women tend to ask more questions while men have a harder time listening. Both sexes, however, do feel that the oppose sex is not as sensitive to their needs in the workplace.Men and women tend to react differently in the workplace in terms of stress, too. While women may openly express concern about a failed project, men may retreat and seek solitude in the face of failure.
Women and men also seek appreciation differently. Women are happier when they are complimented on a group task, while men like to be singled out.

, Though you may be convinced that your boyfriend, male friend, or male co-worker would want to sleep with every woman on the planet in an ideal world, that is not the case. Though men may look at the women around them and can have wandering eyes, they are still selective when the time comes to actually sleep with someone.


If you're convinced that your boyfriend really wants to sleep with all women, then why are you together? If this is really a problem in your relationship because of who he is, then it's one thing, but if it's because you think it's because he's a man, then you have to rethink your ideas.
Sure, you may have the occasional sleazy male friend. But remember that men may want to brag about how many women they like to sleep with to look tough; that doesn't mean they are interested in following through.

, You may think that your boyfriend hates it when it's your turn to pick the location and event for date night, but that's not actually true. Sure, your boyfriend may moan and groan when you make him watch Love Actually for the tenth time, but the truth is, he likes doing what you want to do because, well, it's what makes you happy.


Remind yourself that if your boyfriend really didn't want to do something, he just wouldn't do it. And the same goes for you.

, Think of Tony Soprano: a tough guy on the outside and a big, soft, sensitive bear on the inside. It's true that women may like to be more open with their feelings and to talk more, but that doesn't mean that men aren't sensitive, don't have the ability to get hurt, and don't know how to sympathize or empathize. Men may be more resistant to showing emotion, but that doesn't mean that they don't have feelings that are just as big as yours.


Men are not cavemen who are only obsessed with the basic necessities: food, sex, and sleep. Get this thought out of your mind.

, Sure, men may be more likely to think often about sex than women, especially if they're teenagers, but that doesn't mean that they only have one thing on their minds at all times. Just like anyone else, men spend time thinking about their friends, family, hopes and dreams, and career prospects. If a hot woman in heels walks by, then sure, they may be momentarily distracted, but that doesn't mean that the inside of his mind looks like the XXX section of your local video store.

, When it comes to looks, men and women can both be superficial. You may think that men only care about what a girl's body looks like, adding bonus points if she actually has a nice face, but that is not the case when men get serious about a girl. Don't think that all you have to do to impress a man is to hit the gym, put on the eyeliner, and wear tight pants. You have to impress him with your charm, your brains, and your ability to have a good conversation.


Sure, some men are more obsessed with looks than they should be. But you can say the same for women.

, You may think that men are known for being cheaters; and who can forget the Tiger Woods scandal? However, both men and women are capable of cheating, even if women tend to look for more of an emotional connection while men look for the physical connection. Don't think that your guy is likely to cheat on you just because he's a guy; if he does, it's because he's looking for a connection outside the relationship.That doesn't mean that there aren't some real scumbags out there. But women could be scumbags, too.

, You may think that any man you meet is terrified of commitment and wants to run for the hills as soon as you say the phrase, ""I think you should meet my parents."" In reality, men are just as likely to commit as women. You're just thinking of the 20% of men who are true commitment-phobes. Just remember that there are plenty of women who are equally afraid of getting serious with someone.


If your current love interest is afraid to commit to you, then don't tell yourself it's just because he's ""a typical man."" There are lots of other reasons for why a man may not want to commit, such as a lack of experience or the pain he suffered in a past relationship.

, Sure, men might be intimidated by strong women -- if you're Michelle Obama or Oprah Winfrey. But in general, men are actually attracted to assertive women who know what they want and are comfortable with going after it. Don't try to act girly, clueless, or giggly just to impress a guy. If you want a man to take you seriously, then you have to show him your full potential.


Being strong means being confident. And everyone is attracted to confidence.

, If you want to understand men on an even deeper level, then you should try to understand the male ego.

, Mastering this process could improve your relationship in the long run.

, This can help you understand the thought process of a man who is in it for the long haul.

, This is a challenging aspect of understanding men.

, If you have a better sense of how to improve your relationship with your boyfriend, you'll have a better understanding of men.

Be polite.,
Don't change or break plans.,
Be on time.,
Treat her family well.,
Avoid jealousy.,
Help around the house.",How to Treat a Woman2," Women like to hear ""please"" and ""thank you."" Even if you've been dating a while or married a long time, don't throw manners out the window. Show her the same thoughtfulness you'd show anyone else.


Avoid using profanity. Never use profanity or offensive slang to refer to your woman, even if you're just kidding. If you hold her in high regard, be sure your language reflects that.

, If it's an emergency or the change is completely unavoidable, of course you can break a date, but be sure to give as much advance notice as possible and offer a very good explanation and an apology.

, If you're running late, call as soon as you can to let her know. Everyone's time is valuable, and being somewhere when you say you will is just common courtesy. Resist the impulse to put off calling because you fear your woman will be angry. She might be, but chances are she'll be even angrier if you're not in touch.

, Even if she says that she's not close with her family, always be respectful toward them and avoid criticizing them. Family bonds can be strong, and parents and siblings can influence a woman's decision to date or dump a guy.


If a woman has children, be friendly toward them and do your best to get to know them. Women are quick to say good-bye to men who do not treat their children with kindness. Don't ever overstep your bounds and try to parent or discipline her kids; leave that to the woman in your life.

, Being jealous of male friends, co-workers and exes without good reason tells a woman that you consider her to be deceitful and of low moral character. Not a message you want to send to someone you care for.

, If you two live together, pitch in on chores. Both of you are responsible for the housework. Don't expect her to constantly pick up after you. One of the surest ways to a woman's heart is with a vacuum cleaner in one hand and a box of laundry detergent in the other.

Acknowledge special occasions.,
Celebrate your anniversary.,
Give thoughtful gifts.,
Give flowers.,
Mention her to your friends.",How to Treat a Woman3," Be sure you're ready with a card and a gift when her birthday rolls around, or it's time to celebrate Christmas or Valentine's Day. Marking these and other occasions with tokens of love and appreciation are a great way to make a woman feel special. Remember, too, that right or wrong, her family and friends will likely ask her what you got her or how the two of you celebrated. Don't put your woman on the spot by forcing her to lie or to admit that you let the occasion pass without recognition.
, Anniversaries are like mini-time machines--they allow the two of you to relive an important event (your wedding day, your first date, etc.) They're a chance to re-experience the special emotion created in and by that moment. Show the woman in your life that you value that event and all that's happened since, by doing something special on your anniversary. If you can afford it and your wife or girlfriend would enjoy it, go ahead and do something extravagant. But what can be most meaningful is a card or a conversation in which you reminisce about the good times and the growth of your relationship and your happiness.

, Gifts that come from the heart are among the most appreciated. Put some time and thought into choosing something your woman would love or make something for her yourself. When you invest that kind of time and thought into gift giving, she can't help but be touched.

, Not every woman is a sucker for flowers, but the majority really do appreciate a bouquet, especially if it's being given for no particular reason. Bring flowers on your next date or have them delivered to her home or workplace if that's appropriate. A card that says simply ""Thinking of you"" is enough to bring a smile to her face.
, If she's important to you, your friends should know it. That doesn't mean that you have to go on and on about her (and never discuss what happens in the bedroom with your friends), but making it clear that she's an important part of your life will make her feel special versus make her feel like someone you want to hide or keep from your friends.

Understand that little things mean a lot.,
Send a message.,
Give compliments.,
Follow her lead.,
Embrace foreplay.,
Pop the question.",How to Treat a Woman4," While big romantic gestures may have their place, it's the little things that show a woman how much she means to you. Thoughtful acts like bringing her a cup of coffee in the morning or putting air in her car tires are very concrete ways of saying ""I love you"" without you having to utter a word. Be consistent. Show her in some way each day that you're thinking of her and trying to make her life a bit easier and happier.
, Scratch out a quick note, send her a text or fire off an email to let her know you're thinking of her. If she has a big day coming up--a job interview, a presentation at work--send her a message of encouragement and support.

, You may never have to answer the question, ""Do these pants make my butt look big?"" if you're quick to compliment your woman on her appearance. Dispel any insecurities by saying nice things about parts of her body she might feel less than great about, and don't forget to compliment the things you find most attractive about her. Don't underestimate the impact of a simple ""You look beautiful""--that pretty much says it all.


If you do get the ""Do these pants make my butt look big?"" question, the correct answer is always ""No.""
We all like to be recognized for the things that make us special, so compliment your woman for being who she is. Is she creative, fascinating, funny? Do you admire her achievements and her outlook on life? Tell her! And be sure to look her straight in the eye when you do so.

, Initially, let the woman set the pace for your physical relationship. No woman wants to feel pressured to have sex before she's ready, and everyone has a different timetable for being ready. Let her know how you feel, but back off (without pouting) if she wants to wait before getting intimate.

, Physiologically, experts agree that foreplay is an important part of sexual health. In fact, an Australian study found that the majority of women are more aroused by the idea of foreplay than sex itself.Hold, touch and caress your partner, play games or talk dirty. If you're not sure what your woman likes, ask. Just do it outside the bedroom. It's easier to have that conversation if you're not just about to have sex.

, If you love her, you're ready to settle down and you know she's the one, then make the commitment. If you plan to propose marriage, be sure you mean it. Buy a ring if you can, get on one knee and tell her that you can't imagine your life without her and ask if she'll do you the honor of becoming your wife.

Understand that Libras are social butterflies.,
Know that Libras will mostly likely not engage in debate.",How to Treat a Libra," Whether you are trying to befriend a Libra or date one, you should know that Libras don’t like being alone (and aren’t very good at it.) That means that once you get close to your Libra, you’re probably going to be spending a good deal of time with him or her. Be prepared for that and don’t get on their case about it.If you do find that you are feeling a little claustrophobic, be honest about it in a nice way. Just say something like, ‘I just feel like being by myself for a bit--sometimes I like to take time to just reconnect with myself. It doesn’t have anything to do with you--I love spending time with you!’;
, Libras are pretty sensitive when it comes to criticism, particularly about their physical characteristics. Don’t make a habit of teasing them about their looks--this is one group of people who don’t really see the humor in that form of teasing.If there is something you want to point out to them about their appearance that might embarrass them, do it subtly. Rather than saying ‘Holy crap you have a huge chunk of lettuce in your teeth. Gross!’ say something that will subtly draw his/her attention to it like ‘Hun, you have a little bit of something in that pretty smile of yours.’

, Libras are not big on confrontation--in fact, they pretty much just run away from it. If something is bothering you, just bring it up to them in a non-aggressive way. If they don’t feel like they are entering into a confrontation, they will be more than happy to talk it out with you.

, Despite the fact that they don’t like confrontation, Libras don’t really have any qualms about holding onto grudges, particularly if it really was a big deal (like the time you forgot your anniversary and your Libra got pissed.) To avoid inspiring grudges, try to stay on top of the important dates in your relationship (that means birthday, anniversary, days that are meaningful to your Libra--like the anniversary of a death of a loved one--etc.)

, Libras have a soft spot for beauty (which means you must be doing alright if a Libra loves to hang out with you.) Take your Libra on a beauty-filled adventure to the Redwoods, the beach, to an art museum, etc. Bring your Libra flowers, or prepare a lovely meal for him/her.You should also be aware that because Libras love beauty, they also love looking their best. Don’t get frustrated if your Libra takes a longer time getting ready (or is maybe even a little prideful about his or her looks.)

, Libras have a great love of justice, which means that they will almost never resort to dubious means in order to get something they want. Keep this fact in mind if your Libra ever seems to be acting sketchy--it is likely that it is just in your head as your Libra will go to great lengths to uphold justice.

, If you are dating a Libra, you should know that Libras eat, breath and drink romance. If you want to treat your Libra right, whip out the romantic gestures. Plan romantic outings for you and your Libra love, bring them flowers, chocolates, whatever they like. If nothing else, just let them you know you really like (or love!) them--cuddle, kiss, and most importantly, be nice to them (but of course that applies to anyone you have feelings for.), Libras have a tendency to be indecisive. Treat them right by simply deciding what you’re going to do. If you guys are going out somewhere, choose the restaurant, or the movie, or the club...etc. Of course, you should always check to make sure that the activity is something your Libra actually wants to do, but if your Libra is struggling to decide between two things, save him/her the trouble and just make the executive decision., And by sharing, we mean anything--food, a seat, personal stories. But specifically for this step, know that Libras love to share. This means that if you order separate dishes, be prepared to give away a few (or many) bites--but don’t worry, your Libra will be happy to share their last bite of delectable chocolate mousse., Libras are one of the most social (if not the most social) of the Zodiac symbols. As such, they like to flit from person to person at social gatherings. Understand that your Libra is not intentionally avoiding you--she/he just can’t help but talk to everyone at a party. It’s also good to remember that Libras strive to please everyone--even strangers they meet at parties.

, This applies particularly to social settings. There is a reason that Libras are represented by the scale--they like to keep the peace by hearing both sides of an argument or debate. That means they won’t necessarily back you up in a debate, as they will also want to hear the other side. Don’t take this personally--instead, learn from your Libra friend and try to be opened-minded.


However, that doesn’t mean they don’t have your back. If you have a problem that you just can’t seem to solve (making amends with a friend, what to do about your renegade younger brother, etc.) your Libra will be there to help you through it. Libras are fantastic at looking at a problem objectively and figuring out how to solve it in the least dramatic way.

Determine whether you and your partner have similar values.,
Look for parallels in your individual goals.,
Consider if you have mutual friends and passions.,
Think about your happiness levels.",How to Tell Whether Your Relationship Will Last1," The old saying “opposites attract” appears to be true, but only for short-term flings. Research shows that couples who share similar traits, such as economic background, religion, and closeness in age tend to enjoy happier and more stable marriages.Obviously, you and your significant other don’t have to be identical twins to work, but looking for key commonalities is important.


Specifically, it’s especially vital that you and your partner have similar values and principles about life. For example, does your partner share your religious and political beliefs? If being family-oriented and charitable are important to you, does your partner feel similarly?
While you don’t have to have the exact same values, it’s probably important to figure out whether you have values that clash. For example, you may value integrity most of all and your partner values loyalty. This may become complicated if your partner’s emphasis on being loyal to someone of questionable character causes you to jeopardize your integrity.;
,

Just as you would want to develop a long-term relationship with someone who has similar beliefs and values, you also want to be with someone who is going in the same direction that you are in life. What do you and your partner want out of life individually? Do your separate goals conflict?

Evaluate whether you and your partner are on the same page with your goals. Your individual and relationship goals should be mostly in alignment with one another’s. For instance, it can cause trouble down the line if one person wants kids, but the other does not.
Sit down with your partner and share your dreams and goals.Encourage your partner to do the same. Having a candid conversation about what each of you want can prevent future conflict and disappointment.

, Think over how many times your partner involves you in their life. Have you met their parents? Do you personally know their friends? Do you and your partner have similar interests or share a hobby? If you are in a relationship but you are basically living separate lives, this could be a red flag that the relationship isn’t going anywhere., Are you mostly happy when you are together? When two people are together, they should be enjoying the time together as much as possible. If quarreling takes up most of the time, or you are just counting the seconds until your partner leaves, you may need to evaluate whether you even want this relationship.


A healthy relationship should consist of two people who are genuinely interested in one another. This involves laughing together and being excited about spending time with one another."

Figure out your motives.,
Extend an invitation.,
If you want to get to know them without doing anything too adventurous, just invite them along on a walk or to get some coffee/tea.,
Keep your word.",How to Tell Someone You Want to Spend More Time With Them," What is it that attracts you to this person? What might you see yourself doing with them that they would also enjoy? Find out what interests you have in common and where you might collaborate on something fun and creative. Could you offer to teach them how to rock climb or bake a mean pie? Do you want to form an a cappella singing group - and they're a musician? Find ways that you can break new ground together.;
, Now that you've thought of something you would both enjoy doing, invite them to join you with a friendly smile and an enthusiastic, but unattached, spirit.

, Act independent about it: casually mention that you like to go for walks on the beach to decompress after work, or that you like the vibe at a certain cafe. Then tell them you'd love for them to join you sometime because (fill in the blank - they have such an interesting life and you'd like to hear more about their background; you enjoy their company; you want to hear more about that book they're reading; etc.) Be confident and extend a simple, gentle complement. Nothing more is needed.

, If the person says yes, set a date and stick to it. Honoring your word and being punctual show respect for the other person's time, and you let them know you're someone they can depend on.

Ask yourself whether your relationship has trust.,
Look closely at the way you communicate.,
Determine if your personal boundaries are respected.,
Notice if physical touch is used and reciprocated.,
See if there is empathy between partners.",How to Tell Whether Your Relationship Will Last2," Trust is an essential aspect of a healthy relationship. The ability to trust your partner and be trustworthy can make or break your relationship. The elements of trust may include:

Being able to open up and be vulnerable
Being there for one another
Being consistent in your actions
Doing what you say you will

, Communication is another fundamental component of relationships that last. Being able to communicate your thoughts, opinions, needs, and ideas to your partner effectively and be willing to actively listen as your partner does the same. If you and your partner often run into barriers to communication, this must be addressed in order for the relationship to survive long-term., Even though you are a part of a romantic relationship, you still have individual rights that must be respected. It’s necessary to set boundaries in any relationship to ensure that each individual has a framework in place that protects them from being manipulated or abused by others.If you and your partner do not have boundaries in place — or those boundaries are not being acknowledged and respected, you need to enforce them in order for the relationship to work. Signs that your relationship lacks boundaries may include:Allowing your partner speak to you in ways that are disrespectful or uncomfortable
Having difficulty saying “no”
Acting against your personal beliefs or values
Giving excessively to feel useful
Being unable to communicate your needs
Being repeatedly touched in ways you have asked not to be touched, or asked to perform sexual acts that make you uncomfortable (i.e. after you have established said act as a hard boundary)

, Touch is important for maintaining intimacy and connection in romantic relationships. Sometimes, partners think their relationship is perfectly fine simply because it is not characterized by arguing or tension. Not having these issues doesn’t mean a relationship is built to last.


If you and your partner do not touch (i.e. hold hands, hug, caress, etc.), it can signal a bigger problem. The main issue lies in touch not being reciprocated. A relationship with good emotional intimacy and satisfaction is demonstrated by whether your partner reciprocates touch when it is given. For example, if you hug your significant other and they don't make a move to return the gesture, your relationship could be suffering in the intimacy department., By now, you understand that being able to communicate your emotional needs is important for long-term relationship success. In the same vein, being able to identify and empathize with what your partner is feeling is equally integral.An empathetic partner will express their feelings over the other partner's situation, try to see things from their partner's point of view, ask questions, restate what's being said, and validate their feelings.
If you and your partner have reached a point of not seeming to care about one another’s feelings, this could be a sign that your relationship is dying a slow death.

"
"
Determine if the relationship is mutually exclusive.,
Assess your readiness for commitment.,
Calculate your willingness to compromise and resolve conflict.",How to Tell Whether Your Relationship Will Last3," It’s impossible for your relationship to last if one of you thinks the relationship is monogamous and the other things your relationship is polyamorous or open. Make sure you have a very clear, open discussion about whether or not you are seeing other people and if you need the relationship to be exclusive. Some people can make open relationships work, but this takes a lot of trust and communication with your partner. Being entangled with another person means that you or your partner are not completely invested in the relationship.


There are many ways to determine if the two of you are exclusive. Discussing future plans, meeting family and friends, and acknowledging the relationship in public or online are all signs that the relationship is exclusive.Nevertheless, it’s better to be straightforward. A person could discuss the future but still be secretly communicating with an ex. Your best bet is to pull your significant other aside and ask where this is going: “Hey, I just wanted to know where we stand? Are we dating other people or is it just me and you?”

,

If you’re in a relationship, but deep down you aren’t actually ready to take it to the next level, your partner needs to know. When this happens, partners are likely to make “mistakes” that cause a rift or unconsciously sabotage the relationship to prevent it from going anywhere.

Your relationship is certainly not going to last if either of you isn’t ready to commit. Be candid with yourself and your partner and decide if you want this relationship to last long-term., Commitment in a relationship means making a choice to stick it out even during the tough times. If you think you are ready to commit to your partner, you also need to examine how the two of you handle conflict.


Do fights generally end with one of you always having to relent? Is your partner emotionally or verbally abusive? Being able to resolve conflict in a healthy way using effective communication and compromise is an important indicator of how long your relationship will last.Be willing to discuss difficult topics. If one or both of you avoid conflict, this doesn't mean you have no issues, it means nothing is ever resolved. No relationship is perfect, and there will be disagreements and arguments from time to time. One or both of you need to be willing to initiate hard conversations. Even if it's uncomfortable you need to be able to hash things out and fully resolve them.

If you really love your woman, go out and celebrate your marriage.,
Say, ""I love you honey!"".,
Trust her and win back her trust.,
Do not cheat your partner.,
Do not compare your wife with other women publicly.,
Never take her for granted.,
Welcome communications.,
Understand that it is okay to be not perfect for you as well as your wife.,
Quarrels, arguments, and qualms are part of every relationship.,
Give respect to each other.,
Remember all the celebration dates.",How to Understand Your Wife," Spend time with your wife on the weekends. You need to work hard and earn love and care that you receive from your wife.;
, Women need to know and be reassured that they are loved. Express your feelings several times a day and by saying, ""I love you!"" Use these 3 words often, even when she is your wife and she very well knows that you love her. Expressing love eases stress and strengthens relationships.

, Trust is the most important pillar for any relationship. You need to trust her completely to win back her trust. Show faith and trust in her abilities, decisions, and choices. As you do so, she will turn out to be a more confident and decisive person and, thus, would be far easier to understand! She will be clearly able to tell you, whatever she wants from you.

, If you could risk your relationship for another one, there is no way you can win back her love with these tips.

, It’s not okay to draw parallels publicly and expect her to understand her faults. No one likes to live lives of others. It would be like she comparing you to other men and pointing out how much better husbands others are to their wives.

, Always ask and do not command. No one likes to live a life set through other people's standards. A man who treats his wife like a princess shows that he has been raised in the arms of a queen, so it’s your pride if you behave like a gentleman.

, Do not retrograde if she wants to open up and say something. It is very important to communicate your differences to each other. At times, you need not reply. Just listen to the complete conversation so as to make out where the problem is and find the solution. Never find faults within the other person. That only spoils the whole conversation and the quality of the relationship.

, It is also important that you expect her the way she is and not try to change her to fit your expectations. Don’t expect too much from her. Happy relationships need not have perfect people though perfect companions! If you could become her best friend, no one knows her better than you.

, Learn to live beyond them.

, Learn every one of her favorites, such as foods, colors, clothing, brands, etc. Every time you fail to recognize her preferences in a restaurant or a shopping mall, you make her feel that she is not important to you.

, This includes birthdays and anniversaries. Why? Simply because these are special days for you two and if she is important to you, so should be the days and celebrations with her.

"
"
Know what you want to say.,
Practice with an open minded person.,
Communicate directly with loved ones first.,
Choose a good time and place to talk.,
Use “I” statements.",How to Tell Someone You're an Atheist1," Having your talking points planned out can be a huge help. This will allow you to focus on the important parts of the conversation and get your message across to the other person. If you need to, practice in front of a mirror or write out your main points before the conversation.An example of something you might say would be “I know that the rest of the family is religious, but I simply do not believe the same things.”;
, Some friends or family members will be more open and accepting than others. These people make a good place to start when coming out as an atheist. They are likely to have a positive and compassionate reaction. This will build your confidence to approach your less open-minded loved ones.


For example, you might start by asking your uncle “Why is that you never go to church with everyone else?” Keep in mind that it may not mean he is atheist at all, but you can now steer the conversation in that direction by saying something like “Church is awkward for me because I am atheist.”
If you have a friend or family member that is openly atheist, it might be a good idea to have a conversation with them about how they came out.

, Posting the information to Facebook, or telling a friend of a friend will almost surely lead to your loved ones finding out secondhand. Word travels fast, and your closest connections will likely be upset by the fact that you didn’t tell them yourself. You should make time to talk to parents, best friends, siblings, etc. before coming out publicly. Saying something like “I need to talk to you about something, and I wanted you to hear it from me,” is a good way to start this conversation with a loved one. Naturally, they will ask what it is, and you can continue with “I am an atheist.”
Failing to tell those closest to you may alienate them. The task of telling them you are atheist can be challenging enough without added tension.

, You want your loved ones to be in the right frame of mind to hear you out, instead of just lashing out at you. If you plan to tell your religious friends or family about your lack of belief, you should do it in private, with plenty of time to discuss the matter, and at a time that they are in a good mood.A good time and place to discuss this might be at a family dinner. On the contrary, it may be a bad idea to bring it up at your parent’s workplace, or even worse, in their church.

, Coming out as an atheist can seem like a way to rebel, or can come across as confrontational to the religious establishment in which you were raised (or formerly identified). Make sure that you frame the conversation around your lack of religion and not the fact that you find the other person's belief to be “wrong.”Try saying things like “I personally do not believe that God is real,” in place of things like “Believing in God is absolutely absurd. There is no proof!”

"
Make sure that you mean it.,
Talk over your feelings with a friend.,
Write down your feelings.,
Put yourself in his or her shoes.,
Figure out what went wrong.",How to Tell Someone You Still Love Them1," If you're going to tell someone that you still love them, you should be certain that you do, indeed, still love them. Try to gain a clear perspective on the situation. Clarify why you are telling this person that you still love them, and try to imagine how he or she will react. Ask yourself what you hope to gain from saying this. Perhaps you are trying to win someone back, or apologize for something that you did, or simply reaffirm your feelings.;
, Find someone mature and trustworthy – ideally, someone who is experienced with navigating the waters of love. Ask your friend for advice. Test out the words that you want to say. Talk out the situation in order to clarify your thoughts.


Do not take this person's advice without considering the situation for yourself!
It can help to confide your feelings in a friend who personally knows the object of your love. Be careful, though: you don't want to tell someone who will gossip and spread the word!

, Try brainstorming and writing in stream-of-consciousness in order to explore your thoughts more effectively. Make sure that you don't just want your partner back out of loneliness, guilt, power, or fear – nor any other reason, save love. Be true to yourself and the other person.Ultimately, you will need to forgive yourself and your partner. Avoid conditional forgiveness. Let go.
Look at what you want, but also what the relationship needs. If the case is conditional, such as, ""I love you, but I want you to stop drinking,"" then you may need an third-party counselor, friend, or relative to help you and your partner. Ultimately it is up to your partner to choose to change themselves. You cannot change them directly.

, Think about the situation from the perspective of the person that you love. Ask yourself whether this person still loves you, and whether he/she will be receptive to your admission. Love is a two-way street, so try not to make it all about your own feelings!


Be aware of the impact that your words will have. You might stir up old feelings, and you might destabilize the new life that this person is trying to build. Ask yourself whether you intend to follow through on your words.
Consider that it is sometimes best to ""let sleeping dogs lie."" If it has been a while since your relationship with this person ended, then it may not be appropriate to confess your love. This might be especially true if he/she is in the middle of building a relationship with someone else.

, Simple mistakes or problems happen, such as forgetting an anniversary or being late or absent one too many times to a special event, but when there is an innocent explanation most problems resolve themselves. Do not rush back into things without understanding why the relationship ran aground.


Determine whether distance is the cause. The uncertainty can lead you to paranoia about what the other partner is doing, or with whom they spend time. If you will be separated for months at a time, then you may need to make a plan to keep the relationship alive. Consider taking a break, or opening up the relationship, or moving to wherever your partner is.
You may find that you disagree on certain matters that feel central to your partnership: religious, political, familial, or lifestyle choices. Perhaps your partner wants children, but you do not; perhaps the two of you have begun to fight about which candidate to support in the upcoming election. Consider whether these things are more important than the love you have for this person.

Be prepared to answer questions.,
Choose what you will share.,
Decide how to approach social media.,
Discuss the topic at work.,
Try to keep an open mind and be respectful of others.",How to Tell Someone You're an Atheist2," People often ask about each other’s beliefs and invite one another to religious gatherings. You can either choose to dodge the questions, or answer them. There is no need to wear an “Atheist” T-shirt everywhere you go, but if you are going to identify publicly as an atheist, you have to come right out and say “I am an atheist,” and be prepared for the conversation that follows.Saying something such as “I am not religious and prefer not to discuss religion,” is a good way to end the conversation most of the time. Keep in mind that some people will still continue to ask you questions, and you can still insist that you would prefer to talk about something else.

, You may be asked a lot of questions. Sometimes, this is out of genuine curiosity, and others times, it is an attempt to shame or convert you. It is up to you what you disclose and to whom you disclose it.If you are asked what religion you observe during a job interview, you can easily redirect the question with something like “I do not feel like my spirituality is relevant to this interview.”

, Some people choose to post their religious beliefs, or lack thereof, on their profile. Others simply do not share the information. Still, others post very deliberately about their atheism. Consider your standing in your profession and community and the degree to which you are willing to create controversy to post on social media. That said, it is a personal choice and there is no right or wrong decision.Remember that employers (and future employers) will have access to the information you share. If you fear that being openly atheist will damage your career, be careful about social media.

, Do this only if you feel comfortable. There is no need to discuss the topic, but it is also illegal to for anyone to discriminate against you for doing so. The culture of your workplace will heavily affect how you approach this topic with co-workers.If the conversation does come up in an uncomfortable way, it is usually best not to argue or debate with religious co-workers. Instead, say something like “If you’d like to discuss atheism more, we can have coffee sometime, but I am pretty busy right now.”

, While you will experience some degree of intolerance, or at least confusion, for your atheist beliefs at times, do not fuel the discrimination. You do not have to partake or agree with someone else’s point of view, but it is no more your right to change their mind than it is their right to change yours. Be as open-minded as you hope others will be and show respect.


For example, if someone says “Bless you,” after you sneeze, this is no reason to go on a rant about how you are an atheist and do not believe that there is a God to bless anyone. A simple “Thank you,” will do.
If an acquaintance is genuinely interested in your views, it is okay to discuss them. Just make sure to keep the conversation respectful on both ends.

"
"
End negative relationships.,
Build a support system.,
Anticipate some uncomfortable situations.",How to Tell Someone You're an Atheist3," Most people will be able to come out as atheist with little more than a few tense conversations. In some cases, however, your job may depend on your religion. Other times, certain religions will excommunicate anyone who is a non-believer. You need to remove yourself from these situations by finding a new job and putting in a support system before coming out as atheist.Once you are ready to end judgemental relationships, simply say something like “I have a right to live my life as I see fit, and I will no longer allow other people to decide what I believe or how I portray myself.” Keep calm and do not fight or argue with the person. Say what you need to say and don’t go back into that relationship.

, Having a support system is crucial to being happy. In the case of being atheist, it helps to have other atheists that can relate to your experiences as a non-believer. Look for local atheist groups, or join internet communities of atheists if you don’t know any atheists personally.It is nice to have a support system of other atheists, but you can also rely on the support of your open minded friends and family.

, Opening up as an atheist can do wonders for your happiness, but you also have to respect the religions of others. Co-workers, family members, and friends will not instantly convert when you come out, and sometimes they will even be downright annoying in the interest of “saving your soul.” Be prepared to turn down invitations to church and other religious events, and to be asked to explain your belief and reasons often (though you do not have to oblige).You can respectfully leave any conversation that makes you uncomfortable by saying something like “Excuse me, I think I should be going now.” If someone is not respecting you, it is best to get out of the situation rather than engage in an argument about spirituality.

"
"
Make a plan.,
Set it up.,
Hedge your expectations.",How to Tell Someone You Still Love Them2," First, ensure that you understand why the relationship foundered, where you see yourself in the future, and whether you still truly love this person. Then, decide when and where you're going to do it. If you are able to do so, meet your love in person. If you are less confident, or if there is no way to be physically with this person, then you might call them, or email them, or write them a letter.

, Ask the person if they will meet you at a neutral location: a coffee shop, or a public park, or a favorite restaurant. If they will not meet you, then try a less direct means of communication like phone, email, or handwritten letter.


Avoid saying this over text or instant message. Try to say it as thoughtfully and intentionally as possible. If there is a medium that the two of you always used to communicate, then consider using that medium.
If the person doesn't want to see you, then you need to respect that. Do not show up at his/her home or workplace. Do not follow this person, or arrange for someone else to follow him/her.

, You can hope and pray that this person will return your love, but you need to be prepared for rejection. If you did something to seriously hurt or anger this person, then they may not be ready to take you back. If your love has found someone else, then he or she may simply want to focus on the new relationship instead of trying to sort out the past. It is good to be bold, and to speak what is on your mind – but you must do so with abandon, with the conviction that you absolutely must say this thing, regardless of the outcome.


Be prepared to respect this person's decision. Whether or not they love you back or want you back, you need to allow them the right to say so. If you do not respect a person, then perhaps you do not love them."
"
Speak plainly and honestly.,
Be bold.,
Say it simply.,
Wait for the right moment.",How to Tell Someone You Still Love Them3," You don't need to play any games, especially if you have been with this person in the past. Say exactly what you feel. Put all of your cards onto the table. Spell out your expectations for this relationship, and explain what you want. If you're going to rebuild a relationship, it's incredibly important to establish a line of open and healthy communication.


If you want to get back together, say so. If you just want this person to know that you love them, then make that clear. If you have a vision for what you want to happen next, then explain it.

, Don't wait too long, and don't be afraid to act on your feelings. The more you obsess about this, the harder it will be. Work up your courage, talk to your love, and explain how you feel. Ask yourself this question: ""If I do not do this, will I regret it later?""

, All you need to say, really, is ""I still love you."" But once you do this, don't laugh or stare at them, that will give them the wrong message that it is a prank or joke. Act serious but show them the personality in you that they love. If you have the words for it, then explain why you still love them, or explain how long or how consistently you have loved them.If you need to apologize for something, then make your apology and let it stand. You should not have to grovel in order to get this person back.

, If you have agreed to meet this person somewhere, don't just leap right into the ""I still love you,"" line. Make a bit of small talk: ask how they've been, and tell them a bit about yourself, and try to set a positive scene. That said – don't beat around the bush. This person probably has some idea of why you wanted to meet up, and he/she may be waiting for you to speak your piece. Be patient, but forthright."

Put yourself into it.",How to Talk Dirty," Before you begin talking dirty, think about how to adjust your voice a bit to make it more conducive to sexy talk. Try to talk a bit slower and more softly. Don't use the same voice you would use to ask your lover if he/she took out the trash; find your own sexy bedroom voice.Be aware, consciously trying to adjust the tone of your voice to be more sexy seems to work better for women then men, according to a Albright College study.. So for men, it might be better to just talk naturally and let the voice come on its own.
Don't expect to have the perfect dirty talk voice at first. Experiment with it. The more practice you get, and the more comfortable you get, the easier it will be.;
, Before you go into all-out dirty talk mode, just verbalize some moans, groans, or sighs to show how much pleasure you're feeling. Your might already do this. If so, great. If not, get comfortable with using your voice as well as your body in the bedroom.Encourage your lover to make some noises too if they don't already; you don't want to be the only one moaning and verbalizing your pleasure.

, Start small. Just tell your lover how amazing he looks or how great he is in bed. Just say, ""You look amazing with your shirt off,"" or ""It feels so good to be with you tonight."" You can give a compliment to a specific body part by saying something like, ""Your arms are so toned"" or ""I just can't get enough of your legs."" Just make your lover feel sexy and appreciated., Take it a step further by initiating some soft-core dirty talk. This doesn't mean that you have to say anything X-rated. It just means that you can start talking about how much pleasure you feel and how turned on you are in a PG-13 kind of way.Here are some phrases to try:


""I want you so bad.""
""I've wanted you all day.""
""You smell so good.""
""I've been looking forward to this.""
""You look so sexy right now.""
""You always know how to turn me on right away.""

, The easiest way to feel embarrassment or pressure when trying to talk dirty is to think of it as a performance. There's no wrong way to talk dirty; it should be an authentic expression of yourself. Don't say anything you don't want to, don't talk any more than what feels comfortable, and don't use any words you don't feel comfortable with., This is the perfect formula for a turn-on. There are a variety of verbs and body parts that you could insert into this sentence to turn your partner on.Here are a few of the milder options, though you can imagine some naughtier options as well:


""I love it when you kiss my neck.""
""I love it when you touch my thighs.""
""I love it when you lick my ears.""
""I love it when you stroke my back.""
Of course, you can always switch up the exact words you use for variation. For example, these same sentences can easily expressed as ""It's so nice when you my as well.

, Describe what's happening as it's happening. Act like you're a sexy sports commentator and that you and your lover are the only team in town. Just add, ""I love it when..."" or ""It feels so good when..."" followed by what's happening to add extra pleasure to the event. Talking about what's happening while it's happening will make everything feel twice as good.Here are some things you can say:


""I love getting on top of you.""
""I love seeing you take your shirt off.""
""I love kissing your neck.""
""I love taking off my clothes for you.""

, As you continue to touch and caress your lover, ask him if he likes what you’re doing to him. Don’t just say, “Do you like that?” over and over. Instead, mix it up and make it specific, asking your lover if he/she likes exactly what you’re doing to him/her. Here are some things you can say:”Do you like it when I touch you there?”
""Do you like it when I kiss you like this?”
""Do you like how it feels when I stroke you there?”

, Don’t be afraid to tell your lover how good he/she is making you feel. Even a simple, “I’m so turned on” can go a long way. Your partner will be more turned on just by hearing about how excited you are. You can be more specific about how turned on you feel and can even refer to your private parts for emphasis., As you continue talking dirty, just remember to keep things fresh by finding new things to say that turn your lover on. Don’t just use one technique—try using as many as you can if they turn you on. Try to be as specific as you can while you’re mixing things up.


Don’t just say that something feels good—tell your lover which part of your body feels good. If you’re so turned on that you feel it in your toes, tell him.

, Revealing your sexiest fantasy is a great way to talk dirty. Tell your lover your most illicit sexual fantasy. See if he/she can fulfill it. If you and your lover are really comfortable with each other, just let loose. Tell him/her everything you’ve always wanted and see how much it turns him on.Just proceed with caution. If it’s really illicit, then you may want to get to make sure you’re really comfortable with your lover before you tell him/her your deepest darkest fantasy.

, Simply telling your lover that you’re about to have an orgasm or that you can feel it coming will turn both of you on more. This will add even more build-up and will make you both feel even more excited when it does happen., Don’t be afraid to boss your lover around a bit. Tell him/her what you want him to do to you and be the taskmaster as he fulfills all of your desires. You can start simple, by saying, “Take my shirt off” or “Take off your pants” and get more elaborate as you start making love. Don’t be afraid to get a little aggressive. Be the boss and tell your lover exactly what you want him/her to do to you.
You can both take turns giving orders. After you’ve been the boss for a while, try being a bit more submissive and do whatever your lover wants.

, Though dirty talking is an amazing part of sex for many couples, it does not make everyone comfortable. If your partner is just not okay with it, don't force it. If you try to force it, your partner will be ticked off instead of turned on.Also, it's okay if your partner enjoys your dirty talk but isn't comfortable reciprocating. Of course, if you only enjoy dirty talk when it's going both ways, it might be better to forgo it completely. But it's perfectly acceptable to bring dirty talk into the bedroom even if only one of you is actually doing the talking.

, Though you and your lover probably won't have a sit-down discussion about your expectations during dirty talk before your first sexual adventure, your boundaries should be communicated. You will probably start your first dirty talk session spontaneously, but at some point you should both make it clear if there are any words that make you uncomfortable.If your lover says something too crude or offensive for you in bed, don't stop and get angry. Just say something like, ""Please don't say that again."" If your lover doesn't get the message, then you can stop the action.
If you're too embarrassed to admit that a certain word makes you uncomfortable during sex, mention it afterwards. Just make sure your lover gets the picture.

, Remember that the things you and your lover say to each other in the bedroom are part of sex play and are not meant to be taken seriously in the real world. If your girl or guy lets you say certain things to her/him in bed or call her/him a certain word, this does not mean that she/he would be comfortable with this expression out of bed.You may find that you and your lover take on certain roles when you're talking dirty in bed. This does not mean that these roles reflect on your real roles in the relationship.

, Use common sense and avoid using words and phrases that could possibly offend until you've both talked about your boundaries and likes and dislikes when it comes to dirty talk. Start slowly and follow your lover's lead at first to understand what works for him/her. You don't want to kill the mood by saying something degrading or offensive that really hurts your lover.

, If you want to talk dirty but feel lost or uncreative, watch some porn for an idea of the kinds of things that people say to each other in bed. Of course, the dirty talk in porn may be a bit extreme compared to what you have in mind for your own bedroom moves, but it can help generate some ideas.


If you're both comfortable with it, try watching porn together with your lover. It can give you great dirty talk ideas and turn you on at the same time. You can both comment on what words and phrases the actors use that you like.

, Though dirty talk is part of sex play and is not meant to represent reality, you should still be yourself. You should still sound like yourself, just like a raunchier, naughtier version of yourself. The more you feel like yourself, the more comfortable you'll feel, and the easier it will be for you to explore your dirty talk potential."

Is the test meant for a private one-on-one activity or are you writing the test for a class or a therapy group?
Keep in mind categories that will make your test more specific: age groups, male/female, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation.;
, Compatibility examines how well people can function together.Functional relationships take many different forms:


Marriage
Friendship
Coworkers
Roommates
Teammates

, Relationships are based on common ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving - qualities that shape our personalities.,,What issues arise in any given relationship, and how might they be important to you? How important are they to others? This is what you're trying to find out with your test!


Marriage: trust, communication, arguments, sex
Friendships: shared interests, conversation, companionship
Coworkers: leadership, time management, collaboration, work ethic
Don't be afraid to brainstorm! If your test is meant as a group exercise, ask those peers for input.

, The structure of the questions will shape the overall ""flavor"" of your compatibility test.


Multiple choice and yes/no questions are less intense for the test taker, can be taken by many people, and are easier to grade when the test is complete. These formats also make it easier for you to include more questions on the test.
Short answer or essay questions can potentially provide you with good quality information but can be a lot of work to grade. A short answer compatibility test is better suited to an specific exercise between two people and not general use.

, The way that you phrase your questions will affect the answers that your audience gives.


For shorter questions, try to begin with ""Do you _____"" and present the reader with a yes/no response or a preference choice. ""Do you like scary movies?"" is a popular first date question.Open-ended sentences that start with ""how"" or ""why"" are better for essay questions like ""How do you feel about yourself - physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually?""If you want the test taker to provide shorter answers, ask them to list 1-3 things that are important to them: ""What three interests are you most passionate about?""or ""Name one person you looked up to growing up.""

, The questions you ask should be geared toward finding out what sort of lover/roommate/spouse/coworker the test taker is. Refer to the list you made!


Roommate compatibility questions tend to be more action-oriented, such as ""how often do you clean?"" or ""do you smoke?""Marriage compatibility tends to emphasize personal values: ""How do you most typically express your love for someone?""Personal values and activities often intersect in the workplace. A good question for coworkers might be ""Do you lead a project by pitching in, or do you prefer to step back and supervise?""
All relationships are a blend of shared values and activities. Just look at your list; it probably includes both. Your test questions can too!

, This will help the test takers compare their results, especially if your test is meant for a group of people.


Essay and short answer questions can vary widely are thus more difficult to score using numbers. Review these compatibility tests qualitatively by setting aside time for discussion of each answer.
For multiple choice questions, responses could be listed with numbers ranked in order of importance. You could make numbers like 1, 2, and 3 mean ""disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree."" Just remember to give each number a meaningful label and be consistent!
Numerical responses can be tallied and placed on a scale. For example, if your test has ten questions and each question has a minimum score of 1 and a maximum score of 5, then possible scores range from 10 to 50. Based on your questions, the range could indicate minimum and maximum compatibility. You could also judge compatibility by seeing how close individual scores are to each other on that scale.
Avoid scoring that is based on what you think are ""right"" and ""wrong"" answers.

, Time limits may depend on the format of your test:


If your test consists of longer questions or requires more complex answers, consider giving the test taker as much time as they need.
If the test is being given as part of a class or activity, a time limit is probably a good idea.

, Make them as easy to understand as possible, especially if your test is intended for a large audience. For instance:


A test could be called ""How compatible are you and your spouse after 5 years of marriage?""
Instructions could say: ""The following test consists of thirty multiple-choice questions. Each question presents an issue typically experienced by couples after 5 years of marriage. Indicate how important each issue is to you by choosing 'never', 'sometimes,' or 'always.' You have 30 minutes to complete the test using a pen or pencil. When complete, hand in the test to the counselor.""

, Make preparations based on the format of the test and who will be taking it.


Choose a place that is quiet and free from distractions so that you or your test takers can focus on the questions and provide thoughtful answers.
Online compatibility tests are extremely popular. If your test is designed for a large audience, try sending it out using a free survey website.
Review the test and its instructions. Make sure your audience understands how the test works before you begin.

, Remind yourself and other test takers that they are personally invested in the outcome!


Relax and focus on one question at a time.
Make your responses as honest as possible. If you are taking the test with a partner, don't be tempted to give answers that you think the other person wants to hear.
Try to adhere to the time limit if one is given.

, You may opt to let the test takers grade their own work right after the test is finished. That could segue nicely into a discussion of the results.


Compare the results. How did two different people score on the test? Remember, you're testing the degree to which you're compatible with someone. Answers will certainly vary and are open to interpretation.
Don't work alone. Like the tango, it takes two to be compatible, so include your other test taker(s) in the discussion.
Revisit each of the questions in the test. Breaking compatibility down into its smaller parts - those values and issues - will help you understand how you and your partner are similar and different.

, There's a reason you wanted to know if you're compatible with someone. Did you want to ask someone out, but want to know more about them? Is this test an exercise to help you reconnect with your spouse? Are you trying to figure out the role you fill in the workplace?


Be open to new information that arises. You may think you know a person, but expect to be surprised by some of their responses.
Being compatible is great, but the differences between two people can be just as informative as what they have in common. Don't view those differences negatively.
Use your discussion of the results to address uncertainties or problems in your relationships.

Catch his attention, but in a different manner that all girls usually do.,
Make him respect you.,
Try getting to know him a little.,
Ok, now you can try to flirt with him a little.,
These dates will decide whether he's the right guy for you, or not.,
Go on like this until you're sure he loves you.,
If you finally get him, remember how to keep him too: don't be too possessive, or too demanding, or don't try to change him too much (making him yours is already a big enough change).",How to Tame a Player," Your goal is to make him remember you and like you for who you are, not just for your good looks. Make him think you're special - be charming, smart, sexy, and fun to be around; in a word, show off your best parts. Let him know you're not like the other girls - so he will eventually treat you differently, too.;
, Faking affection is forbidden. This guy will show no respect for you if you're willing to accept everything that comes from him. When he goes overboard, for instance saying unpleasant things to you or making fun of you, gently, but firmly warn him you don't accept this kind of behaviour. Also, be careful how YOU behave yourself. If you look like you're trying too hard and flirt with every guy you encounter, he will think you're promiscuous and treat you accordingly.

, Being ""just friends"" works in the beginning. But beware: don't act COMPLETELY like his pals; don't lose your femininity. But don't make romantic allusions just yet. Getting to know him better will prove helpful later: you will know when he's lying, what's his general attitude towards girls and so on.

, Don't make it too obvious though. Subtlety is the key here. He will most likely understand the message and respond. But don't let him get too comfortable; as soon as he wants to get closer to you, you'll going to have to reject him gently. But let him know he can call you again. Tell him you *kind of* like him, but you don't fully trust him yet- and he'll have to prove himself worthy of your trust. At this point, he's already supposed to like you back, if you've shown him your best traits AND a little bit of interest in him. He will hopefully try harder to get you- these guys have a huge ego, and wouldn't like the idea of not being able to get a girl. Tell him that you can change your mind if you go on a few *real* dates with him, and during these dates, he must prove himself to gain your full trust.

, They shouldn't be official (in the way that it doesn't mean you two have a relationship), so there can be no 'break-up' in case things don't work out between you two, and reason no.2: because such guys act differently in a relationship than they do in a non-official date. Make them fun, interesting and original; you can choose romantic to unusual locations, you decide; just make sure he doesn't get bored with you around. Be yourself, so he will get to know the real you; and -very important- don't get jealous if he happens to look admiringly at other girls (jealousy will turn him off instantly; after all, you're not yet a couple).

, Be distant most of the time; but not that distant so you're completely out of his life; just enough to make him miss you and not get bored of you. You can accept to be his girlfriend when you know he has true feelings for you. You can test him from time to time: for example, making him jealous and seeing if it works.

, Be the girlfriend of his dreams.

Look for a partner who has the same priorities as you.,
Don't define your relationship in terms of ""how far"" you've gone.,
Set physical boundaries early on.,
Keep the end goal in mind.,
Enjoy affectionate outings at your own pace.",How to Take a Relationship Slow1," Your choice of partner is the most important factor in practically any relationship. However, when you're set on taking a relationship slowly, it's even more important than normal. You want someone who can respect your choice to limit your intimacy. This should be a person who isn't only focused on the physical aspects of a relationship. You want someone who's more interested in your thoughts than your body.


You can find people who meet these criteria anywhere. However, you may have the most success if you try places where people like this are likely to gather. For example, since many religions teach that sex before marriage should be avoided, you may find good potential partners in religious youth groups and so on.;
, The things you've done with your partner, especially when it comes to physical affection and sex, aren't measures of how ""good"" your relationship is. At this stage, the most important thing is how you and your partner feel. If you both enjoy each others' company, you're affectionate, and you have open, caring attitudes towards each other, you're doing fine.


Keep in mind that not everyone will agree with this. Some people have different priorities for their relationships. It's OK to disagree with these people. If you're happy with your relationship, so you don't need to let them pressure you into things you're not comfortable with. On the other hand, they're not automatically shallow just because they want different things than you, so try to stay respectful.

, Be clear and explicit about what you are (and aren't) comfortable with. This is important. It can be a big turn-off if your physical limits come as a surprise to your partner in the ""heat of the moment,"" so take the opportunity to be up-front before you start getting affectionate.


Don't be afraid to tell your partner ""no"" if s/he starts to get too ""touchy-feely"" for you. If your partner won't listen to repeated warnings, it's time to have a serious discussion about respecting your boundaries.

, It's a good idea to have an idea of where you want your relationship to be eventually, even if you're not there yet. You can gradually work towards this goal, making week-by-week progress as you take small steps toward it. If you don't have an end in mind for your relationship, it can be harder to justify your slow pace to a partner.


If you are a teen or pre-teen, having an end goal of ""spending lots of time being affectionate with each other"" is fine. There's no need to worry about ""the L word"" or marriage for a long time.
If you're older, it's wise to know whether you plan to end up married, cohabiting, having children, and so on. This makes it easier to find a partner who's right for you (and get rid of ones who aren't). Plus, most adults who are willing to wait a long time to become physically intimate are interested in marriage or life-long relationships.

, Just because you're taking things slow doesn't mean you can't have fun. Take time to go out, explore the world, and treat each other to small luxuries. In other words, date! There's no ""right"" way to do this. Whatever you and your partner enjoy doing together is fair game. The good news is that there are many, many things to do that don't involve physical intimacy. Enjoy traditional dates like dinner and a movie or get creative with dates like rock climbing.

Know that you are not alone.,

Expect the realities of living together to start opening your eyes.,

Face all these little things by handling them constructively and with a positive mindset.,
See the changes as good things.,
Keep on creating and maintaining the relationship.,
Give each other some slack and down time.,
Find, then pursue, what makes you happy.,
Take care of your own feelings.,
Make a commitment to recommitting to your relationship at set times during your life.",How to Tell When Your Honeymoon is Over," You and everyone else will go through the same thing, the same journey, on the same road. Let that be a source of strength to you.;
, The honeymoon phase has the purpose of bringing and keeping the two of you together but it cannot last, for it is often too all-consuming and keeps you from looking outward to other relationships and parts of your life, such as work and general commitments. To be whole, eventually the honeymoon phase must pass. Moreover, part of the change is that your desire has been fulfilled. From the first kiss, all the way to the walk down commitment land, now you have each other and the rest of your life is vying for attention again.

, As the two of you settle into reality, you will begin to see that your partner is just like you, with all the quirks, forgetfulness, or imperfections, from complaining to struggling with life as you do. As each of you seeks to restore your sense of self and determine your comfort zones, the habits you both have will surface, the things you tried to keep unnoticed will reveal themselves and things left unsaid earlier suddenly need urgent expression.


The basic habits of feeling at home are likely to arise once the honeymoon is over. This includes such things as belching, farting and picking of the nose; leaving the toilet seat up or tossing clothes on the floor; staking out territory in certain parts of the house such as the kitchen, the TV remote, the reading nook; and other such things you may never have thought through until now.
It's time to work out who is responsible for what. Who will do the dishes, who will take out the garbage, who does the weekly shopping, who will get the car serviced, etc. If neither of you make clear commitments and divvy these things up fairly between you, it may be a time of resentment or even arguing.
Bills become a part of your lives. During the honeymoon, they got paid and nobody said anything. Suddenly you are both responsible for the bills coming into the house and it's not always as it seems in your head. Once again, without clear discussion on who is responsible, arguments may arise.

, Relating to others can be another area that shocks you both back into reality after the honeymoon. When you only had eyes for each other, it was hard to fit in friends and even family, and excuses were probably made to avoid other people much of the time. When the honeymoon is over, you often feel less needy for one another but far more needier to reach back to those people you've been neglecting. This is a good thing, as you're broadening your circles and establishing the basis for being connected with others again. However, the process of re-establishing your ties can cause tension in the relationship if you aren't clear with each other. Instead of assuming it's okay to go on all-night benders with your old mates or that it's okay to organize your vacation with a friend, both of you need to talk about your expectations and wishes for how to fit your other relationships around your marriage.

, If you push them away, ignore them, or become negative about the changes, you will find the transition from honeymoon phase to real life a hard one, and things left unclarified and unexpressed will ultimately haunt you and undermine your relationship. It is far better to discuss the changes you notice openly, to clarify the boundaries each of you prefers and to be honest about how the changes make you feel.

, Acceptance of the routine of a relationship is actually the key to lifelong contentment with each other. The routine is a sign that both of you are settling down to everyday life––together––in a healthy and realistic manner. When you stay positive and realize that this is just part of your daily lives, you will be ahead of the game. There is nothing fancy or dreamlike about having a partner. It is about working things out together. Not in a blaming, irresponsible way, but in a mature way. And the mature way is to keep open the channels of good talking and to ensure that there is plenty of discussion.


Your marriage is like running a business––you have meetings to talk about; things you encounter or things you face. Indeed, a good marriage has many of the hallmarks of a good business partnership––trust, openness, tackling challenges before they turn into unmanageable problems and planning ahead for the things you both want from life.

, Make time to pursue some shared interests that both of you find fun and enjoyable. If you and your partner have a great friendship to start with, then it is easier, as trust and faith have already been built in.

, No one is perfect, and no one is going to give and let you be happy all the time. Allow for differences of interests, of opinion and of preferences. Neither of you is a clone of the other and by ensuring that each has space and the freedom to pursue different interests for some of the time, you'll both have plenty to talk about and you'll both feel fulfilled. Your relationship benefits from respecting each other's independence as much as acknowledging your togetherness.


Allow your partner some alone time, because spending every minute together will only increase your chances of falling out and feeling smothered.

, That, in turn, will release your partner to do the same. It is not one tying the other, but it is two people in the car together going somewhere or nowhere.

, Talk or do whatever it takes to make your end of the relationship as best as possible. This means not bottling up resentments or anger but finding the earliest possible opportunities to address the things that bother you in constructive ways. If you don't feel you can talk to your partner about something, find a trustworthy friend, sibling or counselor to confide in, someone who can help you to decide how to move forward and eventually address the issue with your partner.

, This might be a marriage vow renewal, a special ceremony honoring the two of you or a trip away to somewhere that both of you hold dear. Whatever you choose to do, make this recommitment time focused just on the two of you, to rejuvenate a little of that honeymoon magic that you both once felt, to restore a frisson of the excitement of young love back into your relationship. If you do this every few years or so, it will help both of you to remember what attracted you to one another and why you are both so willing to keep making this commitment for the rest of your lives together.

Always talk before taking things to the next level.,
Don't be too possessive.,
Don't obsess over the tempo of your relationship.,
Always flirt.",How to Take a Relationship Slow2," Communication is vital to any relationship, but it's even more important when you're taking it slow. You and your partner need to be able to clearly and respectfully discuss the boundaries of the relationship. In other words, you need to be able to have calm discussions about what you're comfortable doing and what you're not comfortable doing. When there are disagreements about this crucial topic, you and your partner need to be able to listen to each others' concerns.


When it's possible to compromise on a disagreement, try to do so. However, when it's not possible to compromise without taking the relationship to a level you're uncomfortable with, don't be afraid to stand your ground.

, Taking a relationship slow may seem ""old-fashioned"" to some, but this isn't an excuse to have old-fashioned ideas about controlling your partner's behavior. Since you trust your partner to respect your pace for the relationship, trust your partner when s/he isn't with you. Don't try to restrict your partner's time with friends, family, or other people who are important to him or her. Give your partner enough space to have some alone time when s/he wants it. Remember that respect is a two-way street.

, Being in a relationship should make you feel good (most of the time). If you find yourself frequently stressing out about whether or not you should take things to the next level, relax. These changes should happen naturally after you've decided that you're ready and you have discussed them with your partner. They aren't ""checkboxes"" to mark off as quickly as possible on the way to a ""real"" relationship.


You also shouldn't let your partner do this. If you suspect that s/he is unhappy with how slowly the relationship is progressing, have a serious conversation about it. It's best to address these problems head-on rather than pretending that they do not exist.

, Just because you're taking things slow doesn't mean your relationship has to be boring. Keep things exciting by learning how to flirt and putting your knowledge into practice. With a little effort, your relationship can be a source of great passion, even if you're waiting to get intimate. See our article on flirting for lots of specific ideas.

Maintain a friendly relationship with your roommate.",How to Survive a Super Clean Roommate," Talking to your roommate about your shared space is the most important step you can take to surviving with a neat freak roommate. This way, you can both form an understanding of the each other’s expectations. There are several things you need to consider:


What is their definition of clean?
What is your definition of clean?
Are they into cleanliness, things looking neat and tidy, or both?
Ask your roommate what bothers them the most about your habits.
Ask if they are willing to accept feedback about their habits, too.;
, Make sure that whenever you try to initiate conversation with your roommate, that you're doing so in a way that is relaxed and stimulates discussion rather than backing your roommate into a corner or provoking a fight. There are a couple tactics you can use to make sure your language is non-threatening:


Use ""I"" statements, such as ""I think"" or ""I feel."" This way your roommate does not think you're speaking for them or telling them they need to do something.
Avoid using body language that suggests you're mad or angry. This includes crossing your arms, clenching fists, or showing your teeth.
Don't pronounce your words in a sharp or snappy way. This just shows them that you are mad and/or frustrated with them.
Instead, move and speak slowly and hold your hands at your side.

, Communication needs to be a continual thing. But don’t argue, and don’t attack. Simply try to find common ground and understand.


Talk to your roommate every week about small things and household issues. This does not have to be a long drawn out discussion, just small comments and pleasantries here and there.
Arrange to have a monthly discussion about the state of the household.
If you sense your roommate is frustrated, initiate a conversation, but do so in a non-aggressive way.

, This will help you triage the situation and focus on areas that will create the most satisfaction for both of you. Remember to hear your roommate out and accept their feelings and desires as legitimate, just as you hope they will do for you. Consider the following:


Are they concerned about particular spatial areas in your home?
Does your roommate often have people over and they are sensitive to what others think?
How often should cleaning be done?

, Now that you’ve opened the lines of communication and formed some sort of understanding with your roommate, you need to agree upon individual responsibilities. If your roommate does all of the cleaning, you should at the very least be offering to assist with necessary responsibilities. Consider:


Trash removal.
Yard maintenance.
Repairs.
Dealing with the landlord.
General cleaning
Cleaning the bathroom, if shared.

, Take the list you both have agreed on, and make sure it’s completed on the time table you’ve both agreed on. Do the best job you can, and try to clean to the expectations you’ve discussed.


Pick up clutter. Move clutter out of the way before you clean. This'll help you get dirt, grime, and other stuff a lot easier.
Dust. Get some lightly wet clothes and dust the surfaces of furniture and appliances. To go the extra mile, make sure to get ceiling fans and molding.
Vacuum. Empty your bag and storage compartment. Use the correct settings and attachment. Get the entire house, including the floorboards and furniture.
Mop floors. Move from the back of the room toward the entrance of the room. Make sure to rinse your mop out after mopping 4x4 foot sections. Otherwise, you'll be spreading dirt., In most cases, focusing on actual dirty areas, rather than minor clutter, will help alleviate any tension between you and your roommate. After all, your roommate probably doesn't mind the newspaper on the table nearly as much as the refried beans that have been sitting in the sink for three days. If you cut down on the filth and really bad habits that may exist, your roommate may feel less overwhelmed and more able to relax.

, Most often, the shared, public rooms, like the kitchen, living room, and bathrooms should have priority over personal space when cleaning. Don’t use your cleaning time to clean out your closet or under your bed. Use it effectively to address your roommate's concerns.

, Consider asking your roommate to chip in for a cleaning person to come once a week. This will relieve a lot of stress for you, and you’ll just have to focus on small stuff and picking up after yourself in the kitchen and living room. If your roommate doesn’t want to pay, and you still want to get a housekeeper, do so. That will release you from a good bit of stress., It might work to actually bring in an outsider who does not have a vested interest in the household situation. This person can talk to both of you and arrive at conclusions that you both might have missed. They might even be able to work out a compromise so that everyone can walk away more satisfied than before.


Both of you must agree.
Look for someone who is a mutual friend, but not someone too close.
Avoid relatives or stakeholders like a landlord.
Make sure that the mediator, you, and your roommate understand that they are only there to make non-binding suggestions (unless you otherwise agree).

, If an overly clean and tidy house makes you unsettled, make sure to create a safe-space for yourself that your roommate understands might not be up to their specs. This is your messy zone. Just make sure that this area, if outside your personal space, is not one of their favorite areas, too. Use this space to pile your stuff up, leave soda cans out, or whatever you want. This space is an important part of maintaining your sanity in the household. Consider the following areas:


Out of the way rooms that visitors or your roommate seldom enter.
Your personal office.
A porch or portion of a porch.
A second living room or family room., This might be the perfect opportunity, and excuse, for you to purge some of your stuff. You probably have a lot more stuff than you use or need. This stuff is probably contributing to clutter and is ticking off your neat freak roommate. Throwing some out or having a garage sale might lessen the amount of stress in your home., Try not to be insulted or to get personally offended by your roommate’s demands for a neat and tidy home. It’s not really you, particularly, but the mess that is bothering them. If you weren’t living with them, they’d probably have another roommate who’d bring the same issue into their lives. Just view this as an opportunity for you to grow and become a slightly neater and tidier person., It is much easier to deal with conflicts if you have a friendship holding you together, and much easier to communicate if you feel comfortable with one another. Make a point to spend time with your roommate, and get into the habit of doing nice things for each other (like cooking meals) regularly.

Talk.,
People love talking about themselves.,
Try to avoid asking lots of questions about where she's been and what she was doing.,
Think before you speak!,
Compliments are excellent, but know that you should stop at the point where you're just listening to yourself talk.,
Nobody can write the definitive guide on dating!,
Listen to what she has to say and pay attention.

,
Above all, take care of yourself.,
Don't be obsessive.,
Don't cheat on her!!,
Make her friends like you, not love you.",How to Succeed in a Relationship with the Perfect Girl," Communication is key. If you are afraid to talk to the girl that you're dating, or if you'd rather do something else, you need to set some priorities. Ask her how her day was. You want her to listen to you, so you should listen to her--conversation is a two way street.;
, Ask her about her dreams and hopes. It will make her feel like you care about her. Always ask her about school and her day as well.

, If they say ""Be right back, I gotta go do something"", it's usually best not to ask what she were doing, as it can make a girl feel annoyed.

, Try to keep things very very positive. If she's complaining about life, don't agree. Tell her she rocks and support her.

, Girls know when you're sincere and when you're just blowing hot air. But, compliments never hurt anyone.

, You need to experiment for yourself! Remember, romance is not always an easy thing.

,, Keep your daily and lifelong goals in sight. Nothing turns off a woman faster than a man who chooses to accomplish nothing, even if all his attention is directed toward her.

, Give her some room. she doesn't need you to be hanging on her, she wants to be able to lean on you, not the other way around.

, If you flirt with another girl, to make her 'jealous' then its not going to work, she'll think that you like them and might end up moving on. Not all girls get jealous the same way.

, If they love you, she will think otherwise or something... Don't fall in love with her friends either!

Turn the negative into positive.,
Practice gratitude.,
Talk to your partner about what you need.",How to Stop Self Doubt from Ruining a Relationship1," Negative thoughts are often a contributor to self-doubt. They can change how you perceive yourself and cause you to misjudge those around you. The next time this happens, change the negative into positive.


For example, if you think, “I’m terrible at cooking dinner. My partner is going to hate it,” change it to, “I’m an excellent cook. My partner is going to love this.” Altering your thinking to this could take a lot of work. However, eventually it will become easier and will hopefully replace your negative thoughts entirely.;
, Write down something positive about yourself daily. Start your day by noting something you love about yourself in a journal. Then refer back to it throughout the day to remind yourself of what you like.


Write down what you are grateful about at the end of the day. Here you’ll want to focus on what you have and what you have accomplished, rather than what you want and past failures. Read this every night and you may find that you have a more positive image of yourself and have feelings of gratitude., Anxiety and self-doubt can cause you to behave selfishly. You often focus on your needs instead of partner’s, which can cause problems in the relationship. Instead, talk to them about your feelings of self-doubt and let them know what you need from them to help them subside.


For instance, say, “I’m feeling really insecure about our relationship right now and it’s because of my self-doubt. Please reassure me that we are good.” Then tell them what kind of reassurance you need. Doing so may help them understand what they need to do to make you happy. Knowing your insecurities may prevent them from leaving the relationship."

Perhaps you were cheated on in a previous relationship. Maybe you heard that you were a failure growing up. Figuring out why you feel this way can help you to stop being so critical on yourself.

Critique your inner voice.,
Notice how self-doubt affects your happiness.,
Look for repetitive ""bad"" relationships.",How to Stop Self Doubt from Ruining a Relationship3," The voice in your head that doubts you and makes you feel bad about yourself can also change your idea of reality. Hearing those bad thoughts enough can prevent you from having the confidence you deserve to have a good relationship.


Pay more attention to your inner voice. Determine if it causes you to judge and hate yourself, as this can also make you think false things about others. It could make you believe that you shouldn’t trust your significant other or create doubt in your mind about their loyalty. Allowing this to happen could sabotage what you have., Doubting yourself and your partner stops you from fully enjoying your relationship. It may cause you and your significant other to not experience all the happiness you could. The relationship could end as a result.


Self-doubt may not only cause your partner to break up with you, but it may cause you to end the relationship, instead. You may believe that your partner doesn’t enjoy you as much as they do, or you may not think they make you happy. Your self-doubt could ultimately be the cause., You can find yourself in an abusive relationship when you start to believe the critical voices in your head. These thoughts can hold you back from getting what you want and deserve.


For instance, if you believe that you are worthless, you may find someone who believes and tells you that, too. You may seek someone who reinforces what you believe, which can make your insecurity even worse."

Pursue something you love.",How to Stop Hating," One of the reasons you may hate everybody is because you assume that everyone around you is only out to hurt, annoy, or bother you in some way. Learn to stop looking at the people around you as a nuisance or a threat and learn to embrace the good people around you and to see that they can actually improve your life if you let them.


Sure, not everyone in the world is going to make your life better, and when you’re stuck on a crowded subway, it’s easy to feel like everyone is only there to make your life miserable. However, if you give individual people a chance, you’ll see that they’re not so bad, after all.
Practice assuming that anyone who talks to you has the best intentions, not the worst. Of course, if a stranger approaches you in a dark alley, you should be wary, but if your coworker or neighbor asks you to grab a cup of coffee, assume that the person just wants to be your friend, not that the person has some ulterior motive for hanging out with you.;
, You may also hate people because you just feel like you’re always stuck talking to them when you’d rather be alone. Well, if this is your point of view, then you’re likely to continue hating people forever. Instead, learn to find the joy in having a conversation and connecting with another person instead of looking at everyone who talks to you as someone who is just wasting your time or blathering on about nothing.


Smile more and be friendly. Show people that you’re open to conversation and they’ll be more likely to be frank with you.
Find a way to find common ground with people. This will show you that you’re not as different from them as you expected.
Know that there’s nothing small about small talk. It’s what leads you to build deeper relationships and to get to know people better eventually.

, Sure, giving compliments is probably the last thing you want to do if you hate people. However, that’s exactly why you should practice giving the people around you sincere compliments to show that you truly do care. Make a habit of giving at least one or two compliments a day to an acquaintance or a perfect stranger to show that you’re paying attention. This will help you be a more positive person and to look for the good in people.


Plus, you never know. The random compliment you give to a person can make that person’s day. Maybe it’ll be the only positive interaction that person has all day, and it takes so little effort.
If you know a person more closely, focus on complimenting an aspect of that person’s personality instead of just the superficial things.
Plus, if you compliment more people, you’ll hear more positive reinforcement back, so you’ll just be contributing to more positive energy and less hatred in the universe.

, Though you may feel like opening up to people is the last thing to do if you’re a self-proclaimed misanthrope, you may find that, if you open up to the people around you a bit, you’ll be likely to find understanding, compassion, and friendship. This will make you much less likely to hate people and more likely to see that developing relationships with people out in the world is a worthy endeavor.


You don’t need to bare your soul to the first person you see. However, if you slowly open up to your acquaintances, then those relationships may lead to friendships.
You may feel like you hate everyone because you feel like a loner who can’t relate to anyone. But if you talk to people more, you’ll see that you’re not as different as you thought.
As you open up to people, make sure to ask them questions about themselves, too. This can help you feel more inclined to connect with people.

, Another way to stop hating everybody is to realize that most of the people around you can be viewed as untapped resources. Your older brother can help you apply to college, your teacher can help you understand World History, and your friend can help you learn how to make the perfect chocolate chip cookies. If you think that everyone around you is just there to make your life miserable, then yeah, you’re going to hate everybody.


One way to see that people can be a big resource to you is to talk to them more. Talking to people more will make you see how much they have to offer to you. You may not know, for example, that your neighbor is a whiz at math until you talk to him more.
If people help you with something, help them out in return. This can make you feel more connected to people and less likely to hate them, too.

, You may think that volunteering to help other people is the last thing you want to do if you feel like you hate everybody. However, if you make an effort to care about people other than yourself and to help your community improve and grow, you’ll soon be on your way to having a more compassionate perspective and to loving the people around you instead of hating them. Whether you’re teaching people to read at a local library or volunteering at a dog shelter, you’ll start to feel more connected to the world through the simple act of helping.


You’ll also meet some people who will help you develop a more positive perspective who will make you see that the world isn’t all doom and gloom.
Just volunteering a few times a month can help you feel more open-minded and like you’re making a real difference.

, In order to stop hating a certain person in your life, whether it’s an ex-friend or an ex-boyfriend, it’s important to be open and honest about how you’re really feeling before you can get rid of those negative feelings. Talk to a close friend about it, write your feelings down, or just make sure that you’re open and honest about why you hate that person; you may find that the person hasn’t actually done anything wrong, or that the real reason why you hate the person isn’t what you expected.


If you’re in denial about why you hate the person, then you’ll never really be able to deal with your feelings. The sooner you let your feelings out, the sooner you’ll feel better.
If you feel like crying, there’s no shame in that. Do whatever you need to do to deal with the source of your hatred.

, If the person you hate was once your friend or significant other and you feel that having a constructive conversation can actually help you feel better, then you should pick the place and time to really talk to that person. You may feel a sense of greater understanding, closure, or even relief at being able to express your feelings and hearing the other person out. Though this may not be the most pleasant conversation, it can save you from months of stewing.


Be open and honest about your feelings. Don’t hold back, as long as you don’t insult the person or stir up more drama. You’ll feel better about letting those feelings go.
If the person is unwilling to talk to you, then there’s no point in forcing it. You’ll only end up feeling more frustrated if the person won’t talk to you.

, People who tend to hate often spend their time feeling angry or bitter about how people have wronged them or done them harm. Of course, if you’ve really been hurt, then it’s important to have a conversation about it and to state your views, but if you tend to hold a grudge and never really accept apologies or hear people out when they’ve made a mistake, then you’ll never be able to move past the hate.


Work on building compassion and trying to see a situation through another person’s shoes. See if you can see where the person who hurt you is coming from.
Make sure you really listen to the person who apologizes to you. If you’re not ready to hear the apology yet, then say you need a while until you’ve calmed down a bit.

, Though you may think that spreading your hatred toward a particular person can really help you get over the situation, doing so will actually make you feel worse about the whole thing. Other people may reinforce your negative feelings, and you’ll only feel more justified in hating that person; plus, talking about how much you hate the person will only get you riled up and even more filled with hatred.


Of course, if you’re in a complicated situation with the person and genuinely need advice, then you can talk to someone else about it. But if you just want to complain, gossip, and make the situation worse, then that definitely won’t stop you from hating.
Plus, if the person hears that you’re gossiping about him or her, then he or she is likely to gossip back, and that will only fuel the cycle of hatred.

, One way to try to turn your attention away from the person you can’t stand is to spend more time with the people you do like. Even if you’re the kind of person who hates almost everyone, there must be at least one or two people in your life whom you genuinely like. Make an effort to spend more time with those people and to think about all of the happiness that they bring to your life; this will help you forget or get over the person you hate much faster than if you spend time by yourself.


Try to avoid talking about the person you hate. Instead, keep things positive and avoid dragging yourself down even further.

, One way to stop hating a specific person is to focus on something good in your life instead. This can be doing yoga, hanging out with your other friends, baking, throwing yourself into your studies, reading for pleasure, hiking, or doing whatever it is that makes you smile. If you have nothing else going on but your hatred for that person, then yeah, you’re likely to keep hating for a long time.


Though it can be hard to fully distract yourself when you hate somebody, just making an effort to go through the motions and throw yourself into something else can be far more effective than sitting there and stewing.
Try to do something that won’t remind you of the person you hate or make you think even more bad thoughts about him or her.

, Be prepared to give it a while before you truly stop hating the person you hate. It’s likely that you’ll have to take some time to fully process and accept whatever happened before moving on. Don’t be frustrated with yourself if it takes you weeks, or even months, to walk by the person before feeling like you’re filled with hatred or even anger or rage. It’s perfectly natural.


If you and the person you hate are in the same social circle or hang out at a lot of the same places, try to avoid the person as much as you can until you feel calmer about the situation.
If you do have to see the person regularly, like in class, then you should work on either ignoring the person or being as cordial as you can.

, Though you may think it’s corny, meditation can actually help you feel more at peace with yourself and the world. It can open up your mind to a more generous, positive perspective, and can help you let the little things roll off your back. Just making a habit of meditating for 10-20 minutes every day can make your whole day shine brighter and can make you feel less inclined to hate everyone around you. Here’s what you do:


Find a calm, quiet place and take a seat on the floor.
Close your eyes and focus on relaxing every part of your body one at a time.
Focus on the breath rising in and out of your body.
Work on eliminating any thoughts, worries, or complaints that may fill your mind.
Do this once or twice a day for at least 10 minutes until you find yourself feeling more at peace, relaxed, and less likely to judge.

, Spending a bit more time surrounded by nature can make you feel more grateful and less inclined to get stuck in the small stuff. Just spending a few hours a week sitting in a nice park, going on a stroll through the woods, walking along the beach, or staring out at a placid lake can make you feel how small you are in the scheme of things, and that the world is too grand and beautiful for you to get hung up on hating people who haven’t done anything wrong, for the most part.


You can do this on your own so you can feel calm and meditative throughout the experience. Avoid thinking any negative thoughts and focus on the present and enjoy the world around you.
You can also bringing a hiking, walking, or jogging buddy with you and enjoy both the nature you see and being around other people.
You don’t need to be the outdoorsy type to spend time outside. If you’re really not into hiking, just take a walk through your neighborhood and look at the leaves changing colors or the flowers blooming.

, You’ll develop more of a positive outlook and will be less likely to hate people if you think about all of the things you have to be thankful for. Just take 15 minutes out of your day to sit down with and write down all of the things you have to be thankful for. This can be everything from your health to your pet kitty to your kind and helpful neighbor, Arnold. Nothing is too small to be thankful for; make sure to write down every little thing that should make you feel thankful.


Take the time to review your list. Read it aloud if you need to. This will help reinforce that you should stop hating so much and that you do have things you can be happy about.
Make a habit of adding to this list once a week. This will show you that you should make a habit of gratitude.
Tape the list above your list if you want to. This can help you stay more positive.

, Another simple way to develop a more positive perspective is to spend more time with people who are happy with who they are and the world around them. Happiness is contagious, and if you spend more time with people who make you laugh, talk about the things they love, and make you feel better about yourself, then you’ll be much more likely to feel good about the world and to stop hating.


Think about it: do most of your friends get you down or enable your hating behavior? If this is the case, then you shouldn’t ditch them completely, but you should seek out more positive people.
Even if you don’t like being social, you should try to hang out with positive people at least once a week. This can help turn your perspective around and make you see that things aren’t so bad, after all.

, Though you may not want to admit it, one of the reasons why you may be struggling to stop hating is because one of the people you hate is yourself. Ask yourself if you truly like who you are and what you have to offer or if there’s room for improvement. Then, work on addressing the flaws you can change and accepting the ones you can’t, all the while reminding yourself about all of the good things you have to offer to the world.


Building your confidence can take years, but once you make an effort to address your insecurities, you’ll be on your way to hating less.
One thing you can do is try to hang out with people who make you feel good about yourself. If everyone around you is always bringing you down, then you’re not likely to be very confident.
Work on projecting confidence through your body language. Stand tall, look people in the eye, and avoid slouching or crossing your arms over your chest. Let people see that you’re happy to inhabit your own body.

, Sure, you’re going to hate if you feel like there’s nothing good going on in your life. However, if you have something good to look forward to, whether it’s some quality time with your family over the weekend or a career in medicine once you’re done with school, then this will make you feel less likely to hate and more likely to be excited about and happy with the world.


Make a list of all the good things you have to look forward to, even if it’s something as silly as your favorite show after school. Start small and build toward larger, more important goals. This can make you see that there is plenty of good in the world after all.
Make a habit of talking about the good things in your life instead of the bad. This can make you both outwardly and inwardly optimistic. Plus, if you share the things you’re excited about, your friends will support you and make you even more excited about them.

, You’ll be less likely to hate everything if you spend time doing something you really care about. This can be playing the violin, working on your novel, training for a marathon, or gardening. You don’t have to be the best at it, either; just making a schedule that allows you to regularly spend time doing something you love can make you less likely to hate.


Sure, you’re going to be a hater if there’s nothing that seems meaningful in your life. But if you spend even one hour or half an hour a day doing what you love, you’ll feel more positive about everything.
If you don’t think there’s really anything you love, then that may be part of the problem. Make an effort to take new classes, ask other people about their hobbies, and sign up for after-work or after-school activities to see what strikes your fancy.

But be honest with yourself: is this helping you in any way, or helping decrease the conflict in your relationship? Let down your defenses in the height of things. While it may feel counterintuitive, it’s quite effective. Don’t be afraid to admit your wrongs.


Don’t be too proud to say “I’m sorry” or “I was wrong.” Especially if you’ve hurt your partner, make it clear that you are remorseful of your actions and that you want things to be better.;
, Sometimes you know that continuing to argue and fight will be futile. Instead of running around the hamster wheel, stop your fight and your words, and commit to touch.Engage in a long embrace, hold hands, or cuddle. Take away the anger, frustration, and hurt for a moment and focus on connection.


You can show and express your love toward someone even if you are angry with him or her. You can say, “I feel really angry, but I still love you and care for you very much.”
Keep in mind that your relationship is multifaceted. While you may feel emotionally disconnected, it doesn’t mean you cannot physically connect.

, A statement can start out as understanding and empathetic, yet get derailed when the word “but” comes in.For instance, you may say, “I know you had to work late tonight, but I really needed you to fold the laundry.” Before you say “but”, think about finishing your original thought first. You can say, “I know you had to work late tonight, and I bet you’re really tired.”


Be empathic toward your partner instead of blaming. This can smooth many fights or arguments before they blow up.
Pay attention to your partner’s needs and voice your appreciation, concern, and empathy.

, Sometimes you feel guilty about something (like not taking out the trash) and find a way to blame your partner (you didn’t remind me; we stayed up late talking about finances). You may blame your partner for being unkind, thoughtless, or not listening. Guilt and blame can play in circles. Instead of letting these feelings get the best of you, stop and notice when you feel guilty or when you’re ready to fire off an accusation or blame. If you feel guilty or you blame yourself, it’s likely that you may want to externalize these uncomfortable feelings onto someone else.When you feel guilt or blame arise, notice the feelings. Remember that you do not have to act on them, just notice them in your feelings, thoughts, or body. Then, think of a way to not blame your partner. You may end the fight completely once you make this decision.

, Even during the most tense situations, it’s okay to try and break the ice with a little humor.You may not realize how quickly a fight escalates, or how intensely you are feeling anger, guilt, blame, or frustration. Having a little comedic relief is healthy and can break down the barriers quickly.


You can express your frustration while still bringing humor to the situation. For instance, you throw an imaginary object at your partner and say “Boing!” or do an anger dance when you feel especially frustrated.

, Be open to hearing your partner out. When you’re unclear about something, don’t jump to conclusions but ask strategic questions that provide clarification.Instead of waiting for your partner to say something “wrong”, make your goal to understand your partner, regardless of whether you agree of disagree. The point of listening isn’t to make your point clear, it’s to more fully understand your partner.


Fights are often due to misinformation or personalization. The more you listen and understand your partner, the less potential for conflict will arise.
Don’t just be curious for information, but ask about your partner’s feelings. Try, “How did it make you feel?” or “What was that situation like for you?”

, Stop putting the energy onto the other person (whom, realistically, you cannot change) and instead put your focus on yourself. What can you do to improve the situation? Remove the phrase “You make me feel…” from your vocabulary.Instead of exploding at your partner, put your focus on yourself and your needs. Express your needs instead of demanding what you want of your partner. For instance, saying “I need time to relax after work” is different than saying, “You never let me relax after work.”


Instead of placing blame onto your partner, state your feelings.For instance, instead of saying, “You’re such a jerk! I can’t believe you!” say, “I feel really hurt and disrespected by your words.” Notice how different these statements are, and imagine how different the response may be from your partner.

, Forgiveness doesn’t mean you have to excuse your partner’s behavior, pretend an event didn’t happen, or let your partner ’off the hook’.Forgiveness allows you to free yourself from holding on to any resentment or negative feelings.


Let go of the urge to punish your partner. You cannot resolve a conflict if you are unwilling to forgive.Let go of past fights and let the past remain in the past. If you still feel bitter or resentful toward you partner, address those feelings and don’t let them linger in the relationship.

, You may feel like you’re in so deep that you don’t know how to get out. A therapist can help you dissect your problems and see what needs are not getting met. Working on skills such as communication, modifying dysfunctional behavior, and changing roles can be a part of couple’s therapy.Therapy can be helpful in getting you and your partner to be on each other’s side and work together instead of against each other.

, Your fights may run in circles until you recognize that there are certain topics that you may never agree on, which may include aspects of finances, parenting, in-laws or friends.Learn to respectfully hear each other’s sides and then drop the issue.


Accept that there are fundamental topics that you will disagree on, and leave it at that.
If you disagree on major issues, find a compromise. For instance, if you disagree on parenting issues, find a way that you each can respect each other and yourself while doing the best for your child.

, If you’re not getting enough sleep, chances are you’ll be more susceptible to stress and conflict.Not getting enough sleep can affect your physical, emotional, and mental health.


Aim to get between 7.5-8 hours of sleep per night.But remember that some people function well at 6 hours of sleep, while others benefit from getting 9 hours of sleep each night. Make minor adjustments to your going to bed/waking times to find the optimal amount of sleep for you.

, Don’t take your stress out on your partner. Instead, find healthy ways to cope daily with the stress of school, work, family, and friends. Stress is a part of every human’s life, the greatest variable is how you deal with it. Find outlets that help you feel good.


Exercise is an excellent way to move your body and release stress. There are numerous benefits of exercise such decreasing stress and boosting your mood.Aim for 30 minutes each day of exercise, which can include going to the gym, dancing, walking your dog, or jumping on the trampoline.
Find time to relax. This may include reading a book, spending time in nature, taking a bath or listening to music.Spend time with friends. If you feel stressed, call up a friend, meet for smoothies, or go for a walk together. Connecting with someone who cares and that supports you is a quick way to release stress., Practicing mindful meditation can help you distance yourself from conflict and negative thoughts.Practice seeing negative thoughts just as thoughts and not as reality. Don’t attach yourself to the thoughts; see them as free-floating thoughts that you can choose to accept or not; they don’t have to be truth.


Practice seeing negative thoughts like free-floating clouds in the sky: one moment they are here, the next they are not. Just like one moment you may say an animal cloud, then it changes, learn to not attach to negative thoughts.

, Make sure you let your partner know how much he or she means to you. Express your gratitude for the big and little things, like picking up the kids from soccer to being there for you when your grandfather died.Be thoughtful and generous with your time. Let your partner know that he or she is a priority and not an afterthought.


Surprise your partner with a thoughtful card, piece of art, flowers, candy, or homemade meal, just because.
Offer an act of kindness. Ask your partner, “What can I do to make your day brighter?”"

Brainstorm ideas.,
Notice what he likes.,
Make a list.,
Consider stepping out of your comfort zone.,
Think outside the box.,
Pay attention to what he doesn’t like.",How to Surprise Your Boyfriend1," Your relationship is unique and so is your guy. Think about what he likes and what makes him feel good. Ask yourself what activities, events, places, hobbies and things he enjoys. Notice what he shows excitement for, is passionate about or makes him laugh.


If you are new to the relationship, you may be able to find hints by asking him during casual conversation. Try not to give your plans to come up with a way to surprise him away.
Consider asking a friend or family member of his for some ideas.
Go ahead and think of things you aren’t sure he would like but that there is a good chance he will.;
, You can get a lot of ideas by watching what he says, does and has conversations about—not only with you but with others as well. Keep an eye on what he orders at restaurants, the things he does for fun and what he watches on TV. Listen when he mentions something he really enjoys while you two are out or when cuddling together. Find out what makes him smile.

, Write down your ideas about what you know or think he likes. Try to write as many as possible so you will have a lot of ideas to choose from for future surprises as well. Writing ideas down will probably help lead to other ideas you should also write down.

, It is surprising when you do things you normally wouldn’t do because you care about someone. For example, you buy you and your partner tickets for a football game just because you know he enjoys it and wants to spend time with you—even though you may not like football or crowds. It’s ok sometimes to make reasonable sacrifices so you two can share an experience together that he may happen to like a lot more than you. Hopefully, he will return the favor one day and surprise you the same way.

, Remember that using only a minimum effort to create the surprise won’t be as impactful. Just buying something pre-made on Valentines  Day, for example, because it is expected won’t be as meaningful as something unexpected. If you can create a gift or experience that will be unique for just the two of you, that would be ideal. This is your chance to really show (rather than just say) how much the other person means to you.


The action that you take to create the surprise is actually less important than the idea that you want to introduce something unexpected or new. This is what creates the rush that makes the surprise so powerful.Know that your surprise does not have to be big or expensive. Little things can be meaningful too. Just make sure your boyfriend isn’t able to predict that you are going to do it.

, It’s important that you try to get a sense of the things your man prefers not to eat, do or places he doesn’t like to be. You don’t want to make your boyfriend a beautiful meal with asparagus and salmon if he can’t stand the way asparagus tastes. He may still eat it because he doesn’t want to ruin how thrilled you are with your surprise but it definitely won’t be as fun for him as you probably wanted it to be. So pay attention to his negative reactions to certain foods, experiences, events and activities as well.

Don't forget about little things.",How to Surprise Your Boyfriend2," Gifts from out of the blue? Always appreciated. If there is something you know he has had his eye on, like a game or some sports gear, go out and buy it for him.


If you do not know of anything he specifically wants or if that item is out of your budget, surprise him with something affordable that you know he will still enjoy, like a book or DVD about something he's interested in.
If you're too young for big gifts or any of these other treats, slip a little note into his locker at school, or decorate his locker when he isn't around. Big surprise!
The less you treat your gift like a big deal, the more awesome it will seem. If you give it to him and say, ""No big deal, just thought of you,"" he'll be blown away. Guaranteed.

, Sports events, concerts, beer festivals and other events in your area are all great guy-ideas. Buy the tickets and plan out the day ahead of time. Find out what other activities are nearby and make it a special day for you both.


If you're not super-into what he's super-into, it's still good to go together. Doing this shows that you're interested in him, even if you're not interested in watching pro wrestling. Go along and decide to have a good time anyway.
Alternatively, plan a boys-night for him. Buy him and his friend some concert or game tickets and send them off for the night. Then stay home and spend some quality solo time.

, A day of being treated like a king will be a welcome surprise for any guy. If you want to surprise your boyfriend, wait for his day off, then tell him that he gets to make all the decisions for the entire day. Let him be in charge.


Give him a day off from doing any chores, or planning anything yourself. Go out of your way to keep him relaxed. Let him plan things out. If he wants to go out, then go out. If he wants to stay in, then stay in.

, Lots of people say the way to a guy's heart is through his stomach. It's probably true for many people, though, guy or gal. Preparing his favorite dinner is a nice treat no matter how long the two of you have been going out.


If the relationship is new and you have never cooked for him before, inviting him over for a home-cooked meal will be a nice surprise, regardless of what you make. Then you can cook him breakfast in bed the next morning.
Plan a picnic lunch, or make reservations at his favorite restaurant. Eating in is nice, but every once in a while, going to a restaurant he really enjoys can demonstrate just as much consideration.
Go on a snack tour of his favorite food in town. Visit every local brewery to let him sample the local beers (you drive), or check out the fried pickles at every local barbecue place. Pick something you know he loves and hit up all the places. Plan out the routes.
Surprise him with lunch at work. Even if he is too busy to eat it with you, making the extra effort on your part will be a sweet surprise and an effective way to show him how much you think of him even when you are not physically together.

, Lots of guys are interested in things that may seem relatively small to you. Planning out something super-elaborate, like a scavenger hunt for relationship-mementos, could come off as corny to some guys. But things that seem kind of lame to you may get him feeling the big feelings. Try out the following for a little treat:


Borrow his car and put gas in it.
Ask to watch an action movie he loves.
Make him a huge sandwich while he's watching TV.
Clean up his place for him.

Throw the party somewhere else.,
Secure the refreshments.,
Forget about decorations.,
Don't give him any hints.,
Get his friends in on it.,
Do something with his family.",How to Surprise Your Boyfriend3," Having a surprise party is great, but having one in public where you won't have to spend a bunch of time afterward cleaning up? Way better for a dude. Either plan the party at a friend's house, or plan the party at a local pub or restaurant that he likes.

, Again, this can't be overstated: Guys like to eat and drink. If you're going to throw a surprise party, get the dude-food in hand. Figure out what he likes best and provide those drinks and refreshments.


If your guy's a meat and potatoes kind of guy, plan a backyard barbecue. Get a friend of his who is good on the grill to make up some brats or ribs, and make sure to get enough for everyone.
If your guy prefers healthy food, plan out a trip to a local spot he hasn't tried yet. Make reservations for all of his friends, buy him a full tasting menu and plan the meet-up.

, It's not usually necessary to waste a bunch of time and effort in making big decorations for a guy's party. If it makes you happy, go for it. If it seems like a big drag on your time and energy, then forget about it. He may not get how much time and effort it took you to create all the elaborate decorations, anyway.

, Pretend like you might have forgotten that it's his birthday, or plan a surprise party for him on a random day. You can wish him a happy birthday to avoid letting his mood sink too low, but do not give away any hints to suggest that you have a roomful of his favorite people, food and gifts waiting for him back home.


Alternatively, you can also plan a surprise party for an occasion that does not usually get a party. A promotion, for instance, is an exciting life event that is not always celebrated formally, but you can surprise him by planning a party to celebrate his accomplishment.

, Demonstrating that you like your guy's friends? That's huge. Surprise your boyfriend by inviting his friends over to watch a game or to play cards with him.


Alternatively, you can ask his friends to meet you and him at a restaurant or sports event, then surprise him by waiting until you get there to reveal that you asked them along.

, If your boyfriend has a strong relationship with his parents, reach out to them and include them in your plan. It'll be pretty impressive and demonstrate that you're in this relationship for the long haul.


It doesn't have to be a big party. Invite them over one evening during the week for dinner, or ask if he'd like to have dinner over there some night. It might be a relief for him that you're willing and interested.

"
Greet him at the door in something sexy.,
Try out a new move.,
Give him a sensual massage.,
Try talking dirty.,
Send dirty texts throughout the day.,
Do the things you used to do.,
Ask him about his fantasies.",How to Surprise Your Boyfriend4," Put on your most sultry, seductive outfit and greet him at the door as soon as he comes over. It will make a nice surprise welcome home for him, especially if you know that he has had a long or frustrating day.


You do not necessarily need to wear something skimpy. Anything that makes you look your best will show that you put some extra effort into surprising him.
Just make sure that he is alone when he comes through the door. If not, it could get awkward.
Better yet: Forget about the door. Wait for him in the bedroom.

, Things getting a little boring in the sack? Do some research and try out a new technique or move that'll drive him crazy the next time you're hooking up. Surprises like these are guaranteed to please.


If you're not interested in a new move, wake him up with one of your old ones. Always a nice surprise.

, Next time your boyfriend is hanging out, surprise him by springing a sensual massage on him. This helps to relax your boyfriend and can be quite a turn-on. What's not to like?


Massages don't have to mean sex. Even if you're not at that stage in your relationship yet, a shoulder massage can be a nice way of doing something nice for your man.

, If you're usually pretty G-rated, it'll be quite the surprise if you start talking like you've been binge-watching X-rated movies while he was gone. Not to mention a turn-on. If you know this is something that might embarrass your guy or make him feel uncomfortable, then just don’t overdo it.


If dirty-talking makes you feel awkward, try asking him to talk dirty to you. Give him the chance to try out something new, if he's interested.

, If your boyfriend has a busy day, letting him know that you're thinking about him ""that way"" will drive him absolutely crazy. Getting a dirty text is one of the best kinds of surprises. Let him know what you plan on doing with him later.


Be careful with pictures. If you're in a committed relationship and you trust your boyfriend, that's one thing. If you're just texting someone you don’t know that well or someone who may turn around and use your pictures against you if you break up, think twice.

, If you’ve been in a relationship for a while, you probably went through a phase where you engaged in lot of naughty surprises and teasing. Think about what you used to do or say, and do them all over again. Maybe you forgot to wear underwear under your slinky black dress while you’re at dinner or watching a show once—make sure he remembers by doing it again.

, If you're not sure how to surprise your boyfriend in the bedroom, talk to him. Learning more about your partner's fantasies is a great way to get closer and become more intimate. You don't want to risk throwing some wild and kinky thing at him in the bedroom, only for him to turn up his nose. Always talk to him about what he wants to do, and try your best to be open-minded.


Don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Him wanting to do something doesn't mean you have to do it to surprise him. Be honest with him in return. Besides, just having the fantasy-talk can sometimes be hot enough to spice it up.

Remember that your partner chose you, not anyone else. Stop obsessing over your weight, height, or looks; your constant negativity is draining… for you and your partner both. Worse yet, an overactive attitude of insecurity can drive people away, turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy that drives you deeper into the hole of fear and self-neglect. Accept yourself as you are. Your partner is with you for a reason and obviously finds you attractive, but even if he weren’t and didn’t, you should never let anyone else’s opinion define or validate yours.

, Whether you’re new to the game or have been at it for years, it’s not always easy to know what a relationship is supposed to be and feel like. Many people don’t grow up with good examples of healthy relationships among their friends, family, or even parents. What’s worse, having one awful relationship can completely throw off your sense of balance and self-trust, making you second-guess your every move for years to follow.

, Once you’ve done some soul-searching and have a clearer perspective on things, it’s time to look at your relationship with a fresh eye. Do your jealousy, doubt, and fear stem from your own issues with self-worth… or is that something you’ve been telling yourself to justify your partner’s unsatisfactory behavior? Even if you haven’t been as stable a girlfriend as you should be, that doesn’t mean you should overlook or write off your partner’s transgressions to over-correct for your own feelings of guilt; it’s always possible that your out-of-control feelings were the result of trying to suppress your own gut instincts – or, at the very least, that you both have played a hand in making the relationship what it is today.

, If you’ve been dogging his footsteps, confronting him with accusations, stalking his social media profiles, or exhibiting any other desperate behavior, your first order of business is to back off. Take a few deep breaths, detach, and play it cool for a while. Find opportunities to be with friends, go to an event you’ve been interested in, and turn him down for at least one get-together. Be very careful not to act vindictive about this; the point isn’t to punish him, give him the cold shoulder, or manipulate him into begging for forgiveness, but to give the both of you a break so you can blow off a little steam, get some perspective, and hopefully save the relationship.


Read How to Give Your Boyfriend Space for more advice.

, Before you can do any in-depth work on yourself or as a couple, you need to do damage control on your strained relationship. Start by striking a healthy balance between giving your partner space and increasing the quality of your time together. Pursue your own interests in a meaningful, enriching way: after all, part of what attracts people to one another is mystery, and if you spend all your time checking in on your partner with calls, texts, emails, and Facebook posts, there can hardly be any intrigue left in what you do. Split your time more evenly between your partner and your friends and allow your partner to do the same. Rediscover your interest in a former passion or, if necessary, find a new hobby that will make your non-romantic time more meaningful. Then, when you both have remembered what it’s like to miss one another, improve your time together by going on a vacation or staycation, trying something new like taking a partner dance class, or lightening the mood by being playful and maintaining the romance.

, This is something the two of you need to work on together; many relationship woes could be cured, if not avoided altogether, if couples simply learned how to truly and effectively communicate with one another. A big part of communicating effectively is knowing how to broach an unpleasant topic without putting your partner on the defensive (or, worse yet, the offensive). Start by curbing your accusations: learn to state what you feel (ex. “I feel afraid when you stay out late and don’t tell me where you are or how long you’ll be there”) instead of what you fear (“I’m worried you’re cheating on me”), which can be come off like a slap in the face. Be honest about your thoughts and concerns while you’re having them instead of stockpiling them for later and letting them explode one day out of the blue. Read How to Communicate Effectively for more guidance.

, Trust issues can make you go crazy. Ask yourself who it is you really mistrust: your partner, your partner’s friends… or yourself? Coming to the realization that you still don’t trust yourself in love or that you’re simply threatened by other girls is a good thing; both stem from the same issue, can be worked on, and are totally within your control. Learn how to trust your boyfriend again for his and your sake both.


He didn't text you back? Big deal. Obsessing over things like this will only come across as annoying; if you are laid back and don't expect instantaneous replies to everything, etc, he will not get irritated. Don't call him to see if he's still there - take a deep breath and let it go. He will reply when he can.
Don’t ask him to stop going certain places. Part of jealousy is the desire to control others, and by giving him freedom, you show that you trust him and make him more likely to respect you.
Don’t write a blank check of trust. If you are genuinely concerned about something, do not be afraid to (gently) broach the topic. Mention that it makes you feel uncomfortable when he talks to certain girls, or tell him honestly about a behavior he has that bothers you. Don't overreact or make accusations. Simply state how you feel and, if he respects that, he will try to work it out.
If your boyfriend simply isn’t trustworthy, it’s his turn to roll up his sleeves and match some of the hard work you’ve been putting into the relationship. If he can’t or won’t do it, dump him and start looking for someone who will.

, Okay, so you’ve managed to salvage the relationship and heal the damage that has been done. How do you step it up a notch? To become the girlfriend he fantasizes about coming home to, read How to Be a Good Girlfriend.

Surprise him with something precious.",How to Surprise Your Boyfriend5," You don’t need a destination—just each other. Go ahead and go on an adventure, not knowing where you will end up can make it more exciting. If you know you love the scenery in the mountains, along the ocean or through the woods, then pack up some gear and head out.


Always bring along a first aid kit, flashlights, food, water, spare tires, blankets and other safety gear, especially if you will be gone for several days.

, Kids are great but they can make it hard to get the quality one-on-one time you and your guy need to keep your relationship strong. Find a babysitter and plan a place for the kids to stay for the evening or night, so you two can catch up on all the passion you’ve put on hold for screaming babies and arguing kids. It can be a great surprise for your guy to come home to a quiet house and an entire evening alone with you to rekindle old flames.

, If your guy is good-natured and loves pranks, why not surprise him with one? You could hide out in the fridge when he goes to get a beer and startle him, scare him out of bed with a costume, make him a pie and then put it on his face or use a fake head on your side of the bed to freak him out.A good-natured prank can leave you both laughing so hard you can’t breathe., After your shower, write how much you love your boyfriend on the steamy mirror. You can write a message, quote or short poem. It will disappear with the steam but reappear like magic when he gets out of the shower.

, Forget about emailing or texting. Write an old-fashioned love letter with paper and pen, then send it to him in the mail. A love letter can be held in his hands, kept and reread later to remind him how much you love him.

, Put small notes that remind him you love him or make him laugh in places he will likely find them throughout the day. Put one in his wallet, another in his pocket, car, desk at work or all over the house. These small tokens of your affection can cheer him up if he’s having a rough day and make him smile because he knows you are thinking about him.

, Replace his wallpaper with something funny like you making a silly face, or something else he’ll enjoy like you looking sexy. It will surprise him when he first turns his device on and make him think of you. Remember, even little things can do wonders to make your relationship stronger as long as they are not expected.

, Get a special frame for his degree or military retirement certificate. Restore an old photo of his family. Sew up that hole in his favorite shirt he’s had since high school. Use a program to take all the background noise out of the recording of him singing as a child.

Improve your self-worth.,
Believe in yourself.,
Keep an ultimatum in mind (to yourself).,
Assess the nature of your relationship.,
Stand up for yourself.,
Have a conversation about power.,
Increase your independence.,
Use silence to your advantage.,
Try couples counseling.,
Break any cycle of abuse.",How to Take Control of a Relationship," Learn to value yourself more as a unique individual with just as many rights in your relationship as he has. Write down a list of your best qualities and also the qualities that you would like to improve on. Rather than conceptualizing your weakness as being bad, you can view them as things you have room to improve on.Another way to improve your self-worth is to stop comparing yourself to others. For one, you only see the side of others that they advertise to you; you aren't getting the full picture, which can lead to a warped perception. For example, you might feel like someone has it all going for them but on the inside he might be sad, afraid, or have low self-worth. Second, if improving yourself is important to you, why not just focus on yourself?Still a further way to improve your self-worth is to adopt a flexible self-view. That is, it is important to evaluate yourself based on your worth now, rather than trying to fit your worth into an outdated definition of yourself. For example, if you define high self-worth as being a good tennis player, because you were in high school, but you aren't so good at tennis anymore, you might suffer from low self-worth. Instead, focus on things that you are good at as an adult. For example, maybe you're a great parent or you are great at managing your money.Once you have improved your self-worth, you may feel you deserve more power, and this motivational force will help you obtain more power.;
, He may try to 'gaslight' you, by engaging in psychological manipulation that makes you question yourself. Do not fall for this. Instead, believe in yourself as a sane, rational, intelligent individual.To believe in yourself, think about times you successfully made choices on your own that led to good outcomes. Reflect on these when you are doubting whether you can make good decisions on your own.

, You may feel powerless because you feel trapped in your relationship. However, remember (to yourself) that if you are completely unhappy with your partner, you have the option of ending the relationship. Remind yourself that there are other people out there and you can have another relationship in the future - one that has more of a balanced power dynamic.


In most cases, it is not a good idea to express this ultimatum to your partner, since doing so can damage your relationship. Instead, just remember this information when you are feeling completely out of control and powerless, as it can help you gain more confidence as you navigate your relationship. An example of an ultimatum you might keep in mind to yourself is, ""if — after two months of not seeing any desired change, despite my explicitly telling my partner I would like us to have more of a balanced relationship and despite me actively trying to work with him to change the relationship for the better — I see no progress in that regard, I will end the relationship because it will mean I am still unhappy.""

, Make sure that you are in a relationship where it is worth gaining power back instead of just walking away. If you find yourself in an abusive relationship, whether that abuse is physical or psychological, ask yourself whether it is worth staying around. Signs of an abusive relationship include when your partner: Humiliates or embarrasses you.
Engages in affairs.
Ignores or excludes you.
Threatens to physically harm you, or actually physically harms you.
Showcases unreasonable jealousy.
Demonstrates extreme moodiness.
Guilt trips you.
Threatens to kill himself if you leave.
Uses money to control your behavior.
Withdraws affection from you.
Uses sarcasm towards you and a mean voice.
Is Hypercritical of you.

, You may have gotten in the habit of just going along with everything he says regardless of whether you agree with it. While it is normal to concede and give in to your partner's choices from time to time to be a generous loving relationship partner, it is not normal for one partner to always get his or her way. To gain back some power in your relationship, it can help to express your thoughts and opinions more.For example, say he always decides where you go out for dinner. If you don't feel like going to where he wants to, suggest a different place. If he ridicules you or says no, say that you no longer feel like going out for dinner. At the end of the day, for him to be in a relationship with you, you have to be an active willing participant; this fact, ultimately, can be used as a source of power for you.

, It is possible that your partner does not realize that he has been exerting too much power in the relationship. So, before drawing any nasty conclusions about your partner, you should voice your concerns with him. Let him know that you feel that you have no or little control in the relationship and that you would like more.


Be sure to lay out specific examples of ways that you would like more power. For example, if you feel that you are always spending time with his friends, but he never spends time with yours, let him know that you would like this area to be more balanced.
Avoid making overarching statements about your partner, but instead point to specific examples. Overarching statements such as ""you're a power hungry jerk"" can be damaging and antagonizing. Instead, point to specifics such as, ""you seem to decide who we hang out with most of the time and I would like more of a say in that arena."", Maybe he has all the power because you have lost all independence in your life. If you are doing everything together and he is calling all the shots, it can easily begin to feel like you have no power. Work to develop your own interests. Through this you may form new friendships, all of which can help you increase your sense of independence.


For example, you might start a hobby; this can help you become more independent by making your well-being less tied up in your partner. Depending on the hobby, it can also be a great way to find new friends; having friends is another way to increase your independence.When you feel like your life outside of your relationship is rich, you will be less likely to feel that you ""need"" this other person, and less likely to give into his power antics. You may come to realize that you don't need him if he continues to be such an unfair partner; this realization (if both you and him come to it) can, in fact, increase your power.

, He may be trying to express his power in your relationship by ridiculing you, calling you names, or otherwise being rude and insulting. If he is being unfair, mean, or destructive like this, rather than giving in to his provocations (which is probably what he wants), stay silent. This is a form of showing him that he doesn't have the power over you that he thinks he does (namely, power over your emotions and reactions).When in doubt, think about how such ""non-violent, silent"" strategies have worked successfully throughout history, such as between Mahatma Gandhi and others and the British-ruled India.

, One effective way to improve the power dynamic in your relationship is to work through your relationship issues with a qualified counselor. It can help to have a third party who is unbiased and can help you and your partner see the issues clearly. In addition, relationship counselors can help you to set goals and compromises that can help you have a more power-balanced relationship.To find a psychologist near you, try this website: http://locator.apa.org/


, If you are someone who finds yourself in an abusive relationship, and you are having trouble getting out of it, there are a number of things you can do or look out for to help you break the cycle of abuse.


Watch out for the honeymoon phase, where your abuser treats you very well after being nasty. Know that this is likely inauthentic and your abuser is only luring you back in so that he can abuse you again in the future.Avoid rationalizing the abuse. Signs of rationalization can include things like ""he's not as bad as some partners I've heard about"" or ""he's only hit/screamed at me a couple of times"" Once you realize these are rationalizations you can dispel them and see more clearly.
Understand his fear-based tactics. An abuser may certain tactics to retain power, such as threatening to commit suicide if you leave, making or carrying out threats of violence, calling you names, playing mind games, taking money or not allowing you to have money, or making light of the abuse or denying that it happened at all.If you understand your abuser's tricks, you will be more able to resist them by seeing them for what they are.

This isn't a good idea, it doesn't rate very high on the coolness scale. No matter what you're feeling inside, don't let it show too much. Obviously you don't have to be stony faced and speak in a monotone voice, but just don't get really worked up. Be cool.;
, Don't go up to her the next day and just ask her out. It'll seem a little weird, and you want to get to know her a bit first. So slowly build up a friendship. You don't have to become best friends, but just try to talk to her whenever you can, and be friendly. You'll find out whether you really like her for who she is, and you'll know more about each other.

, It's scary, but if she likes you then she'll probably agree. If you see her at lunch just going out of the canteen or talking to someone, politely go up to her and ask her if you two could speak to each other alone. Try not to do it when she's with a huge group, it may be a little embarrassing. Just stroll up to her and go, ""Hey. Could i speak to you alone for a moment?""

, After you've asked if you can speak to her alone, just be brave and ask her out. Don't stutter or stumble, just ask her out straight. Okay, so maybe you could add more than a ""Will you go out with me?"". Something like, ""I really like you. I was wondering if you wanted to go out sometime?"" would be a lot better.

, Now you're relationship is at its maximum. Take it even farther! Don't go to fast and rush into kissing though! Start to hug and soon enough, she'll be all over you!

Communicate your needs to your partner and acknowledge theirs.,
Practice healthy conflict resolution.,
Be loving and affectionate.,
Keep the spark alive.",How to Stay Faithful in a Relationship1," Any healthy relationship is built on a foundation of communication. In addition to sharing your thoughts, feelings, opinions, and dreams, each partner should openly express their emotional needs. This prevents you from feeling unfulfilled and looking elsewhere.Have regular “checkups” in which both partners share their needs in the relationship. Then, brainstorm ways to meet these needs together.
For example, you might say, “I know you don’t agree with my desire to return to work, but I really need you to support me.” A healthy partner might respond, “I can see that this is important to you. I will work past my own issues and do my best to support you. How can I show my support?”;
, If one or both partners shy away from conflict, the health of the relationship is compromised. Don’t push problems under the rug. Face problems head-on to stop them from building up and threatening fidelity.


If one of you doesn’t feel heard, you may turn to someone else for validation. Avoid this by facing your issues when they happen.
First, acknowledge the hurt (e.g. “I was hurt when you said…”). Offer a solution (e.g. “I would appreciate it if you…”). Then, your partner should validate your feelings and work with you to come up with a workable solution., Deep down, all humans have an innate desire to belong. Both partners want to feel loved and cared for in a relationship. When you neglect one another in this way, you risk the other seeking external sources to fill this void.


Whether through verbal declarations (e.g. “I love you, sweetie.”) to hugs or kisses, be sure to show your partner that you love and care for them.If your partner does not say these types of things to you, then let them know that you would appreciate it if they started.

, Sex stimulates you emotionally just as it does physically, emphasizing your chemistry and connectedness. If you are hoping to stay faithful to your partner and vice versa, you should maintain an active and healthy sex life.Spice things up every once in a while by dressing up for a special date. Or, light candles and give each other back rubs. Another romantic option might include taking a long soak together in the tub while listening to music.

Think before you speak.,

Consider what you can and can't do.,
Take your promises seriously.,
Make an effort.",How to Stop Breaking Promises," This is a difficult thing to do for many people, mainly because it sounds so simple but is actually quite complicated. Sometimes you say something without thinking it through properly. By the time you realise you shouldn't have said it, the person you said it to has taken it seriously or is relying on it. To avoid this situation, and avoid making impossible promises, don't open your mouth if you haven't thought it through.;
, If the person you make a promise to is in a vulnerable or hurt condition, then think very carefully about making a promise to them. People in this type of condition tend to take a promise to heart, and will gain hope from it. It will be a bad idea to break a promise to them. If, on the other hand, the person you've made a promise to is emotionally strong and independent, you can relax a little.

, Sometimes we promise somebody something because we wish we could do it for them, not because we actually can. Think about this very, very carefully. If you promise something, be sure that you will be able to fulfill it without a struggle or a chance of failure. This can sometimes be the main cause of broken promises.

, If you make a promise, think about it. Consider what you can do, how you can fulfill it, and the impact it will have on people. This step ties in with the first one, and is extremely important. If you don't take your promises seriously, and consider the consequences of them, you can end up breaking them or hurting other people.

, If the answer doesn't come to you immediately, don't just give up. Do what you can to fulfill and keep your promise. This will ensure you keep your promises and gain trust from those close to you. The solution may not always be obvious, but it's always there.

What is this response connected to? Look inward to find the real issue you are responding to., When you feel tears welling up or a flare of anger or jealousy, pause. Ask yourself, ""Why am I feeling this way?"" Acknowledging your emotions instead of ignoring them is a first step towards learning to control them.


Figuring out why you feel a certain way helps you not to rationalize. When we rationalize, we end up lying to ourselves and making things worse.Be honest with yourself. You are not doing yourself any favors by lying.

, When you feel a wave of emotions hitting, ask yourself key questions before reacting. Mentally asking yourself these questions can help you avoid reacting immediately, and also calm down as you evaluate the situation. Ask yourself:


Is this emotion going to help me solve anything?
Do I gain more by holding on to this emotion or letting it go?
Am I capable of letting this emotion go?
Can I walk away for a moment so I can gather myself?
Can I control this emotion so I am fully aware of my decisions and the consequences?, Evaluate your life and your habits. Look for things you do that prompt you to feel overly emotional. Remember, you are in control of your emotions and yourself. Though you may react negatively to outside stimuli, you are the one who is ultimately in control of what you think and feel.Are you more emotional when you are stressed? If so, try managing your stress to avoid emotional reactions.
Do you react more emotionally when you haven't slept or eaten well or enough?
Does exercise help you manage your emotions?
Do you get more sensitive in large crowds full of strangers?
Does your work environment make you emotional?
Being able to pinpoint what some of your triggers are can help you avoid situations where you might be emotional, or be better prepared for them.

, Take calming breaks throughout the day. Get up, take a brisk walk, stretch, read something that makes you feel good, call or text a friend, write an e-mail. Do things that make you happy and reduce stress.This will help you stay calm and centered so that you are prepared when you are faced with a difficult, emotional situation.

, When you feel your emotions rising, step a few feet away.Moving yourself physically away just a few feet helps remove you from the immediate source of the emotional drama. The physical act helps you focus on something else, which can quell your anger or stop your tears. As you step away, you can think logically and decide the best way to deal with the situation.


If you find yourself in tears, shaking from anger, or yelling, walk away. Go to the bathroom or another room to collect yourself.

, Frowning with your brows drawn together might influence the way you react. Scrunching your face like you are going to cry could also help trigger tears. Instead, try keeping a neutral face, or even a slight smile. It might not help calm all of your emotions, but it might stop the onset of tears or a raging yelling spurt., Breathing allows you to calm your nervous system and your fight or flight response, which helps you make a clearer decision.Deep breathing helps calm your emotions and lessens anxiety.


Try breathing in through your nose slowly for four seconds. Hold for two seconds. Exhale through your mouth for six seconds. Repeat.Start meditation and relaxation exercises to help control your emotions. Regular yoga exercises can help reduce your stress and aid you in reflecting on why you feel the way you feel.
Breathing can help you if you find yourself being emotional in an inopportune moment. If you are crying or yelling, take a moment to breathe and recenter yourself.

, When your emotions are high, don't make important decisions. During these times, you are not thinking clearly and are not in the state to make a reasoned, rational decision. Don't answer loaded questions when you are feeling overly emotional. You may say something you regret. Instead, remove yourself from the situation. Allow yourself time to process your feelings before you make decisions.

, When you end up in a situation where you are being overly emotional, be cognizant of the fact that you are overly emotional. Then, ask yourself why you are being this way. Are you reacting to things in yourself you have already discovered are sensitive spots? Are you stressed? Are you reacting to this person at all?


H.A.L.T. Ask yourself if you are Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired. Go eat something, take a walk if you're angry, talk to a friend, or get some rest., Everyday we are put in situations that we don't like, that are uncomfortable, or where we are criticized. Sometimes the way a person treats us is not even related to us, but something in the other person's life. Having a thick skin can help you navigate difficult situations without letting your emotions get the better of you.


Be silent and unresponsive. Don't react to everything. Let some things go and just roll off your back.
Stop exaggerated thinking. Being overly emotional sometimes makes us blow things out of proportion. We take something small and insignificant and turn it into something large. Learn not to indulge in thinking like this to avoid inaccurate versions of the truth.
Figure out why things upset you. Is there a way to fix someone's treatment of you? Can you calmly and respectfully address the person who offended or upset you?
Take criticism with a grain of salt. When someone criticizes you, use it as a moment to better yourself. If you disagree with the criticism, trust and believe in yourself enough to ignore the criticism. People will always criticize you; it's a part of life. Learn to take it in stride., Look at what happened from the other person's perspective. Did they mean to hurt you? Were they trying to be helpful? Were they actually being cruel or bullying you? If the person isn't trying to hurt you, focus on your feelings instead of the other person., Ask yourself, ""Am I going to feel this way in an hour, day, or month?"" Many times, emotions are heat-of-the-moment reactions. Yes, in that moment things feel worst-case scenario and like they will never be better. How often do you look back and think, ""Why was I so nervous/upset/angry/sad?"" Remember to look forward.


This strategy will also help you think twice about your reactions. What will your boss/co-worker/friend think tomorrow if you overreact today?

, If you are struggling to deal with your emotions, talk to someone. Your friends and family care about you and will help you. Sometimes, talking helps dissipate some of the pent up emotions. If that doesn't help, consider going to talk to a therapist. They might be able to help you work through your emotions in healthy, constructive ways.

Ask your partner what’s on their mind.,
Be specific and direct.,
Acknowledge your emotions honestly.,
Apologize if the rough patch is your fault.",How to Survive a Rough Patch in a Relationship1," It may sound too simple to work, but it’s the most important part of working through the rough patches in your relationship. In short, ask questions to figure out how your partner is feeling, and be ready to listen.If you’re hesitating to initiate a conversation, it’s probably worth doing so. While sometimes challenging, even hard conversations are ultimately likely to strengthen your relationship together.
The best question may be the simplest. Try asking your partner, “Hey, what’s been on your mind lately?” whenever it seems like they have something to say, or are behaving emotionally.
Think about your own answers to the questions you want to ask. You might realize that there are some specific things you want to bring up too.;
, It may simply feel as though distance has grown between you. However, it’s better to ask - and easier to answer more specific questions. For instance, ask something like, “We haven’t been as excited to see each other recently, and both of us are coming home later in the evening. Can we sit down and talk about how we’re both feeling?”There may be a concrete reason that’s wearing on your partner. For example, maybe they've simply been stressed about work. Feel free to talk about changes you perceive in one another's behavior. This will help prevent either of you from worrying when a bit of distance between you is coming from something temporary and unrelated to your relationship.

, Steer conversations towards identifying the issues that you can work on together. This will help strengthen your bonds to one another. There are a lot of things that can get in the way, including your emotions. If you’re feeling insecure about your relationship, for instance, admit it.For example, “Hey, I’ve noticed we don’t kiss each other anymore before leaving for work. Maybe it’s silly, but I feel frightened that we’re growing apart.""

, If something you did led to the tension between you, it's vital that you offer your partner a sincere apology. In order to do so, make sure you explicitly express regret, acknowledge your own responsibility, and request forgiveness.Depending on what you have done, you should also likely convey your intent to change your behavior.
For instance, say something like, ""I'm genuinely sorry that I haven't been around for you as much lately. It's something that I realize has contributed negatively to our relationship. I intend to be around more frequently, and to be more accessible to you when we're together. I really want to make this work.""

Communicate your relationship status with your social network.,
Build a circle of faithful and positive friends.,
Enjoy separate and mutual interests.,
Be mindful of how and to whom you vent.,
Be responsible with drugs and alcohol.",How to Stay Faithful in a Relationship2," A practical way to prevent affairs and affirm your commitment to your partner is by publicizing your relationship. When a relationship is kept secret, insecurities flourish. Show your partner you are committed to being faithful by telling your friends, family, coworkers, and acquaintances that you’re “taken.”


You can do this by updating your relationship status on social networks like Facebook or by simply introducing your partner at parties and events., There’s a popular saying when it comes to social groups that you’re the sum of the five people closest to you. That means if you’re surrounding yourself with cheaters, you’re more likely to become one. Clean up your social circle by forging connections with people who share the same values as you.


If your friends and family members don’t have the same values as you and your partner, your relationship may suffer. Boost your chances of remaining faithful by being around people who are doing the same., Healthy and happy couples maximize on quality time. There’s no better way to connect with your partner than by sharing hobbies or interests. Doing so increases your relationship satisfaction and strengthens your bond.At the same time, it’s also healthy to have some individual interests. Find a passion to pursue on your own, too. For example, you and your partner might enjoy traveling together, but on trips you have a separate interest of visiting art galleries.

, Sharing the ups and downs of a relationship may be par for the course in many circles. Both women and men do it. However, whining about your partner’s shortcomings could open the door for someone else.Avoid venting to other potential suitors about your mate. Find a healthier way to relieve tension and work through problems, like talking to your partner or journaling. Or, you might lean on a supportive friend or family member. However, keep in mind that some friends or family members might not be supportive and might just be looking for an opportunity to complain about them.

, If you’re already straying emotionally from your partner, substance use may offer the final push that bumps you across the line. Skip the drinks and drugs and you might avoid feeling regret later.If you are turning to drugs and/or alcohol to cope with the relationship, then it might be best to separate from the person because this is an indication that the relationship has progressed to a very negative point.

"
"
Define your personal values.,
Think about the type of relationship you want.,
Have a candid discussion with your partner.",How to Stay Faithful in a Relationship3," Your values are the beliefs and principles that drive your life and your decisions. When you have a firm grasp on your personal values, you are less likely to stray from them. Discover what your values are so that you can stand by them—and your partner.


Spend some time thinking about the key characteristics that are most important to you. How would a friend describe you? What issues are you most willing to stand up for? What aspects of life make you feel really satisfied?Answering a few questions like these can help you uncover your personal values. Examples of values might include honesty, compassion, forgiveness, and family.

, Faithfulness can mean many things—from not becoming physically intimate with someone other than your partner to prioritizing other people or things over your partner. You can lessen your chances of straying physically, emotionally, or mentally by figuring out what you want.One way to figure out what you want is to review your past relationships. What was missing in these relationships? Why did they end?
Now, think about how you love your partners (e.g. clingy, trusting, idolizing, etc.). Now, think about the kind of partner you desire (e.g. emotionally stable, wealthy, family-oriented).

, If you’re in a relationship with someone, the two of you must work together to keep infidelity away. Arrange for a time to sit down and talk with your beloved about what’s considered ‘unfaithful’ in your book.


You might say, “Since we have decide to be exclusive, I want to make sure all our cards are on the table. I think it will save us problems later if we can clarify our non-negotiables when it comes to infidelity. What does the word ‘unfaithful’ mean to you in a relationship?”
Both of you should share your views and come to an agreement about what classifies as cheating or infidelity in your relationship. After this discussion, you both can feel secure in knowing that your partner knows which behaviors you find unacceptable.Keep in mind that if your disagreements are significant, then you may not be able to rebuild your relationship.

Recognize that relationships take work.,
State what you need and want.,
Develop a plan together.,
Get professional help.,
Forgive your partner.,
Know when to move on.",How to Survive a Rough Patch in a Relationship2," In other words, your life is not a romantic comedy. While this may seem obvious, it can be hard to accept the fact that relationships aren’t always fun, easy, and romantic. As you develop a more intimate relationship with someone, you’ll learn more and more about one another - both good and bad.It might be a good idea for both you and your partner to commit to working through the rough patch. If one or both of you frequently threatens to leave, then this can be damaging to the relationship.
Don’t storm out of the room when an issue arises. Stay and try to work things out.
Similarly, it may be tempting to try and wait out a rough patch. However, proactively working to keep communication open will be far more effective in getting through it.

, The silver lining of working through a rough patch is the value of experiencing something you know you don’t want moving forward. It may become clearer to you what you need and want from a relationship. If you realize your relationship lacks something that would make you happier, it’s important to bring it up.Keep in mind that people change and so do their needs and wants. This means that you and your partner will probably both have different needs and wants as time goes on.
Make sure to ask your partner about their needs and wants. This will take the guesswork out of trying to meet their needs and wants. Try saying something like, “What are some of the things that you need and want from our relationship right now?”
Be specific when you talk about your own needs and wants as well. Since specifics will often vary, your wording will reflect what it is you’re addressing. Most importantly, be direct by saying something like, “I know you care about me. That said, I’ve realized that I need more physical affection to be happy. Can we touch more often?”

, Depending on how serious your relationship is, you may need to discuss one another’s values and hopes for the future. Even if you’re already deeply committed and familiar with one another’s aspirations, it’s important to keep one another in the loop regarding specific goals - both as individuals and as a couple. This is all the more important in the context of a rough patch.Ask yourselves, “What can we do to keep moving forward together?” If both of you are committed to making your relationship work, make sure you can come to an agreement on a course of action that works with both of your individual aspirations as well as your relationship with one another.
On the one hand, you may decide that you both need to spend one night a week working to keep up with professional aspirations. On the other, you may realize that you would both benefit by spending more time together, relaxing at home.

, Therapists have training and experience that can enable them to help facilitate conversations between you and your partner. If you wind up fighting or struggling to agree on anything but still want to make your relationship work, look into relationship therapists in your area., Ultimately, letting go of something your partner has done and working to rebuild your trust in them will be necessary to get through a rough patch. However, how you do so is important. Most importantly, you should acknowledge that you were hurt, but that you're making the decision to forgive them for the sake of your relationship.For instance, say something like, ""What you did really hurt me. It has also hurt our relationship. However, I think our relationship is worth holding onto, and I'm making the choice to forgive you.""
If your partner continues to do things that you've forgiven them for before, articulate the ramifications of doing something yet again. Say something like, ""This has happened before, and it's still happening. I'm willing to forgive you this time, but if this continues to occur, I will not be able to stay in this relationship.""

, To frame a relationship pragmatically, consider the fact that maintaining a healthy, happy relationship requires continually accepting the consequences of one another’s actions. Are you and your partner both willing to do this? It is vitally important that both of you feel cared for, supported, and respected.There are plenty of other important questions to ask yourself. For instance, are there enough positives in your relationship to make it worth working for? Do both of you feel this way? If not, it is likely time to move on.
Another key question: After stating your needs and desires explicitly, does your partner put effort into meeting them? You deserve to be with someone that will put effort into making you happy.

Establish a weekly date night.,
Bring to mind your early romance.,
Schedule a vacation together.,
Spice up your sex life.,
Establish a shared time-commitment.",How to Survive a Rough Patch in a Relationship3," It can be hard to enjoy one another’s companionship if both of your lives are dominated by the daily grind. In order to reconnect with one another, make a point of dedicating one night each week to having fun together. Even better, try to make plans that have a romantic component to reinvigorate some playful affection between you.Take turns deciding on an activity, but always try to choose something to do that your partner will enjoy as well. An old-fashioned dinner date may do the trick, but if you’re really trying to rekindle the romantic flame, get somewhere private with a sunset and something to share that you’ll both enjoy.

, Is there anything you used to enjoy together and don't do anymore? In particular, think of things you did together early on in your relationship. For instance, maybe you have a ritual of always choosing a bottle of wine together at the grocery store. Or maybe a particular date will come to mind that both of your especially enjoyed. Rekindle a bit of the excitement from when you first met by doing something that will bring you both back.For instance, take your partner to the place you realized you were in love with them. When you're there, tell them about it.

, Another way to reconnect with one another is scheduling an escape from your daily lives together. You don’t have to go far, but it’s worth removing yourselves from the everyday contexts in which you live.This is also a great way to facilitate important conversations, as you’ll be spending lots of time together, and will have the space to talk about anything that’s been on either of your minds.

, Even happy, healthy relationships include periods of time where the excitement that often comes with sex dwindles. This is nothing to be ashamed of or worried about - it’s something to address. Instead of waiting for a fizzling sex life to all-of-the-sudden return to how it used to be, shake things up on purpose.


Ask your partner something like, “Is there anything you’ve been wanting to try sexually?” or offer any ideas that have come to mind in personal fantasies.
As another idea for date night, swing by a safe-sex or adult novelty shop after dinner.

, Sometimes, relationships simply oscillate from a whirlwind of romance to a relatively tame, uneventful life together. This can feel like a rough patch, especially if one of you begins to worry that something is wrong. If you’ve talked about how you’re both feeling and you both still want to be together, take steps to spend more time together. One of the best ways to do so is by getting a pet.A dog is an especially good pet to raise together, as they are active and sociable. Not only will you have shared responsibilities, you’ll also have ample opportunities to have fun all together.

Start with small talk.,
Find an opening.,
Bring up a topic.,
Try some specific questions.,
Share something personal.,
Ask engaged questions.,
Allow yourself to be vulnerable.",How to Start a Deep Conversation1," You may not want to jump right into a deep discussion once you meet up with somebody. Instead, ease into it. Start with some easy conversation like, “How’s your day going?” or, ‘“How are you handling exams?” Use your small talk to build upon and lead into deeper questions.If you’re nervous to bring up a topic with someone, don’t spend all your time planning what you will say. Don’t rush right into a deep conversation. Instead, say hello, get comfortable, and settle in a bit.;
, You don't need to force a conversation. Let it develop naturally. If you have something in mind you’d like to bring up, go for it. If you don't have anything to say, then it's okay to not say anything. Wait for an opening in the conversation. This might be a lull or a moment of silence, or an appropriate time to bring up a different topic. Bring up a topic or ask a question in a casual, friendly, self-assured tone.Your conversation may reach a moment of silence or a point of redirection. Take the opportunity to bring up what you’d like to discuss.

, Once you’ve assessed whether people are ready and open to talk, now is the time. If you have a question or a topic you’d like to discuss, bring it up. You don’t need to create a segway unless you want to. If you have a question, ask it.Say, “I have a question for you guys…” or, “I’m really interested to hear your thoughts on this…”

, Part of having a deep conversation is asking great questions. You may want to start with personal questions to learn more about somebody and their experiences. For deep personal questions, ask, “What is something that brings you fulfillment?” or ask, “What is something that’s a passion of yours?”You can ask someone a meaningful question such as, “What’s a mistake you’ve made that you’ve learned a lot from?” or ask, “Have you ever experienced what you thought was a setback, yet it actually helped you move forward?”
Ask open ended questions to keep the conversation flowing. You can use the information you gain to delve into deeper subjects.

, Often, deep discussions involve talking about something personal or private. They are a way to open up to someone and share a part of yourself or have them share something with you. You might wish to talk about your childhood dreams or what your disappointments have taught you. Ask another person about their own personal experiences.Say, “I’d like to share my experience with you about my childhood” or, “I remember one time when I was really disappointed…”
Be vulnerable to some degree. It’s hard to have a deep conversation if you’re unwilling to open up and share who you are. People who are willing to be vulnerable are more likely to engage in deep conversations., If you want to start a deep conversation, it’s important to keep it going for at least some time. Show a genuine interest in the person you’re talking to and their response. You might start with one question you’ve thought to bring up, but let more flow if you’re curious. Ask the person to clarify their response or give examples. Stay curious in what they say.Ask, “What do you mean by that?” or say, “I’d like to hear more of your thoughts.”
Show that you are listening by repeating back part of what they say to you. For example, if they mention their pet's name, slipping it into the conversation at some point shows that you actually cared about what they had to say.

, It's important to allow yourself to be vulnerable in relationships. Be willing to open up to to people and share things that are personal to you. This will help to show the other person that you trust them and encourage them to open up to you."

Let your partner sleep.,
Turn the temperature down.,
Set the mood with music or ambient noise.,
Wear light (or no) clothing.,
Switch your bedding.,
Get ready for bed.",How to Sleep in a Single Bed With a Partner," Spooning is one of the most common positions for couples to try. Traditionally, the taller partner lies on their side with the shorter partner curled up along their torso and under their head. This is quite size-efficient.


This can cause the taller person to get hot, as their partner will be laying in front of their torso.
If the shorter person (often female in common heterosexual relationships) has long hair, this can be an additional source of discomfort.;
, This is a good spooning variation for when the taller partner overheats or if they are bothered by hair in their face. The shorter partner instead spoons the taller one. This can be less size-efficient but can be very helpful for temperature and hair management.

, Each persons head should be around shin or ankle level for the other person. While this isn't necessarily the most romantic (no stinky feet allowed!) it is quite size efficient and allows both partners to sleep and breathe without the breathing of the other partner interfering with them.

, The shorter partner can lie their head on the taller partner's chest directly below the shoulder.The taller partner may want to use extra pillows to elevate their head and neck area slightly so that they can breathe more easily.Raising their head will also help prevent the shorter partner's hair from bothering them.
Elevating the head will also help mitigate snoring., Assuming you are both partnered consenting adults or partnered consenting minors, you may want to consider engaging in intimacy. Sexual satisfaction releases endorphins, a ""feel good"" chemical in your brain that makes sleeping easier and helps establish a connection to your sexual partner.Of course, ideally this happened naturally and not because of reading this.

, If you understand each others sleep preferences you may be able to work out how best to approach the lack of space. While the healthiest sleep position is on your back, both partner's won't have room to do this.Discuss how much each person wants to use the covers so you can plan accordingly.

, If you are a person who goes to the toilet frequently at night, put yourself on the 'outside' of the bed. Most single beds have one side against a wall. If this isn't the case, position yourself on whichever side is closer to the restroom.

, If you wake up first, try not to wake your partner. Odds are they had less rest than usual due to sharing a single bed. If you absolutely must wake them, try to do it in a particularly gentle or pleasant way.

, Since the ideal sleep temperature is around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, one of the most common issues with sleeping together in a small bed is overheating.Turning the thermostat down or opening the window to make the room cold will make it easier - and even more enjoyable - for the two of you to get cozy.You can also use a fan that you place ice cubes in front of to cool the room., Many people sleep easier if there is gentle ambient noise or relaxing music.This may make it easier for you and your partner to sleep. Discuss first.

, Thick flannel and or fleece are terrible ideas. If you must wear clothes, aim for thin summery underwear or pajamas.You can ask your partner to borrow a pair of shorts or boxers if you don't have anything light.

, It's also a good idea to switch to a more summery duvet and blanket instead of a thick duvet. You can add or remove thinner layers to create an optimum temperature for the both of you. A thick duvet or comforter is more difficult to manipulate.

, Both of you should brush your teeth and use the bathroom. You both want to be as comfortable as possible, and using the restroom is especially important because in a single bed it is difficult for one person to get up without waking the other.


Remove items like watches and jewelry that could annoy or irritate the other person.
Put phones aside and on silent, setting an alarm for the morning if need be."

Be a great listener.,
Stay present.,
Keep it (mostly) positive.,
Give thoughtful responses.,
Let go if people don’t want to talk.",How to Start a Deep Conversation2," Instead of just listening to the words someone is saying, understand them. If you notice that you’re distracted, silence whatever distractions are grabbing your attention, such as a cellphone, music, or noise. Give the person your full attention while they are speaking and do not interrupt them. Wait your turn to speak.Use reflective listening to communicate your understanding by saying things like, “So what I hear you saying is…” or, “Let me make sure I’m understanding you...”

, Don’t jump ahead or move on too quickly. Do your best not to interrupt another person if they are talking and instead, listen thoughtfully to what they are saying. Whether you agree with their perspective or not, you can be respectful and present in your interaction.Silence your “monkey mind,” or your thoughts that bounce around or jump ahead. Stay focused and not distracted.Sometimes silences are the best part of a conversation.

, Don’t get into the habit of talking about negative or depressing topics only. If discussions tend to take a negative tone, find ways to approach them from a different angle. Bring up topics that bring you hope or that you feel curious about.If discussions start out as negative, try to bring them full circle and ask, “What can we do to change this? Where can we discover hope or perseverance in this situation?”

, It’s not enough just to bring up deep topics; sustaining the conversation takes effort from whoever is involved. Pause and consider what the other person has said before you respond. Respond with a statement, story, or question that helps tie in what they said with something you’d like to add to the conversation.Find ways to interact in new ways about whatever is being talked about. Some deep conversations meander from one topic to another, while others stay pointedly focused.

, If you bring up a deep conversation and people are not interested in discussing it, let it go. Don’t try to continue talking if people are not interested. You may want to start a discussion at a different time or with different people.It’s okay to let a conversation fade out if people are uninterested in talking about it.

Make time to talk.,
Find other people who enjoy deep conversations.,
Refrain from speaking with a large group.",How to Start a Deep Conversation3," It takes time to build towards a deep conversation. If you want to have a deep conversation, choose a good time. Don’t go for it when people are partying or distracted by other things. Make sure people feel at ease and aren’t about to leave for classes, work, or other obligations.Don’t excessively plan when to have a deep conversation, however. There should be a level of flow so it’s not contrived.

, Think about who would be willing and open to having deep conversations with you. Who might be curious and thoughtful in a similar way as yourself? Can you think of a friend, family member, or partner who would enjoy these discussions? These people may be open to asking questions and engaging beyond normal conversations.Generally, you want to work up to having deep conversations. It may be inappropriate or too soon to attempt having a deep conversation with someone whom you’ve just met.

, It might be best to bring up deep topics when you’re casually hanging out with one friend or a small group of friends. Don’t try to bring up a deep topic with a large group as people might get bored, distracted, or not feel like they have an opportunity to talk. Instead, focus on people you think may be open and willing to talk.You might have one friend you’d like to have deep discussions with or a group of friends. Figure out who you’d like to speak with.

Tell your man how much you love him.,
Encourage him.,
Communicate like a champ.,
Learn to compromise.,
Learn to say you're sorry.",How to Show Your Love to Your Boyfriend1," Seriously. Though your man will claim you're being too mushy, if you're at the ""I love you"" stage, don't forget to tell him that you love him every day. Show him that you mean it by keeping eye contact and touching him lightly. Remember that there's a big difference between saying ""Love ya!"" and ""I love you."";
, If you want your man to know that you love him, then you should encourage him to achieve his goals every day, whether they are big or small. Being there to support and encourage him the night before a big exam or a job interview will show him how much you care and want him to succeed.


If he's not feeling confident, list all of the things that make him great, and all of the reasons that he'll succeed.
If he has a big event coming up, leave him a sweet note to wish him luck.
Push him to do something out of his comfort zone. If he wants to train for a marathon but isn't sure that he can do it, you can tell him that he can accomplish anything (within reason) if he really puts his mind to it.

, Communication is key in any relationship. If you want your man to know how much you love him, then you need to be able to communicate honestly and clearly. Taking the time to check in and make sure that you're on the same page will help your relationship grow even stronger. Here's how you do it:


Don't yell or argue. Instead of yelling or arguing, learn to state your side of the story and wait for a response.
Learn to listen. Communication is a two way street, so take the time to slow down and understand your boyfriend's perspective instead of interrupting and focusing on your own feelings.
Be honest. Be honest about how you're really feeling instead of being passive aggressive. Let him know what's on your mind.
Pick the right time and place to have a serious talk. If you have something important to discuss, don't just blurt it out in a public place, but wait for the right moment when you both have time to sit down and really have a conversation.

, You can show your boyfriend that you care by making it clear that being happy is more important than being right. You and your boyfriend need to learn how to work together to make decisions, big or small. You need to learn to factor him into all of your decisions, and to be able to concede some of the time.


Before a big decision, sit down with your man and write down all of the pros and cons of your two plans. Discuss which plan is best overall, and which will make the two of you the most happy collectively.
Make sure that both people are compromising. Don't always give in to his needs, and don't let him give in to yours all the time.
Take turns, even on the small things. If you picked the dinner location on your date, let him pick the movie.

, If you want your man to know how much you love him, then you need to learn how to be responsible for your mistakes. If you've made a mistake, let him know how truly sorry you are by saying the words like you really mean them, and assuring him that you feel terrible for hurting him. If you're too stubborn to say you're sorry, the relationship won't last.


You should also learn to accept his apologies. You can fume a little bit, but understand that he feels terrible and don't hold a grudge, or you'll never be able to move forward.

Do little favors for him.,
Don't force him to do things he hates to do.,
Learn to love to do what he does -- some of the time.,
Be the person he has the most fun with.",How to Show Your Love to Your Boyfriend2," A few little favors can go a long way. Doing small favors for your man is a great way to show your love for him, especially when he's in a pinch. The favors may be small, but they'll add up. Here are some favors that you can do for him:


If he's having a busy day at work, bring him his lunch, if you can. He'll appreciate it.
Do his laundry from time to time. Just make sure he doesn't take advantage of you -- if you do his laundry, make sure he does yours.
Cook him a nice big dinner when he's having a long and stressful day. All he'll have to do is enjoy it and do the dishes afterward.
Run small errands for him if he needs some help. If you're already doing to the mall, offer to return one of his shirts for him.

, Though all great relationships are built through compromise, this does not mean that you have to drag your boyfriend out of the house to make him do a ton of things that don't interest him at all. Of course, he won't love every last thing you do together, but you can work to make sure you don't make him suffer too much when you go out.


Don't drag him to see a chick flick unless you're really dying to see it and none of your girlfriends will go with you.
Don't force him to take a yoga or dance class with you just to prove how sensitive he is -- unless he thinks it sounds like fun.
Don't make him meet your family until he's ready. If you've only been dating for a few months, he may take meeting your family very seriously, so you shouldn't force him to have an awkward sit-down dinner with your mom if the two of you are just getting to know each other.
Don't force him to move too fast. Don't ""persuade"" him to move in with you, go on long trips with you, or pose for 100 photos you'll post on Facebook if he's not ready. Each relationship moves at its own pace, and if you do this, he won't feel loved -- he'll feel smothered.

, Though he can't expect you to be cheering in the front row of every MMA fight, if you really want to show him your love, you'll have to enjoy some of the things that are important to him. Don't force yourself to do anything that sounds terrible, but take the time to get to know and love things related to his hobbies and interests. Here are a few ideas:


Embrace his favorite sports teams. You don't have to get a tattoo of Coco Crisp on your face just because your boyfriend loves the Oakland A's -- but you should try to watch some baseball games with him, whether they're live or on TV. If you're not big on sports, just be open-minded and give sports a chance before you decide you just can't watch them.
Embrace his tastes. Be open-minded and offer to go to a concert of your boyfriend's favorite band even if you haven't heard of it. If he's obsessed with sushi but you've never tried it, give the fish a chance.
Just remember to maintain your identity. In any healthy and long relationship, the tastes of both members of a couple may naturally converge, but this doesn't mean you have to drop all of your interests and become a clone of your boyfriend. In fact, that will be a major turn-off.

, This is an important point. If you really want your boyfriend to know how much you love him, then you should be the person he wants to spend the most time with and the person he has the most fun with. A lot of guys consider their ""bro time"" to be the most fun and crazy time of their lives, and then come back to you, the sweet girlfriend, expecting you to make them a delicious meal and help cure their hangovers, but this is not the way to do it.


Well, if you really want him to know you care, you need to work to be the person that he has the crazy nights with -- you'll just have to nurse your hangovers together.
Though you don't have to be loud and crazy, he should look forward to time with you as being fun, silly, and the best time he'll have.

Don't be jealous.,
Be cool with his friends.,
Give him time to do his own thing.,
Keep things positive.",How to Show Your Love to Your Boyfriend3," Your boyfriend won't think you love him just because you obsess over his ex-girlfriends or any girls who come within a twenty-foot radius of his person. Instead, he'll just think you're insecure about the relationship, and he'll be annoyed and won't want to hang out with you. If you want to be a cool girlfriend, have faith in your great relationship and don't be freaked out if you see him talking to another girl.


Don't get jealous if your boyfriend and his buddies talk about another girl. Hey, if the girl is hot, you can admit it too. As long as your boyfriend isn't making creepy comments (and why would he?), you should show that you can appreciate a beautiful woman, too.
If any time another girl comes up, you jump to criticize her looks, her weight, or the outfit she wore last Tuesday, you will just come off as looking really insecure. Instead, show that you know you're beautiful but that you're not the only woman in the world, and admit that the other girl is a cool chick.
Don't be mean or snooty to his female friends. If you're being a crazy girlfriend, they'll report back to your man.
Don't snoop through your boyfriend's phone or Facebook to see if he's been chatting it up with other girls. If he finds out, then he won't be able to trust you.

, You'll have a path straight to your man's heart if you're cool with his bros. Seriously. If his friends love you, then they'll actually want to hang out with you, and won't think you're just another one of those possessive girlfriends who won't let her man be any fun.


Take the time to get to know them. If they're receptive, ask them about their lives. Show that you see them as individuals, not just as the guys who hang around your boyfriend.
Don't get upset if the guys are overly obnoxious. Just let them be themselves. You don't want them to feel like they're hanging out with their mom all of a sudden.
If you want to be cool with your man's bros, then don't hang out if you're not wanted. Don't intrude on an obvious ""guys only"" night, or sit through a male activity just because you don't want to let your man out of your sight. If you're cool with letting him have his man time, then the guys will be much happier to see you when you're around at the right times.

, If you want your man to see how much you love him, then you need to show him that you respect him as an individual and want to give him time to do his own thing and to be his own person. He won't be able to grow if you're clinging to his side twenty-four hours a day. Plus, if he spends a bit more time apart from you, he'll appreciate the time he spends with you even more.


Understand the meaning of ""me time."" If your guy wants to read, go for a run, or just spend some time alone watching TV, don't ask if you can come along.
Don't check in on him every five seconds. If he's out with friends or just hanging solo, don't call or text him every ten minutes to make sure he's okay. This will make you look possessive -- or even obsessive.
Let him spend time with other friends and family. Don't ask to tag along to every last social item on his agenda.
Don't forget to do your own thing. While your man is out with his friends or pursuing his interests, make sure that you have friends and interests of your own, too. You don't want him to think that he's the only good thing in your life.

, Don't spend all of your time together nagging and whining. You're allowed to have a bad day, but your man should feel like your equal, not your therapist. He should cherish the time he spends with you and think of it as a fun, positive experience, instead of as a cross to bear. If you want him to see how much you love him, then you should keep things positive as much as you can.


Make an effort to smile more. It will brighten your face as well as your man's day.
Be goofy and show off your sense of humor. You and your man should be able to spend hours just being silly.
Make a rule of thumb: for every one complaint, you should mention at least five things you're excited about. This will make your man more excited about hanging out with you, and more excited about your future together. He'll know you love him because you'll be in a good mood when you're together.

"

Be adventurous together.,
Make time for romance.,
Keep things fresh in the bedroom.",How to Show Your Love to Your Boyfriend4," To avoid getting stuck in the same old routine, you and your man need to put on your cowboy boots and ride off into uncharted territory. Ok, so not really -- but you should try new things that take you out of your comfort zones, which will make you learn new things and grow together in the process.


Try hiking, mountain climbing, or just exploring nature together. If your guy doesn't like hiking, find an outdoorsy activity where he can show off his skills, like camping or biking.
Try exotic foods together. Pick a restaurant that serves the cuisine of a country you've never even heard of, and indulge in the taste and unique cuisines together.
Go on an adventure. This could mean taking a vacation to a fun and crazy spot, or just going in your car and driving for two hours to check out a waterfall or a weird haunted house. You can even close your eyes and point to a map, and go wherever your finger falls. It's all about the journey here.

, If you want to keep your relationship fresh, then you have to make time for romance with your man, no matter how long you've been together. Some guys don't like the unmanly term ""date night,"" but you should still make sure to spend at least one day each week hanging out and doing romantic things together, such as cooking a meal over candlelight, or going out to a wine bar.


If you both dress up, you'll feel like the moment is even more special.
There's no need to get too mushy during ""date night"" -- whatever you do together, make sure your man is actually enjoying himself, and not just doing his boyfriend-ly duty to keep you happy.

, Another way to show your man your love is to keep things fresh in the bedroom. You shouldn't have sex just because he wants to, but because you're excited to get it on with your man. Let him know how much you want to make love, and keep things fresh by always trying something new.


Make love in new positions. Don't do the same old thing you've been doing -- try something completely new. As long as it still feels good, you'll be kicking your sex life up a notch.
Make love in new places. The bed isn't the only place where you can make love. If you're in the mood, make love on your couch, on your floor, or even in a secluded location. This will make the process feel illicit and he'll see how much you love him even more.
If you really want to show your love to your boyfriend, then be respectful if he doesn't love to cuddle for hours after sex. You can spend some time in bed with him after you do the deed, but don't force him to be there until he gets so bored he falls asleep.

Think about conversation topics that might interest your relative.,
Be polite.,
Compliment the chef.,
Talk about a new movie coming out, a local festival due soon or a sporting event about to happen.,
Talk with everyone you can at the table, so that nobody feels left out.,
Talk about things or people you have in common.,
Avoid seeming dismissive of others.,
Help to pass the food around.,
Help clean up.,
Consider taking the kids off the parents' hands for a time.,
Offer to accompany family members home.",How to Socialize at Family Reunions," Consider telling them a bit more about what you've been up to. For example: an award you recently received, a new teacher/lecturer at your school or college, a new style that everybody is wearing, which of your hobbies you like the most, and so forth.;
, You don't have to be entirely familiar with your relative to be polite. Just avoid topics that might be touchy, be respectful of their opinions and avoid arguing the point on anything.


Be considerate as well as being polite. For example, if a relative recently passed that Uncle Larry was close to, don't say anything that might stir up bad memories.

, Make a reference about the food you are eating. It's a common task that can take the conversation far. It will often draw in others too, as they won't want to appear remiss in mentioning the chef.

, Current events are ways to get family to talk about opinions or experiences, as well as discussing whether they're going or not. It's also a great way to find out what other events are coming up, as they'll share the things they're planning to do that haven't been mentioned yet.

, This can ease a bit of tension, by allowing others to contribute to the conversation. In particular, look for the quiet ones who seem willing to say something but need prompting, out of shyness, fear or uncertainty.

, This is a great conversation topic that really can get things moving. Asking after what a mutual friend/neighbor or person is now doing can be a great way to connect various people and to lead into further discussions.

, If people wish to talk about something that you're not that interested in, make an effort to appear interested for at least a short time. You can change the subject after it's clear that they've said their piece and feel heard, not before.

, Offer to hand out food when people are seated elsewhere than at the table. When at the table, pass food promptly and considerately so that everyone gets a share. It's another good excuse to talk too, as you can ask how they like the food, what their favorite foods are and whether they'd like more.

, Offer to do the dishes, put things away, clear up, etc. Encourage others to help too. It's a good way of having a chance to natter with those who are helping with you and to get the cleaning up done quickly, so that everyone can get back to conversing together. Do not leave the chef all alone in the kitchen, unless he or she prefers it that way.

, If some of your family members are parents of small children, offer to play a game with the kids outside or in another room, to give the parents a break and a chance to chat with the rest of the family without constant interruptions. You'll get to spend time with the kids and you'll get lots of appreciation and respect from the parents.

, If there are members of your family who need assistance for any reason, offer to walk them home, drive them home or even catch public transportation with them. It's a kind gesture and you'll get to spend some one-on-one time with them to learn more about them.

Pay the bills.,
Generally, women love responsible men.,
Help Out around the house often.,
Buy her gifts occasionally.,
Tell her you love her.,
Pay her compliments.,
Kiss her often.,
Do a little more touching.,
Look at her often.,
Treat her every now and then.",How to Show Affection to Your Wife," If your wife is struggling, maybe lost a job, things not well at work. Shock her and pay the bills. Don't complain about it though, otherwise it doesn't mean anything. Also remember, you got married, so what's yours is hers. Make as if it doesn't affect you. She will notice that you not complaining and love you more..;
, The fact that she sees you working to take care of and provide for her and the family shows her that you care for her needs enough to provide them. So grind out that job, and pay for your woman’s needs.

, When the chores threaten to overwhelm her, whenever she’s feeling ill, down with pregnancy, or downright not just in the mood, lending a helping hand is a small, sweet way to be affectionate to your wife.

, An occasional flower, box of chocolate, or a nice scarf you ‘happened to see outside and thought would look nice on her’ while on the outside is seemingly trivial, is actually a nice way to show your affection for your wife, and will ensure that you’re the only thing she’d think about for a long while.

, Nothing beats being straight about it. Periodically remind her of how much you love and care for her.

, Remind her in small, nice ways of how beautiful she is. If she’s got a new hairdo, buys a new dress or changes her looks a bit, compliment it a little on that. Paying attention to noticing such small things goes a long way towards showing your affection.

, Kiss her as often as you get the chance. Doesn’t necessarily mean going French all the time but you could just attempt nice little, playful kisses, pecks, and back-of-the-hand kissing. Kiss her in the morning when she wakes up in the morning too (morning bad breath and all). Let her wake up to you staring at her sleep. Smile at her, and then go in for a nibbling kiss. Kiss her also at night, just before you go to bed. She’s sure to drown by your affection this way.

, Learn to be comfortable holding her hand, in public and else; touching her, letting her touch you in return; letting her lean on you as she sleeps; holding her when she cries or is feeling down. These are sure ways to let you affectionate juices flow. Just be a little bit moderate and don’t overdo. Only, seize every chance as it comes.

, Wives like it when their husbands LOOK at them, as opposed to looking at other women. Take time each day to examine your wife’s outlook, from head to toe if possible. Look at her when unclad; look at her fully-clothed. Take time to examine your wife’s figure. And let her catch you doing it. You’ll be rewarded with that bashful, shy smile and the inception in your wife’s consciousness of the knowledge that however old she is she’s still sexy enough to warrant your visual attention.

, There's absolutely nothing wrong with spoiling your woman a little, especially if she's your life partner. Treat her to special surprises once in a while: a fancy trip, a shopping card, an all-expense-paid spa treatment, a romantic candlelight dinner. She's sure to love you forever with a truckload of these coming in occasionally

Realize that boundary-setting promotes self-love and respect.,
Identify what you like and don’t like about this relationship.,
Figure out when the lines were crossed in this relationship.,
Learn about yourself.",How to Set Boundaries with a Clingy Person Recovering from Abuse1," No matter your relationship with the other person, you have one special relationship that you are obliged to nourish and protect: your relationship with yourself. The act of setting boundaries is a matter of self-respect and protection as doing so ensures that the relationships around you are fulfilling and nurturing—not manipulative or exhausting.Have confidence in your decision to set personal boundaries, even though the process may feel like a betrayal to your loved one at first. Keep in mind that your ability to successfully set healthy boundaries will actually benefit your abused loved one in the end.
While you may feel guilty at first, remind yourself that it is not your responsibility to solve your loved one's problems. This is work that they must do themselves with the support of a therapist. This does not mean you can't listen to them and support them, but it does mean they can't expect you to be available 24/7.;
, Contemplate the specific characteristics of the other person that are energizing for you, and those that are draining. Victims of abuse may take on a victim mentality in which they come off as constantly complaining or helpless, even when they don’t realize it. As a result, the relationship may feel one-sided and unfulfilling.


Make a list of the characteristics of this relationship that are both undesirable and desirable. Pay close attention to the traits you list that are negative as these will shed insight into where you’ll want to start drawing boundary lines. For instance, you might dislike the fact that you seem to have to spend all your free time with this person., Pinpointing when your boundaries were crossed can help you recognize your limitations in the relationship. This will guide you in forming healthy boundaries with your loved one in the future.


For instance, was your relationship with this person always characterized by their neediness, or did the clingy behavior arise after a certain event? Perhaps you were able to tolerate the clinginess up to a certain point until it became more apparent or worsened in some way., Solitude is an exercise in self-knowledge and clarity. When you are constantly enmeshed in relationships or in the presence of others, it becomes difficult to distinguish your own decisions from those that have been influenced by others. Solo time gives you the opportunity to act in your best interests without having to react or respond to others. Solitude can benefit not just your relationships but your psychological health, too.Screen your calls for a few days, only taking those which can be classified as urgent.
Engage in activities that you find life-giving or indulgent such as visiting a spa, eating at a nice restaurant, or snuggling in bed with a book all day.
Plan a weekend getaway to a nearby city or rural area to explore a new place. Reflect on how your itinerary differs because no one else is with you.

Do the prep work.,
Find a comfortable spot.,
Start slowly.,
Make intermittent eye contact.,
Ask her how she wants it done.,
Begin massaging harder.,
Show that you're enjoying it.,
Kiss her feet.,
Ask her if you can massage the rest of her.",How to Seduce a Woman With a Foot Massage," If you're planning to give your girl a foot massage, then odds are she's tired. It's time to be her knight in shining armor. Make or order dinner, do the dishes, and clean the living room. If your girl suddenly finds herself sitting comfortably in her favorite seat while you bring her food, clean the house, and refuse to let her lift a finger to help, she will soon start thinking warm, happy thoughts - starring you!;
, Assuming she's already agreed to the foot massage, your next step is to determine the setting. The bed is probably a bit too obvious, although that may be your eventual destination; try the couch instead. Prop her head and neck up with pillows, then sit down and put her feet in your lap.

, Gently use your middle finger and thumb to ever-so-softly massage her heel, the ball of her foot, and her toes sliding your index finger one by one between each toe. Spend about five minutes on each foot- it will pay off soon!

, She will be watching you the whole time, so the expression on your face and the direction of your gaze are both important factors. Watch her feet while you massage them, making sure to keep a tiny hint of a smile on your face (this smile may take some practice in front of a mirror. Most people's idea of a small smile is all but undetectable by others. You want your girl to know you're enjoying it - and also to know that you want more). Occasionally look into her eyes. As you do, allow your smile to widen a little, and part your lips slightly (again, the mirror is indispensable. Practice makes perfect).

, ""Harder or softer?"" is your ideal question. If you're doing Step 3 right, she will almost certainly answer ""harder."" When she does, listen to her tone of voice. Is she beginning to sense your intentions, and if so, does she sound excited or tired? If she's excited, then the game is yours. If she's tired, there is still hope, but you'll be fighting an uphill battle from here.

, By now her tendons will be loose and she will probably be ready for more. Begin using your thumb, fingers, and especially the ""heel"" of your hand to massage her firmly. Firmly, but not TOO firmly! Now isn't the time to prove your manly strength. There is nothing so likely to kill your girl's sex drive as a sudden pinch in a sore spot that sends her leaping off the couch, never to trust you with her feet again. Avoid massaging the middle section of her feet entirely, as this area contains sensitive bones and tendons. Instead, concentrate on the heel, ball and toes (gently with the toes!). Spend another five minutes here.

, Make small murmurs (a deep, quietly whispered ""Mmmm"" works beautifully) and widen your smile to a grin at intervals, to show your girl that you're fully appreciating every interaction with her body.

, As always, timing is an enormous factor. Don't start the massage with a big sloppy toe-sucking fest, because unless your girl is in the mood to jump into bed right away, she will most likely find that sort of behavior annoying. Make sure you've fully completed the previous steps first, then ask her if she's enjoying the massage. She will almost certainly say yes (what else CAN she say without being rude?). If she does, slip off the couch, get down on your knees, and gently kiss her feet a few times. Look up and ask, ""How are you enjoying it now?"" Her response is unlikely to be anything but positive. Keep kissing her feet for at least another minute, but avoid using tongue or putting her toes in your mouth unless you include this as a normal part of your sexual routine. Otherwise it might freak her out.

, This is a big step, so be sure to word the question in a way that lets her know exactly what you want. It won't be too difficult at this point; simply saying, ""Can I massage the rest of you?"" might just work wonders on its own. If you think she's in the mood and you want to try something a little more seductive, say, ""The rest of you looks tired too. Can I take care of that for you?"" If she says yes, you've got it in the bag. ""Oh... darn. Your clothes are in the way...."" You get the idea.

Understanding more about how people's situations can change, for example being made redundant, having their home repossessed, having more children than they can afford to look after etc makes people poor, and or homeless will hopefully help you to treat everyone with respect.

, Don't talk to them, let them talk to you. Strive to understand poor people. The biggest thing that insults poor people, and other groups such as disabled people, or people who have differences is to be ignored, taken for granted, or, worse, stigmatized.

Lean towards “I” statements.,
Do not be defensive.When standing up for yourself, try to state facts.,
Remember you decide the worthiness of your thoughts.,
Explain cultural or lifestyle differences.,
Stay calm.,
Let others speak.,
Summarize another’s thoughts.,
Ask questions.",How to Stand Up for Yourself Without Hurting Someone's Feelings," Being assertive means you stand up for yourself and share your thoughts and feelings with others. You do not want to hurt others with your words. Instead, you want to make your point known. Aggressive language occurs when you belittle others. You might be proving your point at the expense of another.Assertive communication would be: “Gretchen, I would like you to be more open to my personal situation at present. My brother is sick so I cannot come to practice as often.” See be assertive for more tips.
Aggressive communication would be: “Gretchen, you’re such a mean girl. I don’t know how anyone could be so insensitive when another person has a very sick brother. Don’t you have a heart?”;
, Stand tall with your shoulders back. Don't slouch or lean against a wall. Keep your head high and look people in their eyes. Rather than crossing your arms, keep them at your sides or even on your hips. If sitting, keep your legs uncrossed with your feet planted firmly on the floor.

, Instead of using the accusatory “you,” frame your responses with “I.” For example, “I feel hurt when you ignore my needs” rather than “You always forget that I need a ride.” By keeping the focus on “I,” you are less likely to issue blame. Instead, you open a dialogue., Do not just defend yourself. For example, saying, “Gretchen, you’re being unfair!” will be ineffective. Although it is important to say when someone hurts your feelings, explain why. Saying that you’re sad helps if people know the reason. Try the following:


You might say, “Gretchen, I feel like you do not understand why I miss practice so often. My brother is very sick and my family travels twice a week one hour to visit him in the hospital. I want to be committed to the team but right now, my brother is more important. I hope you can understand.”

, If someone is belittling you, realize that no one can make your thoughts worthless.If you think them, they are valuable. That does not mean they are always right. Thus, be aware of the full situation and try to keep an open mind.

, Not every disagreement needs to be resolved. Occasionally, you can explain simply from where you’re coming. Some level of disagreement is completely normal in every relationship.For example, perhaps your religion forbids alcohol and for this reason, you don’t want alcohol served at a joint birthday party. Although your friend might disagree, if she realizes the theme is important for religious reasons, she might be more inclined to agree.

, When having conflicts with others, take a deep breath. Do not react immediately. Make sure that you are calm enough to discuss a situation rationally.


If you are not calm and ready to discuss a situation, say so. For example, ""Please give me a five minute break. Then I can return to this situation.""
Try counting to ten while breathing low from your diaphragm. Let your breath out slowly.

, When you are having a conflict with someone, hear that person’s side of the story. Do not interrupt. Even if you need to stick up for yourself, you will be more aware of the person’s perspective. This will help you communicate more effectively.


Do not dismiss others’ thoughts as nonsense.That is aggressive and unproductive behavior.
Show that you are listening through verbal and visual cues. Nod your head and look the person in her eyes.Offer verbal responses like “right,” “yes,” “mhmm.”

, After your conversation partner has finished speaking, repeat what you have heard. This will help prevent any misunderstandings. It will also demonstrate that you are trying to understand the other person.


For example, you might say: “Gretchen, what I hear you saying is that you think I am the weak link on our soccer team. I do not come to practice as much as you like. Is that right?”

, After your friend has explained her position, take the time to clarify any questions or doubts you might have. Asking questions shows deeper interest than simply accepting what another person says. Additionally, if a person is hesitant to share her view, ask her questions specifically:You might say: “Gretchen, I’ve noticed that you seem frustrated with me. Have I done something to offend you?"" Gretchen might not be mad that you're the weakest player on the team. She could be annoyed by your lack of attendance. She might see real potential in you and be frustrated that you are not committing as much as you could.

You might alert this person ahead of time that you would like to have a candid discussion about the state of your relationship.For instance, you might say, “Hey, Katie, when you have a spare moment, I’d really like for us to talk about our friendship. I want to get some things off my chest and work with you to improve the state of our relationship.”
Part of recovery for your loved one is to regain self-empowerment, self-control, and become independent. Setting boundaries allows them to do that. If you fail to set boundaries with them, this may enable them to become too dependent on you and neglect the work they need to do.

, Once you are face-to-face with the other person, the process of communicating your boundaries will likely feel intimidating. You can take some pressure off yourself and cushion the other person’s feelings by carefully framing the discussion. Use “I” statements that focus on your own thoughts and feelings and minimize the possibility of the other person acting defensively.Say something along the lines of, “""I value our time together, but I feel like I need extra time to focus on myself. I may not be able to spend as much with you during the week so I can focus on my own needs and goals.”
Be careful to avoid blaming “you” statements in your explanation. Additionally, you might say, “I know you like having company and need support, but I could really use some space. I think it would be a great idea if we started setting aside specific times to spend together. This will even give you a chance to spend time with other family and friends.”

, A person recovering from abuse likely has little experience with healthy boundaries, so they may take your boundary-setting as a personal affront despite your use of “I” statements. Be sure to add in remarks about how much you value the person and the relationship to assure your loved one that you are not “breaking up” with them, per se.


Assure the person that wanting to set boundaries doesn't mean you are rejecting them. They may resist setting boundaries because they trust you and consider you a safe person, and they don't want to lose that. You can say something like, ""Setting boundaries is going to make our relationship healthier and stronger.""
For example, you might say, “You are one of my closest friends and I really care about you. I just want to make sure our relationship is a healthy one.”, Now that you have informed the person of your personal boundaries, you will need to round out the discussion by explaining the consequences of violating them. As you are coming up with consequences, be reasonable. Avoid listing anything that you won’t feel comfortable enforcing.Consequences might be communicated by saying, “Our relationship means the world to me, but I don’t want to stand by and watch you miss out on other fulfilling relationships because you are clinging to me. If you try to drop by or call me on our “off” days, I will remind you of our predetermined schedule and refer you to another friend.”
The person will likely act outraged and say something to the effect of “But what if I have a crisis? What kind of friend would do that?” In response, say, “A caring friend will make sure that you have someone else to talk to. That’s exactly what I will do.”, As challenging as it is to set personal boundaries, the real battle begins when the lines are crossed. In order to preserve your boundaries, you must consistently follow through on the agreed upon consequences no matter how hard it feels to do so.Remind yourself that enforcing your own boundaries helps this person understand boundary violations. Following through on your consequences also models the healthy behavior that you hope your loved one will someday adopt.
For instance, you might say, ""I know it seems like I am being unfair, but I am setting these boundaries for the benefit of our relationship. I have to follow through.""

Inform your loved one of the importance of boundaries.,
Assist your loved one in identifying and setting clear boundaries.,
Encourage them to share their boundaries with others.,
Be patient and empathetic.",How to Set Boundaries with a Clingy Person Recovering from Abuse3," As you gain confidence in preserving your own personal boundaries, you might casually suggest to your loved one how beneficial they are. Setting boundaries helps overcome a victim mentality by empowering the individual to stand up for their personal rights and privacy.


If your relationship has improved due to boundary-setting, you might highlight the change by saying, “See how much more fun we have together when we see each other less often? Plus, I’ve noticed that you have started spending more time with your Mom and your sister. That’s awesome!”

, If your loved one feels inspired by your own boundary-setting journey, you might offer to help them do the same. Depending on how close your relationship is with the other person, you may be able to pinpoint a specific relationship in which their boundaries may be crossed. Start there.You might say, “I noticed that your girlfriend insults you when she is mad. How does that make you feel?” If the person seems ready to change the negative behavior, you might say, “It might help to tell her that whenever she insults you, you will immediately let her know that you feel disrespected and would like to discontinue the discussion until it is safe to resume.”

, Victims of abuse may go about boundary-setting in the same way they would if they were starting to walk—slow and shaky. They may not feel up to it, but suggest that they share their boundaries with others in their life. Offer your support by allowing the person to practice rehearsing their boundary-setting conversations with you.


It may also help to practice reinforcing their boundaries in your own relationship with the person. For instance, if your roommate sets a boundary that no one should go in their room, admit to violating this boundary to see if the person will enforce their consequences., People who are recovering from abuse often suffer from low self-esteem and may appear fragile.They require dependable support. However, in order to protect your own boundaries, you must remember to hold them at a distance while still being understanding. Give your friend time to adjust to setting boundaries, and show your enthusiasm for them practicing this necessary form of self-love.


You might say, “I overheard your conversation with Dad last night about going through your things. I am really impressed to hear that you are enforcing your boundaries, even in small ways. Way to go!”

Think about why you lied about your pet; some of the examples below may help.,
Otherwise, the reason you probably did not tell your friends about the pet is that they would have reacted badly.,
A very good friend will probably be hurt the most, but at the same time should be the most understanding.

,
A co-worker or ""school buddy"" who you are close to, but do not see outside of your school/workplace, may be offended as well.,
Acquaintances, or people you talk to but do not know very well, are probably not a big deal.,
Recognize how much you lied to keep your pet a secret.,
If you lied a great deal, and involved several emotional factors in your lies (""I would never own a pet, my aunt Grace owned a dog and it nearly killed my cousin...""), it will be extremely hard to back out of.

,
If you kept things quiet with many lies, but not ones tied to emotional things (""Ugh, I don't know why people would spend good money on a rodent that lives in a cage.,
If the cover-up was simply, ""Um, how about we hang out at your house today?,
Do not make it a big deal.,
Bring the blame onto yourself before your friends can.,
Make the issue about the lies, not the pet itself.",How to Reveal the Secret that You Have a Pet,"


Your friends are all very strict about rules; perhaps you are not allowed to keep a pet, so you hid it from them and your family, because you were afraid they might tell.
One or more of your friends has commented that keeping pets is a waste of time/inhumane/pointless/expensive/etc.. You did not agree and got a pet, but did not want to face criticism.
One or more friends has had problems with pets in the past/dislikes animals/is not a tree hugger, but has some other reason to not want you to own a pet (usually personal and emotional).
You have had bad experiences with pets in the past, and now know you can properly take care of one, but you do not want your friends to criticize or tease you about your past pets.
It was you who once called owning a pet inhumane or pointless, but have come to change your ways and now want a pet of your own, and don't want your friends to call you out on it.;
, Maybe your Vegan friend said that all ownership of animals is cruel and she wouldn't speak to anyone who owned one; maybe you are afraid your very ""goody-goody"" friend will tell your parents, ""for your own good,"" or maybe you just don't want your building manager to find out. Pinpoint your problem, and then move on.

,, The problem is that these people, who do not know you as well as your best friends, will be less understanding.

, Because you are not close, they may not even know if you have a pet or not, and probably don't care that much. Be warned, acquaintances are most likely to jump in on gossip if things to badly., The more you lied, the harder it will be to fix things.

,,""), it will be easier to smooth things over. Friends will be far more offended if you lied about things with emotional value then if it was just a ""dry"" lie.

, Mine is really dirty,"" things will go much easier for you. If you never specifically said you didn't own a pet, then letting people know is easier.

, If you have lied a lot about your pet, this will be much harder. You should try to make the revealing of your secret pet as much of a deal as the lying was. This means that if you only lied a little about your pet, the revealing should also be a small ordeal. If you lied a lot, the telling should be a bigger deal.


This is only because of how your friends might see you. Think about it: Someone makes up hugely fantastic lies about how much they hate pets, how much they would never ever keep one, nobody can ever go to their house because the carpets are always being cleaned, etc. And then they walk up one day and say, ""Hey, I have a pet rat. No big deal."" This would seem very odd to you, and make you feel as if you were played, because the person had no problem with lying to you, and has no problem letting you know that he has been lying to you all along.
If you lied a lot, be more emotional with the telling. It is a good idea to be a little embarrassed and ashamed about it.

, This is the same concept as compliment fishing: If you insult yourself first, people are far more likely (especially girls) to rush in and tell you how wrong you are, that you are really just the best person in the world. If you act very angry with yourself, say how sorry you are about keeping it from them, how much you really feel bad about it all, and how you wish you could make it up, your friends are more likely to accept it and move on. Above all, say and do things that will achieve the following effects:


Your friends will feel sorry for you because you are so hard on yourself
They will feel you are punishing yourself enough
They know you feel bad about lying and really do want to make it up
They know how big of a deal this is for you.

A good way to achieve this is saying the following (with variations suitable to the situation):
""I'll make up lying to you - how about I take us out for dinner?""
""I seriously would never lie to you, but I was worried about what you might say.""
""I feel really, really bad about keeping *pet name* secret.""
""I'll never lie again, really, not about anything ever.""
And so on. If you let them blame you first, you have lost the advantage. The most you can do is accept it without argument, which is more likely to make them feel sorry for you.




, If you can draw the issue away from Fluffy and onto the lies, your friends are more likely to forget the argument about the pet itself and focus on you. This may seem like a bad idea, but if you follow the steps above and get your friends to feel sorry for you, you will be far better off.


Remember that even if they stop talking to you, most friends really won't abandon you just because of a pet. Your friends, especially girls, will shun you for a while to make sure you know you hurt them. With enough begging, the argument will quickly end.

, Earning back trust can take a long time, depending on whom you've hurt. For some people who hold high standards and deep grudges, it can take a lifetime but you don't need to judge yourself by their inability to forgive. Just keep being trustworthy around them and your own account is settled, whatever choice they make.

Quite possibly, this other person hurt you dearly. You'll want to grow from this situation by turning lemons into lemonade, but to do so, you should take a little time for yourself.


In the heat of the moment, your emotions can cloud your judgment. That means that it's hard to think straight, and you could end up saying things that aren't exactly helpful in fixing the situation. How you feel is very important, and it's a big part of regaining trust, but it's also not productive if you don't step away for a little bit.
It's going to be hard not to think about what happened, but try to. At least for a little while. Do something so engaging that you become completely enthralled in the now — go away to a cabin by the lake with your friends, go rock climbing and sweat a little, or have a great conversation with a total stranger. For the time being, forget what happened.;
, You are a victim of the circumstances, but don't become the victim.Do you see the difference? The victim of circumstance understands that the betrayal of trust was one incident, while the victim feels like the entire relationship — all the good along with the bad — is now affected. The victim of circumstance wants to get over the incident; the victim wants to wallow in the pain that the other person caused them. Staying the victim sets up a big roadblock to regaining trust in someone.

, Especially after a betrayal in a relationship, it's easy to feel like the world is being turned upside down and you're in a free fall, disconnected from everything you thought you knew. It's a very disheartening feeling. But it's not the truth. There's still plenty of brightness in your life if you know where to look. Reminding yourself of this simple notion can do a lot to help rebuild trust.


Take a look at the simplest things in life that you still have. Your friends, family, and health are three profound things that you most likely still have, even if the person who betrayed you feels connected to each one of those things. Fall in love again with just how lucky you are to have these things.
Try to look at the positive side of things. It may seem funny to think of a betrayal as having positive aspects, but it's certainly possible. Here's the big one: You've learned a lot about the other person as well as about yourself. If you choose to continue the relationship, you'll want to use these teachings to make sure it doesn't happen again.

, When someone we care about deeply betrays us and misplaces our trust, one of our gut reactions is to try to punish them for hurting us. If our boyfriend cheats on us, we go out and get cozy with that guy we once had a thing for; if our friend lies to us, we justify lying back to them. Try not to do anything crazy before thinking about it first. Here's how you might go about it in your head:


Ask yourself: Are you doing this for yourself or in order to hurt the other person? If you're doing this for yourself, then go ahead — you earned it. But if you're doing something in order to hurt the person who hurt you, ditch the need to ""get back at"" the other person. When you try to put back together the pieces of your relationship, these actions will only stand in the way of making everything good again.

, After taking a little time for yourself to sort through things, get social again. There's nothing quite like social contact to remind you that the world goes on. And while no one is forcing you to move on with your life quite yet, it's a good idea to get some perspective on things. Perspective helps. Friends, colleagues, and even total strangers will help you get that.


Listen to your friends, but take anything they say with a grain of salt. They're probably somewhat disconnected from what happened, and they have a natural tendency to want to comfort you. (That's part of what they're there for.) Just don't take for granted that they know everything that's going on, or that they know what's best for your relationship.

, While it’s sad to see any relationship go — whether it's a friend or lover — sometimes the betrayal is a wake up call and a sign that there are many fish in the sea. Looking at the relationship as a whole should help you decide whether you want to regain trust in the person or whether you'll probably want to move on.


What was the relationship like before the incident? Did you have fun and laugh frequently? Or did you feel like it was a constant chore and you were doing most, if not all, of the work.
Did you feel listened to? Was your word as important as theirs? Were lines of communication free and open, or closed and constrained?
Did you feel that you could rely on this person?
Was the relationship balanced or was it one-sided and not in your favor?
Was the betrayal out of character or, in retrospect, might you have seen this coming? Does the person have a history of breaking the trust of their friends or lovers?

, This is another important exercise in self-discovery you should try to complete before you decide to allow yourself to trust the person who betrayed you. After all, if you're looking for the right things in the wrong places, you might do better to ditch this person and find someone else. It's hard to say, but it's tough medicine.


Are you in a relationship because you need someone to complete you? This may be a problem. Asking someone to complete you is an impossible task. Only you can do that. If you're in a relationship because you need one in order to feel ""whole"", you should probably consider taking a break from dating.
Are you asking for people to hurt you? Do you always date the same kind of person — the person who ends up hurting you in a fiery, dramatic spectacle? You might subconsciously be asking to be hurt because you don't think you deserve better. Well, you do. Improve your self esteem and don't settle for the kind of person you know will hurt you.

, Sure, grading someone sounds callous, but it is an effective and honest way to assess whether or not this person meets your needs. Besides, we deserve five-star relationships, so make sure that's what you've got.


Identify three to five things you value most in a relationship. For some people laughter and emotional support will be among their top needs. For others, intellectual stimulation is a top priority.
Using your grading system, determine whether or not this person is meeting your needs and is compatible with your values. For example, if the person shares all your values and did an excellent job of meeting your needs except for the betrayal, it might be a good idea to give them a second chance. On the other hand, if the person doesn't really share any of your values but is an overall good person, the betrayal might mean it's time to move on.

, Indeed, some people are not deserving of your trust. But sometimes, a mistake hurts because it reminds us of previous a wound. A betrayal that is calculated or born of malicious intent is a clear indication that this person is no one you can trust. But mistakes that are accidental and out of character may deserve forgiveness. Consider the following:


Was it a calculated deceit, for example a cheating spouse, malicious gossip or sabotage by a co-worker?
Was it accidental, like crashing your car or spilling the beans on a secret?
Was it a one-time slip, or does the incident represent a long-standing pattern of behavior?
Consider the circumstances: Is your friend or loved one going through a particularly trying time and could this have played a part in the injury?

, Was it mild, moderate or severe? The severity of the betrayal is often going to be a good sign of the degree of pain the other person put you through.



Mild offenses include blurting a secret, telling 'white' lies (lies that are told to spare your feelings, as opposed to lies told to deceive you) and complimenting your romantic partner in a way that may have seemed flirtatious. These tend to be accidental and one-time incidents. Generally, if you express your concerns, they are met with an immediate and sincere apology and a promise to be more mindful of your feelings in the future.

Moderate offenses include gossiping about you, regularly borrowing money but rarely repaying you and regular disrespect. These behaviors reflect a lack of consideration and selfishness. It can be difficult to confront someone who seems indifferent to your feelings, but sometimes people are just oblivious. These flawed behaviors can be sometimes be talked through and resolved.

Severe betrayals include stealing a significant amount of money, infidelity, spreading malicious gossip or lies, and sabotaging you at work or in some other endeavor. These are calculated betrayals, the perpetrator is aware of the grief he or she will cause and does it anyway. In such cases, you may need to seek professional guidance to salvage the relationship, if indeed you decide to forgive.

, If you’ve decided to forgive and move forward, one of the best ways to let go of resentment, anger and suspicion is to remind yourself of all of the wonderful things this person brings to your life. There's probably a reason — hopefully a lot of reasons — why you stayed in the relationship. Think about those as you begin to let the other person in.

, It's hard to do, and it's not necessarily expected of you, but it will help save the relationship if that's what you want to do. Try to imagine what drove the person to betray you, indirectly or directly. Try to think about how the person feels at this very moment. You shouldn't make any decisions just because you pity someone, but showing empathy is an olive branch that will mean a lot to the other person.

, Be clear about your feelings, and give the other person a chance to speak. At the same time, know that asking for specific details can make the pain even worse.This can make the healing process even harder.


Discuss the event. Explain how you interpreted the event and why you were hurt. Avoid accusatory language. Give the other person the opportunity to explain the situation from their perspective.
Establish your expectations and ask what is expected of you. This will help clarify the cause of the current problem, as well as avoid future disagreements.
Don't expect to get through talking about the incident in one sitting. Make that clear to your friend or partner. The healing process is going to take some time, and that person should be prepared to talk about it for some time. If they're not prepared to, that's a sign that they may not care as much about mending the relationship as you do.

, Often, hurtful behavior has much more to do with the other person than it does with us. Rather than face their own issues, people project them onto a close friend, family member or partner. If the incident was borne of the other person’s insecurity, help him or her deal with the pain. This will help you view the incident with compassion and help you to forgive. Here are a few examples of hurtful behaviors that are not personal attacks:


Someone makes a snide comment about your appearance because he or she feels unattractive.
A partner flirts to feel desirable, not because you are unloving or unlovable.
A friend is hyper-competitive because she feels inadequate.
You are sabotaged by a co-worker because he fears his work is inadequate.

, If you fear the relationship or friendship just isn't going to work, but want to try anyway, you may as well throw in the towel right now. If you decide to give it another try, believe that it will work, not because you want it to, but because the other person has earned it.


Don't constantly live in fear of the same betrayal happening again. Try to get back to normal as much as possible. If you find yourself living in the constant shadow of the betrayal, that's a sign that it's time to get out — both for your sake and for the other person's.

, Likely, forgiveness gave you the opportunity to be a kind and more responsible human being. Forgiving another allows you to pass that gift on to someone else.

When it comes to developing networks, the best advice is to never lose touch.,
Time has a way of escaping us so it is completely understandable when people lose touch.,
The first step to getting back in touch is reviewing your email archive.,
Use Google, Twitter or LinkedIn to find out if you have up-to-date contact information.,
Remember where that person worked and visit the organization's Web site.,
Search for blogs and online journals.,
Remind the contact where they met you.,
Prepare for the meeting.,
Keep in mind that relationship building is important for everybody and most people will be pleasantly surprised by your effort.

",How to Reconnect With Professional Contacts," Regardless of the distance, try your best to send periodic (monthly or bimonthly) email updates or blog posts to those people you have worked with or met at events. Even if you do not think you have anything in common when you first meet, you never know when a network contact will have a best friend you need to know.;
, When it is time to call on old contacts, however, do your best to be considerate and polite. Focus on learning about how they have been and not on what you need.

, Go through your old messages and see when the last time was that you were in touch. What were you discussing then? What were they doing? How did you leave things? This refresher will come in very handy when you are trying to start up conversation.

, Utilize these sites for additional information on what your contact is working on today. Note: If you are requesting to follow a contact on Twitter or be their friend on Facebook, you need to make sure you send them a message with the request. Mention that you can't believe you have not been socially linked before and ask about what they are working on.

, On a company or university Web site you can discover what events and activities are taking place, who has been recently hired and even read blogs from corporate leaders about the industry.

, By finding a contact's blog online you are able to catch up on all the events that have taken place in their lives since you last spoke. An easy way to reconnect through blogs is by leaving a personal comment about a recent post. Let the person know you have been following their work online but would love to see them in person.

, Always begin a letter, email or Facebook message with a short introduction of how you met and why you were thankful for the introduction. Were they a professor for your first-year biology class? Tell them that you were recently reviewing your old papers and found work you completed in their class. Were they introduced to you at a social event? Remind them of how great it was to meet there and how much you appreciated learning about their business. If you do not paint a memory for them of who you were and how you met, they may not feel obligated to call you back.

, Do not show up at someone's office or for coffee without having researched what is happening in their world. If you are meeting with an old professor, find out when homecoming is or what classes they are teaching this semester.

For example, you may have a friend who is commonly very fidgety. If so, their fidgeting may not be a sign of lying or nervousness. If you were to meet them on the street, common knowledge would deem them nervous or anxious. Nope. They just have an excited leg.
Pay attention to the habits of others. Do they maintain eye contact all the time? Do their voices change when they're nervous? When they're preoccupied, how do they transmit it? This will key you in to what you should be looking for when attempting to read them.;
, When you're reading someone, you are watching and listening. What you're not doing is grabbing the conversation by the horns and steering it in your direction. So ask your question and get out of there. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.


You'll be best off asking short, to-the-point, pertinent questions.If you say, ""How's your family?"" you may get a rambling, all-over-the-place response that doesn't help you gauge well the information you're looking for. If you say, ""What book are you reading currently?"" you may be able to gather more personal information.

, A normally affectionate person who seems not to be physically present and doesn't seem to want to get near anyone with a 10-foot pole has something going on; the same behavior exhibited by Boo Radley does not necessarily mean the same thing. Once you've gathered how the person acts in day-to-day life, keep an eye out for the stuff that doesn't mesh.


If something doesn't seem to add up, you'll have to ask why, at least initially. They could simply be exhausted, had a fight with their significant other, got yelled at by their boss, or just have some small personal issue that's sticking in their craw. Do not assume it's a reflection of your relationship with that person before you have all the details.

, Seeing one cue is not grounds for jumping to a conclusion. After all, someone could be leaning away from you simply because that chair is hard to get comfortable in. If you are heavily relying on the non-verbal, make sure you have three or four signs before you start making assumptions.


Try to a take a cue from their words, their tone, their body, and their face. Once you get one from each and they all line up, it may be safe to proceed. But of course, a good way to ascertain if you're correct is just to be direct and ask.

, As a mere mortal human, you are subject to fallibility. Just like the Pope. When you see something pretty, odds are you're going to like it. If it's wearing a finely-tailored Italian suit, you're probably going to trust it. Should you? Not necessarily.


Humans generally think of dangerous people as drunkards roaming the street unbathed and carrying a knife. In reality, most psychopaths are charming and have their act together.Though it's virtually impossible to actually take control of, just be aware that your subconscious is telling you to judge a book by its cover when that's not necessarily the best or most accurate thing to do.

, Body language can tell you a lot about what someone is feeling, especially when it comes to how comfortable they feel. It may be a reflection of the topic at hand or it could be some interpersonal issue. Here are some general guidelines that indicate comfort level.


Positive or comfortable body language cues:Leaning in forward
Relaxed limbs that are at their sides
Eye contact
Smiling that does not look forced or gritted


Negative or uncomfortable body language cues:

Leaning away from you
Crossed arms or legs
Limbs that are moving -- a lot of nervous tapping of the fingers or leg, for example
Looking away when talking



, You should also keep an eye out for fleeting facial expressions. Watch people very closely to see if there are any small movements of the mouth that give away what people are really feeling. For example, a person may smile at you but if their lip twitches, it might mean that they are thinking of something negative.Anything clenched or tense, if even for a second, can be a sign. A furrowed brow, a tense jaw, it's all signs of anxiety.
If their eyes close for longer than a normal blink, they're probably stalling and taking a moment to get a grasp on a situation.It generally is an indicator of someone who is losing grip, be it on themselves or in a situation.

, For example, if a person usually hugs you when they see you but they don't, it might mean that they feel tension towards you. Similarly, think about things like a weak handshake -- that could signify nervousness or uncertainty.Touching is a tough one, though. Everyone has different ideas of a ""personal bubble"" and just because someone touches you a lot doesn't necessarily mean you're ""in."" You could just be one in a line around the block. If you're curious about their touching habits toward you, monitor them around other people to see where the norm lies.

, How close or far away a person is from you also gives you some insight into their state of mind. For example, if a person is distancing themselves from you physically, it may mean that they do not want to be vulnerable or intimate. Or it could mean they're in a hurry! Again, clusters are key here.


Some people are not comfortable being within a certain physical proximity of others regardless of the situation. So just because someone keeps their distance, it may not be a reflection of you. The same goes for the opposite end of the spectrum -- other people have no concept of personal space. If they're violating yours, they may not even realize it.

, A person's voice can tell you a lot about what they're feeling. Listen for inconsistencies in tone or pitch of their voice. Are they simultaneously coming off as happy and angry? They're probably trying to cover something up.


Note the volume -- are they talking louder or quieter than usual?
Watch to see if they are hedging using their voice, saying ""Um,"" or ""Uh,"" often. If this is the case, they might be nervous or lying and trying to buy time.
See if their tone conveys an emotion that they're not expressing outright. For example, do they sound sarcastic or angry? They may feel the need to passively address the situation. If this is the case, it's best to get everything out in the open.

, Short, clipped responses to questions could mean that the person is frustrated or busy, while long responses could mean that the person is interested and happy with the conversation.

, When people say things, there's always a process underlying the content. If someone were to say to you, ""You're dating another dental hygienist?"" They're usage of the word ""another"" indicates that they're actually saying, ""You just dated a dental hygienist and that went to crap -- now you're dating another one?!""


The recent construction ""yeah, no"" has become quite popular. Even small two-letter words can be a dead giveaway for ambivalence (or for definiteness or face-saving or assent or dissent or really anything for that matter.) Even if your buddy says, ""Dude, c'mon,"" that can be a small sign. The ""dude"" there is to indicate solidarity, an acceptable way of saying ""friend.""So start parsing away those words to get a true indicator of how your target feels.

, On a date, you want to ensure that the other person is also into you. Again, clusters are huge here. It's very common for people (women especially) to be mistaken as interested when they're just being sociable.So stay alert.


Watch for body language -- are they leaning forward? Do they have relaxed body language (i.e. no crossed arms or tense shoulders)? These are good signs that the person feels comfortable and interested in you.
On a date, try to see how much the other person is talking and how engaged they are in the conversation. If they are interested, they will lean forward, nod when you talk, and ask questions.
Look for how much they're smiling. If they seem tense and are not smiling during the entire date, it may mean that they feel uncomfortable.
At the end of the date, see how they approach you. This is when you should be especially aware of touch interactions. Do they kiss or hug you? Or do they remain far away? This will give you some insight into how warmly they feel towards you.

, Job interviews are nerve wracking and it can often be difficult to gauge how well one went. Keep an eye out for positive body language that means the interview is going well. But also know that in this context, both parties are on high alert for good impressions, so the data points you gather may not be accurate long-term.


Again, you will want to make sure that the interviewer is giving out positive body language like leaning in and asking questions. You want them to be revealing that they are interested in you and what you're saying.
If your interviewer is shuffling papers or checking his or her computer screen or phone, they may be losing interest. Try to recapture their attention if it seems that they are getting impatient or bored.
When you are leaving, see how the interviewer says goodbye to you. Do they give you a firm handshake and genuine smile? These are good signs that mean that the interview went well.

, One of the most common reasons why you would want to learn how to read someone is to see if they are lying. When observing someone to see if they are lying, you want to look for body language and cues that correlate with nervousness.Once more: clusters.


Check to see if someone's voice changes, or if they suddenly change their body language. For example, if your spouse usually hugs you and touches you a lot but suddenly stops when you're asking them about something, they may be lying.
Do not mistake a person who looks to the side or doesn't make eye contact for a liar because researchers have found no relation between making eye contact and lying.
See if they stop using the word ""I."" Research shows that sometimes when people want to distance themselves from a lie, they will avoid using the word ""I"" and will instead speak of themselves in the third person (example: ""This guy loves a good football game."").
See if what they're saying is too elaborate and detailed. Sometimes when people lie, they rehearse a whole story beforehand. If this is the case, watch out for a story that sounds rehearsed or over polished.
They fidget and move around a lot. This is a dead giveaway that someone is nervous. If the person you're talking to keeps moving around, tapping their foot, or chewing on a pencil, it may mean that they are lying.
Look into their eyes,if their pupils grow bigger while saying something then it is a lie,that's why most poker players wear sunglasses

Recognize that it is different than forgiveness.,
Set realistic expectations.,
Set aside your ego.,
Evaluate the broken relationship.,
State your desire for a positive outcome.,
Acknowledge any anger and resentment.,
Listen to the other person's perspective.,
Apologize for any wrongdoing.,
Ask for and/or accept forgiveness.,
Focus on the present.,
Begin to rebuild trust.",How to Reconcile With Someone Without Losing Your Pride," People often confuse forgiveness and reconciliation. Forgiveness is something that only requires one person, but reconciliation requires two people. If someone is unwilling to reconcile, you cannot do it alone. If the other person is not ready, now may not be the time to reconcile.Never beg or grovel for the other person to speak to you or hear what you have to say. You are only in control of your own actions.
If the other person is unwilling to speak with you about the situation, give them time and space.;
, Because reconciliation is a process, do not expect things to go back to normal after one conversation. Focus on the small victories along the way instead of the final outcome.It takes time for relationships to heal.


An example of a small victory would be having a pleasant conversation or discussing an issue without raising your voice.

, Reconciliation requires honesty. Whether you were the offender or the offended, prepare to hear things about yourself that you may not like.Be willing to admit that you were wrong, that you were hurt, and to see things from the other person's perspective.


Your desire and willingness to reconcile shows your strength.
It may be helpful to journal about these feelings before you talk to the person. This will allow you to work through your thoughts and anticipate some of the conversations that you will be having.

, Take time to sit and think about what went wrong in the relationship. Write down the specific issues and how you contributed to them. Also, write down possible solutions to the issues that you identified.This will help you stay focused when you are talking to the other person and will also show him or her that you are committed to working on the relationship.
As you brainstorm for possible solutions, think of the specific issue, write down how you contributed to the issue and the effect it had on the other person. Consider how the other person viewed your actions and how it made him or her feel. Then think of how the other person contributed to the issue and how his or her actions made you feel. Any possible solutions that you come up with should be helpful to both you and the other person.
This may be difficult as you may still feel anger or resentment towards the person. You will have to make a conscious decision to put yourself in the other person's shoes.
Imagine how the other person feels. Did he or she feel angry, hurt, or disgusted? Think of a time when you felt those same emotions. This will allow you to establish some common ground with the other person., Begin the process by telling the other person your intentions. When trust has been broken, it may be difficult to be sure of someone's intentions. It is important that you express your genuine desire to work on the relationship.You may say, ""I know things have not been going well between us, but I would really like to work on making things better.""

, Most likely, both you and the other person feel hurt or wronged. You should not pretend that these feelings do not exist. Tell the other person why you are angry or resentful. You should also allow the other person to express any anger he or she feels as well.It may help to write down your feelings before talking to the person. If you do not write out your feelings prior to talking, you and the other person can write down how you feel and exchange your writings.
When someone expresses their anger to you, do not be dismissive. Avoid saying things like, ""You should not feel that way."" or ""That does not make any sense."" Instead try saying, ""You have a right to feel that way."" or ""I understand where you are coming from.""

, Allow the other person to talk about the relationship from his or her vantage point. Understanding both sides of the issue will keep you from making the same mistakes in the future. You and the other person need to empathize with each other.Empathy can also lessen feelings of hurt and anger.


Ask yourself what you would do if you were in the other person's shoes. Think about how you would feel, how you would react, and what expectations you would have of yourself
Give the person your complete attention when they are talking. Do not think of your retort as the other person is talking. Wait until he or she is finished before you respond.

, After feelings and emotions have been discussed, you should apologize for any way you contributed to those feelings.When you apologize for hurting someone, you validate his or her hurt. It is your way of saying you respect and have empathy for what the other person experienced.Your apology should state that you regret what you did, you take responsibility for your actions, and you are willing to actually do something to make the situation better.Apologizing to someone is not anything to be ashamed about. It takes a big person to apologize. This does not mean that you are weak.
You can simply say, ""I'm sorry for the hurt that I have caused you. I should not have done what I did. I will not do it again."" Try to be as specific as you can about what you are apologizing for. A vague apology may not seem genuine to the other person.If you are accepting an apology, thank the person and acknowledge what he or she has done. You may say, ""I accept your apology."" or ""I accept your apology. I know that was difficult for you.""

, Once you have apologized for any wrongdoing, it is time to begin the process of forgiveness. Your apology signaled that you regret what you have done and take responsibility, but forgiveness is much deeper than acknowledgment. Forgiveness allows you to express any hurt or resentment, understand the root of your emotions, and finally let go of the negative feelings. If you are the one asking for forgiveness, be honest about your wrongdoings and ask the other person to forgive you. If you are the one accepting the forgiveness, it does not make you weak or mean that it excuses the other person's behavior.Forgiveness is a choice. Both people are releasing any anger, resentment and blame.
Do not accept or ask for forgiveness if it is not genuine. If you are not ready to forgive, let the other person know. You can say, ""I am still working through this, please be patient with me.""
If the other person is not willing to forgive you, you do not have to beg for them to forgive you. All you can do is try. You can keep your dignity and wait for them to come around.
Forgiveness makes reconciliation easier, but it is not a requirement. Even if you or the other person is not ready to forgive, reconciliation is still possible., Once you have discussed the hurt, forgiven, and apologized, it is important to focus on the next steps. Constantly rehashing old conversations and past behaviors can be harmful to the reconciliation process.Reconciliation is focused on rebuilding and repairing the relationship.


Mutually agree to leave the past in the past. Take turns telling each other your vision for the future of the relationship.
Make a list of practical action items. Simple things such as weekly phone conversations or a monthly dinner may be agreed upon.

, Trust is the foundation of any relationship. Once broken, it takes time and effort to rebuild trust. Both you and the other person must continue to communicate openly and honestly, be consistent with your actions, and be patient.There will be setbacks sometimes.


Your words and your actions need to match. If you say you are going to spend time with the person or call him or her at the end of the week, follow through.
If you hurt the other person's feelings, apologize immediately. If you have been hurt, speak up and let the other person know.

Admit that your lovemaking is not what it used to be.,
Make sure your sex life is the only problem.,
Communicate about your problems in the bedroom.",How to Put Passion Back Into Lovemaking1," When you first started seeing your honey, you couldn't keep your hands off of each other or go more than a few hours without getting frisky. But now that you've been together for five years, your love making is about as inspiring as a TV dinner. Here are some signs that you and your special someone are having trouble in the sack:


When you can't remember the last time you had sex. If it takes you more than a few moments to remember the last time you had sex, chances are that it's been way too long, or that it was so unmemorable that you literally forgot about it.
When you've stopped grooming yourself in anticipation for sex. Ladies, if you used to shave your legs every morning and now are going weeks without a good shave, it may be a sign that you're not getting enough action, or that you don't care as much about it when you do. And gentlemen, if you no longer make an effort to smell and feel clean, it may be a sign that you don't care what happens in the bedroom.
If having sex is just another thing on your ""to-do"" list. If you're happy after you've had sex because you've accomplished another task for the day and can move on to the next chore, it's a sign that you don't see it as something fun and hot, but as just another part of your routine.
If you just aren't turned on by your significant other anymore. This is one of the worst signs, but fear not! Unless this is a permanent condition, it can be addressed with some future sexiness.
If sex is something you dread.;
, Sometimes your lackluster situation in the sack is just part of the natural evolution of a relationship, but this may not be the only issue. Before you try to put passion back into lovemaking, you need to make sure that you have a strong relationship otherwise. Here are some signs that there are bigger problems in your relationship than your lack of sex drive:


If you feel very distant from your loved one. If you and your loved one stop sharing your intimate thoughts and worries, or if you just feel like you don't know what your significant other has been up to all week, you may be drifting apart. If your boyfriend walks into the apartment you share and you ask yourself, ""Who is this person?"" your problem may be more than just a lack of passion.
If you find yourself fantasizing about other people---and never your significant other. If you're routinely turned on by strangers, other people of the opposite sex you know, or just hotties on television, but you never think of making love to your significant other unless it's happening, this may be a sign that you're just not that into each other anymore.
If you find yourselves fighting and being unhappy more often than not. Though all good relationships take work, if nothing you're doing is working and you're generally miserable with the person you're with and happier by yourself, then no amount of stellar sex can fix the bigger picture.

, If you truly do care about your significant other and want him or her to be a part of your life forever, then it's time to have a talk. If the rest of your relationship is healthy, then your lines of communication should be open, and having a conversation about the situation is the first step to improving it, even if it's a little awkward. Here's how to start:


Be casual but firm. There's no need to scare your cutie by saying you want to have ""a really serious talk,"" but be firm about the fact that you have something to discuss with him or her. Say, ""There's something I want to talk to you about."" Pick a time when he or she is busy and free from stress to discuss it.
Assure your sweetie that you still love him, but that this is something you want to work on.
Once you both agree that your relationship needs more passion, you can discuss some of the reasons for why it's happening. Are you taking each other for granted? Are you both so busy that sex hasn't been a priority? Are you both too stressed out to even think about it? Whatever the problem is, discussing it together is a first step to solving it.

First and foremost, understand that day sleepers are not lazy and don't sleep their entire lives away.,
Do your very best not to disturb the day sleeper.,
Don't expect the day sleeper to accommodate your schedule just because they keep odd hours.,
Don't take offense.,
If you happen to live with the day sleeper, try to be as quiet as possible during the day.",How to Respect a Day Sleeper," They sleep during the day usually because they work at night. They pretty much keep the same basic routines that you do, except what you do when the sun is out, they usually get done by moonlight.;
, You calling or knocking on their door at 1:00 PM is the equivalent of them calling or knocking on your door at 1:00 AM. A day sleeper's sleep, just because it's during the day, isn't any less important than yours. Unless it's an emergency, avoid trying to get a hold of them during their ""night.""

, Many people will expect a graveyard shifter to come home from work at, for example, 5:00 AM, scarf down a meal, grab a shower, and get into bed by 6:00 AM so they can be up by 2:00 PM to accommodate everyone else. This is totally unrealistic. If you get home from work at 5:00 PM, you wouldn't try to cram everything into one hour and go to sleep at 6:00 PM. Don't expect that of the day sleeper in your life. They want to be able to wind down after work and relax before going to bed just like you.

, Just because a person sleeps during the day and therefore may ignore your daytime calls and knocks on their door doesn't mean that they don't want to spend time with you. Try to work out times to call or visit that work for both of you, such as evenings after you're through with your work day but before they've started theirs, but also respect the fact that they most likely want to spend quality time with their family as well.

, Don't play loud music, turn the TV up loudly, or do anything else that may disturb the day sleeper. Hopefully, they're doing the same for you at night.

Look ready for romance.,
Do romantic things.,
Say romantic things.",How to Put Passion Back Into Lovemaking2," You won't be able to put passion back into your relationship if you're walking around in a sweatsuit and haven't showered in three days. If you want to start feeling romantic again, it's important that you and your honey look ready for romance---or even for some loving.


Clean up nicely. Even if you know you're going to have a busy day, passion can strike at any time, and it's important to be prepared. Both you and your honey should make an effort to shower, groom your hair, smell nice, and have fresh breath, so you can start to get back into a romantic mood.
Dress to impress. Though it's unrealistic to dress to the nines every night, especially if you live with your significant other, make an effort to wear well-fitting clothes that are fresh and appealing, so you'll look nice even if you're just hanging out around the house.
There can be some days when you look more casual, or even lounge around the house all day in your pajamas, but this should not become routine.

, Once you start to look more romantic, you can also act more romantic. It's important to have a romantic atmosphere, go on dates, and say romantic things to keep your passion alive before you head into the bedroom. Here's how:


Have a romantic atmosphere. If you live together, keep a clean apartment with appealing lighting and clean sheets, so hooking up is always a possibility. If you don't live together and your honey is coming over for movie night, light some scented candles and get rid of all of your clutter so he's thinking about sex instead of why you haven't taken out the garbage.
Go on romantic dates. Make an effort to have a date night at least once a week. You can make a delicious dinner at home with a bottle of red wine, go for a moonlit stroll, or check out the new restaurant down the street.
Listen to jazz or watch movies to get you in a romantic mood. If you're surrounded by romance, you're more likely to be romantic.
Make romantic gestures. If you're a guy, open doors, pull out chairs, and give your woman her coat if she's cold. If you're a girl, link arms with your loved one or kiss him on the lips at the right time.

, Make a point of complimenting your honey and saying how much you love him or her. Be cute by leaving a note on the mirror, in your honey's lunch, or in his or her inbox that will make your special someone think of you when you're apart during the day. Here are some other ways to say romantic things:


Write your honey a card listing all the reasons you love him. It doesn't have to be for a birthday or another special occasion--you can do it just because. You can even present him with the card at the beginning of your dinner date to really impress him.
In the evenings, tell him how much you love him right before you go to bed.
Send the occasional text message that tells your honey to have a great day and that you're thinking of him or her.

Make love in new locations.,
Try new sexual positions.,
Take a trip to the sex (or sexy clothes) store.,
Try some fun sex scenarios.",How to Put Passion Back Into Lovemaking3," Once you and your honey are feeling more romantic, it's time to spice things up. Here are some tips for making love in new locations:


Make love in a new part of your home. Having sex in the bedroom can get boring, so try some new places, like your shower, or your kitchen counter---provided that your curtains are closed.
Have sex on the couch or in a special spot of your home. When you have people over, you can wink at each other as you run your hand over the chair where you made love earlier, so you're both thinking of the fun sex you had without anyone knowing.
Take a sexy vacation. Take a trip to the beach or a romantic island, and have sex in a new hotel room.
Hook up in an unconventional place. If you're not offending anyone and have found a private place, hook up in your car, a park, or in a tent while you're camping. Note that you can get in trouble with the law for having sex in public, so choose your locations wisely.

, If you're always having sex in the same one or two positions, it's time to mix things up. A part of passion is keeping things fresh, so it should be your mission to get out of missionary position. Here are some tips for trying new positions:

Switch things around. If you're always on top, switch positions with your honey and see how it feels.
Don't be afraid to look up new positions. Read the Karma Sutra or look up new positions online. If you do this together, you'll be turned on in the process.
Improve your flexibility. Take yoga classes or spend more time stretching your calves, thighs, and hamstrings. This will help you enjoy certain positions even more, or find new positions.

, You've been with the same person for years, so you should be comfortable enough to make your sex a little bit risqué. If you're feeling bold, here are some ways to spice up your sex life:


Don't underestimate the power of sex toys. Go to a sex store together and buy some whips, hand cuffs, sexy lotion, or anything else that may improve your sex life. Though it may feel a little bit awkward, remind yourself that everyone is in a sex store for the same reason, and have fun with it.
Wear sexy clothes. If you're a girl, wear sexy lingerie, such as garters, thongs, and lacy bras. You can even tease your honey by showing him what you're wearing for a second before you cover up. You can even buy clothes that are ridiculously sexy that you would only ever wear in the bedroom and have fun taking them off.

, Why not? Be comfortable with your honey and have fun creating some exciting scenarios to get your blood flowing. Takings some risks can put some passion back into the bedroom. Here are some scenarios to try out:


Dress up really nicely like you're going to a wedding or somewhere important. Pretend like you're running late and really need to leave the house but just can't help yourselves. Have fun having sex in fancy clothes--just make sure to keep them clean!
Try having sex with almost all of your clothes on. That can be just plain hot.
Try some good old-fashioned healthy role play. Go to a sex store and try on some sexy outfits, whether you dress up as a police officer or a princess. It may feel silly at first but whatever, just get it in on in a new outfit!
Pretend that you're having a really big fight and then have ""make-up sex.""
Tell your partner your fantasy--however ridiculous it may be--and wait for him to act it out.

Surprise your honey by talking dirty before you get into bed. If the mood is right, tell him what you want, and the rest will follow.
Talk dirty while you're making love. Tell your sweetie how he or she is making you feel, or talk about how much you love touching his or her body.
Send sexy texts. Send sexy messages to tell your honey that you have the hots for him. But show discretion--make sure you don't embarrass yourself by sending sexy messages that get into the wrong hands.

Work on your relationship.,
Keep your sex life interesting.,
If you can't fix it on your own, get help.",How to Put Passion Back Into Lovemaking5," To continue to have a healthy sex life, you need to work on maintaining a healthy relationship at all times. Work hard to show your loved one how much you he or she means to you, and your sex life will continue to flourish. Here's how to do it:


Communicate. Keep open lines of communication so you can discuss any problems in your relationship--whether they're in the bedroom or not.
Tell your honey how much you care. Make a point of praising or complimenting your loved one as often as you can.
Develop common interests. It's important to make sure that you and your honey have something in common besides your new love for getting it on.

, Even if your sex life has improved, don't take it for granted. There is always room to make things even better---and a chance that things can get worse if you're not careful. Here are some ways to keep things fresh to keep passion in your love making:


Hook up as often as you can. Though you shouldn't have a tally of how often you have sex, the more you hook up, the more you'll want to do it.
Never make lovemaking your last priority. You may have a busy week, but always make time for getting it on. It'll make your relationship stronger and will put you in a better mood.
Try something new as often as you can. Keep the option open for a new position, a new location, or a new scenario.
Even when you're not en media res, don't forget to tell your honey how sexy he is, or how much you love his body.

, If you really want to make things work with your honey in the bedroom but just can't make it happen, it may be time to get help elsewhere. This may sound scary, but having an awkward conversation with someone new is better than having awkward sex. Here are some places to look:


Read sexy blogs or magazines to see if you can pick up any great advice.
Talk to your closest friends who are having passionate sex for some pointers. Make sure your honey is okay with you asking if it's a mutual friend.
See a sex therapist. A sex therapist is a true expert who can really help you turn things around. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you want to save your sex life--and your relationship.

Be spiritual about everything.,
Try to understand the other person and or situation.

,
Accept people and situations as they are.,
Either deal with it and accept it or don't accept it and don't deal with it.,
""Let he who is without sin, cast the first stone."",
Self love and self acceptance helps with not being judgmental, because then you understand this next rule.

,
Everyone has a right to be who they are!,
Turn unnecessary judging into constructive criticism; some criticism can be good.,
""Judge not, that ye be not judged."",
Mind your business.,
Work on your anger issues.,
Know your parts of speech.,
Know that some people judge, because their life is in cahoots.,
Don't judge yourself and you will not judge others!

",How to Not Be Judgemental," Think with your heart, and your spirit and not your flesh. When we think with our flesh, we often judge and misunderstand things and people. When you let your spirit guide you, you will perceive things much more clearly.;
,, When you accept people for the way they are and you understand that a person's behavior is their truth that is being displayed, you will be a far less judgmental person. A person's life is their own life, so remember to accept that! 

, The hardest thing in the world is, to be in a position where you are unhappy, which as a result causes disdain and judgments. That's incongruence, which as a result causes psychological tension. Either deal with people and your situation and accept it, or don't deal with people, nor your situation and don't accept it.

, Staying self focused helps to not point the finger. Every person has something they should want to work on in their own life. Focus on your life and you will be less judgmental of others and their behavior.

,, I am a strong advocate of this rule. When you have self acceptance for your self, you will understand that, people have a right to be who they are as well = no judgments :)

, For example, we must judge if a relationship is best for us, or a certain friend. We must judge with whom and how we choose to spend our time. We have to judge what grocery store, job, school or church is best for us. That is positive judging, because it reaps results and better choices to be made. When our judgments are unnecessary, it's just critical.

, When you judge, you are putting that energy out in the universe, to be returned back to you. What comes around goes around. Judge and be judged. People accept you when you accept them.

, If you mind your own business, then maybe you won't have so much time on your hand to judge others. Is your life not exciting enough? Or are you living a lie, which tells you to judge others, so that you can feel better about yourself?

, Judging also has a seething anger behind it. What are you angry about, that has lead to you becoming the naysayer?

, A noun is a person, place or thing. Understand your boundaries. If you know that certain people, places, or things will bring out the judgmental side of you, don't go there.

, Some people are still working out the details of their own life, and so, they would rather pretend to have all the answers and act as if they are a life coach because it makes them feel as if they have it together.

Determine if the other person wants to fix the relationship.,
Determine why the relationship is in trouble.,
Talk with your partner about what is bothering you.,
Listen to your partner’s responses instead of arguing.,
See the world from your partner’s eyes.,
Act on your issues immediately.,

Remember why you fell in love.",How to Mend a Broken Relationship1," There is no sense in trying to fix something if you are the only one willing to do the work. If your partner is unapologetic for mistakes, dismissive of your desire to talk, or continues hurtful behavior, it might be time to move on.It takes two people to mend a broken relationship. If you are the only one trying to save things then you will never succeed.;
, All relationships go through rough patches at one point or another. As the novelty of your first few months together wears off, problems and stress start to pile up and things you once found cute begin to annoy you to no end. While there are always small issues in a relationship, some issues can cause problems when they linger under the surface for too long:


You don’t believe you opinion is respected.
You feel like your partner doesn’t care about your needs.
You feel your partner is not helping with chores, bills, kids, etc.
You don't communicate well and/or argue frequently., Many times, relationships end or hit rough spots when there is not adequate communication going on between the two parties. While difficult, you have to be willing to share your problems and issues with your partner to have any hope of fixing them.Make time to be honest with your partner. Your concerns have to come out in the open or they will never be fixed.
It can help to write down your problems ahead of time, or discuss them with a close friend so you feel comfortable expressing yourself with your partner later.

, Instead of trying to think of what you need to say next, stop and try to understand what they are telling you. Careful listening shows respect, and will help you both figure out what is going wrong in your relationship.

, Too often, couples get caught up in their own emotions and neglect to see why their partner is upset. This is the easiest way to drag arguments out for days and days, but it can be easily remedied. Pause for a moment and think about why your partner is upset. What sorts of mistakes have you made that might bother them?, It is not enough to simply talk about your issues together. You need to do something to address them. Once you’ve figured out what is wrong between you, each one of you should come up with at least 2 things that you are going to do to address the issues. Tell your partner your solutions and ask them to hold you accountable– the only way to mend a broken relationship is to commit to healing it.


If your partner feels like they do all the work, for example, make a list of 4-5 chores that you will commit to doing every day.
If your partner feels like there is no more romance in your relationship, designate a “date” night once a week.
If your partner feels marginalized or unloved, make a point to listen more and talk less during dinner and before bed.

, This can be the hardest part of mending a relationship, but also the most crucial. Forgiveness releases pent up anger, pain, and emotions so that they don’t come back later in life, sabotaging all the progress you’ve made. Remember that no one is perfect, and without forgiveness there wouldn't be a single working relationship on the planet.Forgiveness takes time, so don’t be afraid if you are still angry 1-2 days after an argument. Keep working on forgiving your partner and you’ll be surprised how quickly you let go of negative emotions.
Talking to your partner and seeing their mistake through their eyes can help you understand the issue and offer forgiveness more readily.

, Being together doesn't mean you've got a leash over the other person. When mending a broken relationship, your instinct might be to spend every waking moment together. But this prevents the two of you from stepping back and seeing the big picture or your relationship, it’s good sides and bad. Spending every waking moment together often leads to fighting or feeling trapped.


Remember the expression, “if you love something, set it free.” Stifling or micromanaging people only drives them away. Trust yourself and your partner to spend some time alone and you will both return happier and healthier.

, After a long time with the same person, it is easy to let the problems in your life, like money, kids, or stress, overwhelm the good memories you have. Try to take a step back from your daily life and think about what you enjoy about your partner, focusing on the reasons you work well together. This will help your let go of the negative thoughts that may have taken over lately and remember why you are in love.Go through old photo albums and tells stories from your early days together.

Keep your eye out for the following lies that men tell in relationships.,
Consider these telltale signs that he is only interested in sex.,
Be careful when it comes to online dating.,
Be open with him.,
Show him that you are an understanding person.,
Don't provoke him with unnecessary questions.,
Respect his privacy.,
Don't stay with somebody who constantly lies to you.,
Trust your instincts.,
Choose men for the right reasons.",How to Not Fall for the Lies of Men," The following list was assembled by a group of male relationship experts for Cosmo magazine:Saying he's fine. Lots of men are too proud to admit it when anything is bothering them, while others lie in order to avoid drama at all costs. Either way, it might be a good idea to give him some time to cool off before asking again.

Giving excuses for not answering his phone. If he tells you that his phone was either off, out of batteries, or that he didn't have service, it could be him covering up for screening your call. That doesn't necessarily mean he didn't want to talk to you, but lying is safer than telling the truth in his eyes.

Lying about drinking. Men in relationships oftentimes downplay how much they drank, or plan on drinking, in a given night. That's mostly because they (rightfully) assume that the truth will be met with disapproval.

Telling you he's stuck in traffic. Men certainly aren't alone on this one; men and women alike use this go-to lie to avoid having to explain why they are really running late.

Calling his ex-girlfriend ""crazy."" Lots of men tell this lie because they are unwilling to accept responsibility for a breakup. It's also a classic cover-up for a guy who still secretly talks to his ex behind your back (i.e. ""I don't know why she's texting me! She's CRAZY!"");
, If you've been casually sleeping with a guy in the hopes that he'll one day become your boyfriend, beware of these red flags:



He tells you that he's not ready for a relationship yet. What he really means is that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with you. As an extra slap in the face, he tacked on the word ""yet"" in order to keep you coming back for more. Believe us, the minute the right girl comes along, he'll be more than ready to hop on the monogamy bandwagon.

He says he doesn't want to ruin the friendship. If that was the case, he wouldn't have slept with you in the first place. This is just a nice way of saying that he doesn't have any romantic feelings toward you.

He insists on keeping your fling under wraps. When a man cares for a woman, he wants to show her off. If you've been sleeping with this guy for more than a couple months and haven't been introduced to any of his friends, it's probably because he's not looking for anything other than sex. It's also very possible that he's seeing other women, and is afraid of introducing these women to the same friend group.

, The following are things that men often lie about on their dating profiles in order to attract more women:What they look like. Lots of men use outdated pictures of themselves to appear younger, or pictures that otherwise don't accurately represent what they really look like. To be fair, though, women are just as guilty of this dating faux pas.

Their age. Because so many men seek to date younger women, they'll round down a couple (or several) years to open up a larger pool of potential matches.

What they are really looking for. Whether it's his hobbies/interests or whether or not he wants to have a family, lots of men lie about what they are looking for because in reality, all they want is a fling.

What they do for a living. This is perhaps the most deceitful thing a man can lie about on his dating profile, but it does happen. Again, the motive here is clear: to attract more women.

, Trust is a two-way street. If you constantly keep things from him, then you can't expect him to always be totally honest with you. You need to open up to him and tell him what's on your mind if you want the same in return.

, Lots of men lie about small, insignificant things simply because they don't want to cause drama. If you are the type of person who throws a tantrum anytime something doesn't go your way, you may want to consider working on how you react to things.


Next time he does or says something that bothers you, try communicating how you feel in a calm, mature way rather than simply yelling at him and slamming the door.

, When it comes to relationships, some conversations just don't need to happen. For example, asking him things like ""Do you think she's pretty?"" or ""Do I look fat in this?"" put him in a very uncomfortable position. In essence, you are asking him to either lie or come across as a total douche bag. Our advice? Ask a friend instead.

, While it's true that relationships are built upon honesty and communication, everybody is entitled to keeping certain things to themselves. Remind yourself every once in a while that you don't really need to know every minuscule detail of his life.

, While this seems like a no-brainer, lots of women stay with men who treat them poorly in the hopes that they will one day change. But if you let him lie to you over and over again and get away with it, you are essentially teaching him that his behavior is okay.


This is not to say that one or two white lies warrants a breakup. Everybody tells lies now and then, but use your best judgment to decide what is okay and what's not.

, When you know somebody well enough, it's easy to tell (even without solid proof) when they are lying. If you find yourself feeling plagued with suspicions of lies or infidelity, put your worries to rest and find out for sure.


Confront him straight out, ask a mutual friend, or hire a private investigator---whatever it takes. But find out now.


, Good looks, lots of money, and fame don't ensure that he'll treat you well. Go figure! If you perpetually find yourself dating guys who lie and cheat, you may want to reassess the qualities you look for in a significant other.


Lots of women are attracted to the ""bad boy"" persona; deep down, part of them wants to be treated poorly. Luckily, this is a habit that you'll eventually outgrow (we hope).

Know that it can take a long time to rebuild trust after cheating.,
Take responsibility for your mistakes.,
Ask for forgiveness.,
Become an open book.,
Keep all of your promises.,
Communicate about what your partner needs.",How to Mend a Broken Relationship2," Once one partner loses faith in their partner it can take years to regain the trust that was lost. Any time a cheating partner leaves the house, meets up with coworkers, or texts someone new, feelings of jealousy and distrust are natural. Be prepared to work hard, and for several months, to rebuild trust after an affair.


Commit to healing your relationship, no matter how difficult things are from day to day, and you can one day rebuild the trust that was lost.

, Avoid making excuses, blaming your partner, or dismissing the affair as “a one-time thing.” In order to ask for forgiveness and begin moving on you need to take ownership of your infidelity. By taking a good, hard look at yourself you can eventually realize what made you decide to cheat and find ways to avoid making the same mistake., This can be the most difficult thing to do after an affair, no matter which side of the relationship you are on. Asking for forgiveness, however, is the only way to start the healing process – you cannot move forward if your partner is still harboring feelings of resentment. While you might not get forgiveness immediately, you need to humble yourself and ask for it anyway.


You will likely have to ask for forgiveness multiple times, but you need to be honest and sincerely sorry for your transgressions.

, If you cheated on your partner, the fastest way to regain trust is to be completely transparent. Make your schedule, calendar, and contacts accessible to your partner.Avoid hiding things, even small things, as they can lead to feelings of distrust.

, You need to show that you are dependable again. Call when you say you will call, show up on time, and do the errands or chores like your promised every single time.Never make promises you can’t keep.
If you need to change plans, change them several days in advance, giving your partner ample time to adjust their schedule as well.

, Listen to what your partner needs from you to help mend the relationship. It may be more time together or more time apart. They could want you to come home from work earlier or stop drinking. No matter what it is, ask you partner “what can I do to help fix this” and listen to the answer without judgment.


This is not, however, and invitation for abuse. Be sincere, helpful, and loving, but do not let your partner abuse you out of ""fairness"" or revenge.

"
"
Spend time together.,
Communicate openly and honestly.,
View each other as a team.,
Invest time in personal development.,
Accept your partner’s faults.,
Take a vacation together.",How to Mend a Broken Relationship3," This seems obvious, but you have to be together to keep your love alive. Find things that you enjoy doing together and commit to them, from cooking dinner to going on Sunday hikes. A relationship requires work to stay healthy, so don’t neglect your partner and expect to stay in love.


If you cannot be together, write each other letters or schedule times to talk on the phone or online.

, Honest communication steers off problems before they become giant issues. When something bothers you, bring it up instead of bottling it inside. Letting anger fester or grow only makes it harder to curb later on in the relationship.


Jealousy, misunderstandings and ego can lead to many failed romances, so be upfront about your worries instead of hiding them.

, Your partner is you other half, and you need to remember this when things get tough. One of the best parts about being in love is knowing that you don’t have to go through things alone – you have a partner and friend to help you get through stressful situations and feelings.


Work on projects together.
Discuss problems at work or home together and brainstorm solutions.
Call your partner when you need someone to talk to. They should always be willing to listen when you need them.

, Get up early and eat healthy, exercise, and take care of yourself. Not only does this make you happier, but it makes it easier to then focus on loving your partner. You need to be in the right physical and mental space to love your partner, and that means loving yourself.

, No one is perfect, and we often judge our lovers more harshly than anyone else. Your partner is going to make a mistake or hurt your feelings, and it may be difficult to forgive them immediately. However, the only way to stay in love is to know and accept that your partner is not perfect, and forgive them when they are wrong. Accept and appreciate their quirks instead of trying to change them.


You must be willing to give forgiveness in order to receive it. Don’t forget that you aren’t perfect either.

, Escape from the stress of everyday life for a week or a weekend and Try to reconnect. A change of setting is a great way to change your frame of mind. Once you’ve left behind bills, work, and daily routines you can focus on what matters most: each other.


If you cannot get away for vacation, find a way to have a vacation from home. Go out to dinner and a movie, rent a hotel room in town, or spend a rainy Sunday together in your pajamas.

End relationships that constantly lead to pain or anger.,
Know that relationship issues are never one person’s fault.,
Note if you fights resolve healthily or drag on for weeks.,
Realize when you and your partner’s plans no longer mesh.,
End a relationship when you spend more time miserable than happy.",How to Mend a Broken Relationship4," Even if you have great times together when things are good, a person who constantly hurts you by yelling, cheating, or disappearing will never change. If you find yourself fighting or hurting regularly then you are stuck in an unhealthy relationship, and you need to get out.Don’t let patches of happiness make you second-guess your decision. Your partner should almost never hurt you or break your heart, no matter how good they are the rest of the time.

, A relationship is between two people, so never let your partner blame your for all of the issues in your relationship. Someone who passes blame and refuses to think about their own role will be very difficult, if not impossible, to get on your side. Never let someone force you to change to save a relationship – this is a sign of a controlling and unhealthy relationship.


You should always feel free to be yourself with your partner., Healthy relationships have their share of arguments, but they usually resolve themselves quickly and without violence or screaming. If you fights last for days or weeks, or you keep having the same fight time and time again, it may be time to look for someone new.This applies if you fight over different things every day as well. If you find yourself fighting over every single thing that happens, step back and ask yourself why.

, Couples that once had perfect chemistry can run into trouble when life-goals and missions collide. If one person, for example, wants to go back to grad school while the other wants to travel the world, one person might feel slighted or cheated no matter which choice you go with. If you are constantly fighting or drifting apart because you have different dreams, it may be time to pursue your goals on your own.Discuss marriage or having kids – if you and your partner have opposing viewpoints, then this is a red flag that a long-term relationship might have problems.

, Love is about having fun, feeling secure, and enjoying your life together. If you find yourself regretting time together, waking up unhappy, or miserable in your partner’s company, it is time to move on."

The little things mean a lot.,
Don't put your guy friends above your lady.,
When you're hurt, let her fix it.,
Don't always stay at home.,
Women LOVE surprises.,
Women don't like to feel used.,
Tell her you love her.,
Last but not least, don't forget how fragile your woman is.",How to Make Your Woman Know She Means the World," Most men don't get this concept, most think that women want the biggest and baddest things, which some do. However, most women love to be told how much you love them through small gestures. Some ideas are a handwritten card, a few roses, an unexpected phone call just to check up on us, or just a simple text saying that you were thinking of us. Those things make women feel like they have the best man in the world.;
, Yes, you deserve to have your own time to spend with the guys, but women feel forgotten and unimportant when you decide to spend her time with your guys. Make time with your guys BUT let your lady know far ahead in advance so she feels like you remembered her as well.

, Women are natural born fixers. They magically heal the little boy's scrapes and bruises with a single kiss, and the cut finger with a simple band aid and hug. Females have this magical ability to take what is hurt, and broken, and put it back together. But guys, the longer you wait to let her fix it, the more she feels incompetent because she's made to do things like this.

, Take your woman out on a date, and don't always ask. When you start to ask her and let her decide all the time, it takes the romantic feelings out of the date.

, Females love to have their guy do things without them having to ask and hint multiple times. They love it when guys take the lead and don't always have to be asked or told.

, Here's the Raw in this sentence: Guys tend to make women do things for them sometimes and then get busy and forget about that woman. It's a big no-no. Women want to be kept and remembered. Not do something for their man because he begs, and then to be given just a smudge of time later. In a relationship, a woman needs to feel equal and expect their man to treat them the same.

, Women think that the word 'Love' is more than you wanting sex, or you just saying it. Simple ways of telling her that she's beautiful -not cute because that's reserved for pre-teens- or holding her close, showing ways that you're thinking of her, will give her more than one reason to know that she is loved.

, Sometimes women may act like they're tough on the inside and out, but everyone has their weaknesses. Their hearts are fragile and they take things to heart. They're emotional which sometimes comes off as being dramatic, when actually they're only doing what they know best on how to express their feelings. Simple harsh words to a woman can make or break her. When you ignore a woman, it can break her hope in you. Our trust can easily be given, and then never be shown again. Yes, guys are fragile in their own ways too, but females were made in a way that a man cannot know. So guys, treat your woman like it's the last day on earth you have to spend alive with her.

Clarify your expectations.,
Eliminate temptations.,
Overcome jealousy.,
Choose your battles wisely.,
Compromise.,
Forgive one another.,
Take responsibility for mistakes.,
Talk about everything.,
Listen actively.,
Increase your emotional intelligence.,
Develop mutual interests.,
Be affectionate.,

Spice it up.",How to Minimize Relationship Threats," One of the most common issues many couples find themselves facing is unrealistic or differing expectations of how the relationship should be. Either of you may fall prey to unreasonable beliefs, such as ""My partner should complete me."" Or, one partner may expect sex several times within a week, while the other does not have the same expectations.


In general, when your expectations are unreasonable or too high, one or both of you can end up feeling unfulfilled, which is a major threat to the relationship.
Clarify your expectations through communication.Sit down with one another to verify each person's wants and needs within the relationship and discuss the feasibility of both. Also, anticipate that your partner's expectations will likely change throughout the course of the relationship. Check in periodically to ensure that you are both on the same page.;
, Research shows that three of the main temptations in a committed relationship include the 3 A's: addiction, affairs, and anger.If you are encountering either of these threats in your relationship, it's important to know how to effectively handle them.


If either partner has an addiction, such as gambling, sex, or alcohol, the partner with the problem must be willing to acknowledge the issue when the other partner points it out. Once you have acknowledged there is a problem, the two of you can work together to get help both individually and as a couple. Be willing to find healthier ways to cope than by turning to these outlets. Get help with this process by seeking out a professional.
If there is another person threatening the livelihood of your relationship, it's necessary to cut all ties with this person immediately to save the relationship. Talk with your partner about cheating prevention strategies and minimize your chances of getting intimately involved with someone new.If one of you has an anger issue, you must take initiative to prevent anger from exploding into physical abuse or snide sarcasm--both of which can be damaging to your relationship. Go to counseling or take an anger management course to help both of you find more adaptive ways to cope with anger.

, The green-eyed monster known as jealousy can pull the legs from beneath even the most stable of relationships. Some jealousy in relationships is quite common and may not jeopardize your relationship satisfaction. For example, you may feel envious or insecure when your partner looks for a second too long at another, or when he or she pays more attention to the kids than to you. However, feeling jealousy and acting on jealous feelings are different.


Know that acting on jealousy by accusing, looking for assurance constantly, or acting out can destroy your relationship. While it's normal to feel jealousy every now and then, you can prevent these feelings from ruining your relationship by recognizing that jealousy is an emotion, not a reality. Simply because something your partner does makes you jealous does not mean that your feelings are supported by facts.
For instance, if your partner is working late with a cute coworker, this is not evidence of infidelity. If there is no evidence to support your emotional reaction, try to let it go for the sake of the relationship.
Accept that some uncertainty is a part of any relationship and be willing to reexamine your assumptions about how relationships work. For instance, if your parents divorced because your mom fell for another man, this does not necessarily reflect your own relationship. Learn how to separate your quick assumptions from the truth., Do you constantly hound your partner about nitpicky things? Do you turn even the smallest issue into a major fallout? Doing so can cause tension between you and your partner and threaten the livelihood of your relationship.That’s why it’s smart to learn how to choose your battles. Here’s how:Make a personal agreement to only raise issues that are actually important. Measure importance by how much they will matter down the road. Will this matter next week? Next year?
Resist the urge to react right away. Give yourself some time to consider the dilemma and think about your position.
Pick a time when you both are able to talk calmly and freely. Wait until tempers fade and until you have privacy.Work together. Consider your partner as your teammate rather than your enemy. Take turns expressing your grievances and producing possible solutions. Arrive at an agreement together.

, The other side of choosing your battles is knowing when and how to compromise. Sometimes, you just have to agree to disagree. The only way to do that is by finding some common ground. You may have to ask yourself the following questions to achieve compromise:How can we negotiate our differences while maintaining love and respect?
Do I feel okay not being right?
Do I value my partner’s differences?
Am I open to learning something new?
Can I put my needs aside for his/hers?
Am I sacrificing my values?

, Research suggests that one’s ability to forgive in a romantic relationship is a central component to a lasting, healthy relationship.Even when your relationship is threatened by internal or external forces, the gift of forgiveness supports relationship satisfaction. Build an attitude of forgiveness by:Considering the desired outcome (i.e. a common goal)
Avoiding building a case against your partner
Turning off your inner critical voice that gives advice that worsens the situation
Avoiding your inherent fear of intimacy that tends to push your partner away
Keeping negative family dynamics out of your current relationship

, Both you and your partner will feel happier and more fulfilled in your relationship when both of you takes ownership for your actions. There will be times when one of you knows that you are wrong. However, in an effort to appear tough or to push your partner away, you let the issue explode out of control. Admit when you’re wrong and save your relationship the trouble.Recognize that admitting you have done something wrong creates an opportunity to make it better. This may help you to be more willing to admit when you have made a mistake.Avoid associating your actions with your value. If you make a mistake, that does not make you a bad person. Try to remind yourself of this if you find yourself beating yourself up for a mistake you have made., At the start of a relationship, things probably felt electric between you and your partner. You wanted to chat about any and everything all day long. As the relationship progresses, these involved conversations become few and far between.Reignite the passion and minimize problems in your relationship by boosting your communication.


No matter how tired you are, or what you think you already know about your partner, make an effort to draw him or her into a real conversation. Look online for conversation starters, such as “What would you do if you knew you could not fail?” or “How would you spend your money if you won the lottery?”
Topics can be silly or serious, as long as you two are talking freely and excitedly about your opinions, thoughts, feeling, ideas, and dreams. Be sure to exclude heavy topics like kids, bills, health concerns, or resentments. You can choose a different time to discuss more serious subjects.

, Just as you and your partner may have stopped talking, one or both of you may also be guilty of not listening. When one of you doesn’t feel heard, relationship satisfaction may plummet and the odds of your mate looking for quality conversation elsewhere rise. Practice active listening to show your spouse you are attentive and engaged.


In addition to removing distractions, making eye contact, and orienting towards your partner when he or she is speaking, there are a number of strategies you can try to improve your listening skills.Restating: “From what I hear, you’re saying…”

Summarizing: “Let me put this in my own words to make sure I understand. You feel…”

Reflecting: “It sounds like you are really upset about this…”

Validating: “I can see this is hard for you to discuss. I’m glad you’re sharing it with me now…”

Using “I” messages: “I feel ignored when you come in on the phone and don’t greet me. It would be nice if you could pause your conversation to say ‘hello’.”



, Another aspect relating to communication that can decrease relationship threats is developing interpersonal sensitivity. Research shows that by improving your ability to identify emotions, understand why they occur, and regulate them can influence both you and your partner’s relationship satisfaction.The first step towards developing emotional intelligence is learning to identify emotions in yourself and others. You can learn this through the practice of mindfulness, which involves focusing on the present moment. This technique promotes calm and focus in order to become more self-aware of your thoughts and feelings., A significant aspect of a healthy, affair-free relationship is spending quality time together. What better way is there to pass the time than by engaging in activities that you both love? When you cultivate common interests, you have fun together, have more to talk about, and strengthen your bond as a couple.


Consider joining in with your partner in an already developed hobby or start anew by taking up one together. The sky is the limit on what you can do—hiking, horseback riding, yoga, painting, or even watching horror films.
This isn’t to say that you should spend every waking moment together, of course. It’s just as important to have separate passions that you enjoy on your own. When you have positive activities to explore outside of the relationship, you will feel more fulfilled with your mate., Surprisingly, giving and receiving physical affection doesn’t always come naturally. Some partners weren’t hugged or kissed in childhood and, therefore, don’t see these gestures as indicators of love. However, research shows that physical affection is a cornerstone to each person feeling satisfied in the relationship.


Other reasons to be physically affectionate include reducing stress, releasing feel-good hormones, lowering blood pressure, and improving mood.So, even if you aren’t normally very touchy-feely, give your mate the gift of loving touch whenever you can.

, Recognition can go a long way towards helping both partners find satisfaction and reducing the chances of either of you straying. Showing appreciation by recognizing your mate’s positive qualities actually provides motivation to stay in the relationship. In other words, the more you recognize your partner for being kind or caring or attentive, he or she is more likely to keep those habits up.Take time out often to appreciate and recognize your partner. You might say “I feel so blessed to have you in my life. You are such a thoughtful and committed partner.”

, As time passes and each individual has separate and shared experiences, you naturally change and grow into a slightly different version of yourself. In worse-case scenarios, individual growth can translate to growing apart in the relationship.


You can overcome the notion of “growing apart” by encouraging one another to pursue outside interests and learn new things. When both partners feel like they are contributing in life and love, they are more satisfied overall.Support your partner as he or she pursues an education or a new career path. Show an interest when they are trying out a new skill or hobby. Work together and separately to find meaning and purpose in your lives and you will feel more connected in the relationship.

, A key part of eliminating relationship threats is keeping things fresh. It’s common for couples to grow disinterested or dissatisfied when you’re with the same person doing the same things for weeks, months, or years. Counteract the gradual fade of infatuation by spicing things up every now and then.Just like spices in your cabinet, there are a variety of ways to add zest to your relationship. Perhaps, you feel stuck in your routine. Shake things up by planning a date night mid-week. Or, maybe the two of you have become too predictable. Surprise your partner with a massage after dinner or pop by on lunch break for a picnic.
Make sure that your date night plans are a priority. Compare your schedules to identify a night that will work for both of you. If you have kids, make sure that you arrange for child care as well.
Spice can also refer to intimacy. Instead of the usual peck on the cheek before departing to work, pull your partner in for a long, sensual French kiss. Leave a sexy note in your partner’s lunch. Send a dirty text in the middle of the day. Think outside the box and come up with a few fun ways you can freshen up your relationship starting now.

, Be a good listener and show that you're actively digesting the information that they're sharing with you. By getting them to talk about themselves more, they will feel pleased to be heard and will respect your willingness to give them the opportunity to talk.


Avoid controversial topics, especially if you're aware that this person is well known for ranting or for being highly opinionated. If he or she does get onto such pet topics, smile politely and take the first possible opportunity to change the subject.

, If the person is mean, annoying or rude towards you, stay calm and respond in a normal voice. If they're trying to be bossy, thank them for their suggestion but be clear that you are still happy to proceed with the matter in your own way.


Be assertive, not aggressive or passive. Respond with ""I"" statements, making your own position clear and not reflecting any of the attitude of the person you don't much like.
Consider making a complaint to someone, if relevant. However, this should only be a last resort, as it will not help you to get along with this person.

, That may feel hard if they're belittling, blustering or boring but every person has something good within that you can locate and hang onto. This isn't the same as liking the person or wanting to spend any extra time with them, it's about trying your best to see what's special about the person. To be more mercenary, if you're in a job or doing a deal with this person, finding that good part could also be about finding out the best way to utilize that person's skills to forward your own or the workplace's needs.

, Stay polite and simply inform the requester that you respect each person for their skills and talents and that X certainly has good talent Y and great skill X. This avoids having to say anything about X's rotten personal skills or stinking attitude.


Don't freak out if asked this. Go straight into pointing out the good you noticed and nothing more.
If the person asking is hopeful for a bit of gossip, smile and simply say that you haven't a clue. Don't begin to gossip, as it always gets back somehow. Indeed, you can't be sure of the motives of the person asking you this...

, Be polite, recognize the short duration of the moment, then move on with your life in your way. There is no guarantee in life of always meeting people you like and avoiding those who bother you. The best response is to expect that you won't like everyone but that you still have a responsibility to respect their dignity, to be polite and to not allow them to railroad you into feeling less than them.

Before you take action, take a step back and view your relationship with your partner and your other friendships.,
Consider feelings.,
Talk to your partner and friends, if possible, and ask them how they feel.",How to Manage Friendship when in a Relationship1," Sometimes, you may not be taking a look at the whole picture - you may be just focusing on part of your garden and neglecting all the weeds growing in other places! Ask yourself these questions:


Am I spending enough time with both?
Who am I with most of the time?
Are there more positive or negative feelings in my partner's relationship and my friendships?
Do I feel unhappy with my relationship or friendships?;
, Do you sense negative energy from your partner or friends? If there seems to be a cloudier tension in your relationship, you may want to lay off some time from hanging out with your friends. If it's the other way around, you may be spending too much time in your love life.

, Do you spend too much time tending to your relationship and neglecting the weeds in your friendships, or is it other way around? You can't just focus on one part of the garden, but you must take a look at the whole garden. Where are the weeds thriving more?

"
"
Consider what your priorities lay.,
Always be in touch.,
Make sure your partner is aware of the times you plan to hang out with your friends or have private time alone.,
Remember that you are committed, not barred in a relationship.,
Let your partner do their things as they want.,
Make sure you are there when your best friend needs a shoulder to lean or cry on.,
Don't be afraid to speak out about how you feel, but do consider other people's feelings and do it in the gentlest but firmest way.,
Enjoy your flourishing garden of relationship and friendships!",How to Manage Friendship when in a Relationship2," Is it your life, friends, career, etc? Even though you have your relationship and friendships to tend to, you must focus on your priorities, but not so much that you are neglecting your partner and friends! Spread your time so that you can be with each person personally. Remember that you can't be everywhere at once; there is only one of you, so time matters in this step!


Time management is important in maintaining both relationship and friendships. It's critical to provide time for your partner, your buddies, and - most importantly - yourself!
Know that your partner is just as important as your friends. No one deserves more attention than the other.

, Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you can't hang out with your buddies. Hang out with them at least once a week; if you cannot be present, sending them a card letting them know you love them is more touching than an email or text message.


Go out on an outing with your friends. Whether it's a trip to the club, bowling, or a meal at a restaurant, make every moment count! Never leave one of your friends out!
Be aware of what is going on in your friends' lives. If you do not update yourself on their status every few days, they will think you do not care for them and your friendships will wither!
Going on social websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Myspace, etc. can help you keep in touch with your friends. Plus, you can easily plan social events and group hang outs!

, This way, your schedule and your partner's schedule will not be upset. If your partner has no idea about your group hang out and plans a special surprise dinner for you that day, more than likely will he/she be hurt! Letting your partner know about your schedule will prevent any hurt feelings and confusion in the future.


Make sure your partner is also aware of who your friends are. It's best that he/she knows who your friends are so that there is no worry of who you're hanging out with. This will also erase any possessive or concerned feelings in your partner.

, Make sure your friends are aware of that as well. They need to know that you love your partner's company, but you miss their company as well. You can still live your life however you want; your partner cannot control you in that area. You make the decisions.

, Avoid being the over-possessive partner just because he or she has more girl or guy friends. If your partner really does care for you, he/she will not cheat on you. However, being sure that you do spend enough time with your partner will prevent your partner from holding such thoughts.


If your partner does cheat on you, know that it is not your fault. Your partner probably feels deprived of love and sees something else in another person that he/she does not see in you.

, This way, you can be sure they will return the favor in the future when you need them! However, if you are unable to be present, sending them a thoughtful, loving card that assures your support with them can be just as sweet as you being there in person with them.



Never delay in sending comfort or reassurance to your friend. Your friend will most likely hold hurt feelings and wonder whether you really are their best friend or not.

, Don't let anyone control you - this is your life, and these are your decisions!


Do let people influence your decisions a little, but do not let them make the decisions for you unless if their advice seems better than your own.

, Be sure to tend to it every day and never neglect one part of it. Always look at the whole picture and do whatever it takes to pull out the weeds and keep the flowers blooming.

Talk about rewards.",How to Make Your Husband Quit His Bad Habits," How many times have you found yourself playing with your hair or fidgeting without even knowing it? It's possible that your husband's bad habit is just as subconscious. Let him know that it bothers you. Does he even know he's doing it?


Of course, certain habits are more delicate than others. But you two are married for Pete's sake -- if you feel uncomfortable bringing it up with him, who would you feel comfortable talking about it with? As long as you're calm and gentle about it, he shouldn't get offended. A simple, ""Hon, do you realize when you're chewing on your nails? It bothers me,"" will get the conversation going.
Show him the side effects of his bad habit and why you are asking him to quit it. Tell him how it's affecting your life and what result it will bring in the future. He may need a bit of convincing.;
, Bad habits don't just present themselves for no reason. Usually they're the result of either boredom or stress. Does your husband smoke like a chimney after work? Crack his knuckles during TV? Get to the why behind the habit. It's the only way you can really get it to stop.


If he claims not to know, you'll have to be super observant. Watch him at different times of the day, while he's doing different activities, and when he's displaying different types of emotion. What seems to be the reason for his habit?

, We all have bad habits. Show him you understand how hard it is to break one and that you're not expecting a miracle overnight. Especially if it's something like eating less or working out -- that stuff is tough!


Don't make him feel like a child. The last thing your husband wants is to feel emasculated. Nagging won't get you anywhere. If anything, it'll get him riled up and more stubborn in his ways! Make sure it's a conversation and that both of you are listening.

, They don't call it a ""bad"" habit for nothing'. He probably knows it's bad for him, but you may need to point it out anyway. Whether the reasons are health, well-being, or simply aesthetic, make the reasons very clear. Sometimes we humans need to be kindly ushered out of denial, you know?


Steer clear of being too judgmental about it. Your good intentions won't get you anywhere if you go the, ""Ugh, but smoking will KILL YOU"" route. Instead, show that you're being logical and level-headed. ""You know how terrible smoking is and the ill-effects it has on your body and the people around you."" is much harder to get angry at.

, As much as he knows it's bad for him, he may not realize how much of an effect it has on you. Let him know how it affects your health, your energy, or just your well-being or mood. It's possible he doesn't know how much it bothers you or is negatively affecting your life. Especially if you've been too nice about it!


Be honest. It's easy to say, ""Your nail biting ruins my life!"" but you don't actually mean it. ""When you bite your nails so much, it gives me the heebie jeebies. It's a really uncomfortable feeling. To top it off, you say yourself that it hurts!"" is something he'd be more likely to respond to.

, You'd be in a better mood, that's for sure! And since you could start working to a reward, there's double the reason to kick the habit. The negatives might work for him, the positives might work for him; but if you can, show him both.

, Old habits don't just go away; they need to be replaced. So if you're on him to eat less, start by swapping out dessert for fruit. If you're on him to not crack his knuckles, offer him other things to keep his hands busy. He'll feel less deprived and angsty.


Generally you want to keep it in the same family. Instead of cracking his knuckles, he can clench his fists. Instead of jigging his leg, tense it up. Instead of a bag of potato chips, baby carrots. That way it'll be less stark of a contrast.

, He needs to know you're on his side and that you're willing to make sacrifices, too. If you can do it with him, all the better! It'll be more motivation -- have you ever done your workout routine without your buddy? Eesh. The companionship will keep it positive but also keep the pressure on.


Ask him if there's something you could do so you could break a habit together. Maybe he needs to eat more healthy but you need to kick the chocolate. For every stride he makes, you'll match it.

, It's impossible to demand that your husband quit smoking today, that he go out and run a 10k, that he drop his lifestyle and automatically pick up a new one. That's not how it works. Let him know that you'd be happy with one less cigarette right now, that that snack after dinner could be an apple instead of a cookie, that he can crack his knuckles before bed if he really wants to. Let him ease into it.


When the mountain looks too high to climb, we give up. Start from the get-go with baby steps. Momentum will build from there. When he's okay with fewer cigarettes, with fewer calories, push him to go a bit further. One step at a time.

, It's easy to say, ""Yeah, yeah, I'll stop drinking Diet Dew tomorrow""...and then you run into the 24-pack in the fridge. Start with a boom -- throw the 24-pack out. With him, of course! And be sure to be positive about it -- this is the beginning of change!


It sort of officially marks the beginning of a new path. Without it, it's easy to forget about, really. Have you ever gone to bed, resolving to start your diet tomorrow...and then you remember the next day when there's a chip in your mouth? Don't let that happen!

, Ask him about his progress. Watch him when you're home together. Let him know you've got a keen eye on his success (not his failure). With a positive spin, it's just watching him become a better person. What are wives for, anyway?


If that's not enough, see if you can casually slip it in to his friends or his employees about the habit he's trying to kick. Once they know, he'll feel the pressure not to cave to the temptation. Or you could follow up later!

, If you're on him to not be lazy and to eat better, don't sit down on the couch with a bucket of fried chicken, demanding the remote. Rude. You need to be an example, too.


It's best if you're consistent at all times. You may want to have a little hanky panky, you may want to go out to dinner, you may want this or that, but if it interferes, make the sacrifice. Can't have your cake and eat it too!

, Have a calendar hanging up where you two can see. For every day that your husband is successful, make a big red X. After a week or so, he'll have a nice chain going that he probably won't want to break. Having concrete proof of our efforts is more motivating than just knowing it ourselves.


Try to go for sixty days. That 21 day stuff? That's crap.He'll probably need about two months before it really sinks in. However, it depends on the habit. If you want him to drink more water, it'll be no problem. If you want him to become a mountain climber, well, that's a different story.

, All this hard work better pay off! Sit down with him and discuss what he'd like for a reward. As long as it isn't, ""An hour of smoking/cracking my knuckles/shoving pie in my face,"" (or whatever the habit is), good. He's deserved it!


60 days is a long time. Feel free to dangle smaller rewards in his face at certain checkpoints. Maybe every two weeks? Write that down on the calendar too!

This doesn't mean that you can never pause or enjoy a moment of silence, but is instead meant more metaphorically.


If you know how to communicate and the right things to talk about with your girlfriend, your relationship will bloom into a better romance, and your girlfriend will become more enamored of you.
There may be times when you feel like you have nothing more to say, but if you want to have that spark, there are lots of ways to keep the communication channels flowing beyond ""pass the salt, please."";
, Talk about your life, the things you want to do, your future goals and aspirations and the like. Do you see college or university in your future? What kind of job do you plan on having? These are potential topics of conversation.Women generally like men who have a vision for their futures and work towards that vision., Discuss her interests, her friends and her family. Ask her about her friends, her family and their lives, and have long conversations about how she likes to spend her days. What are her hobbies? What are her likes and dislikes?Talk about everyday things that interest her, be it shopping, cooking, listening to music, or blogging. Your girlfriend will feel special in that you're willing to stop and listen to her.Many women find it annoying when men just talk about themselves.Talking about your girlfriend’s interests will help her see that you’re genuinely interested in knowing everything about her and her life. It also shows her that you're intent on sticking around for a while.
Be genuine. Don't fake an interest in something; this could backfire and end up hurting her feelings.
You may find that you share common hobbies, thus bonding you more tightly. And when you do meet her friends or family, you’ll already have a bunch of conversation starters with which to impress them!

, Social psychology researchers have found that asking questions to one another almost always make two people feel better about each other and want to see each other again.


The top 5 questions to ask are: 1) Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want to go out for dinner with? 2) Would you like to be famous? 3) Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say? Why? 4) What would make a perfect day for you? 5) When did you last sing to yourself and/or to someone else?
You should each take a turn answering each question and do so in order..

, All of us have our own individual views about life but we often keep these to ourselves. By inviting her to open up about the big questions of life, you'll understand more about who she is at her very core and her value system.


Ask her about whether she attends church or how she was raised. Ask whether she plans to keep up her family's beliefs and traditions.
Getting into the big stuff will show her that you're committed and also that you're able to be serious as well as playful.

, Childhood memories are always fun to talk about and to listen to, especially if they involve something embarrassing or hilarious. Talk about your first crush or the time you did something silly. Then get her to spill all of her stories.


Both of you will benefit from learning more about each others' histories. You'll laugh and get a better sense of how the other person came to be who they are today.
Talking even about painful, embarrassing or hurtful past memories will also show her that you trust her enough to tell her the less savory stories alongside the funny ones. Hopefully she will show her trust in you by disclosing her past experiences too.

, Compliment your girlfriend on her dress or thank her for something special she did for you.


Genuine compliments can lead to better romance and more romantic conversations; they let her know that you think she's special and that you feel lucky to be with her.
Don't just compliment her looks. Her personality is really what you love, so let her know how funny, clever, and smart she is.

, Show her that you're well informed and are an engaged civic actor. She'll respect you for caring about the world around you.


You'll also learn a lot about each other and your political views. You can start to check in about your compatibility.

, Generally, women end up talking more about their days while men just listen. But guys can talk too!Be open and tell her about all of the little things you did that day, whether it be at school or work or at home. This keeps you two engaged in each other's day-to-day life, which is, let's be honest, not the most exciting, but is highly important. It's the everyday that keeps you connected; this is way long-distance relationships are so challenging.

, Girls love a guy who can open up and be frank about his fears. You can tell her your girl about the big things that scare you (e.g., like saying ""I love you"" or someday getting married) and also about your other, more everyday fears (e.g., like spiders, heights, or your own cooking!)


By talking about what scares you, you’ll make your girlfriend feel closer to you because you’re revealing your vulnerable side. If something bothers you or you're upset, talk about it with your girlfriend. She’ll be interested and will probably offer her you her support.

, Tell her how you feel irrespective of whether it's good or bad. You can work wonders if tell her what you're thinking and feeling and then listen with an open mind., Spending time together is one of the best ways to fall in love. Go on dates and do things that you both like to do. Just having fun together will help your girlfriend realize how happy she is with you.

, Show her that you see her in your future. Planning for the future is an indicator of your commitment and is also a healthy ingredient for a budding relationship.Start making ""we"" statements (e.g. ""We"" should get furniture for your new dorm room. ""We"" should go see that movie you've been wanting to see next weekend, etc.).
For example, if you're with someone who loves art, make plans to go to the Getty Museum. If she likes ice hockey, suggest you both go to a game.
Start planning holidays and special dates. This is always a fun time in a relationship. Decide when you'll see her family and when you'll spend with yours over big holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. She'll love that you're thinking ahead and showing your that she and her family are a priority for you, especially during busy times like the holidays.
By talking about the future, and even just the short-term future, you're helping her imagine herself with you down the line.

, If she asks you to not to use a particular word or requests or asks that you call her father Mr. So-and-So, then agree to accommodate her request. This isn't ""giving in"" to her ""demands,"" but instead respecting her wishes.


Respect her individuality first and foremost. A woman who feels that her boyfriend allows her to make her own decisions is more likely to remain in a relationship than a woman who feels that she is being told what to do all the time. Don't compare her to other women. Accept and embrace that she is her own unique individual.Don't intimidate or force her into doing things she doesn't want to do. This is a sure-fire way to an unhealthy relationship.

, This doesn't necessarily mean engaging in sexual activity, but instead creating closeness and sexual chemistry. Physical and emotional intimacy is a key component of healthy, loving relationships.Stay physically connected. Hold hands or put your arm around your girlfriend while you walk to together. Kiss her. Show her with actions how physically close you want to be and how attracted you are to her.

, This signifies to her that you're in this for the long haul and that you want to make her a part of, and not just an accessory, to your life.

, Women are generally very pleased when a guy keeps his room, car, clothes and body in good order. Keeping things tidy shows your girlfriend that you are an adult man capable of having a committed, adult-style relationship. You're proving you're worthy of her time and attention.Pay special attention to the refrigerator, sink, and bathroom. She’ll notice.

, You want her to fall in love with you, not some version of you that you read on a website. Like Star Wars? Are you a crazy hockey buff? Are you vegetarian? Don't hide aspects of yourself. After all, you deserve to be loved for who you are just as much as she does.

, Show her how much you care by going above and beyond. Exceed her expectations.For example, if she asks you to help with an after-school project, go the extra mile and pick up all the supplies in advance and show up ready to help out. She'll be both surprised and impressed if you do more than she expected.
Surprise her with things she likes to show her that you've listened. Have flowers delivered to her, bring her lunch during her break at work, or get tickets for a show she wants to see."

Use touch to flirt.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Think You're Cute," You don't need to douse yourself in perfume if that's not what you or your boyfriend like. But you should be sure to bathe, groom yourself, and wear deodorant before your date. It will help you feel more confident, and make your boyfriend want to get close to you.

, No matter how modest you are, there is certainly some aspect of your appearance that you feel is the strongest or most attractive. One way to remind your boyfriend of how cute you are is to accentuate the parts of yourself that you feel are your strongest or most attractive qualities. If it's your eyes, try wearing eye liner and/or eye shadow that brings out the color in your eyes. If it's your lips, try a new lip gloss. If it's your hair, try a new hair style to better frame your beautiful face. Whatever you feel is your best features, accentuate them to remind your boyfriend how lucky he is.

Accentuating your favorite features will not only get your boyfriend's attention - it will also help you feel better about yourself and increase your confidence., If you go to the makeup counter at a department store and ask an employee there for help trying out new colors, you may be able to get a free makeover out of it. Let her know what shades you normally wear, and ask her to try out something new and bold. If you like the way it turns out, you can buy makeup in those shades. At the very least, you'll have a fresh new look to show off to your boyfriend.

, Hairstyles are easy to stick with once you find something that's comfortable. But if you want to rev up your boyfriend's engines, a new and exciting cut might help catch his eye.

Let the person cutting your hair know what your comfort zone is with hair cuts. Don't go drastically different if you're not comfortable with it. You can still get a fresh new look with only minor alterations to your usual style.

, No matter what you have in your closet or what your body type is, you can put together a stunning outfit that will accentuate all the right curves. Think about what kind of look you want to aim for, and work your way toward completing that ensemble.


Choose a bra that will create a stunning silhouette. Some fashion experts recommend starting with the bra and building your outfit around the silhouette your undergarments create.Wear jeans that make you feel attractive and confident. If you prefer skin-tight skinny jeans, then slip into your favorite pair. If you prefer something a little more comfortable that can still give you a tailored look, try a pair of flared jeans.Don't just aim to impress your man. The most important thing is to dress in a way that makes you feel empowered. If you feel sexy and confident, your boyfriend will notice and will turn on the charm.

, Locking eyes with your boyfriend, even if you've been dating for a while, will excite and engage him. Flirting is often thought of as something only single people do, but flirting with your significant other can help reignite the passion in your relationship.

Hold his glance for a few seconds, then smile and look away. It will make him feel like you're playing just enough ""hard to get"" that he may work a little harder to romance you., Everyone has a sort of ""barrier"" around his or her body, which we tend to think of as our personal space. Even if you've been dating someone a while, entering his personal space will invariably trigger an arousal response. That's because having our space invaded by someone we're attracted to is stimulating and prepares us for the possibility of a romantic encounter.

Find little ways to enter his personal space, like leaning close to tell him something. It will no doubt excite him and remind him of the many reasons he's attracted to you., Flirting is largely reliant on body language, but you can incorporate some light touching into your flirtation. Try hugging your boyfriend when you see him, and use that occasion to set a precedent for continued touching/handholding throughout the evening. You can also touch his hand or shoulder to get his attention, and hold his hand or elbow any time you lead him to another room.

Reinforce the emotional aspect at each step.",How to Manage Couple Conflicts," You are probably asking yourself: Is there any other way to resolve conflicts other than to have a winner and a loser? Can anybody develop skills to do things differently? Can I get whatever I want or need, without destroying the other side's self-esteem? Or, even better, can I get it with the other person's cooperation and support? YES! Here you have the easy steps to clarify and manage your conflicts:;
, Why are you so upset? Explore your reaction to the event and see if you are responding to the present situation or reliving a past hurtful event. Has the same situation (getting rejected or ignored?) happened to you in the past? Does it look similar to the one that happened then and there? Perhaps you are reacting to that situation, and not the present one…. See if this issue is really about you and your significant other or you and someone from your past.

, As difficult as it can be, finding a constructive manner in which to air grievances provides an open and honest relationship. You need to have some agreement arrived at before there is a serious fight, where both of you say what to do. Are you going to schedule a time to talk? Or a chill out session? How about finding ways of calming anger? Establish a system by which you two agree to a fair fight, so you have the rules of engagement ready…. and know what to do before hurting each other.

,, Agree to reach a resolution, even a provisional one. Many of us take a fight-or-flight approach to conflict, sometimes only to make our point stick. You and your future partner are on the same side of the same team, which is difficult to remember when you are in a heated argument.


Definition of Resolution is: both parties compromising to reach a solution. It is not about one person getting his way and the other person caving in to manipulation or feeling defeated or humiliated.







, Be responsible for your own side and offer your information about your needs and wants. See what you and your partner can work out for a mutually satisfying resolution. Your partner cannot give you want you want if you don't have the courage to ask for it.

, Be willing to back up your requests and desires with a solution that is mutually satisfactory. Sometimes we say no to a new way of doing things simply because we have not thought of an alternative. Back up your statement with a good argument that is reasonable, and see the reaction. Don't force a solution that has not the complete approval of the other side…or you will be back at the issue in dispute very soon.

, Resolving conflict does not mean to take on more responsibility simply because it is easier than arguing, but sometimes it happens in this way. A relationship is a partnership, a joint effort to shoulder your own part of the deal. If one person ends up being responsible for making the union work on every level, resentment will build up and it will not last. Sometimes men are less articulate, but it does not mean that you can shy from a deep compromise to do your best to solve the issue.

, If the first solution doesn't work, don't be afraid to revisit the issue and make changes. Many times what seems doable in theory is flawed in reality. Do not chastise your partner, for that only will encourage avoidance in the future with other issues. What you need to build up is on the practice to share the discussion over the issue, the search for solutions and the agreement to do things in a different way.

, Send heartfelt messages of appreciation for the effort that the other side is doing. It is important to keep the conversation in a respectful and appreciative mood, and to say frequently that you are thankful for that. You are building now strategies of good communication that will last for ever!.

Wear skinny jeans, a flirty blouse (or a conversation-starting T-shirt), a pair of sandals or sneakers, and pull back your hair. You can braid it, don't just pull it in a pony-tail.;
, Making him jealous is good, if he likes you he will get jealous.

, Ignoring him is not a good thing, but occasionally a ""Hi, |insert name|, how are you?"" But completely ignoring him won't attract his attention towards you.

, ""Can we be friends?"" (yea, sure) ""Oh, can I please have your phone number or email so I can stay in touch on weekends"" (gives number/email).

, Say you have his email. Send him an email saying something like you miss him and can't wait to see him next time. Don't be TOO flirty, but be generously nice. Send winks and stuff too, once you get more comfortable.

, Once you flirt with him, if he is interested, he may ask you first; but if he doesn't, either way: ask him on a date. The school dance, the movies, any festival or something you both are interested in. E.g: Comic Con, Fair, Racing, anything.

, Or, you can tell him that you like him. Either way, it is going to come out that you like him.

, If he says yes, you are officially dating!

, But play hard to get. Here's how: he should call YOU. NEVER call a boy. Miss a few calls, or wait a while to respond to texts. DON'T make excuses. If you miss a call, don't say ""I am sorry, sweetie. I was asleep."" Instead, say nothing at all. Flirt with other guys, but don't lose your relationship.

, Hint a kiss, or, the easy way: Grab him by his shirt and kiss him. Just like in movies, this is a good move to make. It happens so fast he won't know what happened, except for he enjoyed it.

Listen to your boyfriend.,
Respond in a supportive way.,
Say his name.,
Compliment him.,
Arrange video chat dates.,
Send a romantic text.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Miss You1," Being a good listener is essential to a healthy relationship, but it can also help to increase your boyfriend’s feelings of attraction for you. This can mean that he will crave your companionship and want to see you when you are not around. To be a good listener, you will need to:








put away distractions such as your cell phone, laptop, or TV
maintain eye contact when he is talking
nod and make neutral statements such as “I see,” “uh-huh,” and “go on”
restate what he has just said now and then for clarity, such as “It sounds like you were really angry at him for borrowing your stuff without asking.”;
, Men are more attracted to women who are responsive to them.If you are responsive when your boyfriend shares something with you, then he will be more likely to seek you out when he has other problems. To be responsive, listen to your boyfriend when he shares a problem or struggle with you and respond in a supportive way.









For example, if your boyfriend shares something about how a coworker took credit for something he did, then you might respond with something like, “That’s awful! He must feel threatened by your abilities.”
Do not disregard your boyfriend’s feelings or ignore him when he shares a problem with you.

, Saying your boyfriend’s name when you are with him can make him feel more attracted to you as well. Saying his name lets him know that you are thinking about him and that you don’t have anything or anyone else on your mind. This can help him to feel valued and that feeling can last even after he is not with you.








Try saying your boyfriend’s name at unexpected times, such as in the middle of a story you are telling him or during a long hug.

, Let your boyfriend know you still desire him and find him attractive by giving him praise and compliments. When you compliment your boyfriend, it lets him know that you find him attractive and this will intensify his feelings for you.








Focus on complimenting a particular skill or activity that your boyfriend does well, like cooking your favorite dish or cleaning up around the house.
Try to compliment him as soon as he does something that you appreciate or find attractive.
Don’t worry if he only respond with a grunt or a smile. He will be drawn in by your compliment and develop an even deeper affection for you.

, You can use technology to your advantage, especially if you are in a long-distance relationship. Arrange video chat dates at least once per week. This will allow you and your boyfriend to see each other and talk face to face, even if it is through a phone or a computer.









Having a visual reference when he speaks to you will remind your boyfriend how much he misses you and give him images to return to when you are not around.

, If the two of you are busy and have not spoken over the phone for a couple of days, a quick romantic text message can remind him of you and why he enjoys being with you so much.









Your text can be as simple as “I love you!,” “I miss you!,” or “Thinking of you right now!”
Sexting can be a risky move, and sending explicit picture of yourself via text message is a risk best left unexplored in many cases. If you want to be romantic and sexy at the same time, you could try sending a message that lets him know how much you miss him and hints at how much you want him. For instance, try something like, “Just thinking about our last night together...” or “Looking forward to our next night together...”

Recognize that people have different communication styles.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Love You More," If you’ve been together for a while, it’s common for the two of you to start taking each other for granted. This is one of the most common challenges in relationships, but it doesn’t have to wreck yours.Try reflecting a few times a week on things you love about your boyfriend. Maybe it’s how he knows exactly when you’ve had a terrible day and brings you pizza and a movie. Maybe it’s how great he is at volleyball. Whatever it is that makes you love him, make an effort to think about these. Occasionally telling your boyfriend what’s so great about him is a good idea, too.
Don’t take this to the other extreme and become over-clingy, though. Constantly examining everything he does to see if he “really” loves you will only make you both anxious and stressed out. If he says he loves you, and his actions generally bear that out (remembering that everyone slips up occasionally), take him at his word.;
, It can be easy to “tune out” of conversations, especially if you aren’t really into them or you’re distracted with your own stuff. It happens to everyone. Learn to note when you zone out and practice “active listening” instead. Your boyfriend will feel more valued and acknowledged, and you might just learn some things you didn’t know.Restate and clarify what you heard. This step can save you a lot of grief, especially if you’re in an emotional conversation. Rather than assuming you heard correctly, paraphrase what you heard and ask for clarification: “Okay, let’s see if I heard you correctly. I heard you say ____. Is that right?” Then, let your boyfriend explain if you didn’t get something the first time.
Encourage. This shows that you’re into what your boyfriend’s saying. Ask little questions like “And then what happened?” or “What did you do?” You can also nod and use minimal encouragers, like “Uh-huh” or “Oh.”
Summarize. When you’ve had a conversation with a lot of info, summarize the main threads. This shows you were paying attention and offers space for any tweaks or feedback. “Okay, so you’re worried you’re going to have a really stressful day tomorrow at work, so you’d like me to pick you up after and we’ll go to the arcade tomorrow night. Right?”
These techniques are for more than just romantic relationships! They can improve your communication with anyone.

, This isn’t just “What did you do today?” or “What do you want to eat?” Asking probing, meaningful questions can enrich the conversations the two of you have. It helps encourage each other to share your feelings and thoughts. Studies have even shown that asking deep questions leads to improved intimacy and feeling like you’re in love.For example, if your boyfriend is talking about a problem with one of his classes, try asking a probing question, such as “What do you think would happen if you tried ____?”

, Questions and statements that focus on “you” messages and “whys” can cause problems.These sound blaming and make the other person shut down or respond defensively.For example, it’s not a good idea to ask a question like “Why do you always forget to pick me up from school"".this just makes you sound blaming and angry and not at all attractive
Instead, use “I”-statements. You can ask questions that request legitimate information, too. For example: “I noticed you weren't there to pick me up as we had decided earlier "" This doesn’t sound accusatory (as long as you keep away from sarcasm!), but it does communicate your feelings and gives your boyfriend a space to share his.

, Preaching is best left to professionals in pulpits. It’s tempting to give others advice, especially when you’re in a relationship. If someone has asked for your advice, then offer it. Otherwise, it can come across as patronizing, preachy, or like you don’t trust the other person enough to make his own decisions.Sometimes, when people ask for advice, what they’re really looking for is someone who will listen to them vent with a sympathetic ear. If you think this is happening with your boyfriend, ask: “Do you just need someone to listen, or do you want me to Try to find a fix for this?”Stay away from the “shoulds.” Nobody likes to be told “You should do this” or “You ought to do this.” It can make them feel stupid or like you’re being condescending. Instead, try something like “What about ___?” or “Have you tried ___?”

, This one is really hard. We’re all motivated by the desire to be “right” at least sometimes. In most situations, though, there really isn’t a clear “right” or “wrong.” Don’t approach a conversation with your boyfriend like it’s a battle.This doesn’t mean you don’t have a right to your emotions and thoughts. You do. How you feel is how you feel. Just remember that your boyfriend also has a right to his emotions and thoughts. There is no “right” or “wrong” with feelings. They just are. What you both control is your own responses to feelings.For example, imagine that your boyfriend comes to you and says you embarrassed him in front of his friends earlier. You may feel like that’s totally unfair, but take the time to acknowledge his feelings: “I’m sorry I embarrassed you.” Then you can explain your side: “I didn’t realize that would embarrass you. I’ll try not to do that again.”
If you start off from a place of defensiveness, the other person probably won’t hear anything past that. If you start off by acknowledging the other person’s feelings first, and then explaining when it’s appropriate, the other person will feel validated and s/he’s more likely to accept that you didn’t mean to offend.
Not insisting on being “right” doesn’t mean you have to be a pushover. If you feel strongly that something is important, talk about it. Just remember to also listen to the other person’s perspective. It may be that a compromise is the best solution.

, If you don’t share the intimate, sometimes embarrassing thoughts, needs, and feelings you have with each other, your relationship can suffer.Studies show that people who don’t openly communicate their feelings and needs with others don’t feel as emotionally secure or generally happy as those who do.Studies have also shown that couples who don’t communicate openly and directly with each other are more likely to feel uncertain about their relationships.Try not to dismiss your needs, or your boyfriend’s, as “stupid” or “immature.” Dismissal kills trust. Both of you need to feel like the other person is a safe person to share even the scariest stuff with.
Don’t hide or conceal your feelings in an effort to “be strong.” Suppressing or concealing your feelings can lead to resentment and cause serious damage to your relationship.When your boyfriend is sharing with you, demonstrate that you’re listening and empathizing by saying things like “I appreciate your willingness to share this with me” or “I hear you saying that you feel afraid because ___”. These open and accepting types of remarks will encourage him to see you as someone he can trust., Passive-aggressive behavior is the opposite of clear, open communication, and it can kill a relationship in no time. It’s usually motivated by anger or hurt. It may be tempting to “punish” your boyfriend if he’s upset or hurt you, but it’s much healthier (and more effective) to just talk it out. There are many ways to be passive-aggressive in a relationship, but here are a few to watch out for:“Forgetting” to do something. One common way people show passive-aggression in relationships is to “forget” to do something they don’t want to do. You might “forget” to buy tickets to that movie you really don’t want to go see. He might “forget” your anniversary if you upset him. This kind of behavior hurts both of you.
Saying things you don’t mean. Sarcasm is a quick way to hurt other people. Sometimes, people engage in passive-aggressive language to indirectly communicate that they are displeased or upset. For example, if your boyfriend forgot that you had a date together Friday night and bought tickets to a hockey game instead, a passive-aggressive response might look like this: “No, why would I be upset? I love it when you forget things that are important to me. You should definitely go that hockey game.” Instead of communicating your feelings with respect and clarity, this type of language provokes defensiveness and even confusion (some people are just not great at picking up on sarcasm).
Giving the “silent treatment.” If you feel upset or hurt, you may ignore or pretend not to hear your boyfriend. This type of behavior is damaging because it can kill genuine efforts to open a conversation, and may eventually discourage conversation altogether. If you need time to cool off -- which is totally healthy and natural -- be open about it: “I am too upset to talk about this right now. Please give me an hour, and then we’ll talk.”

, We communicate more with our non-verbal communication -- our body language and gestures -- than we do with what we say. Keep an eye on your body language. It may be sending messages you didn’t mean.Keep your arms uncrossed and loose. Folding your arms across your chest makes you look defensive or closed off.
Make eye contact. Not making eye contact can tell the other person that you’re not interested or listening to what he’s saying. Try to make eye contact at least 50% of the time while speaking, and 70% of the time while listening.Avoid pointing. This can feel accusatory or intimidating. Try gesturing with an open palm instead.
Keep your body turned toward the other person when you’re interacted. Facing away or to the side of the other person indicates that you’re not engaged with what’s going on.

, We live in a super-connected world, but ironically, this can actually cause you and your boyfriend to feel more distant from each other. You aren’t really communicating if you’re both on your phones or computers all the time. Commit to having some time for just the two of you: no phones, no computers, no video games.It’s really easy to pick up your phone without even realizing you’ve done it. If this is a problem for you, try putting your phone somewhere else, like a box by the door, when it’s your “no-tech time together.”
If you don’t live together, try talking on the phone or over Skype in addition to texting. A lot of communication involves non-verbal cues, like tone of voice, gestures, and facial expression. All of this is lost in texts.Try to chat for a least a few minutes as close to “in-person” as you can each day. This will help build a connection and make him want to continue that intimacy that you showed with him in the beginning.

, Remember when you first started dating, how every date was something new? And you were so excited to see each other that you could barely wait until date night? If you’ve fallen into a “rut” in your relationship, varying up your routines together can make both of you feel more excited to spend time together.Try something new. Trying new things together, whether it’s a new restaurant or a new hobby, will help you bond over the experience. It will also expand your “toolbox” of fun stuff to enjoy together.
Switch up your current routines. For example, if you love movie nights, see what you can do to make them more fun. See if an old theater is playing your favorite movie on the big screen. Check out “screenings under the stars” in the summer. Go to a dinner theater or a sing-a-long movie. Make a themed dinner for your next movie night (“Goodfellas” and spaghetti, anyone?).

, These don’t have to be huge. Even if it’s just working on homework at a coffee shop together, spending quality time together can help you feel more connected.

, Relationships work best when both people maintain some separate interests and spend time on their own or with their own friends.Both of you need to have an identity that doesn’t revolve around the other person. No one likes to be constantly watched or hovered over.


This shows him that you trust him. If you let him know he's earned your trust, he's actually less likely to throw that trust away. If you don't trust him to be responsible on his own, he could be more likely to betray that trust just because he resents not being trusted.No matter how much you love each other, no one person can meet every single need the other person has. Spending time with other friends and having outside interests helps both of you stay happy, healthy, well-rounded people. It also makes the time you spend together extra-special.

, Especially if your boyfriend enjoys getting gifts or surprises, making them really personal shows that you know him better than anyone else and you really pay attention to his needs and preferences. Think about the things your boyfriend would love to do/get, and use that as a guide.


Does your boyfriend like sports? Is he an adrenaline junky? Get the two of you a pair of tickets to a local football, basketball, or soccer game. Take him to an amusement park and ride as many roller coasters as you can in three hours.
Is your boyfriend the hopeless romantic type? In touch with his sensitive side? Get him an old Philip Larkin or John Keats book of poetry and inscribe something on the cover: ""With all my heart — the love that flows through these words is meant just for you.""
Is your boyfriend the outdoorsy type? Take him on a camping trip and snuggle up with him in his sleeping bag. Or maybe take him whale watching or bird-calling in your local Audubon Society.

, If your boyfriend enjoys words of affirmation (remember those love languages?), try leaving him a little note. Whether it’s straightforward, humorous, or even outright wacky, these little reminders can show you care.Gauge your note to what makes your boyfriend feel most comfortable. If he’s a little squeamish about gushy feelings, write him a playfully funny note. If he loves sincere expressions of feeling, tell him how much he means to you.
Humans quickly get used to even positive things in their lives. This is called “hedonic adaptation.” Make sure you don’t leave so many notes that they stop being meaningful. Too much of a good thing really is still too much., Displays of affection are especially important if your boyfriend values “Physical Touch” as a love language. Don’t do anything that embarrasses him, but let him know you think he’s adorable.


Check out what your boyfriend likes. He may love it when you nibble on his neck, or he may hate it. Knowing what makes him feel loved and what turns him on will help you display your affection in healthy ways.
Dressing in “sexy” clothes for your boyfriend can add a little spice to your relationship. Find out if he has a fantasy or something he finds hot and do something special every now and then. He will be more than happy to return the favor.
Remember that there are other ways to show physical affection than sex. Try holding hands, hugging, kissing, and cuddling, too. It’s good to have a variety of ways to show your affection for each other.
Don’t take it personally if your boyfriend isn’t into the same physical displays of affection that you are. People are different., It’s important for the two of you to have separate interests and your own friends, but it can also strengthen your relationship to spend time with each other’s friends, too.A common problem in new relationships is that you start spending more time with your new boyfriend and less time with your friends. This can cause your friends to feel neglected, and it can also put strain on your relationship. Integrate your boyfriend into your social circle by inviting him out once in a while. Go out with his friends once in a while, too.

, Have a quiet dinner, for example, and let your boyfriend know how much he means to you. Let him share some of his opinions and his feelings. Really listen to what he has to say, but offer comments to make the conversation flow. Clear some things up if you need to.


Go on dates that you think he would appreciate. Think of activities where you both can be close together such as: a boat ride, a nature hike, a trip to the zoo, a train trip, a day trip to a nearby town, etc.

, Take a day off. Do something totally unexpected, like making music together and recording it. Take advantage of your new found freedom, even if it's just a day, and live like you've got one day to love.Making memories together will give you something to reminisce about later. Research shows that remembering fun experiences you had together later will help you feel more bonded to each other., According to psychologist Gary Chapman, people have “love languages” that they use to show love themselves and interpret demonstrations of love from other people. Knowing each other’s love languages allows you to show your love in the way that the other person will most strongly connect with. If you and your boyfriend have different love languages and don’t know it, it can cause a lot of stress. The five love languages, according to Chapman, are “Words of Affirmation,” “Acts of Service,” “Receiving Gifts,” “Quality Time,” and “Physical Touch.”“Words of Affirmation” are things like compliments, encouragement, or “check-ins” about your feelings.
“Acts of Service” are things like doing chores or everyday stuff that the other person may not enjoy doing.
“Receiving Gifts” are things like gifts or visible symbols of love, like flowers.
“Quality Time” is time with your partner without interruptions or distractions.
“Physical Touch” can be any demonstration of physical affection, including hugging, kissing, or sex.


The key to these languages is sharing them with each other. That way, if your boyfriend prefers “Physical Touch” to “Receiving Gifts,” you’ll know how to show him you love him in a way he connects with. Similarly, if your boyfriend knows “Receiving Gifts” is your top language, he won’t be confused when you don’t naturally see his taking out the trash regularly as a sign of love.
It’s also important to keep these in mind so that you can be on the lookout for love signals that you might not otherwise pick up on.

, These three components make up Robert Sternberg's theory of love. Although psychologists have varying opinions, in general, romantic “love” is the drive you feel toward feeling intimacy and commitment with a particular person. Passion, or lust, is sexual desire, which may or may not be limited to one person. In relationships, lust is often the instigating feeling: when you find someone hot, you become interested in pursuing him/her. Love requires time to develop and thrive.In relationships, it’s natural for both of these feelings to have ups and downs. In the beginning of a relationship -- often called the “honeymoon phase” -- it’s very common for lust to be at a peak: both of you can’t keep your hands off each other and you’re obsessed with how sexy the other person is.This is great, but it’s also natural for this phase to fade as you spend more time together and get to know each other more deeply.After the initial burst of lust fades, you may find that you’ve been idealizing your boyfriend thanks to chemicals in your brain going a little crazy.When that pedestal comes crashing down, you’ll start noticing things that annoy you, like how he flosses in front of you or checks out his groceries at the store differently than you do. This is normal. It’s where the “love” comes in. Love gives you the patience to ignore the little annoyances because you really dig this guy.
This doesn’t mean lust has to disappear once you’ve been dating a few months. Take some time to explore what turns both of you on. Communicate your sexual needs to each other. Spice up your routines. Have fun with each other!

, “Men are from Mars, women are from Venus” is a common truism, but the truth is actually more complicated. Even people of the same gender can have very different communication styles. Whether you’re gay or straight, if it feels like you and your boyfriend are sometimes speaking different languages, it could be because your communication styles aren’t the same. There’s nothing inherently “better” about one way or the other, but it’s helpful to understand how both of you communicate.Some people are affiliative communicators. Affiliative communicators enjoy asking others for feedback. They tend to prefer collaboration, and may see challenges or disagreement as signs of aggression or hostility. If you prefer to listen to all sides, avoid conflict, approach issues collaboratively, and speak up less rarely, you may be an affiliative communicator.
Some people are competitive communicators. Competitive communicators tend to be direct, assertive, and okay with presenting challenges. They like to gather information and make their own decisions. They often prefer to be in charge. If you speak your mind readily, feel comfortable with conflict, and prefer to make decisions on your own, you may be a competitive communicator.
People can also vary in terms of their directness. Some people are comfortable with direct communication, such as “I want to spend more time together.” Others are more comfortable with indirect communication, such as “It’s fun when we spend time together. It’s too bad we don’t do it more.” Either form can be appropriate, depending on the situation. The important thing is to listen to each other and clarify when you don’t understand.
Having different communication styles doesn’t mean your relationship is doomed. It just means you need to know what differences can cause tension between you, and both of you need to commit to flexibility and compromise.

Keep a clean appearance.,
Wear the right clothes.,
Stay fit.",How to Make Women Adore You1," Personal hygiene is important to most people who are looking for a partner. That doesn't necessarily mean that you need a day at the spa every time you go out, but it does mean taking basic steps to care for yourself and your body. Before going out on a date or to a social event, it's best to make sure you've showered, shaved or groomed your facial hair (if relevant), put on deodorant, and brushed your teeth., For some people, fashion is important. But if you can't afford or aren't interested in keeping up with the latest brands and designers, you should still make wardrobe choices that are attractive and fashionable. That's because studies have shown that wearing fashionable or otherwise attractive outfits can help give a positive first impression to a potential mate.Your clothes and your physical appearance are the first things a person sees when they spot you across a bar or restaurant, so making appropriate wardrobe choices can help you make a strong first impression.


You don't have to go broke buying the most trendy clothing line of the year, but you should wear an outfit that you're comfortable in and that looks good on you. If you have a particular pair of pants or a dress that you feel confident and attractive in, then it's a good outfit for meeting women., You don't need to have a model's figure to be a viable partner. But for many people, basic physical fitness is an attractive quality.Being physically fit doesn't mean starving yourself and spending hours at the gym. There's nothing wrong with naturally have a larger body type, and you shouldn't try to radically alter your physical appearance for the sake of others. But maintaining some level of personal fitness - whatever level you're comfortable with - may help you feel more confident and attractive to women."

Surprise him with a gift or a special date.,
Write him a love letter.,
Treat your boyfriend.,
Leave something behind.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Miss You2," A good way to make your boyfriend miss you is to create special memories together that he will not want to forget. This could mean surprising him with a special gift, like an item of clothing he has always wanted, or planning a special date to see a band he really likes.









Keep the relationship spontaneous and exciting by planning surprise activities that you can do together. This will allow you and your boyfriend to spend quality time together and build memories that will serve as reminders of how enjoyable your relationship is.

, Be extra romantic and write down your feelings and emotions in a letter for your boyfriend to find later on his pillow, in his bag, or in his car. Use nice stationery and be as intimate and honest as you can. Seal the letter and leave it somewhere where he can find it easily. When he finds it and opens it, he will think of you and miss your loving presence.









You can also send him a loving text via your phone, and remember to wish him good night or good morning, especially if you are apart from each other. This will help you both to maintain a strong connection to each other and show your boyfriend he is always on your mind.

, Find a way to surprise and treat your boyfriend now and then. Prepare his favorite meal, give him a massage, or allow him time to focus on his own hobbies or passions. This will show him how generous and loving you can be. Doing things he enjoys can be a good reminder that your relationship is valuable and he will miss good treatment from you when you are away.









Make sure that you do not neglect your needs in order to meet your boyfriend’s needs. Just try to find little ways to surprise him now and then so that he will be more likely to miss you when you are not with him.

, Leaving a small item at your boyfriend’s house may remind him of you when he least expects it. Try leaving an earring, hair clip, or some other small items that will remind him of you when he finds it.









Leaving an earring behind can be subtle and symbolic. Earrings are a pair, so leaving one behind implies that that the pair will come together again just as you and your boyfriend will come together again.
Avoid leaving behind anything too essential. Your house keys, wallet, or driver's license are necessary parts of your daily life, so you will need to turn right back around to retrieve them. This will not give your boyfriend enough time to miss you.

Look your best.,
Show off your great personality.,
Make eye contact.,
Wear red.,
Choose a signature scent.,
Maintain a social life outside of your relationship.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Miss You3," Physical attraction is important in a relationship, but that does not mean that you have to look perfect. Men are more attracted to women who show that they take care of themselves and try to look their best. To show that you take good care of yourself, make sure that you:shower every day
style your hair
brush your teeth twice daily
wear clothes that fit you well and make you feel attractive
exercise at least a few times per week
keep your nails clean and trimmed
wear a little makeup now and then (only if you like to wear makeup)

, Physical attraction is important, but men are even more attracted to women who have positive personality traits.Make sure that you show your boyfriend what great personality you have by demonstrating your traits.


You can show off your personality just by being yourself, but you can also try to highlight some of the traits that your boyfriend finds attractive. For example, you can show that you are kind by being polite to the waiter when you are out to dinner. Or, show that you are an optimist by pointing out the bright side of things as much as possible.

, Gazing into your boyfriend’s eyes for two minutes can increase his feelings of attraction for you and vice versa.Make sure that eye contact is a regular part of your time spent together so that he will be more likely to remember those romantic feelings when you are apart.


Try catching his eye when he is walking by you in the hall and hold the gaze for a minute. Or, during a discussion over coffee make sure that you hold his gaze for a little longer than usual.

, The color red seems to attract men to women more than other colors.To take advantage of this, try wearing red more often when your boyfriend will see you.


For example, you could wear a red sweater when you drop off something to him at work or keep a red scarf handy and pop it on before your boyfriend comes over.

, Scents can draw out memories, so make sure that you wear a specific perfume or body spray whenever you are with your boyfriend.Over time, he should start to associate that scent with positive feelings about you and smelling the scent may make him miss you.


If you sleep over at your boyfriend’s house, then you can spray a bit of your perfume on his pillow before you leave. Later when he goes to bed alone, he will smell your perfume and he may start to miss you.
Try wearing one of your boyfriend’s favorite sweatshirts for a few hours (with permission of course). Make sure that you are wearing your perfume so that a bit of it will get on the sweatshirt. Return the sweatshirt to him with your scent on it.

, Rather than always being available to your boyfriend, it is important that you maintain your relationships with friends and family. Being independent and not always having to spend time around your boyfriend will make your boyfriend value the time you spend together even more.


Go out with your friends on your own, or spend time with family without your boyfriend. Encourage your boyfriend to do the same. When you see him again after having your separate social activities, be pleasant and make sure he knows that you want him to have fun when he is not with you as well.Avoid texting him too much when you are apart. Instead, send a message to make sure that he is having a good time and then don’t text him any more for the day or night.
Do not drop your plans to spend time with him. Your relationship will be much healthier and more fulfilling if you both have a certain level of independence and do not spend every moment together.

Choose the right photograph.,
Create a good username.,
Write a compelling profile.,
Send the right message.",How to Make Women Adore You2," When choosing a profile picture (if you have an online dating profile), it's important to choose carefully, as this will create your first impression. You should certainly choose a photograph that you feel showcases your attractive qualities, but equally important is to choose a photograph that conveys personality. Consider your dating profile picture as the way you would want a woman to see you at a bar or singles event, and choose a picture that showcases your best qualities and characteristics.


Studies show that a genuine smile (aka a Duchenne smile) in a dating profile can communicate a sense of humor and an easy-going, pleasant personality.Slightly tilting or angling your head to the side can convey a sense of mystery or playfulness.If your dating profile allows you to post multiple photographs, include one that shows you with a group of friends smiling and having fun. It's even better if you're more or less in the middle of your group of friends, as this conveys a sense of importance and creates a desirability to be around you., You may not think much of your username, but there's a good chance that a woman looking at your profile might. Studies suggest that a username that conveys intelligence or a career drive are often more attractive to women online. You may also want to choose a username with a lower alphabetical letter at the start of your name, because many dating sites return profile searches in alphabetical order.Intelligence and creativity are typically desirable traits in a partner because they convey that the person will most likely pass on those desirable traits to a hypothetical child. Though most people aren't consciously thinking of what kind of parent their partner will be one day, those factors do drive some aspects of our subconscious attractions to others., Your name and picture may be the things that draw a woman to your profile, but it's a compelling ""about me"" section that will make a woman decide if you'll be a match or not. It's important to be honest and describe yourself and your interests sincerely, but you should also devote a little space to what you're looking for in a partner. Some experts recommend a 70 percent/30 percent split between yourself and what you're looking for to avoid coming across as shallow or self-absorbed.Some studies suggest that women tend to find self-descriptions depicting confidence, bravery, courage, and risk-taking more attractive in a potential partner's online profile.Some of the most desirable hobbies worth mentioning (if you engage in these hobbies) include playing sports, playing/writing/recording music, taking artistic photographs, and taking spontaneous trips or outings., Once you and a woman have expressed an interest in one another online, the next step is contacting the other person. If you're sending a message to a woman (or responding to a woman's message), you want to write a message that will convey the right things to that woman. The message should be personalized, engaging, and should highlight your best qualities.Incorporate the qualities you believe make you most desirable, such as a sense of humor or a sincerely kind personality.Read the woman's profile, and personalize the message you write to include some mutual interests and hobbies. This will show that you've taken the time to read her profile, and have things in common with her.Express an interest in the woman's job or educational background.Proofread. Many experts agree that spelling and grammar errors are a quick turn-off for some women, and if nothing else may cause you to appear less educated or informed than you actually are."

Go out.,
Avoid pickup lines.,
Have a meaningful conversation.,
Recognize your body language.,
Be positive and pleasant.,
Use humor.,
Wear red.",How to Make Women Adore You3," It may seem obvious, but the first step in meeting women is putting yourself out there. Even in the world of online dating, you'll need to meet in person at some point. That means being willing to go out to social places where singles often meet: bars, restaurants, night clubs, or even more social events like shared-interest clubs, organized social outings, or simply getting together with a larger group of friends.Find social activities online, or try going to a social place near your home where you feel comfortable. And when you get there, make a point of talking to people. That doesn't mean being aggressively flirtatious, but it does mean approaching people and starting a conversation., Some people think that the best way to engage a woman in conversation is by using a pickup line. Pickup lines (occasionally) work in movies, which creates the illusion that pickup lines may work in real life. The truth, however, is that most women find pickup lines cheesy, annoying, or downright repulsive. Women simply don't want to hear pickup lines because they're unoriginal and often insulting to a woman's intelligence. Find something more creative and engaging to say, and you may end up initiating a meaningful and memorable conversation.Rather than using a pickup line to approach a woman, try simply saying ""hi"" or ""hello"" and introducing yourself. If the woman seems receptive, ask her about herself, or start a conversation about an interest she might share., If you approach a woman, or if she approaches you, and you've managed to avoid using a cheesy pickup line, you'll need to engage in a real conversation. That is the only thing that will keep the dialogue going, and potentially further her interest in you (and vice versa). The key to a meaningful conversation is to create a real dialogue, rather than a monologue. Engage with one another, and see where the conversation leads you.Minimize the time you ""control"" the conversation. Don't make it all about you and your interests. If she asks about you, then certainly tell her a little about yourself, but don't dominate the conversational space with your own interests. Let her speak, and let the things she says determine where the conversation moves.Ask open-ended questions to follow-up the things she says. For example, instead of saying ""You must love animals, since you became a veterinarian,"" ask an open-ended question, such as, ""What made you want to become a veterinarian?"" or ""When did you know you had a passion for animals?""Listen without reacting. Don't judge the things she says, and avoid trying to insert your own ideas or values into the context of what she says.Don't assume that she thinks, sees, and feels the same way you think, see, and feel (and vice versa)., If you're trying to have a pleasant conversation with someone you've just met, use respectful and engaging body language to let her know that you're interested in what she's saying. For example, try to maintain a warm eye contact, face the woman while you're conversing (rather than standing at an angle or turned away from her), and try to keep your arms open instead of crossed.That doesn't necessarily mean use flirtatious body language, just maintaining a respectful and open posture to convey your interest in continuing the conversation.


Maintain a confident posture. That means a straight back, shoulders broad (not hunched or slouched), and keeping your chin around 90 degrees (rather than looking down at the floor, which may convey insecurity).Smile warmly, but not in a forced, salesman-like manner. Give a sincere, kind smile, and it will make you highly approachable.Don't stare, but make eye contact during conversation for a long-enough period that it shows an interest.Don't talk too fast or act jittery. Some studies suggest that a relatively slow pace conveys confidence and self-assurance.Wait a second or so before responding when the other person has finished speaking. That shows that you are being respectful and calmly processing what she's said, while also allowing her a moment in case she wants to add to anything she's finished saying., While physical attraction is certainly a component of many relationships, it is not the only component. Having a desirable personality is often at the top of many people's ideal traits. That means being positive, pleasant, friendly, and fun to be around. Attraction may get a woman to approach you, but it's an enjoyable personality that will decide whether she'll continue to carry on a conversation with you.Some positive traits that women often desire include being optimistic, thoughtful, sympathetic, well-behaved, and entertaining., Some people are naturally more funny than others. But even if you don't have a history of performing standup comedy, you probably still have a sense of humor. Whether your style of humor is observational, conversational, self-depreciating, or simple joke-telling, you may want to consider letting your funny side out while courting a woman. Studies have shown that many women find a sense of humor to be tremendously attractive, and are more likely to engage in conversation with someone who is funny or otherwise entertaining.Using humor doesn't mean you need to be a laugh machine. Trying too hard to be funny may be a turnoff for some women. So don't try to be all laughs all the time, but by all means let yourself be amusing and entertaining, if that's the kind of person you are deep down.
Even if you're not comfortable being funny, studies suggest that simply smiling at someone you're interested in may be enough to catch their interest. If you want to catch a woman's eye and your instinct is to be funny, then go for it. But if humor's not your thing, try to smile to make yourself appear more fun and approachable., It may sound strange, but studies have shown that both men and women are deeply attracted to people who wear the color red. That's because red has subconscious associations with sexuality, fertility, health, and social status.Some psychologists therefore recommend wearing an article of clothing that is red in order to send visual cues that you are a suitable partner.If you're dressing elegantly for an occasion, wear a red tie (if you're a man) or a red dress (if you're a woman) to impress the women you meet. If you're going to a more casual occasion, wear a red shirt or blouse to catch a woman's eye."
"
Ask her out.,
Plan a good date.,
Flirt with her.,
Be honest.",How to Make Women Adore You4," If you've met a woman you're interested in and you seem to have hit it off well conversationally, the next step is to ask the woman out on a date. Here it is particularly important that you avoid pickup lines or cheesy remarks, as this is sort of a make-or-break situation. If you like the woman and she seems to like you, be polite and respectful while asking about concrete plans. Try saying something like, ""I have to be going soon, but I was wondering - would you like to get together for coffee or a drink this weekend?""The best way of asking someone out is a respectful, open invitation. The example above is structured around more-or-less concrete plans: one or both of you may be busy on a particular day, but ""the weekend"" is open and flexible, and having coffee or a drink leaves the ball in her court on what she would like to do. Either way, it's an invitation to a social place within a set time frame., An ideal first date should give you both a chance to get to know one another, while also offering some level of energy. For example, after dinner or coffee (or whatever activity/atmosphere you plan), you may want to go for a long walk together. That way, if the conversation starts to lag, you'll have something to talk about: the park, the city scenery, or the surrounding neighborhood's atmosphere., If you're on a date and you think it's going well, it's okay to be a little flirty. You don't have to be overt about it - in fact, subtle flirting may be even more approachable, and is generally preferred in courting rituals. Most people don't like flirting that feels like flirting, so be somewhat subtle and suggestive in expressing your interest.Lock eyes for a few seconds, then look away. Don't stare, but don't appear disinterested, either.Smile and convey happiness and interest.Try to replicate her body language. This shouldn't be an exact replication, of course, but if she's exhibiting body language that conveys an interest, exhibit your own interested body language., Honesty goes both ways: you owe it to your date to be honest with her, but you should also be honest with yourself. If you meet and go on a date and you know, deep down, that it's not going to work, recognize that. That feeling won't go away with time, and will only make things more difficult when you do eventually end the relationship.Be prepared to politely tell her it's not going to work, if that's how you feel. If you know things won't work out, say at the end of the date, ""I enjoyed meeting you, and this has been fun, but I don't think this would work out. Thank you for a lovely evening, though. Take care."" You should also be prepared to hear her say those words to you."

Make time for each other.,
Don’t lose yourself in your relationship.,
Try not to not smother one another.,
Communicate with one another.",How to Make a Relationship Work if You're in College1," College brings along all kinds of new challenges, especially in your first year. You may suddenly be very busy with classes, social activities, and studying. But, you will need to prioritize your significant other and make sure you give them an appropriate amount of time and attention.


Even though it’s important to give your boyfriend or girlfriend your attention, it will need to be a balance. You are obviously in college because you want to succeed in school, so make sure you are giving the right amount of time to all of your academic responsibilities.Sometimes, combining the priorities of school and a significant other can work, too—try having study dates, or doing homework together.;
, Similarly to making your significant other a priority and making time for them, you need to make sure you make time for yourself.


Taking time for yourself might seem like an easy thing to do, but you might find out it can be difficult! If you are having trouble making time for yourself, put it in your planner or on your calendar, and make sure not to schedule anything else during that time.

, If you go to the same school, or even take some of the same classes, the two of you might begin to feel a little overwhelmed from too much time together. Make sure to pencil some alone time into your schedule., Talk to each other honestly and openly. Do not harbor any secrets or grievances. These omissions can end up weakening your bond, especially when they finally come out.


Simply talking isn’t necessarily good communication. Make sure you are really listening to your significant other rather than just waiting for your turn to speak.An advantage of living near your boyfriend or girlfriend through college is that when you communicate with them, you can also read into their body language. For example, folded arms might indicate defensiveness, while a lack of making eye contact might signal disinterest or even shame."

Compliment him.,
Lock eyes with him.,
Kiss with passion.,
Surprise him.,
Encourage him.,
Show your confidence.,
Tell him about yourself.,
Pay attention to what your boyfriend is attracted to.,
Keep your time together light and fun.,
Stay close by.,
Respect your boyfriend’s personal space and enjoy yours as well.,
Mirror his movements.,
Play hard to get.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Go Crazy over You," Complimenting your boyfriend is an important way to help him feel appreciated and loved. By complimenting him, you will show him that you accept him as he is and that you like the things that he says and does.

It is important to compliment your boyfriend for his big accomplishments, but you should also try paying your boyfriend compliments when he does little things as well. For example:

“Wow, that was an amazing kiss.”
“You looked so sexy and manly out there cutting the grass.”
“You were so good in the game today; it’s such a turn on watching you play.”;
, Eye contact is a great nonverbal way to show your acceptance of someone. When we like people, we are more likely to make eye contact with them.Show your boyfriend that you love and accept him by gazing into his eyes. If he returns your feelings, then he should gaze into you eyes in return.

, Kissing is one of the ways that we evaluate our partners, so being a good kisser is really important. Kissing can also help to improve your boyfriend’s feeling of attraction and connection to you. To be a good kisser, try to keep some things in mind:

It’s okay to start off a kiss with your mouth closed and move into a more passionate kind of kiss if the mood is right.
Make sure your teeth are clean and your breath is fresh before you attempt a kiss.
Focus on him and nothing else when you are kissing. Being distracted while kissing can be a big turn-off.
Try touching the back of his head or neck or stroking his arm while you kiss. These extra touches can be a great way to enhance a kiss.

, Nothing helps spark or reignite passion like a little spontaneity. It can help break up your normal routine and show him that you feel crazy about him, which could inspire him to go crazy over you. Be flirty and live in the moment at all times, and he will always feel excited to be around you. Some spontaneous ideas to consider:


If your car breaks down in the rain, don’t just sit in the car waiting for him to fix it. Jump out and dance with him on the side of the road.
If you normally watch his favorite sports team at home, surprise him with tickets or take him out to a local restaurant with huge TVs to watch the game instead.
Take on a sexy alter ego and stay in character during your entire date.

, One huge part of sparking desire in your partner is helping him feel good about himself. Encourage him in his goals like you would encourage a friend. Make sure that he knows that you are there for him and that you support him.


For example, if your boyfriend is worried about a job interview, then you can encourage him by saying something like, ""You are going to be great! They would not have called you for an interview if they did not already think you were a good choice for the job!""

, Confidence is a really sexy quality for most people, so feel free to be your most confident when you are with your boyfriend. You can demonstrate your confidence by doing things like sharing your accomplishments and acknowledging your strengths.


Keep in mind that some people find confidence a little intimidating. If your boyfriend has low self-confidence, then projecting your confidence may not increase his desire for you., Revealing things about yourself will help to enhance your boyfriend’s feelings for you.Tell him all about yourself, including your interests, your goals, and your family. Be careful not to reveal too much too soon, though. Keeping some aspects of your life, goals, and feelings can add mystery to your relationship, which may help to increase his interest in you.

, Your boyfriend may have some specific things that attract him, so try to pay attention when he tells you that you look sexy. Perhaps your boyfriend loves lingerie, or maybe he thinks you look sexiest right after a workout. Some things that might help include:



Wearing eye makeup. Eye makeup has been shown to make women seem more attractive to some men.Try wearing some eyeliner or eyeshadow and mascara when your boyfriend is around.

Using unscented or lightly scented products on your body. It is important for your boyfriend to be able to smell your natural scent. This scent can help him to experience strong feelings of attraction.Try wearing unscented deodorant and using unscented bath products so that your boyfriend can smell your natural scent.

Wearing red clothing now and then. One study found that men are more attracted by the color red than any other color.Get a red dress or sweater to wear on a date with your boyfriend and see what happens.

, In addition to being sexy and desirable, another great way to drive your boyfriend wild is to just be a fun loving person. You want him to want to hang out with you, and showing him that you are the type of person who is up for a good time is a great hook. Don’t try to be someone you’re not, but know that there are a lot of ways to have a good time. Some ideas include:


Go for a hike and race him to the top for the last leg. Laughing through a competitive situation will bond you and endear you to him.
Go out to watch a sports game with him and his friends and impress them with your knowledge of the game.
Play a game of truth or dare to show him you can be silly and fun.

, Proximity has been found to increase feelings that people have for each other. In other words, the more that you see someone, the more likely you are to like that person.To make this work for you, try stopping by your boyfriend’s locker on the way to class, suggest some regular study sessions, or find ways to see more of him.

, A great way to make your boyfriend go crazy over you is to make sure that you give him a chance to miss being with you all of the time. Some of the initial spark and passion fizzle out because you get too comfortable with each other. You want him to miss you, but you also want him to know that he isn’t your sole source of happiness.


Make plans to spend time with your girlfriends one night per week and encourage him to have a guys night.

, Mirroring someone’s movements can increase their feelings of attraction for you.To make this work for you, try to copy his physical position now and then. For example, if your boyfriend readjusts himself in his seat and leans on his right hand, wait a few seconds and do the same. Make sure that you are leaning on your left hand so that you look like a mirror image of him.


Try to be subtle about this. Mirroring often happens without people noticing they are doing it and it is important to avoid making it too obvious or it might seem strange.

, Even though you are already dating, you can increase your partner’s desire for you by playing hard to get.Some easy ways to play hard to get with your boyfriend include:


Waiting 15 minutes to respond to a non-urgent text or missing a call every so often.
Asking to reschedule if he asks for a date and you already have plans.
Denying him a kiss now and then.

Talk to the biological parent first.,
Stand in the shoes of your stepdaughter.,
Buy a small gift for your stepdaughter.,
Spend time together.,
Give your stepdaughter the gift of time.",How to Make Friends with a Stepdaughter," Find out what the daughter's interests are and the sorts of things she enjoys most. Knowing this in advance will help you to avoid any awkward silences and can help you to build bridges towards a strong relationship. Another good reason for finding out what your stepdaughter likes is that you can look up anything you're unfamiliar with, so that you can ask well informed questions to encourage her to talk more about it.
, Be aware that an older stepdaughter may perceive you as a threat. If so, it is important to try to explain early on that you have no intentions of replacing their same sex parent in anyway, and that you are simply another bonus person in their lives, a person who cares about them and will look out for them too. This will help to reassure your stepdaughter that it's okay to like someone new and will alleviate any guilt they might be experiencing., Again, focus on something that you know she likes and keep it small. This isn't about bribing for her affections, it's about showing that you cared enough to go out of your way to find something you think she'll like. Giving a gift can open up the channels of communication, making it easier to talk together., Set aside time to spend with your stepdaughter without other people being around. This can be a good chance to bond, doing an activity that she enjoys, such as going to the movies, horse-riding, walking on the beach or window-shopping. Be sure to include a visit to a cafe or have something such as a picnic, so that the two of you have time to sit still and just talk together, away from the rest of the usual family hubbub. This can help both of you get to know each other better., Realize that she may need more time to warm to you; don't worry if it takes a while, she clearly needs the time to work through all the changes and see the real you. Go about your activities as normal, staying polite and upbeat around her, and letting her know that you're open to talk and that you're there for her, as needed. In time, your stepdaughter will learn to trust you and begin to open up. By not pressuring her, she will realize that you're friendly and neither pushy nor bossy."

Be open to the possibilities of tension.,
Create clear ground rules.,
Trust yourselves.,
Consider all the benefits of a platonic relationship.,
Reassure others who might be impacted by your platonic relationship.,
Be realistic.",How to Make a Platonic Relationship Work," Unless you and your platonic friend are not romantically or sexually attracted to people of their gender and your gender, there is always a possibility that one of you could develop a crush on the other. It's not unusual, but it can make the platonic relationship a difficult one to maintain.;
, Avoid getting into the ""friends first"" difficulty. If you both agreed that having a relationship was off the cards for such reasons as married status, work or study pressures, distance, religion, etc., the ""potential"" for a romantic affiliation hangs there unspoken. It is much better to make it clear that you have a friendship that matters, in which both of you care for one another in a sibling-like manner by watching out for one another and spending time together but that friendship is all it remains.

, All the ""possibilities"" aside, have trust in your decision. Nature and societal pressures are not determinants of you, your friend, or your choices. You are responsible for your own choices and the decision to make the relationship platonic is your clear-cut choice. Believe in it for what it is and trust both of you to fulfill the platonic compact.

, It helps to remember what is gained by remaining platonic rather than ever being tempted to throw that away in a moment of romantic weakness. The benefits of platonic friendships include:


They endure because you trust one another and share a lot together at a spiritual, emotional and shared experiences level
You aren't plagued by the intimacy of romantic love and sexual relations, with all the accompanying doubts, jealousies, complications, etc.
Neither of you need to perform in front of one another; you are who you are
You can learn about another gender from one another in a safe and uncompromising way, if you two are of different genders
Both of you benefit from each other's perspectives on challenges facing you in relations with other people
There is always someone you can go to for genuine, fearless, and forthright advice - platonic friendships tend to have a quality that transcends the often unspoken competitive and conforming needs of same gender friendships

, Where there are partners, spouses, lovers, etc., involved, it can be helpful to clear the air with them early on about the nature of your platonic friendship. Do likewise for your platonic friend's other half where politic. Stay out of potentially compromising situations, such as being at their apartment late at night without your spouse's knowledge/agreement. Acknowledge that sometimes the partner's concerns about your platonic relationship can be the hardest part of maintaining a platonic friendship. Your spouse needs to know that (a) you aren't talking or complaining about them, (b) you will be open with your spouse about what you say and do with your platonic friend, (c) there will be no secretive actions, and (d) you will not let the platonic friend supplant the relationship you have with your spouse.

, It just may well be that some of the deliberately suppressed tension in your relationship is what provides both of you with the spark to make it work so well. This never-fulfilled but potential reality can be the source of incredible creativity, discovery, and problem-solving when the two of you work together on something. While you should never act on it, it is sometimes worth acknowledging to yourself that this does form part of what makes the platonic friendship work so well.

Keep reasonable expectations.",How to Make a Long Distance Relationship Work in College," Keeping busy shouldn’t be a problem for most college students, what with classes, projects, homework, social activities, part-time jobs, etc. However, make a concerted effort to fill your free time when in a long distance relationship, so that you aren’t sitting around pining for your significant other.Keeping busy provides a distraction from the pain of separation, but it also provides opportunities to make friends, get involved in clubs and activities, and embrace the college experience.
Sitting around all the time wishing you were back home with your boyfriend or girlfriend won’t be good for your college experience, and it probably won’t do your relationship any good either.;
, No matter if you are single or romantically attached, time management is a crucial skill for a college student. When you factor in the demands of a long distance relationship, the importance of scheduling and utilizing your precious time wisely only increases.Plan ahead for mutually-beneficial times for regular phone calls and the like. During a call, try to multitask without removing focus from your boyfriend or girlfriend; talk while you walk on a treadmill, for instance.
Plot out your visits home ahead of time so that you can ensure sufficient time to spend with your parents and family, while also sharing as much time as you can with your boyfriend or girlfriend.

, Regular visits give a long distance relationship a revitalizing ""shot in the arm."" However, excessive pressures or demands regarding visits can be damaging to both the relationship and your college experience.Recognize the time and monetary commitments that are required of a visit by your ""sweetheart."" Don't demand more of either than what your boyfriend or girlfriend can afford.
If it helps, agree upon ""ground rules"" for the frequency of and expectations for visits. Work in visits around busy times for either or both of you (midterms, big class presentations, etc.).

, Whether you’re in a relationship or not, college is a big step in your development as an individual. There’s no guarantee that your relationship will make it in the long run, but you can be sure that you will regret not making the most of your time in college.Always wanted to join a band? Do it. Feel like challenging yourself with an elective biochemistry class? Go for it. Want to write for the student newspaper? Give it a try. These kinds of opportunities for “tasting” new and different experiences don’t come around all that often in life.

, Don't miss out on enjoying your time in college. Try new things. Make new friends. Go new places. Sure, it would be great if you could do them with your “sweetheart” by your side, but depriving yourself of happiness out of misguided loyalty to your significant other is likely to only build resentment on your part.You shouldn't feel guilty about trying new things and enjoying yourself while your significant other is far away. If he or she can’t support your efforts to “find yourself” and maximize your experience, then the relationship may not be built to last anyway.
A supportive boyfriend or girlfriend will want you to be happy and have a good time, but even the most secure boyfriend or girlfriend may feel a bit jealous. Make sure you talk about and also carve out actual time for fun activities you can share from a distance or when you get to be together.

, Whether you’re starting college when you’re 18 or 35, you won’t emerge from your time at school as the same exact person. You will grow and change, your partner will grow and change, and so will your relationship. This is what is supposed to happen. In successful relationships, people learn to adapt to each other as they grow. In the relationship, people can also grow together, which can be a challenge for long-term relationships. Making an effort to concentrate on adapting and growing together will help the relationship. People and relationships that do not adapt and grow will not last.

You shouldn’t assume that your relationship is doomed when you head off to college, but you also should accept that it may be for the best if it does end. It might strengthen as the two of you mature and change, or it might weaken. Only time will tell.

, Try to maintain a consistent contact schedule in regards to phone calls, texts, emails, etc. Fill some of the time you would be spending in each other’s presence with alternate forms of contact.Obviously, many things will change in your relationship when you are far apart. Amid all those changes, finding and holding onto familiar habits and activities can provide reassurance that the core elements that support your partnership remain strong.

, It's easy to lose track of what's going on in your partner's life when you're far apart. It's also easy to lose track of how long it's been since you said ""I love you"" with real passion or gave him or her a surprise gift.


Send flowers or gifts occasionally if that’s something you normally do, or send a weekly text of encouragement before your boyfriend or girlfriend heads off to that terrible weekend part-time job.

, It’s not quite the same as being cuddled up on the couch together, but watching the same favorite show at the same time while talking or texting back and forth can help fill a bit of the separation void. Even the admittedly old-fashioned, lo-tech notion of looking up at the same starry sky at the same time may do the trick.You can also try taking up the same new hobby or activity in your separate locations. It could be anything from karate to stamp collecting. You don’t necessarily have to be doing the new thing at the same time; just commiserate about your experiences each evening or week.
Specifically for the college setting, you may want to take the same elective class during the same semester. You can talk about the similarities and differences, and help each other out to some degree in learning calculus or trying to recall the French you took in high school.

, Make the most of your visits with each other, but don’t make it feel as though every second has to be maximized to its absolute fullest. Just hanging out, watching TV, or doing other things you normally do together is good also.Focus on enjoying each other's company when you get the chance. This is your opportunity to be comfortable, relaxed, and secure together. Don't add unnecessary pressure or awkwardness.

, You may assume that cheating or becoming too busy to keep in touch usually doom long distance relationships that don’t last. Instead, it is usually the lack of connection — not just physically, but the emotional sense that you’re sharing life’s experiences together. Work to strengthen the bonds that are already strong in your relationship, and they can help make up for those that are weakened by the distance.Focus especially on building and maintaining trust, which is almost always challenged by a long distance relationship. Without a trusting foundation to begin with, a long distance relationship is in jeopardy from the start.

, Don't let suspicion, jealousy, or your own busy schedules prevent you from supporting each other fully as you navigate your separate college lives. Especially when you are separated by distance, your partner needs and deserves your encouragement and support.The first step towards support is awareness. Know what’s going on with your significant other (midterms, homecoming, etc.) and take a genuine interest in his or her successes, opportunities, and challenges.

, Being in a long distance relationship can make it easier to forget about your significant other’s faults and foibles and put him or her on a pedestal. But that’s not the person you took an interest in. Keep looking at your partner as the wonderfully imperfect person he or she is.


There is actually some benefit to idealizing your absent partner to a degree, as it helps you to deal with the challenges and stresses of separation by giving you a positive perception to cling to. However, make an effort to idealize by emphasizing your partner’s good qualities and inner beauty, not by transforming him or her into some flawless creature.If you imagine your partner as an unrealistically perfect person during your time apart, you're going to be disappointed every time you do get to spend time together.

, Honesty is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and may be even more important when distance is involved. Don’t pretend that being apart isn’t a challenge, or doesn’t cause you stress or even doubts. Overly idealizing the relationship instead of dealing with it openly as-is will not provide any lasting benefits.If you’re feeling jealous because your significant other seems to be having so much fun without you around, talk about it. Openness about your feelings will either strengthen your bond or expose issues that need to be dealt with.
Distance can make it easier to hide your true feelings, but they will eventually come out anyway. Use the challenge of separation as an opportunity for relationship growth, not as an excuse to conceal things that need to be addressed.

, Before you even begin the long distance portion of your relationship, it is probably best to make sure you are both “on the same page” regarding its status. This can help calm anxieties for both of you, and also nips the “But I thought we both agreed we weren’t 100% exclusive” excuse in the bud.Especially if you are in a relatively new relationship, have a frank discussion about status and expectations. Is it okay to see other people too? Don’t assume that you both see things the same way.
Also, are there expectations about the frequency of calls, visits, and other forms of contact? What would constitute “not trying hard enough” or “giving up” on the relationship?

, No matter how much you care about your absent boyfriend or girlfriend, you’re going to at least occasionally notice that cute guy in the lunchroom or feel an urge to flirt back with the girl in the bookstore checkout line. No one is immune to flashes of temptation, but people in committed relationships tend to be able to brush these aside more quickly — often by unconsciously emphasizing less appealing elements (minor appearance flaws, personality quirks, etc.) of a potential romantic temptation.Don’t lock yourself in your dorm room to avoid temptations. Instead, practice consciously pointing out (to yourself) flaws and less desirable elements in people who trigger a spark of romantic temptation. At the same time, practice envisioning times of close connection and happiness with your partner when such feelings arise.
If you can’t stop feeling romantic temptations everywhere you turn, that may be a sign of a weakening attachment to your partner. Take time to consider whether this is an inevitable decline or something that can (and should) be confronted.

, Like temptation, jealousy is another natural component of even the strongest relationships, and especially long distance ones. Jealousy, grounded in shortcomings in your self-confidence, may make you see many of your absent partner’s new college friends or classmates as potential romantic rivals. Accept this as reality and work to recognize and be as rational as possible about it.


Jealousy can make you unconsciously shift your perception of yourself to match what you believe are the desirable qualities in the person you see as a romantic rival. (That is, you basically change how you view yourself to replicate what you think is enticing your partner.)Instead of letting unfounded jealousy change you, work to recognize and rationally consider whether your worries about a potential romantic rival have any basis in reality. Most of the time they likely will not. In any case, talk to your partner about your feelings; he or she almost certainly feels jealousy from time to time as well.

, Yes, there is a good chance that your long distance relationship won’t last — but only because the same is true for any relationship. College is a time for new opportunities and experiences, and meeting new people, whether your boyfriend or girlfriend is in a dorm room 100 yards or 100 miles away.Some people spend their lives with their college sweethearts, and many don’t make it past Thanksgiving of freshman year.Accept that either is possible and focus on what you can control. Give the relationship the effort it deserves, and if it doesn’t work out, chalk it up as another one of the many learning experiences you’ll have during this time of your life.

Take advantage of technology.,
Acknowledge the needs of both partners.,
Avoid comparing this relationship to relationships you have had in the past.,
Budget for visits.",How to Make a Relationship Work if You're in College2," Long distance relationships are much easier to maintain today than they were a long time ago. With text messaging, social media, and video chatting, technology can allow long distance couples to feel closer to one another, even when they are far apart.


There are apps for smartphones that allow you and your partner to touch your thumbs to the same spot on the screen and your phone will emit a vibration.Video chatting services like Skype and FaceTime allow for those in long distance relationships to have face-to-face conversations rather than just talking on the phone. Download a video chatting service and get a webcam! Most new laptops come with web-cameras built in.
It’s safe to say that most people use text messaging very often in their everyday lives. Use it as a way of sending messages and photos to your significant other while you are apart. It will help you feel more connected and more like you are a part of each other’s day-to-day lives.

, If you go to college far away from one another and decide to maintain a long distance relationship, make sure you are both clear on what you expect from one another.


Be open and honest about your needs and where you want the relationship to go. Don’t be afraid to tell your significant other if your needs aren’t being met, or if you think you both should work towards making some changes., A long distance relationship, particularly one that is made more difficult by the stresses and responsibilities that come along with college life, is an entirely different entity than the average, geographically close relationship., As college students, you are more than likely living on a small budget. With tuition, rent, food, and transportation costs, college is an expensive time in anyone’s life. So, budgeting for trips to visit your significant other might seem like a difficult task.


Book airline tickets well in advance. A few months to about 8 weeks before is a good window for purchasing. You can even create a price alert on some travel websites and get an e-mail or text alert when plane tickets for your route go down.
Try planning a trip to a third location—rather than you going to see them or them coming to see you, plan to meet in the middle, or meet up in some other fun, interesting location. Not only will it keep things interesting, but the effort will feel more balanced on both sides.
Consider taking a bus. It isn’t as time efficient, but new express bus services in the US can take you pretty long distances for a low fee.

Set boundaries and expectations early on.,
Establish good communication habits.,
Be up-front and honest about your sexual relationship.,
Discuss and set “rules” regarding sexual fidelity.,
Be present for one another.,
Support one another through your successes and be there for one another when things don’t go as planned.,
Be as understanding as possible.",How to Make a Relationship Work if You're in College3," Whether you live near one another or far apart, it is still important to discuss boundaries for your relationship. This includes physical and non-physical boundaries.


Don’t be quick to assume your partner feels the same about any given thing as you do. Establishing boundaries can help eliminate that instinct and allow for better communication and a more healthy relationship.When setting boundaries, try not to use language like “never” or “always.” These are less likely to last because they are absolute and unrealistic., Don’t keep important things to yourself. Speak up, but also be willing to listen when your partner has something to say. If you establish good communication early on, it will set you up for a healthier relationship.


Don’t physically leave (or hang up the phone) is your discussion is not over. Walking out in the middle of a discussion will only make the problem bigger and last longer.Being in a long distance relationship can make it difficult to justify spending your rare physical time together having serious discussions about feelings or issues, but doing so is important., Since you are in college and no longer in high school, it is likely you might choose to engage in a sexual or intimate relationship with your girlfriend or boyfriend. Just make sure you are ready to discuss these important things with your partner.


Just because you are in a relationship does not give automatic consent. Consent is “affirmative, voluntary, and sober.” It can also be taken away at any time by either partner. Make sure both partners have always given clear consent.
Both partners should consider getting tested for STDs prior to becoming intimate. One in four people under the age of 25 has a sexually transmitted disease. Practice safe sex.

, Especially in long distance relationships, this is very important to discuss with your partner. If you are in a monogamous relationship, then infidelity could lead to the end of that relationship.


Be open with your partner about your beliefs and opinions on what constitutes cheating, and what cheating could mean for your relationship.

, Your lives will be hectic—between school, work, and personal commitments, it will be easy to feel stressed out and disconnected. But when you are together, really be there with your significant other in the moment, and give them your attention.


If you stay focused in the moment, even small arguments will be less likely to expand into bigger deals. Don’t let an argument about what to make for dinner end up snowballing into an argument about other, bigger things., This will help build trust and loyalty with your significant other.

, If you and your significant other are both college students, there will have to be a good amount of give and take.


Be understanding when your boyfriend or girlfriend is very busy with school or work. If you are understanding with them, they will be better able to return the favor when you get busy.
If you find your schedules are especially conflicting and you are finding it harder and harder to be understanding when your plans get broken due to other commitments, try talking it out with one another and making a schedule that you can both stick to.

Therefore, they will feel entitled to your time and attention. They will not consider whether or not you have time to engage with them. They will just assume they deserve your energy.A narcissist will expect from you whatever they expect or want for themselves. They will assume your needs and wants are the same as theirs, and therefore be very demanding of your attention.
For example, if you're in a relationship with a narcissist, they may assume you're going out or staying in on any given night to suit their needs. They will become angry and even hostile if you express your need for alone time or socialization independent of them. They may be unable to understand that they do not deserve your constant attention.;
, If you're a narcissistic extension, a narcissist sees you as an extension of themselves. Therefore, boundaries are non-existent in your relationship. A narcissist will not realize when you're becoming nervous or uncomfortable, and will continually push your boundaries in order to get you to serve their own needs.For example, your girlfriend wants to take you hiking near the mountains, even though you've told her many times you're afraid of heights. She does not let it go until you agree to go with her.
During the hike, you becoming increasingly panicked and uncomfortable as you get higher in the mountains. Your girlfriend does not seem concerned about your requests to stop. Instead, she is angry that you are not keeping up with her. She is not concerned you're uncomfortable and cannot fathom your feelings about the situation are different than her's.

, Conversations with a narcissist can be very frustrating. A narcissist has very little sense of shame. As a narcissistic extension, you're expected to build up a narcissist even when conversations make you uncomfortable. You are also expected to give out a lot of information about yourself, whether you want to or not.A narcissist may share facts about themselves that feel too private and personal, and have little sense of shame when sharing. A narcissist may, for example, tell a story about how they ""called someone out"" and boast about having been very rude and aggressive to someone. They will expect you to be impressed by their courage in this situation, rather than shocked by the hostility.
A narcissist will expect this same level of transparency from you, and be unable to tell when you're uncomfortable in a situation. They may, for example, ask very pressing questions and get angry if you don't disclose information. They also will be unable to tell when you're becoming uncomfortable in a situation.

, If you're a narcissistic extension, the narcissist sees you as a reflection of them. Therefore, they will take credit for your acomplishments. A narcissist may, for example, say something like, ""I got you a really good grade on that test because I studied with you"" or ""That publication was because I reviewed your work.""This trait is particularly common if your parent is a narcissist and you are their extension.

, Narcissists do not like it when their behavior is questioned. If they are questioned in any way, it's common for them to become hostile and angry very suddenly.Think about any time you've pushed back against a narcissist. When you tell this person they hurt you, how do they react? Instead of admitting to wrongdoing or agreeing to change, a narcissist will often get very angry. They may meet your request with personal attacks and put downs, and may even force you to apologize.
If you're a narcissistic extension, the narcissist will feel your feelings and emotions should only exist to serve them. They will be unable to understand when your feelings are hurt, and be unwilling to change for your sake.

, In any relationship, it's important your wants and needs are met to some degree. When you're a narcissistic extension, however, your wants and needs will consistently fall to the wayside.Think about what you need and want and whether it's consistently sacrificed. Do you feel like the other person is willing or able to meet certain needs, or allow you to pursue your own interests?
A narcissist will only be able to see their needs and wants, and often expect them to be met even if it's unreasonable or interferes with your own needs and wants. They are good at manipulating others, so if you confront them with your feelings, they're likely to get hostile instead of apologizing and changing.
For example, you're extroverted by nature and like to go out on the weekends. Your boyfriend gets nervous at big parties, and expects you to stay by his side the whole time, even when he refuses to socialize with others. When you express the fact your need for socialization isn't met, he insists you instead meet his need for attention and reassurance. Rather than working towards a compromise, a narcissistic boyfriend will instead continue to put his needs first, regardless of whether it's reasonable.

, Being a narcissistic extension is draining. If you're in a relationship with a narcissist, they will take up a lot of your time and energy. Consider whether you have time for yourself. Are you allowed to pursue your own hobbies and interests? Do you have separate relationships with family members and friends? If not, you may be a narcissistic extension., A narcissist will not see you as a separate entity, with your own ideas and opinions. They will only see you as a reflection of them and their values. Therefore, you will not have a lot of energy to focus on anything but them.A narcissist will constantly pressure you to make them happy and content. You will find yourself trying to meet unreasonable needs a lot, and many of your daily decisions will revolve around keeping the narcissist happy.
If you consider your own feelings, you may feel guilt and shame. Narcissists are very good at guilt-tripping, and you may feel like a bad person if you take time for yourself on occasion.

, For narcissists, feelings are a competition. If you experience an emotion, it must be filtered through the narcissist. You may eventually start to feel you don't have permission to have certain feelings or emotions.Narcissists like to control everything, including your feelings. They tend to take pleasure over making another person feel shame. You may eventually internalize the narcissist's put downs, and begin to feel shame over your basic wants and needs.
You may also be unable to express hurt. If you say something like, ""The way you were behaving last night hurt my feelings,"" the narcissist will not apologize. Instead, they will chastise you for having felt that way or insist your feelings are invalid.

, Narcissists don't let their extensions go easily. If you're trying to distance yourself from a narcissist, they will manipulate you to get you to stay. Avoid getting sucked back into this cycle. Stay strong as you end a relationship with a narcissist.A narcissist often feigns the desire to change when they sense someone is leaving. They may tell you things will be different this time, and make big promises for major changes.
Remember, a narcissist only acts to serve their own needs. They are only making you promises in the hopes of getting something they want. In this case, they want your attention and focus. Do not believe anything a narcissist says as you prepare to leave.

, It's natural to feel angry after leaving a narcissist. You expected someone to be kind and loving, and instead they neglected your needs and wants. Anger is an important step in the healing process.Realize that you are angry. Think about the actions and behaviors that created this sense of anger.
From there, find ways to release your anger in a healthy fashion. You can cry, talk to a friend, or engage in physical activity.

, It's important to talk things over with a therapist. You do not want relationship patterns to repeat in the future. You also want to make sure you're dealing with your emotions in a healthy fashion.You need to remember how to meet your own personal needs. After being a narcissistic extension, especially if you were one for a long time, you may not remember what you need and want out of life. A neutral third party can help you remember.
You can see a therapist through your regular doctor or through your insurance. If you're a student, your college or university may provide free counseling.

, Narcissists may not let their extensions go easily. You may need to cease contact with a narcissist to avoid getting dragged back into the cycle.Block them on social media. You should also block their phone number and email address.
If you were in an abusive relationship, contact a local domestic violence shelter for help. You should also call 9-1-1 or your local emergency contact number if you feel your safety is immediately threatened at any point.

Don't take the relationship for granted.,

Never stop flirting.,
Touch.,
Don't be afraid to acknowledge your love.,
Commit.",How to Make a Relationship Better1," If there's one thing you do to make your relationship better, make it this. Being in a happy relationship is a privilege — it's not something that is guaranteed all of the time. Because of this, you should always treat your relationship like it is something special and worthy of celebration. Always seek to please your partner and look for opportunities to show your love. Never assume that because you are in a relationship you can ""let yourself go"" and become unpleasant, disrespectful, or entitled.


This doesn't mean that you have to constantly treat your partner to luxuries (though the occasional present or fancy dinner is always a nice gesture). Instead, make this advice more about your actions. Treat your partner to heartfelt shows of love and affection. Be there when s/he needs you most. Look for creative, memorable things to do with him or her.;
, Your partner wants to be admired and respected as a full person — not simply kept around for emotional support. Always play an active role in your partner's life. Conversely, let your partner take an active role in yours. By taking lots of opportunities to talk about each other and do things with each other, you give yourselves chances to grow as a couple. Just a few ideas are below:


Ask your partner's opinion when you're having trouble making a decision
Talk about each others' successes and frustrations with work, school, etc. often
Help your partner with difficult work/school tasks occasionally
Take an interest in your partner's creative pursuits (writing, drawing, etc.)

, Many couples complain of losing a certain romantic ""spark"" as their relationship matures. Keep the magic alive by treating every day like you're still trying to woo each other. Gently tease each other, play hard to get, make subtle innuendos — whatever worked for you before you were in a relationship. You can never know a partner too well to stop flirting.

, Touching is a way to foster greater physical intimacy without necessarily doing anything sexual. For example, holding hands, hugging, and giving massages are all ways of showing your affection through touch. These sorts of actions are a simple but effective way to show that you enjoy the way your partner feels when you're together.


While touch is a great way to gain a closer bond, you should always respect your partner's personal boundaries. Don't touch your partner when s/he isn't in the mood for it — this is disrespectful and a good way to start a fight.

, If you and your partner have reached the stage where you're comfortable using the ""L word,"" feel free to make it part of your regular vocabulary. Reminding your partner that you love him or her can be just the boost of positivity and passion that's needed before starting the day, going to bed, or doing something hard. It can also bring you back together after an argument — you may have your differences, but you love each other, so you can work through them.


On the other hand, if this is something you find yourself saying every time you get together, you may want to resist the urge. Saying ""I love you"" constantly can cheapen the phrase. When you really mean it, it may have less of an effect.

, Uncertainty about the future of a relationship can kill long-term passion. On the other hand, knowing that your partner will be there for you (and vice versa) allows you to approach each other with confidence. You know neither of you are going anywhere for a while, so you can relax a little and be your true selves. As a result, your relationship will grow in honesty and affection.


This doesn't mean that you need to decide to get married right off the bat (or ever). However, you should talk about what both of you want to get from the relationship early on so you don't run into any conflicts months or years later.

Utilize social networking platforms to build larger business circles.",How to Maintain Business to Business Relationships," Whenever possible, try to have in-person meetings with current or potential business associates. Face-to-face interaction is crucial for building and maintaining relationships of any kind, business included.Meeting in-person allows you to notice body language and other non-verbal cues that would be harder to interpret over the phone or via email.;
, Writing an old-fashioned note is a simple way to maintain business-to-business relationships. Unlike sending an e-mail, a card is an obvious, visible reminder of your thoughtfulness.Be sure to follow up on collaborative projects. Send a thank you note about your partnership and let the other party know you are always willing to collaborate again.

, Whenever possible, interact via phone conversation rather than just through email. Taking the time to make a simple phone call can make all the difference in the world to a person you are in business with, especially in today’s fast-paced, email-oriented, technology-driven environment.When a business sends clients your way, acknowledge the gesture with a phone call. This is a great way to show your gratitude.

, Listening well is part of maintaining any relationship that matters to you, especially business relationships. You want your business associates to feel like you hear what they are saying and that you think their opinion matters. This means giving them the floor to talk and letting them see that you are listening.Practice active listening skills like nodding your head, making eye contact, and giving short verbal responses to indicate that you are engaged in the conversation even when you aren’t speaking.

, All relationships take time and effort to build and maintain. Business relationships are no different. You must make time for them, even when it’s inconvenient for you, so that they know you value their business.This means that you can’t just call someone up whenever you need them and ignore them when you don’t.
You have to be willing to invest time and energy into your relationship even if it doesn’t seem to benefit you immediately. You will reap the benefits in the long run.

, Try to be proactive about predicting the needs of the businesses you interact with on a regular basis. Continuously check in with company leaders to ensure that their needs are being met by your services. Don’t simply wait for them to contact you.Determine how you can best serve business clients and colleagues. Ask direct questions about your company's quality, products, and efficiency. Surveys, phone calls or a casual on-site visit are inexpensive ways to improve business-to-business relationships.

, Instead of simply attempting to meet the needs of a client's short-term project, learn what the company might need in the future. Ask what new developments are in the works. Then get a timeline for pending product launches. Finally, determine how your business skills can increase their chances of success with the new projects.

, A great way to expand your business relationships is to network through business associates you already have. Ask some existing business clients or associates to make introductions for you so that you can expand your business circle.Just be sure that you are willing to help others network in return. Maintaining business relationships is all about finding the balance of give and take. You have to be willing to give in order for others to be willing to give to you., When you learn of a colleague or business in need of services that someone you know can provide, offer to arrange an introduction between the two entities. If your business associates think of you as someone who helps them solve their problems (even when it might not directly benefit you), they will be more likely to remain in business with you.Before making a business-to-business referral, try to get a general understanding of the capabilities, needs, and budgets of both parties to avoid wasting anyone's time.

, Collaboration can be a great way to build business relationships. Find out how to collaborate with competitors on certain projects. If your business owns a piece of machinery that you believe will add value to another company's services, approach the company owner to determine if you can work together.Invite the potential collaborator to lunch to talk about complimentary services and products.

, Take the time to build a professional presence on social networking websites to share your background with others who may not be as familiar with your work. This will help get your business name out there and can reassure your existing business relationships.Using social media will help you reach a larger audience of people with your vision for your business and will give you a great starting point for building business relationships.
Having an online presence makes it easier for new contacts (and existing ones) to find you and contact you.

Do not try to change your partner.,
Do not control your partner.,
Support their interests.,
Don't minimize your partner's emotions.",How to Maintain a Relationship1," Accept that you can only change yourself, not your partner . This is perhaps the hardest but most important tenet of a solid relationship. You should never enter a relationship with the plan to ""fix"" your partner. You need to accept the fact that your partner may never change, and be okay with that. To do otherwise is a guaranteed way to frustrate yourself and alienate your partner.


You may support your partner to make positive changes in their life. But you should never try or need to fundamentally change them.
If you cannot accept your partner for who they are, you either need to set boundaries to avoid getting hurt or leave the relationship entirely.
Understand that men and women are different . Or for that matter understand that different men and different women are different. Do not unfairly hold your partner up to the standards of an old relationship or of an ideal one.;
, We all know that violence is not an acceptable way to control partner. But know that using guilt or shame is just as damaging. Guilting or shaming to control your partner is emotional abuse. Do not attempt to control your partner. This is an extension of ""Do not try to change your partner"" step.


If you cannot handle compromise then leave the relationship, do not try to control or change your partner to make it work.

, You do not have to share your partner's every hobby. But you should listen to your partner when they talk about their interests, and give them guilt-free time and space to pursue their interests.

, While not every emotion is desirable (for example anger, resentment, and frustration), they are all normal. If your partner is angry at something, do not criticize them for being angry -- that cannot be helped. What people are responsible for is how they express their emotions. Anger can be destructive or constructive. You may rightly criticize how emotions are expressed and ask that they be shared in a constructive fashion, but do not critique the emotion itself. Critiquing emotions can lead to your partner feeling guilty, defensive and emotionally withdrawn.


A destructive expression of anger is to yell and throw things. A constructive expression of anger is to talk about one's anger feelings and reach a conclusion.
Example: Do not say ""Don't be mad"" or ""You shouldn't be mad"". Telling your partner not to feel something is futile and hinders further communication. Your partner cannot help but be mad. Instead say, ""I understand you are angry. Can you tell me calmly why?"" and work together through dialogue to get to the root of the problem and come to an agreeable solution.

, The more people there are, the more people there are to hug. Note that if you choose a place that's owned by someone (such as a shopping mall) it might be a good idea to get permission first.

, If you're lazy or shy, just smile at people and wait patiently for them to come up to you and offer you a hug.

, That means you wrap your arms around a person over their shoulders or just below their arms and maybe pat their back gently a few times. Try to avoid touching people below the waist, and there's no need for your hips to touch, either. Wait until they let go, unless you get creeped out because you think they're trying to cop a feel.

Be open and honest.,
Deal with problems as soon as possible.,
Be trusting.,
Be willing to compromise on important things.",How to Make a Relationship Better2," Communication between you and your partner should be completely open while remaining respectful. This is crucial for a healthy relationship. If your partner respects you, s/he should be able to listen to your concerns and come to an agreement that is fair to both parties. Remember: you'll usually regret staying silent more than you'll regret speaking up and making a mistake.


For example, if you are concerned that your partner is uncomfortable around your family, it's important to discuss this, rather than hoping the problem goes away. If you don't, future interactions may get tense and awkward since you'll be forced to simply guess what's wrong.

, Letting issues between you and your partner fester is never a good idea. If you sense tension, bring it up. Similarly, if your partner brings up a problem with you, give it the attention you deserve. Be willing to work towards a quick, mutually-satisfying solution — even if it means setting aside your ego and apologizing for something you don't think is a big deal.


Some couples enjoy using the ""One Day Rule."" With this system, when you and your partner have an argument, you swear to fight it out and solve the problem together within the same day. This avoids long, drawn-out emotional battles.

, Trust is the cornerstone of all great relationships. Always remember that your significant other is an equal partner, not someone you can control. You need to be comfortable letting your partner out of your supervision for your relationship to thrive. Trust him or her to make wise decisions and stay faithful even when you're not around. This can be difficult for people who are naturally a little jealous, but being able to do this is a sign of maturity and respect that relationships can't grow without.


Similarly, do your best to deserve your partner's trust. Act with respect for him or her, even when you're apart. For instance, don't talk rudely about your partner to your friends, even if you're angry. Definitely don't do anything that would call the foundations of your relationship into question.

, Partners in a committed relationship won't always agree on everything (nor should they). Because the occasional disagreement is inevitable, both partners need to be comfortable not getting what they want sometimes. If you can reach ""middle ground"" with your partner during an argument, take this route so that both partners get some of what they want. If this is impossible, realize that you may need to simply give in sometimes. Your relationship should be worth more to you than a petty argument.


Ideally, both you and your partner should share this responsibility equally. Unequal sharing of burdens can lead to resentment.

When practicing active listening you need to ask questions and paraphrase back important points to demonstrate your involvement and interest. You are never done learning about your partner, nor they about you, and learning starts with good listening. A good, deep relationship requires lifelong maintenance and effort, but the effort is worth it for the support, security and love from someone who really knows you.

, Listen when your partner talks. Respect your partner's opinion by allowing them to express it in full, even if you disagree. Take the time to really understand your partner's views by asking questions and attempting to paraphrase what they are saying to you.

, Do not simply try to fix the symptoms, but when your partner or you is unhappy take the time to explore and understand what is the source of the problem and fix that.


For example if your wife is mad that you spend too much time with the guys and doesn't want you to go out, you could treat the symptom and just stop ever hanging out with the boys, but this is not a healthy long-term fix. Instead you should explore the numerous reasons why she doesn't like you spending time with the guys. Ask questions and listen to her without judging to uncover her motivations. You may find that:

A) She is jealous of other women at the bars you go to with the boys. Solution: Change the venue, or invite her to ""drop by"" and see that nothing unseemly is going on.
B) She thinks you do not like to spend time with her and do not like her. Solution: Schedule regularly quality time with her, and verbally ensure her that you enjoy her company too.
C) She thinks that your hanging out with the boys unfairly burdens her. This is especially true if you have kids, as your hanging out with the boys means that she is on solo baby duty. Solution: Offer to give her a day out with the girls too. And make sure you are not falling behind on household chores when you do go out.

Anger is a waste of time .,
Keep your fights clean.,
Make efforts to establish physical contact .,
Say ""Thank you"".,
Say ""please"".",How to Maintain a Relationship3," Your goal in a relationship is to build connections and work through problems together. Being angry may give you a sense of self righteousness, but it does nothing to move a relationship forward to a solution. Let your anger go, even if you are ""right"".

, In the course of all relationships there will be disagreements. This is normal. But how you handle these disagreements reflects on the health of your relationship. Disagreements are not the time to air every grievance you have ever had. Disagreements are also not the time to ""get even"" with your partner by hurting them emotionally. Disagreements are a time to discuss your different views as they relate to the problem at hand and work towards a mutual solution.

, In the early stages of a relationship expressing your love is natural and regular. You can not wait to hold their hand, steal a kiss or more. But after a few years or decades, even the steamiest relationships tends to cool. Hand holding, back rubs, and kisses do not just happen, especially if you have kids. Make time for these things. Make a conscious daily effort to establish loving physical contact with your partner.

, Daily express your appreciation for your partner . Even if your partner is just doing their ""fair share"", it is still important to thank them. When your husband does the dishes say, ""Thanks for doing the dishes"". When your wife puts the kids to bed say, ""Thanks for handling the kids tonight."" It seems silly but these little niceties go a long way for making your partner feel appreciated, and feeling appreciated can head off resentment or anger stemming from ""not feeling appreciated"".

, Do not demand from your partner. Ask nicely, even if it is something you expect them to do. Instead of saying ""Get the kid juice"", say ""Would you please get the kid juice?"" Saying ""please"" changes a demand to a favor and helps establish a respectful cooperative relationship.

Respect: Respect is a big one.","How to Have an Exclusive, Long Term, Mature, Serious (and Healthy) Relationship"," Even if you have to mark it down on calendars, do it! Call each other often. Basically, if you're a girlfriend (or a boyfriend), anything you do together is a date.;
, You have to be capable of being a healthy and happy individual without your boyfriend (or girlfriend) around all the time. You need to balance the time you have - between your friends, family, your hobbies/interests, school, your job/career, and time by yourself. Have your own life apart from your relationship.

, About the serious, important, and major issues, and also about the joking, non-serious, unimportant, little stuff too. Talk about anything you want - how your day went, viewpoints, opinions, thoughts, wants, needs, desires, ambitions, goals, your past, how you want your future to be, hopes, dreams, insecurities, fears, wishes, or what's going on in your life.

, You need to trust each other enough to not think that they will cheat, or do anything else to hurt you emotionally, physically, or otherwise.

, Uplift the other person in good ways. Be there (physically, emotionally, or any way you can) for each other during the happy times and the not so happy times. It will make all the difference!

Communicate in various ways.,
Start conversations with them.,
Tell them your needs.,
Ask questions.",How to Maintain a Relationship with a Quiet Person1," Your partner might be quiet, but all relationships depend on communication. You can maintain your relationship by being creative and communicating with your partner in ways other than just talking.


Write notes and letters to each other. This can be as simple as a ‘good morning’ written on a sticky note or it can be a three-page love letter.
Draw your partner a quick doodle, sketch, or picture expressing how you feel. Or ask them to do the same for you.
Use texts, emails, and other forms of messaging to communicate. For example, you could send your partner an instant message to check on how their day is going.
Try video or photo chatting with each other. Apps like Snapchat make it possible for you to communicate in fun ways.;
, Don’t wait for your partner to start talking to you. If you do, you may be waiting a while. Especially if you need to talk about a problem in the relationship or other serious issue, you shouldn’t wait for them to bring it up. Maintain your relationship with a quiet person by being the one to start conversations.For example, if you need to talk about your plans for prom, you could wait for her to bring it up and potentially miss prom. Or, you could say something like, “Mandy, let’s talk about our plans for the prom.”
Or if, for instance, you are wondering about the status of your relationship, you might say to your partner, “Chase, we need to talk about where our relationship is headed.”

, You can maintain a relationship with a quiet person if you let them know what you need from the relationship.You definitely want to think about their needs, but you also have to balance it by communicating your needs.


Let your partner know if you need more social time or even more quality one-on-one time. For example, you might say, “I understand that you need quiet time. Sometimes I do, too. I’d love if we could spend some quiet time together.”
Tell them if you need more affection or even a little space. You might try saying, “Sometimes I’d like to just cuddle. Even if it’s just for a few minutes.”

, When you are in a relationship with a quiet partner you will need to develop good questioning skills. Since your quiet partner may not just open up and tell you what’s on their mind or share their preferences with you, you will need to ask them questions to find out what they are thinking or what’s going on with them. Be sure to share openly and honestly with them as well.


Avoid just asking questions they can answer with one word. For example, don’t ask, “Did you have a good time?” You partner might just respond, “Yes.”
Try asking open-ended questions like, “What was your favorite part?” “What’s your opinion about the situation?” or “What or your thoughts?”
You can also ask more direct questions such as, “What activities do you enjoy and why?” “How do you like to recharge?” and “What kinds of topics interest you and why?”

"
"
Compromise on activities.,
Plan social events in advance.,
Take advantage of downtime.",How to Maintain a Relationship with a Quiet Person2," Take turns choosing the activities you do together. Compromising between quiet, downtime and exciting, social time will help you maintain your relationship with a quiet person.Make plans to do quiet activities together like watching a marathon of your favorite web series or just sitting and talking.
Spend time hanging out with other couples or in group settings. For example, go to a party together with some of your mutual friends.
You can even spend a few hours together in the morning volunteering in the community and then spend the afternoon quietly relaxing.
Keep in mind that your partner may be easily drained after a few hours of activity, especially if they are an introvert. Make sure to give them a chance to recharge after social activities and be willing to do some non-social activities as well.

, It can be really stressful for quiet people to be thrown into social situations without preparation.This can cause problems in your relationship and make your partner feel uncomfortable. You can spend quality time with your quiet partner and maintain a good relationship if you give your partner advance notice about social events.


For example, inviting your mutual friends over for a game day and not telling your partner until the doorbell rings isn’t a good idea.
Give your partner enough time to mentally prepare to be social. You might say, “Later in the week I’d like to get together with our friends and play some board games.”

, Spending quiet, one-on-one time together is a good thing for any relationship. It gives you the opportunity to connect with each other on a different level. When you are in a relationship with a quiet person, you can maintain the relationship by taking advantage of your quiet time together.


Spend some time just sitting with each other or cuddling. You don’t have to say or do anything other than be together.
Try meditating together or practicing other relaxation techniques like deep breathing.
Spend time in nature together, such as by taking a walk outside. This is a healthy, relaxing activity that you can do together.

"
"
Accept them the way they are.,
Develop your own interests.,
Make sure you’re not being manipulated.",How to Maintain a Relationship with a Quiet Person3," You may want your partner to talk more or be more social, but trying to change them is not the way to maintain a relationship with a quiet person.Accept that they are a quiet person and love them for it the same way they accept and love you.


Avoid trying to force your partner to be more talkative or try to make them feel bad for being a quiet person. For instance, don’t tell you partner, “Our relationship would be better if you talked to me more. Why don’t you talk more?” Remember that there is nothing wrong with being a quiet person and criticizing them for being quiet will only cause them to resent you.
Show them you respect and appreciate who they are. Say something like, “I know you’re a quiet person. I appreciate the conversations you sharing with me.”
Reflect on what drew you to your partner in the first place. What qualities of theirs did/do you admire?

, One way you can maintain a relationship with a quiet person is to make sure that you have other activities and people in your life. This way, when your partner needs quiet time, but you want to be social, you will have someone else to talk to and other things to do.


Continue participating in the activities that you were involved in before your relationship started. For example, if you play the cello, continue taking your lessons.
Hang out with your own friends on a regular basis. For instance, have a weekly ‘girls night’ so you can catch up with your female friends and give your partner some quiet time.
Remember that you and your partner are not there to complete each other, but to enhance each other’s lives. Maintain your individual time and interests.

, Sometimes people can use silence as a weapon in relationships. Ignoring you or barely talking to you can be a way of controlling you.You can maintain a relationship with a quiet person if you determine that they aren’t using silence as a way to control you.


Notice if your partner is talkative and social with other people and only seems quiet with you. For example, does she regularly hang out with and talk to her friends, but can barely say ‘hi’ to you?
Pay attention if you partner ignores you or gives you the silent treatment to get you to do what they want. For instance, if he won’t speak to you unless you agree to go to a party with him, then he is being manipulative.
If your partner is not normally quiet, then taking on this trait might be a sign that something is wrong. Seek help for your partner if this is not normal behavior for them.

Ask them how their day was or how they feel. Share your thoughts and feelings with them as well. Be sure they never feel abandoned and always talk to each other.;
, Your relationship will teach you your limitations, so accept them with open arms.
You will both eventually be wrong on something, regardless of your perceptions. Take responsibility for doing something wrong. Show that you regret your mistake and apologise if necessary.
Always apologise for mistakes or wrongdoings. However, a simple ""I'm sorry"" is not enough. Make an effort to avoid making the same mistake in the future.

, Think back to this time before confronting your partner.
Different perspectives are important as they allow for multiple sides to a decision or story. Listen to the position of your partner and share yours as well. Don't try to make yours seem more important than the other, as this is generally not true.

, Though shared interests are important, be sure to develop some of your own as well. You can learn from your experiences in ways that will help you with your relationship and future decisions.

, Responsibilities should never fall to a single person nor should one need to be asked to carry them out if they are known.

, Nobody is perfect. Laugh whenever you can.
Laugh with each other, not at each other. Mistakes are generally mutual, especially with joint decisions.

, If both share the goal of: making a happy marriage, you'll keep the love!

If your parents are strict they might not approve of you having a partner.,
Have a special place, or make one.",How to Have a Memorable Long Term Relationship," Sending a cute text can be very sweet. Sending a nice e-card (which is sweet sense you can add a little message). Call them every now and then. Just be sure you don't call her too little and or too much.;
, Think of things that can be special to you and her. If you go to the same school go to their locker and slide in a love letter (with your name on it or they'll think it's from somebody else), make sure it isn't too small and unnoticeable, or too big. About a 3X3 card with a cute ribbon on it should be nice, but only if you think she'll like it.

, Anything from dance classes, creating a band, and ice skating classes can be fun. If one of you doesn't like the activity, then try finding something else to do.

, Dating is very important, but don't date too much unless you both like it. Go somewhere she or he likes, somewhere new, not always the same place. Water parks, amusement parks, zoos, movies, restaurants, and concerts are good. Share drinks, food, and have fun! Anything should do as long as you're together.

,,, It's romantic and sweet.

, When proposing make it romantic. She won't think you’re serious if you try to do it though the phone, email, or a text.

,, Don't always give them advice (as this can be annoying) but sometimes when nobody else listens, you can be a good shoulder to cry on, and always comfort her.

, Girls like guys that smell nice and keep themselves clean and tidy. Comb your hair and always take a shower or bath to get rid of body odors.

, As a goodbye or a hello, sometimes a peck on the cheek, a 5-second kiss, or a passionate kiss can be sweet. Don’t always make out or she'll think that's all you want, or talk about it too much! Occasionally a surprise kiss can be cute! However, don’t keep it a peck; make it a long passionate kiss.

,, This you will have to figure out and really talk through to your parents. Don’t just whine, actually sit them down and have a serious talk. Racial differences can have a huge impact on your partner so that is something you really need to prove to your parents that their wrong and your right. Maybe you parents don't want you kissing or having anything sexual at a young age. You will have to make sure your parents understand you are smarter than this and never lie to them about these things. You'll lose a lot of your trust and they'll most likely end up saying I told you so. Nevertheless, if you truly love your partner, then you can’t give up.

, This can be your rooftop, a tree, a hill, a restaurant, or a certain bench! Somewhere worthy of being called special, like where you’re first kiss was, or where you proposed, your first date, or where you asked them out!

Spend time doing enjoyable things together.,
Show him that you appreciate him.,
Show him affection.,
Do small things for him.,
Be playful.",How to Have a Great Relationship with Your Boyfriend1," One way to better your relationship with your boyfriend is to do things together that you both enjoy. Finding joy in the time you spend together can help the two of you build a stronger friendship and a deeper bond. If you like each other more, your relationship will be better.For example, you can play card games, go for hikes, try new activities, or volunteer together.
The idea is to do something you both enjoy. Discuss things you like to do, then find a few you have in common.
Try to avoid doing the same things you always do. If you aren’t happy with where your relationship is now, doing the same thing over and over isn’t going to help it improve.
Ask your boyfriend, ""What do you like to do when we're not together? These are things I like to do."" You may say, ""I saw there's a new musical in town. I've always wanted to see one. Would you like to go with me?"";
, After you have been with someone for a long time, you might start to take for granted that he knows how you feel about him. Maybe you’re not in that honeymoon phase anymore, but you want him to know how you feel about. Let him know that you care and appreciate everything he does.For example, you can thank him for paying for dinner, for taking out the trash, or for holding the door open for you. Say, ""I really appreciate how you took the trash out last night"" or ""Thank you for the coffee you brought me. It made my morning.""
Tell him how good you think he looks, how you like the beard he’s grown out, or that you like his new cologne. Tell him, ""That shirt looks so great on you"" or ""I love that new haircut. It makes you look handsome.""
Dress nice for him. Wear his favorite shirt, the underwear he likes you in, or the fragrance he likes the smell of.

, If you’ve been in a relationship for awhile, you may have stopped being as affectionate or physically loving with each other outside of sex. Sex and affection are two different things. Show more affection outside of the bedroom. Just make small changes to show more affection when you are together.For example, you can touch him more when you talk, hold his hand, or rest your head on his shoulder.
Be present when you kiss him instead of a quick distracted peck.
Spend time holding each other and cuddling when you watch television.

, You don’t have to make a sweeping romantic gesture to get your relationship back on track. Small things are sometimes more meaningful than large gestures. Start doing small, thoughtful things for your boyfriend when you are together. This will show him that you care, pay attention, and think about him.For example, bring him his favorite flavor of coffee when you get together in the morning, or have his coffee waiting when he wakes up. Buy his favorite snack food at the grocery store, or pick it up before you go to the movies.
If your partner always loses his pens at work, buy him a pack to keep in his car. Keep an extra pair of sunglasses in your car for him if he always forgets his.

, One way to make your relationship better is to keep it light. Being playful with one another is a way to deepen your connection and communicate. You don’t just have to be serious with one another to improve the relationship. Joking with each other, acting silly, and engaging in lighthearted activities that make you both laugh can make you feel closer to one another.Lightly tease each other about things, bring up inside jokes, and smile or laugh when the other one says something funny.
Remember that any teasing or joking should be fun and playful, not mean-spirited.

Don't think positively.",How to Have a Long Distance Christian Relationship," Tell your partner about your day. Talk out your conflicts and discuss both negative and positive emotions. Respectfully discuss theology, values and beliefs. Discuss your dreams and goals. Talk about the future. Share what you are learning practically and spiritually. Pray and read the Bible together.;
, Be attentive to your partner's dislikes and likes. Pay close attention to their feelings and thoughts. Think before you respond; maybe they just want you to listen.

, Don't assume the worst about them! Instead, talk things out. Be honest with them, even if it makes you feel ashamed at the moment. Don't put yourself in situations where you are tempted to break their trust (cheating, spilling a secret, etc.). Remember that God is in control. Anything that makes you doubt or distrust has already been handled. Also remind yourself that if your partner is trusting Jesus, He is guiding them, and He will never guide them to a place that is ultimately harmful for you or for them.

, Pray for your partner frequently about both general and specific requests. Meet their family and friends. Visit their church. Deliberately encourage them in their faith and life's path.

, Make sure that both of you have space to grow on your own. Each person needs to have their own spiritual walk, or their heart's state will rely on someone else--someone who is not perfect and will fail at times. It is important to give each other room to grow spiritually, mentally and emotionally. Set physical boundaries as well. Instead of asking yourself as a Christian, ""how far is too far,"" keep in mind that the closer you get physically, the closer you will be bonded emotionally (See Mark 10:8). If the relationship ends someday, you want to spare yourself and your partner from as much heartache as possible.

, A big part of Christianity is community. Your Church family is there to encourage and guide you in your relationship. Be willing to take others' advice and let them voice any concerns. Have them keep you accountable in your relationship with your partner. Though it is good to share your feelings with your partner, it is healthy to get out your irrational fears and thoughts so that your partner does not have to process them.

, There's a cliché pyramid illustration that tells us ""the closer you both get to God, the closer you get to each other,"" and it's totally true. Because the only source of real love is in Jesus Christ, you cannot love your partner without being ""plugged in"" with Him.

, Use social media to share photos. Talk via Skype or FaceTime. Fall asleep together on the phone. Don't just text--Email! It shows you are invested in the relationship and willing to spend time on it. Write letters.

, Set up a time to talk every day. Let your partner know when you are busy, but be willing to set aside time specifically for them.

, Choose specific activities to do together. Go somewhere new. Plan ahead to ensure that the visit goes smoothly.

, Do things at the same time. Learn something new together. Share your calendar, blog and photos.

, Wear a jewelry item they gave you or put a picture of them in your wallet. These little things will remind you of your love for them and everything about them.

, Positive thinking is all based on logic. Instead, think of the truth of the Gospel and the freedom you find in Jesus. Remind yourself that God has authority over your life and relationship, and that He is working in you to make you more like Him. Know that you are His child, and that He has brought you to your partner to be a mirror of His relationship to His Church. You are no longer under the bondage of sin and you have freedom to live boldly in Christ. When you know and believe these things, you won't need ""positive thinking.""

Build trust.,
Commit to being non-judgmental.,
Reciprocate.,
Be honest.",How to Have Healthy Communication in a Relationship," People who trust each other will be more likely to want to communicate with each other, and be able to tell you anything that is on their mind. Keep in mind that building trust takes time - LOTS of time. This is normal, because trust builds through different situations. You have to be patient with this, since it is going to be the foundation for the future of your relationship.Also keep in mind that trust can be lost very easily. All it takes is one situation where you betrayed that trust (for example, an affair with someone else, or lying about something and getting caught). Be careful not to destroy that trust so easily, and if it is destroyed, you have to start again to build it.;
, Sometimes, people are hesitant to communicate certain ideas, thoughts or emotions with others out of fear that the other person will judge them. This is a major hurdle to overcome, even in the most intimate and serious relationships. You have to show your partner that you are not going to judge them for their opinions, their thoughts, and their emotions. This is easier said than done, but if your partner feels that you will never judge them, they will feel more confident about sharing and communicating with you!

, You have to remember that communication is a two-way street. If you want your partner to have healthy communication habits with you, you have to be willing to share healthy communication habits with your partner as well. This will also give your partner an opportunity to see what your preferences are, and give him/her a fair chance at understanding what healthy communication means to you!

, Whenever you communicate with your partner, do your best to be an honest individual. Even if what you are telling your partner is not what they want to hear, you should be an honest individual who strives to tell the truth, no matter how painful it is. Your partner may feel hurt at first, but they will eventually respect you and will learn to count on your honesty!

Talk to your boyfriend.,
Listen to each other.,
Be honest.,
Talk in person.,
Tell your boyfriend what you feel.,
Talk about things that interest you.,
Discuss what you want out of life.,
Set goals for your relationship.,
Consider going to a relationship counselor.",How to Have a Great Relationship with Your Boyfriend2," This might seem obvious, but if you’ve been with someone for awhile, you may take certain things for granted. You may have stopped sharing things with one another, asking each other questions, or telling each other things that have changed. Get to know your boyfriend again by making an effort to talk.Find out if your boyfriend has any new hobbies, interests, or favorite movies. Ask him if there are things that bug him, or if anything else has changed that you may have missed.
For example, you might ask, ""What new TV shows or movies have you watched lately? Have you found any great new songs?"" or ""I've noticed you've been reading a lot of fantasy lately. That's new. Tell me about it.""

, One way to improve the communication with your boyfriend is to listen to him, really listen to him. If you are arguing, don’t get so upset that you ignore what he is saying in favor or getting your point across. Instead, listen to what he has to say. Listening to each other will help you come to a resolution instead of continuing arguing.When you listen, actually listen. Turn off the voices in your head that are screaming the points you want to make, how wrong he is, and how how can get him to side with you.
To be an active listener, you should use open body language, looking at the person directly and nodding. Pay attention to what the person is saying, and restate what they say back to you (for example, ""It sounds like you're having a pretty hard time at work!""). Make good eye contact, and provide thoughtful comments and questions about what the person is saying., One way to better the relationship with your boyfriend is to be honest with him. This may be difficult, but if you want to have a good, healthy relationship, both of you need to trust each other enough to open up and be honest. Be honest about things that bother you, things that scare you, or things that make you uneasy.Avoid lying to your boyfriend. This will only cause problems down the road.
Being honest doesn’t mean just tell him when he bothers you. This means being honest about all aspects of your life. Work on opening up to him and trusting him.

, If there is something important you need to discuss with your boyfriend, do it in person instead of via text or e-mail. This helps avoid miscommunication. You need to also find the right time to talk in person. Choose a time when you both have time to talk and when you can be alone.Refrain from attacking your boyfriend when you talk. This doesn’t lead to any productive resolution.

, After you’ve been with someone for a long time, you just assume they know things. You may think your boyfriend knows what you think, what you feel, and how you feel about him. He is not a mind reader, just as you are not a mind reader. Let your boyfriend know what you want so you can be on the same page.Tell your boyfriend that you care about him, like being around him, or love him. Tell him like like it when he holds your hand or appreciate it when he takes you around his friends.
Let him know that you are having a bad day, or that you had a great day at work. Communicate to him that you want to try a new restaurant or do something different this weekend.
For example, you may say, ""I really appreciate it when you hold my hand in public,"" ""I'd like to try Indian food tonight, and I'd love for you to come with me,"" or ""We should try something new this weekend. I was thinking about going for a hike somewhere we haven't been. What do you think?""
During a bad day, say, ""I had a bad day at work and am grumpy"" or ""I'm sorry I snapped, but I had a really bad day.""

, Small talk is important in a relationship. Talking about the random things that seem unimportant may help you improve your relationship. Ask your boyfriend about the new video game he’s playing, his intramural baseball team, or what he thought of the last episode of a television show.Tell him about the little things in your life, too. Share all aspects of your life with each other, not just the big important things.
Don’t get bored when your boyfriend goes on and on about something you don’t care about. If he’s taking the time to share it with you, it must mean something to him.
For example, you may share things like, ""We got a new employee at work"" or ""My dog did the funniest thing."" You may also say, ""I watched this really great movie"" or ""I had a great workout this morning. Let me tell you why.""

, You and your partner may have gotten to different places in life. You may want the things you used to, which means you may not have the same goals anymore as he does. Talk about what you want out of life, what your plans are, and what goals you have for your life.Focus on goals that you both share. Sharing common goals can help you both work towards something together, which can be fulfilling and make you closer.
For example, tell your boyfriend, ""I really want to travel to exotic places. What about you?"" or ""My goal is to get an advanced degree. What are your career aspirations?""

, One way to better your relationship is for you and your boyfriend to sit down and make goals for the relationship. What do you want from your relationship? Where do you want it to be? These goals work both ways. He can come up with things he wants you to work on just like you come up with things for him to work on.Maybe you would both like to spend more time being active together, or maybe you would like to spend more time with your families.
You may want him to stop watching so much sports, while he wants you to be more organized.
Tell your boyfriend what you need from him, and encourage him to do the same for you.

, If you think your relationship is in trouble but don't know how to fix it, consider going to see a relationship counselor. A relationship counselor can help both of you learn how to better communicate, solve problems, and work on problems in healthy, productive ways.


A relationship counselor may not be for everyone. If you haven't been going out for very long, it may be too soon for a relationship counselor.

Avoid negative thoughts.,
Stop looking at your phone.,
Do not try to change him.,
Fight fair.",How to Have a Great Relationship with Your Boyfriend3," If you’ve gotten to a bad place in your relationship, you may find yourself getting annoyed by everything your boyfriend does. Maybe you hate the way he does something or get offended when he says something. Try to get out of the habit of being negative about your boyfriend.Instead of automatically getting annoyed, think about why he is doing the thing that bothers you. Is it really a problem, or is it a common action that has just started getting on your nerves? Try to take a step back and realize it’s not a big deal.
Talk to your boyfriend about things that really bother you. He may not even realize it’s a problem.

, If you are obsessed with your phone, it might be impacting your relationship. Constantly checking Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter or texting other people while you’re together may make him feel unwanted and cause problems. Instead, put your phone away and pay attention to him. Make sure he does the same for you.If you are paying attention to your phone, you might miss something he is saying. You also are not fully there when you are doing an activity.
Focus on the person in front of you and enjoy spending time with him instead of turning to social media every few minutes.

, You cannot change your boyfriend. He cannot change you. If you think the relationship will be better by changing him, then you need to change your thinking. Trying to change him will only lead to conflict. Instead, talk about things that bother you. The two of you can work together to find a solution.Compromise is a way to work towards a better relationship without forcing change on anyone. Talk to each other and come to an agreement about how to handle the issue.
People want to be accepted for who they are, especially by their significant other. Trying to change your boyfriend may make him think something is wrong with him or that you you don’t care about him.

, If you have to disagree with your boyfriend and you end up arguing, it's not the end of the world. However, you should make sure that you're not fighting in a way that you'll regret later. Follow these rules to make sure that you fight in a fair and respectful way:


Be specific about what bothers you.
Do not be accusatory or petty.
Don't use generalizations, like ""always"" or never.""
Focus on the issue at hand; don't bring past arguments into the present one.
Try to stay calm, and talk about the issue only when you are calm.
Be communicative. Don't give your boyfriend the silent treatment.
Talk about your feelings; do not use actions to show how you feel."
"
Have different interests.,
Focus on making yourself happy.,
Cultivate self-esteem.",How to Have a Great Relationship with Your Boyfriend4," A good way to better your relationship with your boyfriend is to have interests outside of him. You and your boyfriend should share interests and do things together, but you shouldn’t do everything together. Having different interests keeps things interesting, gives you things to talk about and tell each other about, and helps you both cultivate other relationships. It’s important to keep your individual selves even when growing closer.It’s okay if you like playing music but he likes art, or if you like baseball and he likes football. You can both enjoy these other interests with each other, but it’s perfectly fine for you to go to a baseball game with your friends while he goes to an art opening with his friends.

, One problem that may arise in a relationship is when you place your happiness in the other person’s hands. You expect your only happiness to come from that person. While it’s important to be happy when you’re with your boyfriend, he shouldn’t be your only source of happiness.Your relationship will be better when you find ways to be happy. This might be through friendship with others, volunteering, sports, hobbies, or academics.
If you have trouble finding ways to be happy, you may want to consider seeing a therapist or counselor to help you work through any issues you have.

, Another way to better your relationship with your boyfriend is to better your relationship with yourself. If you have good self-esteem, you won’t feel as insecure or jealous. Instead, you will trust yourself and your boyfriend more.


Don’t base your worth and self-esteem on your boyfriend. Your self-esteem should come from inside you. Base it on your positive attributes and characteristics.
Find ways to be confident in yourself. Dress nicely, be proud of your accomplishments, exercise, and try new hobbies. These are all ways to build confidence.

Do never stop to wish all beings happy.",How to Have a Happy Spiritual Relationship," Marriage is work. It is a false way of comprehending that one can let go completely at home. It takes some effort to make a relationship succeed, and you have to decide if you're willing to put in that work.;
, Live yourself and your needs so that you feel good in thee. Do not work too much.

, Do criticism factual, sensitive and at the right moment. The basic rule for each relationship is least 2 / 3 praise and less than 1 / 3 critique.

, Say yes as often as is possible.

, Clarify the precise factual situation. Think about different solutions. Find the good common ground.

, Do not reward negative behavior. Stay in a neutral form or say ""No"".

, A good relationship is based on teamwork. A good team has a common goal. It knows its way to success.

, Love means to be able to forgive. Love means to apologize.

, Love means to have patience.

, Do not demand too much from the partner, the life and yourself. Anyone who can not limit his wishes becomes permanently unhappy. Who does not know his point of satisfaction will never be satisfied. What is your full stop?

, Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. No man is perfect. Love means to love the partner with his weaknesses. Accept the smallness in you, then you can take it in your fellow man.

,, Who wishes the happiness of all beings is growing in his own happiness. This is the highest spiritual wisdom.

Think ahead of time of the personality types of each guy that will be present at this social gathering.,
Observe carefully how the guys relate to one another and emulate their behavior towards them.,
Be interesting.,
Socialize with everyone.,
Leave the guy(s) wanting more.",How to Hang Out with Guys (for Girls)," Determine whether they are extroverted, introverted, sporty, book-smart, etc. For example, this will help you avoid talking too much to a guy that is not talkative, which can lead them to be turned off from future outings with you. And you definitely want to make a positive impression on all of them, even if you are interested in just one or two, because the guy you don't care about could turn out to be the best friend of the actual guy you are interested in. Definitely keep all the guys on your good side!;
, They will see that you are making an effort to bond in their platonic relationship style, which gives you the upper hand. They will regard you as a platonic friend, so they will want to hang out with you another time. This will give you more opportunities to develop chemistry and attraction between you and them. Just remember to NOT ATTEMPT to go in between the guy bonds. Guys cherish their friendships, and you should too, so always allow them to do what they need to do.

, Guys can get very bored very quickly with a girl that has limited interests or conversation. Show off your knowledge and fun-loving nature to them by talking, teasing, playing a game, etc. But this doesn't mean to talk incessantly (as a lot of us are apt to do). Let them talk about themselves. Ensure them that you are listening by providing comments that are thought-provoking and fresh, which will leave them thinking longer about what you said. The longer they think about what you said, the more they think and wonder about you and their attraction to you. Guys love to solve mysteries!

, If you are trying to keep your options open with the guys, or even if you have picked the guy you like, don't favor only one. Socialize with everyone, in similar proportions. Guys love social girls and this will also create a slight competition between the guys. Guys love chasing and proving themselves to a girl, it gives them a goal in socializing. If you are going to zero in on the potential guy, do it later on in the outing, but keep it aloof! You don't want to give away your pick too quick, or you will risk looking like you were just shopping for a mate!

, Another version of this is, ""play hard-to-get"" but I avoid saying this because this is often misinterpreted. Guys do not want a girl that is so extroverted that she is open about anything, including her sexuality. Sure, they might want to fantasize about naughty nights with them, but this will lower the chance of a long-term attachment. Determine outfits that showcase your best features without showing too much. But besides appearances, don't reveal your thoughts and intentions too easily. If they ask you about who you are, don't always give them a straight up answer. Evade a little bit. Let them guess about you. Be an enigma.

Assess whether the rude comments are intentional or not.,
If you're not sure, perhaps get a neutral opinion.",How to Handle Nasty Comments from Flatmates1," Are the people you living with trying to be rude, or might it be accidental? Are they the kind of people who would be mean? Do they realise you are hurt by their comments?;
, Make a mental note of the situation and the words uttered next time it happens. Retell this story to a friend who does not know your roommate, and ask for his/her opinion. Would they consider the comment rude, and if so, would they think it was done on purpose? This makes a huge difference in how you should handle the situation.

"
"
If there's a chance that the housemate may not be aware that they are being perceived as rude, you need to find the root of the problem and work it out together, with patience.

,
Consider what else could be driving their harsh words.,
Take a moment to empathize.,
Perhaps they had an issue with something, and unintentionally came off as passive-aggressive.,
Keep in mind that you could have accidentally upset your flatmate, too.,
Use ""I"" Language to explain your feelings.,
When it comes time to encounter your housemate, be alert for the next time they say something that rubs you the wrong way.",How to Handle Nasty Comments from Flatmates2,", It might have nothing to do with you. Were they having a rough time that day, or that month? Perhaps they are shy and insecure deep down, and do not feel able to express themselves as they mean to.

, Showing the other person that you see their good intentions and empathize with their situation will make it easier for them to feel comfortable apologizing if necessary. They will feel greater freedom to experiment with changing their behavior if they know you are willing to be patient with, and ultimately forgive, their social sloppiness.


People with disabilities, such as autistic people, may have trouble understanding manners.

, Most likely it is something that can be resolved; it just needs to be aired out. You two may have had different expectations about what flatmates should do and not do.

, It could be an ongoing habit of yours - a little thing like not replacing their favorite mug in the place they keep it, or singing loudly in the shower - or it could have been a one-time incidence in which you said something that rubbed them the wrong way. There could have been a misunderstanding; perhaps something of theirs went missing and they assumed your dog ate it when in fact it was stolen. Who knows? Just be aware that there are many possible reasons as to why they apparently have beef with you. Airing those out will help clear up the misunderstanding, and/or, reach a compromise between both of your needs if that is needed.

, This helps you phrase things in a clear, non-accusatory manner. ""I"" language is a useful tool in fixing misunderstandings between people, and conflicts caused by accident.


An easy template is ""When you _______, I feel/felt ______."" For example, ""When you commented about my wardrobe being strange, I felt hurt and embarrassed.""
No one can argue with how you feel. If your flatmate tries to make excuses or ignore your feelings, then their nastiness probably is intentional.

, First making sure that they have time and aren't in the middle of something, catch them in the moment. Don't speak in an accusatory manner or assume that they meant to be rude; instead, gently and inquisitively say something like, ""wait, what you just said - when you said (insert comment here), I felt (judged, blamed, alienated, whatever you felt) because I took it to mean (whatever you took it to mean). I'm not sure that's what you meant though. What did you mean?"" This nonjudgmental, nonviolent format helps resolve conflicts. Find out what they really meant. This should begin to open the door to finding out what underlying problem - a personal issue in their own life, a psychological issue of theirs, a habit of yours they dislike, or an action of yours that they misinterpreted - is the cause of your poor interactions. See How to Practice Nonviolent Communication.

Ask the person you're having conflict with if you can set aside some time in the next few days to talk.,
When it comes time for the conversation, be willing to listen as much as you want to be heard.,
Find out what they want in their home.,
If they admit that something you have done has triggered them to act in this way, then get to the root of that.,
If they don't agree to have a talk, ask why not.,
Set boundaries clearly with an unwilling flatmate.,
Document what happens.,
Consider moving out.",How to Handle Nasty Comments from Flatmates3," Let them know in a gentle, non-accusatory manner that there are some things you think could go better in your house or apartment, and you'd like to talk about it and reach a consensus that works for all of you.

, Do be sure to set boundaries, though, and be clear that you are not a doormat and will not tolerate being treated rudely in your own home. Be clear about what you DO want in your home: feelings of peace, comfort, trust, openness, respect etc. Tell them the ways in which you have been attempting to be friendly (perhaps describe habits of yours that display general kindness, which they do not reflect back at you). Tell them that these things are meaningful to you and you would like to receive the same respect.

, Peace, joy, comfort, security, fun, luxury, love? What are their main desires at home, and what do these mean to them? How would they like to be treated? Most likely you are not so different, so you can use this as a way of generating empathy between both of you - ""me too. I want peace too. How can we both have that?"" Or, maybe your needs are different. If so, you need to find that out as well, and then see if a compromise can be reached.

, Was your action misunderstood? If so, explain your side non-defensively. Or, did you really do something malicious or inconsiderate? Be willing to apologize if necessary.

,


If they insist on dealing with things in the moment, then tell them in straightforward language how their most recent comment affected you. Tell them that you've been feeling increasingly uncomfortable at home because of their rude comments. You feel you deserve to be at peace in your own home, and need to clear this up. Hopefully they should be willing to talk to you.
If they refuse to communicate at all, then the situation is unworkable. You need to find something better. Consider one of you moving away. See the information above for more on that.

, For example, ""It is not okay to mess with the things in my bedroom"" or ""I expect you to treat me with respect."" Be assertive, non-judgmental, and to the point.


Talking about your feelings won't help if they are trying to hurt your feelings. ""I"" language and nonviolent communication are not effective tools for this type of problem.

, If your flatmate is regularly being mean to you on purpose, this is bullying. Keeping a clear written record can be useful, especially if you need to explain to a college RA or other person why you need to move rooms.


Keep the record out of sight from your flatmate. If they find it, they may get worse, or destroy the record.
Keep your log entries factual, such as ""Larissa said my painting looked garish and childish, and that I was an awful painter who would never keep my scholarship. She acted like she would rip it, but I grabbed it. I went to my room and cried."" Opinion statements, such as ""Larissa is awful and I hate her,"" are best left for venting to a diary or trusted friend.

, If they are not willing to meet your needs of peace and safety at home, or treat you with basic respect, then the two of you should not live together. This should depend on who has been established in the house or apartment the longest, and basic common sense. For instance, if anyone was planning to move out soon anyway, then there is no point in the other person moving out.

Know the rules regarding workplace romance.,
Only date people at the same level as yourself.,
Keep your routine intact.,
Keep your relationship private for as long as possible.,
Don’t document your relationship.,
Avoid attending social gatherings together.,
Don’t allow your relationship to impact your work.,
Tell your boss when the time is right.",How to Handle an Office Relationship1," It's always better if you are aware of the regulations and rules by which you have to work, Inform yourself and your partner about what policies the firm has in place regarding conducting a romantic relationship in the workplace.


Once you know what the rules are, you can do your best to avoid breaking them. You should also know what kind of trouble you can get into if you do break the rules.
Consult the company handbook on office conduct and read the company's harassment policy for more information.;
, It's a good idea to only date fellow employees who are at the same level as you. When you date someone who is your superior or your subordinate things can get messy.


Dating a superior or a subordinate can get messy, as people will be more inclined to gossip about the circumstances surrounding the relationship. For example, if you are dating a subordinate, people might think you are taking advantage of your position of authority and manipulating the other person. This also leaves you open to a harassment suit if the relationship goes sour.
If you are dating a superior, people might think that you just trying to get favors like a promotion or a raise.

, The best way to handle your relationship is to cast a protective shell around your new relationship to the extent that nobody is aware of it till the time you yourself decide to share it with others.


Keep your work hours the same and do not purposely avoid people whom you used to hang out with. Also take your lunches as you always used to do.
People notice small changes and if you do anything out of the ordinary, the gossipy office types won’t spare you.

, You might be tempted to share details of your relationship with your close friends at work, but it’s probably wiser to not give in to this urge. The less people know, the better.


If you are conducting a relationship with another employee and things are getting serious, you want your boss to hear it directly from you, not through office gossip.
It’s acceptable to tell friends as long as they are not going to talk about it, however, you should preferably share it with those friends who do not have any connections with your workplace.

, Company emails are not private, so you should not document anything about your relationship via email.


Most companies have servers that can easily extract all your emails and they can track emails sent between employees. More than enough evidence will be available against you if you end up on a bitter note in your relationship.
If it’s really tempting for you to write something sweet, try using post it notes to convey your message but it’s highly recommended to restrict yourself to cell phone texts to let go of all risks of it getting revealed.

, Staying cautious in the workplace can be relatively easy because you are busy most of the time. However, if there are any official gatherings like a hangout at local bar or office Christmas Party, there is an increased risk of you and your romantic interest being found. Don’t take any risks, as office gossip tends to spread like wildfire.


Such purposeful avoidance will pay you off in long run. If it’s not possible to skip these events entirely, try to make your appearances at different time slots so that there is less to be noticed.

, You can send text messages using your cell phone if necessary, but aside from that nothing pertaining to your relationship should become a source of distraction or affect your performance at work.


You are risking your professional future if you shirk your work duties for the sake of a relationship.
Stay busy while at work and spare no time to risk exposure. If you don’t stay busy, you ll be thinking more about your partner or you may go out of your way to plan interactive opportunities.

, If the relationship becomes serious and you're tired of feeling like you're sneaking around all the time, then it's a good idea to set up a meeting with your boss and tell them about it face to face.


As long as the relationship is not a direct breach of the company's harassment or workplace relationship policy, and you are both remaining professional about it, there's no reason for your boss to object.
Your boss should appreciate your honesty and will probably be much more accepting of the relationship if he hears it directly from you, rather than hearing it secondhand.

Coach your management.,
Broadcast your harassment policy.,
Develop or review your workplace romance policy.,
Handling any issues according to the company policy.,
Watch out for inappropriate behaviors.,
Acknowledge employee complaints.,
Keep the issue as private as possible.,
Take appropriate action.This includes all steps you would consider taking to keep the employees performance and behavior intact.",How to Handle an Office Relationship2," This pertains to providing training and awareness to supervisors and managers to discreetly address any office relationships. They should be advised to monitor office relationships without infringing on any employee’s privacy.


The managers should be instructed to amicably and comfortably coach employees who get into a relationship with each other. If necessary, they should talk to the employees any negative impact their relationship has had on the office environment, on productivity, or on team morale.
They should also be instructed to keep their ears open for gossip and any potentially career damaging behaviors in case the relationship breaks up. Where a breakup ends up becoming a sexual harassment claim, they are advised to immediately take action in consultation with HR.

, The company should have a well defined policy to handle any sexual harassment claims. The policy should detail how a sexual harassment claim should be handled.


The policy should serve the purpose of educating employees about the behaviors that fall under harassment and emphasize the fact that the company has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment.

, If the company finds it suitable, it may be a good idea to establish a separate workplace relationship policy. However, sometimes this is covered under the company's harassment policy.


The workplace relationship policy may state that all staff members are expected to behave in a professional manner and all personal interactions and relationships must be kept outside of the workplace.
Furthermore, consequences of the relationship turning bitter must be clearly spelled out within this policy.

, Once you have a concrete policy that is being periodically reviewed, you should be prepared to handle an issue if it comes your way.

, There has to be a level of professionalism and decorum maintained throughout the office, relationship or no relationship. So when two employees are together you need to watch them closely for any inappropriate behaviors.


Things like hand holding, talking intimately, rubbing shoulders, spending unnecessary time with each other, etc. are inappropriate in the workplace and should be nipped in the bud. If it is allowed to continue, these behaviors can irritate other employees and create slackness in discipline that can affect the productivity of the workplace.
However, if the two employees do behave appropriately and the relationship does not seem to be affecting their productivity or the other employees morale in anyway, there is no reason that the relationship should not be allowed to continue.

, Office relationships can sometimes affect other employees in a negative way, and when this happens they are liable to put forward their concern in the form of a complaint.


Addressing any employee complaints regarding an office relationship becomes more important if the office relationship is negatively affecting general work environment and productivity.
Secondly, if upon a breakup, either individual comes up to you for filing a claim of harassment, this also has to be acknowledged. When a complaint arrives, you have to consider employee records before making any decisions.

, Every employer understands that such a sensitive issue should not be disclosed publicly, but should be dealt with in private.


If you attempt to discuss the issue in front of other staff members, this may cause a lot of embarrassment to the employees involved in the relationship and could even be interpreted as a violation of their privacy.

, All this is undertaken in light of the impact on the overall organization. Many times organizations take strict action so that others learn from it.


Appropriate action taken by the employer will depend on the specific situation. Sometimes only slight changes may be necessary, like transferring employees to new roles or new location. However sometimes more drastic action is necessary, such as firing an employee on harassment grounds.
Other associated actions include conducting policy refresher sessions across the organization to ensure that the work environment stays pleasant and that these types of situations are avoided in future.

Understand the negative aspects of an office romance.,
Be aware of the possible consequences of an office relationship.,
Consider the positives of a workplace romance.",How to Handle an Office Relationship3," Keep in mind that no matter how well the relationship starts off, the workplace romance itself can be a recipe for disaster.


Since you are in constant interaction with your partner, you may encounter friction within the relationship because you may need your alone time to pursue your interests like hanging out with friends. Your time alone may become a subject of discussion.
You may be distracted while at work and you will be unable to perform your professional responsibilities as outstandingly as possible. You should also be sure to avoid accusation of favoritism or conflict of interest.
You may also feel jealous if you are keeping your relationship a secret while others may flirt with your partner. You should deal with these matters as a mature individual.

, Before you indulge in a relationship carefully consider whom should you be involved with, what could be the possible consequences of being in a relationship or ultimately breaking up.


The situation may become awkward if you are in a relationship with a colleague and the break up occurs at the time when career advancement planning is at its peak.
If you are involved with a subordinate, false accusations of favoritism or harassment may arise after the break up.
If the breakup negatively affects workplace relations or ends in a harassment claim, it may result in you getting fired.

, On the other hand, office relationships can be a positive thing. If you've found someone whose company you enjoy and who shares the same interests as you, then that's something to be celebrated, not something to feel guilty about.


When you're in a job that requires spending a lot of time in the office, it limits the opportunities to meet someone outside of work. Dating someone in your work takes pressure off trying to meet someone and ensures that the other person understands your schedule and the demands of your work.
The second advantage is that you spend many hours together which gives you a much better idea of what the other person is actually like, before things get too serious. This can save you from a lot of stress and heartbreak down the line.
Furthermore, if you carpool to work with the person you're dating, you can save on gas expenses!

Be yourself.,
Talk to each other.,
Pay attention to small things.,
Try new things.,
Spend time together.,
Spend some time apart.",How to Handle a New Relationship1,"

Let your new mate have a chance to get to know more about you and the great things there are to love about you. Don’t change yourself to fit their likes and desires.Remember if they didn’t like the real you, they wouldn’t be in a relationship with you.

Be honest about the things you do and don’t like or agree with.
For example, if you don’t like basketball, don’t fake enthusiasm for March Madness.
If you enjoy sketching, share some of your drawings with your significant other.;
, Although you know enough about your partner to be in a relationship with them, there’s a lot you don’t know and a lot they don’t know about you. The more you know about each other, the more you will understand each other and the stronger your relationship will be.


Talk about everyday things like how your day was, funny things your friends did, your plans for the weekend.
Talk to your significant other to learn more about their dreams and goals. Share your hopes and aspirations with them.
Discuss your fears, worries, and even your mistakes with each other. Sharing these things will form a bond between you two.

, You will learn a lot about your mate by talking to them, but a great deal of what you learn will be from observing them and paying attention to other hints about them. Notice what types of music, movies, and TV shows they prefer. What situations make them laugh? What makes them angry? What types of things do they like or comment on online?

,

Because you are individuals, you and your partner will have some things in common as well as different interests, opinions, etc. Be open to doing things their way every once and a while, you just might discover that you like it or learn something new.Let them introduce you to their hobbies, and teach you how to do them. (Everyone loves to feel like an expert.) You can teach them to do your favorite activities too.
Listen to and think about their opinion on where to go, what to do, how to do things, etc.
Don’t feel pressured to do anything you really don’t want to do. You can try new things without giving up your morals, values, or beliefs.

, The best way to get to know each other is to spend time together. Try to interact with each other in a variety of settings so that you can experience the different sides to each other.

Spending time one-on-one gives you a chance to pay attention to each other without distractions.
When you do things in a group setting, it allows you to see how they interact with others.
Don’t just pay attention to how great they look, but also what seems to make them comfortable or uncomfortable, what types of activities and settings they enjoy, etc.

, Although you will probably want to be around each other all the time, it’s a good idea to spend some time apart.Doing things outside of your relationship means you have something to talk about when you are together. It also gives you time to reflect on your partner and the relationship.


Do things and go places without each other. You had interests before you started your relationship. Continue to do those things.
Make time for your friends and family. Even though you are in a relationship, the other people in your life still need you and want to spend time with you, too.
Make sure you are making time to take care of your other responsibilities (clean your room, finish your work, feed the fish, etc.).

Talk about whether you’ve cheated or have been cheated on, and ask your partner about his or her past. Talk about what would happen to the relationship in the event of infidelity.


For example, if one person cheats, is the relationship over, or is there room to work through it? How have your past experiences shaped your views now?;
, What is considered cheating may differ from one person to the next. For example, do you consider flirting to be cheating? What about meeting in private? Kissing? Where does emotional cheating fit in? Determine your own boundaries for cheating and discuss them with your partner. Talk about each of your comfort levels and determine what’s okay and what’s not. Boundaries are about controlling what you do, not what other people do.For example, if you disengage from a potentially lustful interaction, this is a boundary that you’ve created.
Say to your partner, “I want to respect our relationship and you. It makes me uncomfortable to be at a dinner alone with someone I know is attracted to me. I will not do that. What is a boundary for you?”

, If you and your partner are going through a rough patch, talk it through. Don’t avoid it or pretend that it doesn’t exist. Instead, be honest and confront what is going on. Find some common goals and work toward them.This could mean “Let’s plan to sit down and discuss our finances each week” or “Let’s work on yelling less.”

, To help increase the intimacy of your relationship, you and your partner should agree on certain practices and rules to help you bond together. These can be boundaries about how you spend time together or little daily habits that help improve your relationship. Some ideas include:

Banning electronics from the bedroom and dinner table
Having at least one meal together a day
Taking a walk together after a meal
Going out on a date once a week

, Maintaining a relationship takes work. Don’t get distracted by work, activities, and other things on a regular basis. Instead, make your top priority your relationship.If you have a fight, repair your bond afterward. Make time for your partner and always strive to put the relationship first.


Do the things you did when you first started dating, such as going out together, talking about life in general, and being silly together.

, Know appropriate versus inappropriate behavior with others. If someone is flirting with you, you do not have to flirt back. If someone asks for your phone number, it’s okay to say, “No thank you.” Practice ways of turning down advances. One boundary to practice is not discussing relationship issues with someone you feel attraction toward. Many affairs begin as supportive friendships that lacked boundaries and became muddled.If someone hits on you, be direct and honest. Say, “I’m flattered, but I’m not interested” or, “No thank you, I’m in a relationship.”

, If you start to see your partner as the cause of your unhappiness, you may start to feel like a victim. If you feel victimized, you may convince yourself of many things by placing blame onto someone else.For example, “My partner is mean to me sometimes, so I don’t have to make time for him or do nice things. If only he was nicer, I’d be a better girlfriend.” Blaming your unhappiness or dissatisfaction on your partner is a slippery slope that can lead to feeling sorry for yourself, even if you know you’re partly (or fully) to blame.


If you find yourself blaming your partner for how unfulfilled you feel in your relationship, take an honest look at yourself. Are you doing all you can for the relationship or are you creating an excuse for bad behavior?

, Prioritizing your relationship doesn’t mean spending all of your time and energy with your partner. Encourage your partner to pursue his or her interests and be supportive. You and your partner likely differ on activities and that’s okay. Allow your partner to pursue his or her interests and be with friends, because not everything has to be done as a couple.This can help your partner feel supported in his or her own pursuits, which can strengthen your bond as a couple.


If your partner enjoys outside activities, don’t be jealous of his or her time. Instead, be supportive of the activity and the friendships your partner enjoys.
Even if you don’t understand your partner’s interests, be supportive and encouraging. For example, if your partner enjoys going to synagogue but you do not share the same faith, be supportive of him or her without putting your partner down.

, If you feel threatened by your partner’s behavior with others, it’s immature to try and make him or her jealous. Don’t flirt with someone else in an effort to escalate cheating behaviors or make your partner jealous.If you have a problem with your partner’s behavior, talk about it instead of acting on it.


Revenge will likely hurt your relationship, not help it.

, If you demand to look through your partner’s phone or know who he or she is seeing, you may be overly vigilant in your relationship. If you constantly must know what your partner is up to or if you go so far to spy on your partner, it’s likely you have some trust issues.Instead of distrusting your partner, talk about why you feel threatened.


Your partner may feel put-off by your possessiveness, which may lead him or her to do things behind your back. This can become a vicious cycle.

, Trust is the primary foundation of a relationship. Avoid bringing past hurts and heartbreaks into your relationship. If you’ve been hurt before, it doesn’t mean that your current partner will hurt you. If your partner knows that you do not trust him or her, it can create tension in the relationship.Distrust comes from feeling insecure and powerless. Work with a professional to help you with these feelings and build trust again.
Avoid tracking your partner obsessively on social media or looking up their ex-partners online. You may want to set rules and expectations about social media use if you think that it will be a problem.

, If you’ve previously dealt with infidelity in your relationship, you may be extra careful to guard against future infidelity. Many couples find therapy helpful for moving through the hurt and pain and transitioning into a stable future together. Therapy can help re-build trust and faithfulness. It can help each partner to work through difficult emotions and gain trust in each other once again.Tell your current partner about past infidelity. Let them know what you learned from the incident as well as what you need in this relationship to heal. Make sure that you both address what is acceptable and not acceptable for you in a relationship.
Don’t make any threats you don’t fully intend to carry out. For example, if you tell your partner that you’ll leave if he or she cheats again, be ready to leave if that happens.
Avoid making any large decisions early in the healing process, such as moving out, leaving the kids, or getting a divorce. These are life-changing decisions that cannot easily be undone.

, When life gets difficult or you struggle to understand your partner, remember that you play on the same team! Don’t purposefully hurt your partner or do something you know will upset your partner. Instead, focus on working together. If something doesn’t work, scrap it and try something new. Avoid turning against your partner as this can cause rifts and create distance between you. Be cooperative in making the relationship work.Letting your partner know you will always stand together assures him or her that you can be counted on.
In times of distress and conflict, remind yourself that even though you may not like your partner, you still love him or her. Act in ways that will help you resolve problems and move on.

, Share your affection with your partner. Hold hands, cuddle, and be close. Do something loving toward your partner that you know he or she will appreciate. This can help your partner understand your commitment and love toward him or her.Being affectionate can reassure your partner of your care and desire to be close together, and that you chose him or her to be near.


Surprise your partner with a night of stargazing or take your partner to the bed & breakfast he or she has always wanted to go to. Pay attention to the details your partner casually says, such as, “It would be fun to go to Mackinaw Island” or “I’d really love to see the northern lights one day.”

, A thoughtful gift can show your partner that you care. Buy your partner something nice that he or she will enjoy.A gift shows your partner that you are thinking of him or her and that you’re putting in effort to be loving. It doesn’t have to be jewelry or cologne; instead, choose something that will appeal to your partner. It may be an action figure or a pair of shoes.


Use the element of surprise to please your partner. Come home and have a gift waiting for your partner, or buy something “just because.”

, Make time for physical intimacy with your partner. If this part of your relationship is gone by the wayside, amp it up again.Sharing sexual intimacy can strengthen your bond together and make you feel close with your partner. Add some spice to your relationship and do things you know your partner enjoys. Be playful, sexy, and fun.

, The best thing to do before considering a second chance; sit back, reflect and meditate on the reasons for misunderstandings.

, Don't go ahead and expect more than what is achievable as far as the issue is concerned.

, If you and either or both of your parents have fallen apart for some reasons known best between the two of you, then that is upon you, if not your parent to fix that. Both sides may have a problem putting their pride aside, but someone has to step in at the end of the day.

, Parents sometimes may think that we, being their children, deserve no apologies from them, but it's upon us to let them know that they were wrong but that you still wish to give them a chance to make things right and vice versa.

, If you were in a relationship with someone that you treasured or loved and then things fell apart, rethink your options and allow your partner a second chance to make things right. As it is said, it's better the devil you know, than the angel you don't.

, If things with your partner seem to be hitting the wall other than growing positively, try to give each other some ""space apart"", then give each other a second chance later on.

, If the person you have issues with seems to think that you are the one on the wrong and you know it's true, the best you can do is ""own up"" to the blame.

, If the issues you have with either party seems to want to head for a fight, you should take the initiative of backing up and give them time to cool off first before picking up the discussion again.

Talk and listen.,
Speak up.,
Disagree with each other.,
Let some things go.",How to Handle a New Relationship2," Regular communication builds your new relationship and allows you to get to know one another more. It also helps cut down on misunderstandings and confusion. Remember, though, that communication is a two-way street; make sure that you are doing as much listening in your relationship as you are talking.Even if it’s just a ‘good morning’ message or afternoon call, check-in with each other on a regular basis. Everyone likes to know that someone else is thinking of them.
Make time to actually sit-down and just talk with each other. Talk about your day, your goals, your fears, your friends, etc.
Listen to what they have to say and share with you. Use your talks as a way to learn more about each other and to support each other.
Talk about the serious and important things face-to-face.,

When something is really bothering you, then say something about it. It’s better to speak up when something first upsets you than to let it go and have it turn into a big issue later on. Remember, the relationship is still new and your mate doesn’t know all of your boundaries yet.Talk calmly about what is on your mind in private and don’t use an accusatory tone.
For example, you don’t want shout, “You are so inconsiderate! Spreading our business to everyone!” at them in the middle of the mall.
Instead, you might wait until you two are alone and say, “Hey, babe, it makes me uncomfortable to talk to strangers about personal issues. Can we keep our personal stuff between just us?”

, All relationships have times when the two people don’t agree with one another; this is normal. How you communicate during your disagreement (more so than what you disagree about) is what determines how long your new relationship will last. Relationships are measured on the quality of the make-up compared to the frequency or intensity of the disagreements.


Disagreements simply mean that you are individuals with two different ways of viewing or doing things.
Focus on what is right, not who is right. Trying to problem-solve, rather than blaming each other will strengthen your new relationship.
Speak respectfully to each other and avoid saying things just because you are angry or hurt.
Be able to “agree to disagree” about some things. Accept that there are some things you simply will never see eye-to-eye about. If they aren’t major, then just agree that each of you has your own perspective.
Focus on getting all of your feelings out during the argument. Express all of your feelings, emotions, and opinions about the situation. Then, however, you should focus on repairing the relationship.
Check in with your partner afterward. Ask, ""Are you okay?"" or ""Is there anything you're still upset about?"" Then plan to do something special to make up.

,

Although you should voice your concerns, you don’t have to point out every little thing. There will be things about your sweetie that annoy you, but not everything is worth discussing, or even mentioning.Accept that some things are just an endearing quirk of their character, the same as they do for you.

If the issue doesn’t go against your morals or values; doesn’t hurt anyone; and isn’t worth leaving them for, then try to let it go.
For example, the way he says ‘pacifically’ instead of ‘specifically’ might be annoying, but it isn’t a relationship-ending issue, so just let it go.

"
"
Talk about it.,
Take it one step at a time.,
Make the first move.",How to Handle a New Relationship3,"

Because the relationship is new, you all need to talk about what you want and are okay with in terms of intimacy.It might be a little awkward at first, but talking about it eliminates any confusion and misunderstandings that may arise later.

Discuss what types of intimacy you are okay with; For example, holding hands, hugging, kissing, cuddling, etc.
You might try saying, “This is a little weird, but I want to talk about what I’m okay with. I like holding hands a lot, but I’m not all right with…”
Talk about how fast or slow you want to move as well as being safe at each step.
For example, you could say, “I want to take things slowly and enjoy the process of getting to know each other.”

, There is no reason to rush. Sure you may want to get physical, but if this is the start of the relationship there's plenty of time for that.Get to know each other in other ways before you get intimate. Taking it one step at a time allows you to enjoy each step of getting to know each other this way.


Consider your emotional attachment as the benchmark by which to measure if you are ready for physical intimacy. Do you feel emotionally close, safe, and open enough to match those feelings through physical intimacy?
Remember that neither of you have to do anything or move any faster than you are ready to.
Just because you all have talked about your limits doesn’t mean you should go straight to those limits.
For example, if you both agree that the limit is kissing, then don’t start with kissing. Start with holding hands for a bit and enjoy that closeness. Then move to hugging, then to kissing.

,

When the relationship is new, both people can be a little nervous about making the first move. Once you have talked about your physical boundaries, you may have to (or want to) be the one to make the first romantic move.If you are nervous, then take a few deep breaths.
You can ask them if it’s okay. It can be really sweet to say, “Can I hold your hand?” or “Can I kiss you?”.
Don’t be worried if it’s a little awkward at first, just remember that the relationship is new and you are still getting to know each other.

Talk about the relationship.,
Talk about the relationship future.,
Admit when things aren’t working.",How to Handle a New Relationship4,"

Even though the relationship is new, talking about how you both think it is going will help the two of you solve any problems that you foresee. Discuss what works for you and what you like about the relationship, as well as what doesn’t make you so happy., Have a realistic and honest conversation about where you see the relationship heading. Making sure you are both thinking the same about the future of the relationship will make it easier for you the two to build your new relationship., Sometimes relationships don’t work out and the sooner you admit it, the better for both people. If you have gotten to know one another, tried communicating, and spending time together (and apart), talked about the relationship and either of you aren’t happy, you should consider talking about whether the relationship should continue.

Though everyone gets annoyed with their boyfriend from time to time, you shouldn’t spend most of your time nagging him or talking about the things you hate about him; focus on the positive and compliment his strong attributes while encouraging him to always be his best self.


If your boyfriend loves the person he is around you, he’ll want to spend even more time with you. If you make him feel down about himself, then it’s natural that he’ll want to spend less time with you.;
, If you want the relationship to continue feeling fresh and exciting, then you should never forget that romantic feeling you felt in the first days of your courtship. Though you can’t be sweet and romantic all of the time, you should still make the effort to be loving and romantic and to show your boyfriend how much he means to you so you can keep your passion alive. Here are some things that you can do:


Write him sweet notes for him to find when you’re not home telling him how much he means to you.
Send him a cute text message when he’s having a long day.
Plan to have romantic date nights at least twice a month and make an effort to dress up and really give it your all.
Give him passionate, exciting kisses. Don’t make kissing feel like it’s part of a routine.
Give him the affection that he needs. Even if you’ve both had a long day, just hugging or cuddling can ignite that spark.

, If you want to keep things interesting, then you and your boyfriend can try a variety of activities together so that you never run out of things to be excited about. This can mean taking a trip to a new hiking site once a month, exploring a new part of the city you live in together, taking a dance class together, or even starting a two-person book club together. Finding new things to enjoy together can deepen your bond and make you love each other even more.


You don’t have to try too hard to do something new. Just one completely new thing every few weeks will do the trick; it’s important to find a routine you love, too.
Be spontaneous. If you wake up on a Saturday morning and feel like painting your room yellow or taking a trip to the beach together, then go for it.

, In order to really win your boyfriend over, you have to show that you can get along with his buddies. You shouldn’t be the girl who makes him less fun when you’re around, and you shouldn’t be cold or even rude to his friends because you think they’re not worth your time, either. Instead, you should ask them questions about their lives, be friendly when you see them even when your boyfriend’s not around, and make an effort to make them feel comfortable.


If his friends like you, then they’ll tell your boyfriend that you’re a catch. If you’re closed off toward them, then they may have less than nice things to say about you.

, To keep your relationship strong and healthy, and to have your boyfriend like you even more, you have to make sure that you make enough time to do your own thing. This can be writing poetry, hanging out with your friends, or taking daily yoga classes—it doesn’t really matter what you do, though it does matter that you make time for personal growth. If you’re a cool girl who has her own life going on, then your boyfriend will like you even more for it; if he feels like he’s the center of your universe, then he’ll be more cautious around you.


Having a meaningful life outside of your relationship will make your boyfriend feel like it’s a privilege to spend time with you. If he thinks that you have all day to spend time with him, then he may take you for granted a bit more.
Making time to see your friends will also help you stay in touch with other people who help you grow as a person and to live a more well-rounded life.

, If your boyfriend is having a hard week, then you can help him out by doing little favors for him, from getting him coffee to putting gas in his car if he’s really low on time. Taking the time to make his life a little bit easier will show him how much you care about his happiness; just make sure that he would do the same for you and that he’s not taking advantage of you.


He may not always admit it if he needs your help, but you should be on the lookout to make sure that he’s not just being coy with you. If he’s clearly struggling and super stressed out, see if you can help lighten the load a bit.

, If you want your relationship to stay exciting, then you should keep things fresh and fiery in the bedroom. Whether you’re having sex or just making out a lot, you should make sure to keep that momentum going, even if you’ve been together for a while. Don’t make your boyfriend feel like you’re only hooking up because he wants to, but because you’re really feeling it, too. That said, you should never feel pressure to do more than you’re comfortable with just to please your boyfriend.


Every relationship moves at its own pace and you shouldn’t have sex with your boyfriend if you’re not ready. However, if you two are sexually active, then make sure there’s still time for foreplay, affection, and some cuddling afterward, so you don’t take each other for granted too much.

, If you really want your boyfriend to love you, then you have to be able to respect his boundaries and to let him continue to be his own person. If you want to spend every second with him and always ask him what he’s doing when you’re not around, then you’ll come off as clingy or codependent, and this won’t get you very far with most guys; instead, you should cherish the time you spend together and enjoy being apart, knowing that it’s healthy for you both to pursue your own interests.


Plus, if you and your boyfriend spend more time doing your own thing, then you’ll be able to appreciate each other more when you’re together.
If your boyfriend has more time to study, play guitar, or pursue his other interests, then he’ll be able to grow as a person. You should want him to continue to develop into a healthy, well-rounded human being if you truly care for him.
You don’t want him to feel like he’s accountable to you 24/7 or he’ll feel smothered. Show him that you trust him enough to let him train for a marathon for a few hours without calling him three times.

, To get your boyfriend to really appreciate you, you have to be understanding of the fact that he needs to have time with his guy friends in order to feel a healthy sense of proportion in his life. Though he may see his friends less frequently because you’re in the picture, you shouldn’t make him feel guilty every time he hangs with his friends or get him to spend time with you instead; let him see that you’re okay with him being with his friends and that you want him to have a good time without you.


You also don’t always have to make him choose. If you’re hanging out together, invite some of your friends and some of his friends to join you, so hanging out in groups becomes more natural. Though solo guy time is still important, this can be a nice compromise sometimes.
When he’s out with his friends, you shouldn’t call or text him a lot asking when he’s coming home, or he’ll feel like you don’t trust him or want him to have a good time.

, To be an understanding girlfriend in a loving relationship, you need to learn that it’s important to not always get your way. You should work on compromising with your boyfriend when you find yourselves in a tricky situation and finding solutions to problems that can make both of you happy. Sometimes, you can give in to him, as long as he lets you get your way, too. If your boyfriend thinks that you have to get your way or you’ll be annoyed with him, then he’ll be less likely to have a good time with you.


If you disagree about something, make sure you hear each other out so you understand whether or not the matter at hand is really important to your boyfriend.
Don’t name call or get so angry that it’s impossible for your boyfriend to get a word in. Take some time to calm down if you need to before you try to make things work.
If your boyfriend gets “his way” once in a while—like if you two decide to go to a baseball game instead of your friend’s party—then you should try to make the best of it instead of resenting him the whole time.

, If you want your boyfriend to really love and respect you, then you have to be able to admit when you’re wrong. Look him in the eyes, put away your phone, and make him see how truly sorry you are. Don’t make him think that you’re saying sorry just because you want something from him or because you feel like you have to; let him see that you’re really troubled by what you did and that you’re determined not to do it again.


It’s much more important to admit that you’re human than to try to act perfect so your boyfriend will like you. If you don’t get in denial when you’ve made a mistake, your boyfriend will appreciate you a lot more for it.
Don’t say, “I’m sorry that you got mad when I…” because this kind of talk puts the blame on your boyfriend. Instead, take accountability for your actions and say, “I’m sorry that I…”

, If you want to be understanding and to show your boyfriend how much you really care about him, then you have to make an effort to step into your boyfriend’s shoes every once in a while to try to see a situation from his perspective. Considering what’s really going through his head can help you see that not everything is as black and white as it seems and that he may have more reasons for what he does or says than you think.


For example, if he’s been acting really distant for the past two weeks, you should consider other things going on in his life that may lead him to act that way. If his grandmother just passed away, he’s stressed about finding a new job, or he’s had a horrible cold, then he may just not be feeling like himself; understand that not all of his behavior has to do with you.
If you know he’s having a rough week, make an effort to help him out more, whether it’s by making him dinner or running a quick errand for him. As long as he would do the same for you when you’re not having a great week, this is a great way to say that you’re really thinking about what he’s going through.

, To get your boyfriend to really fall for you, you have to show that you care about his family, even if you couldn’t be more different from them. Make an effort to be friendly, to make small talk, and to be a considerate guest in his family’s home. If it’s just not working, you should try to be patient and do your best instead of bad mouthing them to your boyfriend or giving them attitude; remember that at the end of the day, he wants a girl who can fit comfortably into his life, and if you feel like you can’t go thirty seconds without getting in an argument with his mother, then that’s a red flag.


Of course, if his family really is truly cold and unwelcoming, you don’t need to completely suck up to them. Work on maintaining a respectful distance from them and on discussing the situation as sensitively as possible if you talk to your boyfriend about it.
At the end of the day, you have to remember that your boyfriend has known his family a lot longer than he’s known you. Don’t try to make him choose between you or them.

, Another way to be understanding and to make your boyfriend really fall for you is to have strong communication in your relationship. This could mean talking to your boyfriend about why you had a bad day instead of pretending everything is fine, asking him why he’s upset when he’s clearly not feeling his best but holding back, and bringing up something that’s been bothering you in the relationship in a tactful and respectful manner. Making a habit of having strong communication skills can help you and your boyfriend have a healthy and loving relationship.


When it comes to having a serious talk, timing can be everything. Don’t bringing up something that’s been bothering you for weeks fifteen minutes before your boyfriend’s birthday party or his job interview. Though you can’t wait for the perfect opportunity forever, you should try to find the most convenient time to talk if you want to be taken seriously.
Listening is just as important as talking. When your boyfriend is trying to tell you something, make sure you really listen to what he’s saying instead of waiting for your turn to speak or interrupting him.

, If you want your boyfriend to fall for you, then you have to show him that you’re comfortable in the relationship. If you’re constantly doubting him, asking where he’s been, or even comparing yourself to other girls, then you’ll only be giving him more reasons to doubt you. If you’re comfortable with yourself and say nice things about other girls, on the other hand, then he’ll be even more inclined to love you because you’ll be confident in who you are.


Of course, if your boyfriend is legitimately doing something suspicious, then you have the right to be jealous and to ask questions. But if you ask him questions any time he’s been talking to a girl or even interrupt any solo conversations he has with a girl, it’ll start to get old.
Instead of gossiping about other girls or calling them ugly, tell him about the things you love about your friends or a new girl you just met. You should be happy enough with yourself and your relationship not to care about the other girls out there.

, Unfortunately, not even a magic spell can make your boyfriend fall in love with you. Love takes time, and sometimes, he’ll either begin to feel it or he won’t. You can be the most perfect girlfriend in the world and can give him everything you think he needs, but he may just not be able to have that loving feeling for you. This can be incredibly heartbreaking, but it’s better to be realistic and to know when it’s just not happening than to keep hoping for something that just isn’t there.


If you’re coming to this page, then it should be because you want to be a better girlfriend and have an even more amazing relationship. However, you shouldn’t be looking for ways to change yourself so that your boyfriend will love you more.
If you feel like you’ve tried everything and have been together for a long time and he’s just not returning the intensity of your feelings, then you should ask yourself whether you think it’s worth continuing the relationship.

, Forcing your boyfriend to move too fast can also put the relationship in jeopardy. If you make him move too fast too soon, then you may be keeping him from naturally developing those loving feelings for you at his own pace. Give him time to meet your friends and your family, go on weekend trips with you, move in with you, or even to say the words “I love you.” Though each relationship has its own timeline, you shouldn’t expect him to say he loves you in the first few weeks, or even the first few months, or you may even be scaring him away.


In fact, if you keep pressuring him to move faster and keep asking him why he hasn’t introduced you to his friends or invited you over for Thanksgiving dinner, then you may actually be scaring him away. Respect the fact that he needs time for his feelings to develop.
If you find that you love him after the first few weeks, you may want to think twice before announcing it to him right away. If you don’t think he’s anywhere near on the same page, then you may be scaring him away with this kind of talk.

, Though every relationship is about give and take, you shouldn’t make your boyfriend do 1,000 different activities that you think a good boyfriend should do if it’s not his thing. If he really isn’t outdoorsy, you can ask him to go on a hike or two without forcing him to go camping for two weeks; if he’s not into couple workouts, don’t drag him to your yoga class. Be respectful of the fact that there are some things that he just won’t want to do and stick to enjoying the things that actually make both of you happy.


Don’t feel like forcing him to do something he has no interest in doing, like painting your friend’s entire house, is some kind of way for him to prove his love for you.
Of course, everyone has to do something he doesn’t want to do to make a relationship work. Your boyfriend may wish he was hanging out with his friends instead of going shopping with your mom, but he’ll just have to suck it up sometimes. But when you feel like you’re “dragging” him to do almost everything together, you may have a problem.

, Every relationship is different, and you won’t get anywhere if you go around comparing your relationship to your parents’, your best friend’s, or your next door neighbor’s. Just because your best friend and her boyfriend moved in together after only dating for six months doesn’t mean you should do the same; just because your parents got married when they were twenty-five doesn’t mean you have to follow the same timeline. If you get too wrapped up in doing what you “should” do in your relationship, then you won’t be able to enjoy your relationship on its own terms.


Furthermore, nothing will drive your boyfriend faster than comparing your relationship to another relationship. He’ll start to feel like your expectations are unreasonable and that he’ll never be enough for you.
You can never fully understand the dynamics between two other people, so you shouldn’t think that another relationship can give you answers about your own. You can certainly seek advice from others, but you should remember that the most important relationship is the one between you and your boyfriend.

, If you feel like you have to change the person who you are to win your boyfriend over, then you should back off as soon as possible. At the end of the day, while there are certain things you may be able to do to make your relationship stronger and to be a more understanding girlfriend, you should want your boyfriend to appreciate and love the person who you really are, not some perfect, polished version of what you think a girlfriend should be.


If you find yourself acting or dressing in a way that seems not like you at all, you may need to rethink your motivations. Are you changing yourself because it’s what your boyfriend really wants, or because you think it’s what he wants? At the end of the day, it’s most important that you stay true to yourself.

Pick a calm, quiet moment.,
Ask about his childhood.,
Talk about work or school.,
Ask about his favorite books, movies, and music.,
Be a good listener.,
Talk about yourself, too.,
Respect silence.",How to Get to Know Your Boyfriend Better1," In order to truly focus on getting to know your boyfriend better, pick the right setting to have a deep conversation. Avoid a noisy bar or restaurant or talking at a time when one of you will be busy. Instead, choose to have a nice talk while on a walk through the park, during a picnic, or while sitting out on the porch looking at the stars.;
, To get to know your boyfriend fully, first find out how his earliest years were. Ask him where he grew up, about his siblings, his relationships with his parents, and his friends when he was a kid. Ask him his favorite memory and his worst memory from his childhood. This will help you get a general feel for the major events that occurred while he was growing up., Ask your beau questions about the schools he’s been to, his experiences there, and his current job. Find out if he enjoys his job or if he wants to change careers or go back to school.Ask him what his ideal job or college would look like.
You might say something like “So, tell me about your job now. What do you like best about it? And what do you wish you could change?”

, You can also really get to know a person by finding out what kind of entertainment they enjoy. You might even find out that you have more in common than you thought. Find out what books he enjoyed most or could read over and over. See if any films have made him cry. Find out what concerts he’s been to or ones he’d like to go to.You can try saying “When I was a kid, I remember reading To Kill a Mockingbird and it really changed my life. Do you have any books that affected you like that?”

, During this process, be sure that you are fully engaged in the conversation. You cannot get to know someone if you are not paying attention to them. Put your phone down and truly listen. Laugh with him, cry with him, kiss him, and nod to show that you are paying attention.Respect his privacy if he doesn’t want to talk about certain topics.

, In getting to know him, be sure that he is getting to know you, too. As he finishes sharing stories or information about himself, share some things about you, as well. This will help the two of you grow closer.For instance, in talking about his childhood, you can also talk about your own. If he recalls a time he got in a fight with his sister, you can say “Yea, I used to fight with my brother all the time, too! Mom and Dad were always grounding us for our arguments.”

, You can get to know someone even when you are not speaking. Notice how often you are silent with your boyfriend and if that silence is comfortable. This is a sign of true closeness. Allow for moments of silence when you don’t have anything to say and simply enjoy the peace in the room.

Never run your mouth.,
Be calm because if you talk a lot, people will not trust you because they see you have trouble controlling what you say.

,
Let them know you can talk to them, be comforting and they will feel safer.

,
Try to keep your thoughts hidden, and give good advice.,
Remember that how you would feel in their position isn't necessarily how they feel in the same situation.,
Be supportive if they are upset, and be honest with them to a certain degree.",How to Give That Trustful Vibe," Try your hardest not to let secrets slip, to anyone, not even your best friends. Sometimes, that ""anything"" someone confided to you is just that important to them.;
,,, Good listening is also important. Remember, the best listener rarely talks about themselves.

, Everyone is different.

, You don't need to tell them if you think they are being completely ridiculous, but it might help them to know that they could be blowing the situation a bit out of proportion. Just be nice.

Try an adventurous activity.,
Try a new type of food.,
Start a new hobby together.,
Play a game together.,
Notice how he treats others.",How to Get to Know Your Boyfriend Better2," Getting to know your man should go beyond just the conversations that you have with him. Get to know with him by seeing how he responds to stress, fear, or excitement. Visit a local theme park together, go horseback riding, or try something like indoor skydiving Notice how he reacts to these types of situations..For instance, perhaps when he gets on a rollercoaster, he gets very anxious and then afterwards is frustrated with you. This could indicate that he is not a person who handles fear well.
He might also react to an adventure positively and the two of you may have a lot of fun.

, Expand both of your culinary palettes by trying a food you’ve both never had. Whether you head to the new restaurant downtown or you cook a meal together, this will show you how your boyfriend responds to newness.


He might not like the food very much, and yet not complain, which is a good sign. Or perhaps he goes on and on about hating the food all night, which could be a downer for you.

, Try something new together like dancing, horseback riding or painting. Notice how he reacts to learning something new. Some people will give up if they can’t get the hang of it soon and others will keep at it until they master it. Notice how your boyfriend responds in situations where he is a rookie., Some people are sore losers and others take losing or winning like a champ. Play some video games or board games with your boyfriend and see how he reacts to the outcome. He might have a competitive spirit that matches yours or perhaps he sulks or is cocky when he wins. Either way, this will help you assess his character.


You can also do something that is a team effort like a puzzle, escape room or even a DIY project. See if he leads, follows, doesn’t help at all, or takes over completely.

, In getting to know your boyfriend better, pay close attention to how he treats and talks about others. For instance, does he gossip or speak badly about friends? If so, he might speak badly about you, as well. Is he kind to waiters when you are out to eat or is he rude to them? An ideal partner is one who treats all people well, not just those who he views as having a similar social status.

"
"
Pay attention to his family interactions.,
Get your family’s opinion.,
Plan an outing with your friends.,
Meet his friends.",How to Get to Know Your Boyfriend Better3," If you have met his family, think back on how their interactions were. If you have not met them, perhaps he has spoken to them on the phone while you were around. If he is kind and loving with them, then you likely have a good man on your hands. However, if he is harsh, be careful.Before you judge, however, know at least some of his history with his family. For instance, if they have been abusive or neglectful in the past, this could explain why he is cold to them.

, If you are serious about this boyfriend, plan some time for him to meet your family. Bring him over for Sunday dinner or invite him to go to a family event with you. Notice how he interacts with your family, if he is friendly or more reserved or if he is rude. Ask your family what they thought of him later.

, In addition to learning more about your boyfriend, allow your friends to do so, as well. They will often pick up on things that you might not notice. Go out to dinner with him and some of your friends or out bowling. Ask them what they thought of him soon after.


For instance, your boyfriend might have done something nice for your friend while you were in the restroom that they will want to tell you about.

, It is said that you are the compilation of the five people you spend the most time around, and it is likely that your boyfriend spends a lot of time with his friends. Get to know those closest to him and get a feel for their character and personality. Though many friends are different from one another, they will likely have many similarities.As a bonus, they will also likely tell you some embarrassing stories about your boyfriend!

Be a good listener.,
Don't try to change people.,
Keep your sense of humor.,
State outright that you want to get along.,
Radiate positivity.,
Give genuine compliments.,
Do things for others.",How to Get Along with Others Well1," To start a conversation, it is important to listen first, especially when you are in a group. Don’t indulge yourself in instant chat when you have just arrived. First, examine the situation and the conversation, then say whatever you deem fit. It is better to say something substantial, rather than meaningless banter. So it is better to listen to what the conversation is about before speaking.;
, It is not your job to change anyone else. It is not in your power to change anyone else. Let other people live how they want to live. You can only change how you interact with people. You cannot change them. If you do not like how someone acts, you can arrange things so that you interact with them as little as possible. You can always maintain a good attitude around them so that your relationship with them might change.

, A little laughter goes a long way, and a smile eases tensions, whereas a frown can create tension. If someone teases you, try to laugh it off. If someone is frowning, smile at them. Be mindful of your countenance (facial expression). If you are persistently cheerful and optimistic, people will cheer up when they see you coming.

, Some people do not take hints. Some people do not read body language. For these people, it really works to just say with a cheerful face and voice, ""I really want us to work well together. I'll help you and back you up, and you help me and back me up.""

, Always remember that how you project your feelings affects the people within your proximity. It almost has a ripple effect on the people around you. Therefore, it would be advisable to remain thoughtful of how you conduct yourself and deal with others around you. In other words, do not allow yourself to take out your negative emotions on others around you.

, People love compliments, especially when they are genuine. Don't be so proud as to never congratulate someone on their work or ideas. A good compliment is sincere and succinct. No one like a brown-noser or a suck-up, but no one likes people who seem better than everyone else either.


One good compliment per conversation is a good benchmark to shoot for.

, Being kind is its own reward. It could be as simple as bringing in doughnuts for people or offering to help someone who is struggling to carry something. This will show you care about other people and this will make people want to be around you.

Find a quiet time when both of you can talk together freely.,
Ask politely and humbly.,
Point out how much you love and care about your partner.,
Avoid any abusive, blaming or personality-attacking comments.,
Listen attentively.,
Help your partner to view early counselling as a useful bridge for problem solving.,
Help your partner to see that counselling is not about telling him or her what to do or how to think.,
Be aware that older partners may be of a more old-fashioned mindset that counselling is a sign of weakness or a reason to be embarrassed.,
Seek out a counselling style that interests your partner.,
Make a deal.,
Give an out clause.,
Go anyway.",How to Get Your Partner to Agree to Relationship Counselling," Do not raise your wish to go to couple's counselling when in public or within the earshot of anyone else. This is a very personal and private matter, just between both of you. If anyone else is about, your partner may feel pressured and unable to explain his or her concerns, preferences and wants properly.;
, Do not simply assume that counselling is a necessity and that everything will fall apart without it. You cannot force your partner to do anything and having a mind set on counselling can make things harder should your partner refuse you. Instead, have ready a list of reasons for why the counselling will benefit the two of you, as well as explaining what you hope the counselling will provide at the end for both of you as a couple.


Always begin with explaining why you think your relationship is important. Point out the good aspects of your coupledom and the good you see in your partner.
Focus on the positives when explaining the good things that can be brought to the forefront of your marriage or partnership. Things such as a fun, deeper understanding, greater sharing, happier times together, etc.

, This is the main reason for making a good go of things, to use counselling to get both of you back to that loving place.


For example: ""I love you and I want that love to be a big part of our relationship again. I would like to try counselling because I love you. I want to learn the skills that will let us both communicate well together.""

, When asking your partner, keep everything on an even keel, factual and compassionate. Use your empathy to try to imagine how your partner feels about being asked to tag along and try to word your request in line with allaying possible fears, rebuttals and anger, depending on what you know about your partner.

, Do not talk over, interrupt or argue with your partner. Remember that you have had more time to digest this as a possible option and are already won over by it. Your partner may simply need time to think it through, or may have firm ideas about counselling that need to be worked on together before an affirmative answer can be reached.

, Even if your relationship ""problems"" are considered to be minor, both of you can learn new ways to problem solve that you may not have thought of before or learned skilfully. Some things you might want to tell a partner who isn't convinced that counselling is appropriate for small problems include:


Dealing with small problems early with counselling can avert bigger problems snowballing from the smaller ones.
Going before it's ""end of the tether"" gives both of you plenty of breathing space and time to resolve problems amicably.

, Rather, explain how counselling can give both of you the tools to make better decisions together and to connect at the same level even where you both don't see eye to eye about major issues. It can help to point out that couples who go through counselling tend to emerge happier for it and find their lives together more complete., Your partner may object on the grounds of being ""too old for new tricks"". Explain that age is no pre-condition for counselling and that it's ideal for partners of any age. You'll need to convince your partner that it's perfectly normal to get counselling and that it is indeed a very healthy way of resolving problems and learning new relating skills.


It can really help some people to understand that they'll become more skillful as a result of counselling, not just seeing it as a ""listening and feedback"" device.

, In order to encourage your partner to come along, try to match the counselling style to things that you think would entice your partner to get involved. For example, art therapy might be one way to encourage a partner who is very creative to get involved in more creative problem-solving techniques.


Do some research before having a discussion with your partner about the counselling options. Present a range of possible therapies that might be of interest. Most importantly, give your partner time to go away and digest these options and come back with one that he or she prefers. In this way, you can help your partner to feel invested in the process of choosing and therefore more committed to seeing it work out.

, Compromise on something that your partner wants you to do, in return for the counselling. Is there something that your partner keeps insisting that you do, that you would not mind using as leverage for making such a compromise? This might be agreeing to giving a little more space, letting your partner go on a vacation alone, agreeing to your partner changing jobs, getting help for an addiction or disorder that you may have, etc. in return for your partner attending counselling sessions with you. If your partner is able to see that you've given up something that you've earlier resisted, this can demonstrate that you are extremely serious about mending the relationship and that counselling is a vital part of this.

, Suggest that your partner attend at least one session of counselling, after which he or she is free to opt out with good reason. (Ask that the reason be explained clearly to you though, so that you can see what went wrong.) Giving your partner the chance to try before he or she buys into it, can alleviate a lot of the stress in making a decision to come along.

, If, despite everything above, your partner still refuses to go to counselling, you should still go. It will help you to see things from a healthier perspective and you will learn the coping and communicating skills that you're so dearly seeking. Take these skills home and practice them on your partner. The proof of the benefits will take on a real life of their own, right in front of his or her eyes. Eventually, the results may just do enough of the convincing for you.

Know that good manners and polite demeanor can help you get along with anyone.,
Make eye contact and smile when talking to someone.,
Always smile; that way people won’t think you are serious and hard to get along with.

,
Be polite and humble.,
Treat others how you wish to be treated.,
Never say anything about someone you wouldn't say to him in person.,
Speak in a clear, confident manner.,
Understand that people make mistakes.",How to Get Along with Others Well2," Think of your manners as the coat of paint on your personality-- if you keep it clean and pleasant, it leaves a wonderful first impression when you meet someone.

, This tells them that you are interested in what they have to say and want to be comfortable around them. When meeting someone for the first time, make good eye contact and shake their hand firmly as you introduce yourself.

,, If you are rude and arrogant, people will not like you.

, The golden rule is still the most important rule for getting along with others. Think of how you would like your friends to act around you. If you treat people with love and respect, they will treat you with the same.

, Gossip has a way of traveling around, and hearing that someone has been speaking ill of you behind your back is a sure-fire way to ruin a friendship. If you wouldn't say it to them in person, it is best not to say it at all.

, Be confident. Don't let it show that you're trying to be liked. Talk loud and clear, speaking slowly enough to get your words out without mumbling. You don't need to yell, interject, or rush words out -- take your time and make each word count.

, Forgiveness is not only polite, it leads to stronger friendships. No one is perfect, so judging someone for a fault is not fair when you expect them to forgive your mistakes too. Be willing to accept an apology and try and think of things through someone else's perspective -- were they really trying to be hurtful, or did they make an honest mistake?


Having the humility to give and accept forgiveness is a great way to show people that you are a reasonable, kind person.

Discuss and negotiate with others when your opinions differ.,
If people have troubles, help them.,
Avoid making quarrels personal.,
Look for common ground.,
Agree with them when appropriate.",How to Get Along with Others Well3," You do not have to completely avoid issues you disagree on. You do need to refrain from yelling, judging, or blocking out people you disagree with. There are very few people who will agree with you on everything, so it important to learn how to have a civil, polite argument or debate.

, Then, when you have troubles, they might help you, too.

, While you can have a nice discussion, about political differences, for example, saying that their view makes them ""a bad person"" is a perfect way to ruin a relationship.


Remember that almost everyone disagrees on something -- this doesn't mean you can't get along.

, While you might have different ideas on who should be president, try and bond over a common topic or hobby. Find discussion topics and activities that you can both enjoy instead of focusing on the things that divide you.

, Even on contentious topics like religion or politics, there are likely to be a few things that you both can agree on. Don't be afraid to agree with someone when they make a good point -- this will make it easier to keep the conversation civil.

Consider how you're prioritizing the relationship.,
Accept what you can't change.,
Make yourself feel attractive.",How to Get the Spark Back in Your Relationship1," When a relationship has been going on for a while, sometimes you begin to take your partner for granted. Examine how you prioritize the relationship. Are you paying enough attention to your partner?


Do you set aside regular alone time with your partner? Career, job, and children often lessen the time you have for a relationship. If you've become busy recently, have you remembered to spend time with your partner one-on-one?How often do you communicate with your partner? Oftentimes, we forgot to ask someone about their day or how they're feeling when we're very busy. Make sure you're making an effort to reach out to your partner on a regular basis.;
, The fact is, people have bad habits. When you're with someone for a long time, a mild flaw can start to grate on you. Try to work on accepting those things about your partner that you can't change.


Many believe they can't be happy in a relationship until they work on improving or perfecting their partner's bad qualities. However, this is not the case and can actually be damaging to a relationship longterm. Do you constantly remind your partner to, say, take out the recycling to no avail? If repeatedly talking and nagging does nothing to correct a minor bad behavior, you might have to learn to accept it.Keep perspective. Some days, your partner's constant lateness or sloppiness can seem unbearable, but try to remind yourself this is a mild matter in the grand scheme of things. When you're frustrated, think to yourself, ""Yes, my boyfriend/girlfriend is always running behind schedule, but he/she also always remembers to ask me about my dad, listens to my problems when I'm upset, and laughs at my jokes. That's what's really important."", Insecurity on your own part can lessen the spark of a relationship. If you're feeling bad about yourself physically, you may be pulling away from your partner without realizing it. Try to work on feeling attractive.


Changing your style can help you feel attractive. Consider a new wardrobe, hairstyle, or make up. Going shopping and talking to a department store stylist can help.Exercise and eat right. Even if you do not want to lose weight, people tend to feel more attractive when they feel healthy."

Communicate with your partner about wants and needs.,
Make small gestures of appreciation.,
Flirt.,
Have fun together.,
Explore new sexual activities.",How to Get the Spark Back in Your Relationship2," If you feel you're in a relationship rut, chances are your partner feels the same. Sit down and have a talk with your partner about what you want and need from the relationship.


Schedule a specific time for the talk and go in prepared to listen. If you want the spark in your romance back, you have to be willing to change. Rarely is a relationship rut completely one-sided. Remain calm and listen carefully to your partner's needs and wants.Talk about the times where you feel your partner loves and cares about you. Do you feel loved when your partner brings you flowers? Asks about your day? Holds your hand during movies? Let your partner know.Talk about anything you would want to do more often. Would you like to spend more nights of the week together? Go out on more dates? Try new things together?Are there any things you used to do together that you no longer do? Early in a relationship, you may feel compelled to engage in grand romantic gestures. Sending emotional texts, bringing your partner flowers, and staying up late talking are activities that we sometimes do less of the longer we've been with someone. If you're missing these types of gestures, talk to your partner about trying to engage in them more often., Small gestures can go a long way. If you feel the spark in your relationship is lessening, consider doing some of the following:


Surprise outings, like dinner dates, concert trips, and going to museums
Tell your partner one thing you like about him or her every day. For example, ""I love how you yawn in the morning"" or ""I love how the coffee's always ready because you remember to set up the pot before bed.""If your partner is busy at work, do something to make things easier when they get home. Do the dishes or laundry. Take out the trash. Cook them dinner., Flirting is a fun way to feel sexy. Oftentimes, we flirt at the beginning of a relationship to convey interest. Once mutual interest is established, flirting tends to taper off. Try to occasionally flirt with your partner via body language and verbal communication. Flirting can revitalize a relationship and increase feelings of attractiveness in both parties., Oftentimes, we forget that fun is a vital component to a romantic relationship. Try to make time for fun, romantic activities together.


Plan date nights. Oftentimes, the longer you're with someone the less you date. Try to find fun new things to do together on dates. Take a pottery class. Go dancing. Take a day hike. Visit a neighboring town.You can also reach out to others. Make plans with other couple friends. Join a club together where you can meet new people. Exploring a social life together is a great way to have fun in a relationship.Have fun at home as well. Break out board games for nights in. Find a funny television show to watch. Do Mad Libs., Your sex life is an important factor in your romantic relationship. If things are beginning to feel stale, find ways to reignite your sexual passion. You can try some of the following:Exploring new sexual positions.
Watching pornography together.
Role playing.
Talking about sexual fantasies.
Using sex toys.

Plan nostalgic dates.",How to Get the Spark Back in Your Relationship3," You can bring the spark back to your romance by going back to the beginning. In order to appreciate your partner, remember the very beginning of your relationship. This is usually when passion is at its highest.


Talk about how you met. Your personal love story can stir feelings of sentimentality and romance. Discuss how you first met, your initial impressions of one another, and share memories of your first date.The conversation can be fairly easy to start. Simply say, ""Remember the first night we met?"" and go from there. Talk about what first attracted you to your partner, what your fondest memory of your early romance was, and what made you think the relationship was special., You can also revisit past happy times in your life. Together, the two of you can relive good times to get the passion back.


Listen to music that reminds you of the early stages of the romance.

, You could also simply watch others to see how they react to this person.

, Maybe you overheard a conversation they had about a certain interest. Maybe you could just ask a quick question (if you were, say, at work) and see how they react to it. Or lastly, just simply introduce yourself. ""Oh, hey, I haven't met you yet, I'm Danny"", And see what happens.

, No matter how annoying you think they are, a smile could mean a lot of things. If they are nice, do the same. Everyone likes strangers to think they like them in some way.

, When they are around, be outgoing and show them how you are, what you like, without them knowing you are showing them. Similar to what you did to them earlier, but vice versa.

, Repeat all steps (especially the watching and learning) until this person starts approaching you. They will. It just takes time. Then start talking about the things that you have learned you will both be interested in.

Respect each other's property.,
Decide whether to share food or cook separately.,
Clean up after yourself.,
Take your turn to tidy, sweep, and mop the common areas.,Make sure you do your fair share of household chores, such as taking out the trash and recycling, cleaning the washroom, and emptying the fridge of rotting food.",How to Get Along With Roommates in Your Apartment," This may sound basic, but there are certain liberties people can take with their own family that they can’t with others. While your mother had an open pantry and your siblings didn’t mind sharing their clothes, this may not fly in an apartment arrangement. Some people are guarded of their possessions, and rightly so. Establish the boundaries early – is it acceptable to borrow clothes, browse through each other’s music collection, use somebody else’s personal computer, etc.;
, Communal meals or dinner for one? There are advantages to both strategies.


Sharing food can help you save money because you split the price of dietary staples. However, if you aren’t a large eater you may find yourself spending above your weight. Also, settling on a diet that everyone agrees upon can be difficult.
Cooking for yourself can be more convenient because you only have to please yourself. If your roommates have boyfriends or girlfriends who often hang around the apartment, buying your own groceries won’t make you worry that you’re supporting the food plan of a ‘significant other’. Also, you can eat on your own time schedule and purchase whatever food you want regardless of others’ budgets. That’s not to say you can’t share certain foods though. Often apartment roommates share food staples such as milk, sugar and bread. If you run out of something, it’s nice to have an understanding with your roommates that you’re allowed to borrow something of theirs until you replenish your stock. If you all cook separately, and at different times, you might consider arranging a weekly sit-down meal together. Dining together is one of the easiest and most satisfying ways to bring people closer.

, If you make a mess don't leave it for someone else to look after.

, If you share a place, you all have equal responsibility to keep it clean.

Have slow, full, meaningful hugs, or more like holding. It's nice when the girl cuddles up into a guys chest, with their face laying against it, and when a guy holds his girl from behind or around the waist. You should be comfortable enough to touch any part of you partner's body, but in a respectful, ""I love you and your body"" way. Cuddle or sleep with each other, not in a sexual way. Do sexual stuff later to make feelings between you two stronger.;

Forgive and love yourself.",How to Forgive Someone Who Has Hurt You," If you resent the person for the harm he or she has caused, then you'll never be able to move on, both in your own life and in continuing your relationship. Accept that what has been done is done, by saying things like, “I am angry because __ broke my trust and I accept that this has happened” and “I accept what has happened and how it made me feel”.Accept what the person has done to you and recognize that you have no control over it. However, you can control how you react to the situation.
Recognize your own flaws and possible ways you have hurt people to help you accept the wrongdoing and release your resentment. Everyone makes mistakes, and recognizing your own mistakes will help you understand the mistakes the person who hurt you.It won't happen overnight, but the sooner you aim to let go of your resentment, the sooner it will become a priority. Focus moving forward instead of stewing.;
, As you move on your path toward forgiveness, take a step back and think about how serious the pain that has been caused really is. Is the act truly forgivable, or is it something you won't even think about in a month? Think, “will it matter in the morning?”. Only you can decide.Include your personal morals and beliefs in your analysis of the big picture. If you are strongly against cheating, and your partner has cheated on you, then your moral compass may not allow you to forgive them. However, if you personally believe you work through infidelity, then you can move towards forgiveness. , Do you enjoy spending time with the person because they are funny or you have intelligent conversations together? Do you make a good team raising your children? Are you sexually satisfied? Make a list of all the great things about your platonic or romantic relationship with the person who has hurt you. Assess whether the good outweighs the the thing(s) they did to hurt you.Start by noting smaller positive attributes, such as, “they take the trash out” or “they send me helpful links at work”, then move into bigger positive attributes such as personality or good deeds they do., If you're feeling really hurt and upset about what happened, talking to someone else about it can help you gain some valuable perspective. Instead of mulling it over on your own or isolating yourself, talk to another person to help you gain some insight and to feel like you're less alone. You might also get some valuable advice that can help you have a better understanding of the situation, and a stronger sense of how to proceed.You might not want to talk with too many people and risk getting an overwhelming amount of opinions. Select a few trusted friends or family members whose opinions you highly value.

, Another important aspect of forgiving someone is being able to take some time to just be alone with your thoughts. If someone has really wronged you, whether your boyfriend has cheated on you or your best friend has been saying hurtful things behind your back, it's important to take some time to get space and spend some time on your own. Additionally, overtime, you might gain perspective on the situation. For example, in the moment, certain words said by your partner or friend may have seemed especially hurtful. Yet, over time and thinking them over, you might understand why they said the hurtful thing.If you live with that person who has hurt you, you may need to find another place to stay for a while, if possible. If you don't live together, then make it clear that you need some time away from each other and that you'll reach out when you're ready.

, Prepare how you want to start the conversation and what you want to say before you initiate the conversation. Though you may be feeling bitter, anger, hurt, or confused, you should find a way to delicately state these emotions instead of exploding or saying something you don't really mean. Take deep breaths before and after each comment, and try to be as reasonable as possible.Before you open your mouth to say anything, ask yourself how it will sound or come across to the other person. Your words could be hurtful towards them, and then you are in the position of forgiving and having to be forgiven.
Try writing down exactly what you want to say, and even practice in front of a mirror, to get it exactly how you want.

, As part of your conversation, tell the other person how his or her actions made you feel. Be as honest as possible, expressing the pain you have been going through. Be open about your feelings to show that the person has really hurt you and that you have had a hard time dealing with it. Make eye contact and speak slowly, showing that you really mean what you say.


Use “I statements” such as “I felt hurt when you cheated on me because I've been loyal and devoted, and I thought you felt the same way."" Or, “I felt upset when you were gossiping about me because I don’t think I have done anything to deserve it.”Use the general formula of, “I felt__ when __ because __”. Focus on expressing your feelings instead of the negative things they did., There are always two sides to a coin. Hear the other person out and listen to what they have to say. Let the person talk without interrupting them, and try to see the situation from his or her side of the story.To be a good listener, make eye contact, put away distractions such as your phone, and be open minded. Also, try to provide appropriate feedback by asking clarifying question or paraphrasing what they said.For example, after they say something, clarify and paraphrase the statement by saying, “so what you said was…”
Do not be combative or defensive. Take deep breaths or step away from the situation if you get angry from something they say.

, Compassion may be the last thing you want to show when you feel like you've been truly hurt. However, if you put yourself in the other person's shoes and think about how he or she may be feeling, then you may find it in your heart not to be so angry or upset with the other person. Ask question and set aside your prejudices. Really listen and open up to the person.Empathy and forgiveness are tightly linked and it will be nearly impossible to forgive someone without feeling empathy for them. , Assess whether or not you need some physical time away from the person who hurt you. If you do, then there's no shame in saying you need a few weeks, a few months, or just that you want to be apart until you're ready for more time together. Make this clear to the person so he or she doesn't keep trying to return back to your normal relationship when you don't feel ready.Be honest. Say something like, ""I'm just not quite ready to start hanging out again. I hope you can respect that.""

, Once you're ready to move forward with the person, slowly ease back into the relationship. Things might not go back to normal right away. Hang out only once or twice a week instead of every day or hang out in groups before you do some of the more intimate, personal things you used to do together.


If it's a romantic relationship, treat it like going on a first date. You don't have to hug, cuddle, or hold hands like you did before if you're just not ready.
In addition to taking small steps in getting your relationship back on track, learning to fully forgive will take small steps and practice. So mending your relationship slowly will help you become better at forgiveness., Avoid dwelling on the past as you move forward with your relationship. Continuing to think about the past will limit your trust of the person, leading to a stifled relationship. You do not necessarily need to “forgive and forget”; instead forgive and learn from the experience. If your partner cheated on you and you have chosen to forgive them, understand that you can now recognize the signs of possible cheating, or you can think about what may have caused the infidelity in the first place and not let that happen again. Let each event be a learning opportunity to make your relationship stronger.When you catch yourself dwelling on the past, focus on the present moment instead. Be mindful by taking a deep breath and focusing on exactly what is in front of you; the smell in the room, the conversation with your friend, etc…, Get real with yourself. Admit to yourself if you can't really forgive the person. Unfortunately, there may be a situation where you think you are ready to forgive someone and then realize that you're just not able to do it once you start spending time together again. If you hang out with the person and find yourself thinking about how much he or she hurt you again and again, then you may have to end the relationship.Continuing with a platonic or romantic relationship after you have realized you are unable to forgive them is bad for both of you. You might become bitter or resent them which is unhealthy. Once you have realized that forgiveness might not be in the cards, cut the relationship off as soon as possible.

, A crucial part of forgiveness and moving forward after you forgive is to love and forgive yourself. You are probably much harder on yourself then you are with others. You may feel unlovable or like you have been too hard on the person who hurt you.Realize that you have done the best you could at the time and accept the events that occurred. Try to cut yourself some slack and learn to self-love by thinking kind thoughts about yourself and read self-help books."
"
Give her time alone.,
Focus on your own happiness during your time apart.,
Reflect on why the relationship ended.,
Let her see how far you've come.,
Have a casual meeting.,
Meet up again.,
Apologize.,
Have an open and honest conversation about your feelings for her.,
Act like it's your first date again.,
If the date goes well, keep working on your relationship.",How to Get a Girl Back," This is the hardest part. You'll reconnect with her soon enough, but for now you need to spend time apart. Regardless of how the relationship ended, you both probably said things you didn't mean. The wound is fresh, and it needs time to heal. Cut off communication and give her time to reflect on the breakup. Hopefully you'll both move past whatever ended the relationship and remember all the good times you had together. After enough time, she'll start to miss you.


The amount of time you need to spend apart depends on the relationship and the nature of the breakup. If your relationship was serious and your breakup was nasty, she'll need more time. If you just started dating and it was a silly fight, she won't need much time at all.
Don't text her or message her. If she reaches out to you, don't ignore her, but play it safe. This is not the time for big romantic gestures.
Avoid places you know she frequents. Steer clear of her favorite coffee shop and the gym she goes to.
If you happen to see her in person, be polite. Say hello or wave, but that's it.
If you have to see her regularly, like for class, acknowledge but don't engage her. Talk to your friends instead. Let her see you having a good time.;
, This is perfect opportunity to pick up the pieces and get your life back on track. You need to show her that you're capable of being independent and strong. Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, work on self-improvement.


Remember the activities that made you happy before your girlfriend. Focus on pursuing those interests. Did you used to like to go to play piano or go hiking? Zone in on those interests again. They'll help revitalize your life.
Find a new hobby. Try yoga. Learn to surf. Go to the opera. Try something new that you've never had time for. This will let you grow as a person. Even if your ex never finds out, it'll distract you and build your self-confidence.
Work out. Not only will this get you in shape and make you more attractive, you'll feel better about yourself. Exercise is scientifically proven to fight depression.Get a work out routine and stick to it. When she sees you again, she'll be impressed with your new and improved body and mood.
Have an active social life. You need your friends now more than ever. Family and friends are there to support you. Don't harp on your breakup, though. Go out and have fun with them! Go to a bar, go dancing, or organize a road trip.
Try a new style. Buy new clothes and within reason, reinvent your look and your general lifestyle. Be careful not to lose what made her like you in the first place.

, This is easier said than done. Take time and really think about the underlying causes that led to your breakup. Was it a lack of communication? Did you take her for granted? Are you stressed or depressed, and you took it out on her? Whatever happened, diagnose the problem. Then you can start to look for a solution.


Be honest with yourself. This can be hard. Nobody wants to admit blame. Swallow your pride and find what the true problem was.
After that, think of solutions. Don't dwell in the past. Regrets don't help anyone. Instead, think of how you can avoid those problems in the future.
Writing can help. Jot down what went wrong in the relationship. For every problem list one or two things you can do to improve yourself and make sure those problems don't come up again.

, Once you've spent enough time apart, briefly reconnect. Send her a breezy text, or ""accidentally"" run into her. Be friendly and outgoing to show her how happy you are. She won't want you back if you're acting clingy and desperate. Bring out your aloof and independent side. Have a brief, mature conversation — maybe apologize for how things ended — and move along.


Ideally, you'll be around friends for this interaction. Hang out with them in the park where she walks her dogs or where she likes to get frozen yogurt. You don't even have to talk to her necessarily. Just let her see you having a good time. Laugh and act like the life of the party.
If possible let her see you doing something new. It can be hard to pull this off, so let social media do the work for you. Post a picture of you at the beach with your new surfboard.
Make her feel a little jealous. Be friendly with another girl in front of her. Post pictures to social media with girls she doesn't know. This will improve your social status in her eyes and make her want you again. Be careful not to take this too far. It can easily backfire. And whatever you do, don't make a move on another girl.
Use the show, don't tell method to prove that you've changed. Show her that you can keep a steady job, that you're on top of your finances, and that you're in charge of your life. She'll be attracted to how responsible you are.

, Ask her out to coffee or lunch. Let her know it's not a date, it's a just a relaxed get-together. By this point, she'll really want to talk to you so she should agree. When you see her, be fun and friendly. Show her how easygoing and carefree you can be.


Avoid asking her with a serious text like ""we have to talk."" At this point, you want to be as breezy as possible.
Compliment her. Tell her you like her earrings or her scarf, or just that she looks nice. Don't go overboard though. One or two compliments is plenty.
Have some light flirtation. Remember that it's only supposed to be a platonic meeting, but add some levity to the situation. Maybe bring up an old inside joke.
Laugh and have a good time. Remind her how happy you can be together.
If she broaches the breakup, try to change the topic. If she presses the issue, maybe it's already time to talk. Take a deep breath and tell her what you've learned in your time apart. Part 3 has more tips on how to handle that conversation.
At the end, leave things open-ended. A hug will probably be appropriate. Tell her it was nice seeing her and you had a great time and leave it at that.

, The key here is to keep the ball rolling. Now that you have momentum, have another casual meet up. Don't be in a rush though. Wait at least a week before meeting up again. Keep your strategy of being easygoing throughout the process. This time, maybe do something more active. You can get ice cream and go for a walk or get drinks at a low-key bar. Assure her it's not a date. You just want to see her.


Try to meet up three to five times before moving forward. She needs time to remember what attracted her to you in the first place. Show her your best side without any strings attached, and before long she'll start to want you back.

, When you're meeting with her, make it clear that you're sorry. Whatever happened, you probably did or said something you regret. You had plenty of time apart to reflect on what went wrong. Share with her what you learned. Tell her you know you messed up and make it clear that you've changed and wouldn't make the same mistakes. Above all else, be specific. She doesn't want an empty or generic apology. She wants you to know exactly what you did wrong and what you're doing to fix it.


Be sincere. Look her in the eyes and tell that you're genuinely sorry for what happened.
Don't be too dramatic. You're still trying to be easygoing, but you can be casual and still genuinely apologize for the way things ended.
If you did something especially bad like cheating and you really hurt her, your apology should come before anything else. You have to let her know how deeply sorry you are before she would even consider getting back together. You're going to have to apologize multiple times and in multiple ways. If she doesn't accept your apology, be understanding. Give her space and apologize again after you've both had time to think it over.

, Make sure you pick the right time and place for this conversation. Ideally, it should be at night with no distractions — it's just the two of you. Seize the moment and tell her how much you miss her. Let her know that you've changed. Talk about what went wrong and what you'll do to make sure that doesn't happen again. Apologize again, and assume all the responsibility. Be humble and show her how mature you can be. At the end, don't beg her to take you back. Make it clear you want to get back together and see how she responds. If she's uncertain, don't try to convince her. She needs more time. If she feels the same way, ask her on a date!


Have a plan. Know when and where you want to take her on a date if she responds positively to your conversation.
Practice what you're going to say beforehand. At the very least, know what you want to say. This is one of the most important conversations you'll have, so you don't want to wing it.
Be calm and confident. Keep a steady voice and look her in the eyes. You need to reassure her that you want to get back together. You can't accomplish that if you're acting jittery and nervous. Take a deep breath and be honest.
Be specific. Let her know exactly what you would change this time around. Generic words and cliches won't help you here.
This can be a messy conversation. Try to stay on message and don't get sidetracked. Respond to her concerns in a respectful manner. She probably won't react positively right away. Persevere and be understanding to her feelings. It could be a long conversation, so be patient. Keep taking deep breaths to calm yourself and she'll see how confident and thoughtful you are.

, Be the perfect gentleman. Pick her up. Bring flowers. Compliment her. Flirt with her. Pay for the meal. Hang on her every word. Impress her with your confidence. Show her you at your best, and let her fall in love with you all over again. Even if the date doesn't go perfectly, the effort alone will show her how much you care.


Take cues from her about how to end the date. If she's not ready to go straight back into a relationship, be understanding. Drop her off and let her know you want to take her out again. If there's an opportunity for a kiss, go for it. And if she wants to sleep with you, it'll reignite your passion and intimacy almost immediately.
Take a deep breath and stay in control.
Make her laugh. The best way to have a good date is to be funny. If you have old inside jokes, this is the perfect time to cash in on them.
Be totally engaged in her. Don't check your phone or act absent-minded. Listen to her carefully and act like it's just the two of you.

, Just because you're back together doesn't mean your problems are over. If you want to stay together, you're going to have to do better this time. Take everything you learned from the breakup and your time apart and put it into practice. Be more appreciative of her this time. Be a more responsive and communicative boyfriend. Work on your problems as a couple, and you'll come out of the ordeal stronger than ever!


Keep working on yourself too. The happier and more responsible you are, the more she'll want to stay with you. Keep having an active social life and pursuing your hobbies.
Consider couples therapy. This can be immensely beneficial for the future of your relationship. The two of you only know so much. Get a professional involved.
Make sure it doesn't happen again. Be vigilant of the problem signs that led to your breakup, and stop them before they can hurt your relationship again. You're much smarter and more experienced this time, so you're perfectly equipped to make sure your relationship goes the distance this time.
Be happy and thankful that you have her back. Don't be paranoid about it ending. Live for the moment while being a caring partner and you won't have anything to worry about.

Such sites allow you to build a profile or post an ad seeking out a roommate to meet your needs.Craigslist is one of the biggest and most commonly used sites. As it's free, it's a great means to reach a wide audience.
Sites outside of Craigslist, such as roomates.com, often come with fees. However, they also allow you to create a more customized profile and search for roommates based on specific attributes.;
, As your friends know you well, let them know you're seeking a roommate. Let them know to pass on any leads to you. As your friends know your habits and lifestyle, they'll likely to be able to point you in the direction of a compatible match., A bad roommate can make life incredibly stressful. The sooner you start looking for a roommate, the better. Start seeking out a roommate a month or two in advance., Seemingly small details can make a big difference in attracting the right match. While writing your post, include as many details as possible about your lifestyle and habits. If you're seeking a roommate for an apartment you're currently living in, make sure to provide details about the apartment and neighborhood.Include the basics, such as the size of the apartment. Then, list any appliances the apartment has and the feel of the neighborhood.
Include details about any personal habits that may affect the living situation. For example, if you work night shifts, make sure you choose a roommate who's a sound sleeper and will not be bothered by you coming and going at odd hours.

, While you don't need to be best friends with your roommate, it's always a perk to find someone you get along with. Include a little about yourself and your interests. This will help you attract a likeminded roommate.For example, say something like, ""I love sports and always follow football season. I'm also into cooking and baking, so I'll be in the kitchen a lot.""

, Never agree to a living situation without meeting up in person first. You want to make sure there's good chemistry and the person doesn't seem unsafe or unfriendly. Meet up in a neutral location, like a coffee shop, and talk over your expectations for things like chores, bills, and so on.If you're showing your apartment, meet up at a neutral location first before bringing over the potential roommate. It's a good idea to have a friend or family member in the apartment with you for safety.

, Some roommates simply aren't compatible. Think about your personal living habits and ask about the other person's habits. Make sure the two of you have a similar lifestyle so you won't clash too much.Talk about your general lifestyle. Do you love loud music and having people over? If so, you may not hit it off with a quiet, introverted roommate.
Hobbies and leisurely activities can also sometimes be an issue. For example, if your new roommate watches a lot of television, this could drive up the cable bill.

, Chores are a common reason roommates fight, so make sure to ask your potential roomie whether they're a neat person. You should also confess to your own cleaning habits. If you occasionally let dishes sit in the sink overnight, for example, be upfront about this. If you're visiting an apartment to potentially move into, pay attention to whether it's clean. If you notice a lot of dust, grime, and dirty dishes, this may not be the ideal place to live.

, If you're having someone move in with you, ask them why they're looking for a new place. This can be a good way to identify red flags. If someone has a reasonable need to move, such as wanting to be closer to work, this is a good sign. However, people who cite things like roommate drama may be difficult to live with., Asks about a potential roommate's income and make sure it exceeds your rent and bills. You don't want to be left lending your roommate money each month for rent.In addition to a decent income, make sure they're work is steady. If your roommate is working a temp job, for example, they may not be able to make rent in a few months.

, It's completely appropriate to ask a roommate for references. Ask for the number of their old landlords and a few previous roommates. Call these people up to make sure your roommate was respectful and paid any bills in a timely fashion., If you haven't known someone for awhile, it's always good to double check that they're safe. Ask to run a basic credit check and criminal background check, which can easily be done online. You can also have a potential roommate get their credit checked and present you with the paperwork.If someone objects strongly to a background check, this may be a red flag.

, If you have a handful of good candidates, pick the roommate most similar to you. Choose someone who's lifestyle, cleaning habits, and personality closely mimic your own. Roommates with compatible personalities tend to get along the easiest., When signing up to live with someone, get everything in writing. In addition to financial responsibilities regarding rent and bills, have loose agreements about having friends over, parties, and chores. Having a roommate contract to refer to can prevent arguments down the road."

Recognize how you are feeling, and let yourself feel it.,
Take responsibility for your part.,
Strive for empathy.,
Know what forgiveness means.,
Avoid rumination.",How to Forgive Someone Without Using Religion1," When someone we care about lets us down, we often try to bottle up the resulting emotions. We feel shame or embarrassed that we made ourselves vulnerable. Perhaps, we feel angry at the other for betraying us.Name the emotion you are feeling and know that it's okay to feel it.


Research shows that experiencing negative emotions is just as healthy as positive emotions when it comes to understanding the complexities of life.To accept your emotions, breathe slowly and deeply - in through your nose and out through your mouth - as you think about how you feel. What would you call this emotion? How does it feel in your body? If you had to color it what would the landscape look like?
Another way to embrace negative emotions is to imagine them floating over your head like clouds. Just like the weather, this reminds us that negative emotional states also come and go. This bad feeling won't last forever.;
, This may be hard to do, but in order to move on you must be willing to accept some role in what you're feeling. Of course, you didn't ask the person to hurt you or betray you. You certainly didn't deserve it. However, you are responsible for how you react to your circumstances. And, when you accept that responsibility you can also accept the knowledge that you can learn and move on from this., All humans make mistakes because we are flawed beings. Developing empathy means walking in the other person's shoes and recognizing his emotional experience of the situation. Ask yourself these questions to strive for empathy:Have you ever made a mistake that hurt someone?
Why do you think this person hurt you? Was it intentional or accidental?
How might this person feel as a result of hurting you?
Would you want someone to extend forgiveness to you in a similar situation?

, People are often hesitant to offer forgiveness because they misunderstand who it benefits. While the other person may be pleased that you extended forgiveness, doing so is really for you. It involves a shift in thinking from bitterness to one of goodwill towards the other. Here are other common myths about forgiveness.Forgiveness means I must mend the relationship. While you may certainly choose to mend the relationship, forgiveness does not require that. It is simply removing the urge for revenge or ill-will from your heart against another.

Forgiveness means I must forget. No, forgiveness requires acknowledging what happened, pondering the consequences, and deciding how you want to move forward. We know we have forgiven when we can think about what happened and not feel resentment.

Forgiveness means I am excusing wrongdoing. When you forgive someone you are not showing that it's okay to hurt others. You are also not demonstrating that it does not hurt to be betrayed. Forgiveness does not equal minimizing or justifying.

, If you are truly going to move on, you must not continue to obsessively replay the betrayal over and over in your head. Thinking about what happened and what you could have done may only serve to intensify your negative emotions. Ruminating can even lead to depression.To overcome rumination, do the following:Taking action could decrease your need to ruminate. Grab a pen and paper and engage in problem-solving about the situation. How can you minimize your potential to be betrayed in this way in the future? What mistakes did you make? How can you correct those mistakes? Make a plan to execute these changes.
Reappraise your assessment of the event. Sometimes, we get hurt because we had overly high expectations of others, or we exaggerate their shortcomings. Was the situation really as bad as you have been viewing it?

Boost your self-esteem. When we are betrayed our confidence takes a dip. Reach out to a friend or loved one who knows you well and ask these people to help you identify your strengths and talents. Being betrayed doesn't steal away your worth as a human. Focus on the things you are good at.

Apologies that are not delayed tend to ease tension in the relationship and help with further conversation. Apologies for more significant events, like infidelity, are best when the person has had some time to fully process the event.


If you are a woman, keep in mind the tendency in our culture for women to apologize too frequently. This can make apologies seem less meaningful to the other person.;
, Before you apologize, take time to affirm yourself. This can help boost your ego, make your apology more sincere, and make the process of apologizing a little less uncomfortable.


Say things to yourself like “I am good enough,” “I am human,” “No one is perfect.”
Reflect on what you value, what gives you meaning in life, and what’s going well for you right now. This can help you feel better when you have to admit you’re wrong., While it may be uncomfortable and unpleasant to apologize to someone, it is essential for the health of your relationship to give the other person a good apology. Keep in mind the following elements of a good apology:Say you’re sorry, describe everything that happened without omission, and acknowledge how you have hurt the other person.
Listen to the other person’s feelings. Let them talk without trying to argue or reason with them. Be open to any questions they may ask you.
Avoid blaming them, getting defensive, or making excuses for your actions.
Express remorse. Apologies are empty if you do not mean what you say or if you blame the other person. Even though feelings of guilt and remorse are uncomfortable, expressing them shows that you care and that you are willing to work on your relationship., Whoever you wronged has the right to their own feelings. While you showed great courage and vulnerability in opening up to your mistake, the other person does not have to forgive you and may choose to walk away from the relationship., Talk to the other person about what you are willing to do to improve the situation. Give specific and realistic examples of what you will do to make it up to them. Most importantly, ask the other person what they need from you to rebuild trust and honor what they need.If you broke someone’s trust due to infidelity and you both agree you want to stay in your marriage, your partner may have many questions and requests. They may ask you to end the affair, and if you haven’t already this is something you should do first.
Your partner may also ask you about details of the affair, and in rebuilding trust it’s important to answer their questions honestly. Do not keep secrets.
Your partner might also ask you to check-in more frequently about where you go and who you spend time with, or pay closer attention to your phone calls and emails. Do not be defensive against these requests., Your natural inclination may be to avoid talking about the betrayal because of feelings of shame or embarrassment, but seeking help from a therapist or other professional will be healing.


If the broken trust occurred due to infidelity, commit to going to individual counseling, marriage counseling, couples counseling, or marriage education courses if your partner is willing. A licensed professional can help you address the underlying causes of the infidelity and other issues in your relationship. With counseling, you can establish healthier boundaries, expectations, and communication styles in a safe environment.It can take a year or more in counseling to work on broken trust in your relationship. Be patient and engaged in therapy, but keep in mind that it will be tough emotional work., Outside of counseling sessions, strive to connect by paying attention to how the other person is feeling, being open to talking about feelings, and trying to understand their perspective even if it’s different from yours.give you


If you are unsure of how to communicate with your loved one, some good keys to communication are using I-statements such as “I feel…” or “I need…,” listening and reflecting back what the other person is saying, and expressing gratitude and appreciation.After an infidelity, it is particularly important that you share both positive and negative feelings with each other, don’t try to “fix” how the other person is feeling, show affection, and recognize when you fall back into old patterns that are damaging to the relationship.Try setting aside an hour each week to check-in on how you both are feeling. Share what you both have been doing that has been helpful, as well as what you both still need from each other., Nobody is perfect and even the most normal, healthy relationships will experience moments of broken trust and misunderstanding. Most people, with time, patience, practice, and healthy communication skills, can work through their misunderstandings.If you’re a parent and your child or teenager has broken your trust, you have the challenge of teaching your child the importance of trust. They might not understand the limits you give them and become angry, so be clear about what things your child needs to do to keep the trust in your relationship. Keep your expectations low, be calm, and understand it may take time and practice for them to learn why trust is important., Forgiveness is about accepting what has happened and moving forward. It is not a denial of the betrayal or a justification of what the other person did. It does not guarantee that the other person won’t hurt you again, but it can bring you a sense of power and peace.You can choose not to forgive, but keep in mind that if you dwell on the broken trust, you might experience depression, anxiety, anger, and lack of connection with others.You can forgive someone without reconciling or staying in the relationship.

, You can start the process of forgiveness by reflecting on how the experience of broken trust has affected you and your relationship to the other person. You can also reflect on the positive times in your relationship. What do you miss about your relationship and how would you like to get back to that?

If you get stuck:Consider the other person’s perspective and what you would want if you were in their position.
Consider other times and experiences in life where your trust was broken or you broke someone’s trust. How were you able to forgive or were others able to forgive you?
Consider journaling, talking to a friend or loved one, or talking to a counselor to help guide you.

, Instead of replaying and reliving the hurt feelings in your head, try to shift your focus to looking for healthy relationships and experiences that bring you happiness, hope, and peace.If you get overwhelmed in feeling the hurt while you’re trying to forgive, try practicing these techniques to ease your stress level:


Deep breathing
Meditation
Mindfulness exercises

, Forgiveness is not complete without reflecting on what you’ve learned. Use this experience to set boundaries and expectations in future relationships. Above all, trust yourself. If you’re unable to move on and completely forgive just yet, it might be too difficult to be around the person who broke your trust."
"
Confront the person and express forgiveness.,
Write a letter.,
Consider how this painful situation helped you to grow.Even if we don't want to admit it, we grow through experience - both good and bad ones.",How to Forgive Someone Without Using Religion2," If you decide to reconcile with the person who hurt you, you will need to meet with him face-to-face at some point.


Reach out to the other person and decide on a convenient time to meet.
Share your feelings and how the other person hurt you. Use ""I"" statements, which are phrases that minimize blame and allow you to take ownership for your feelings. For example, you might say, ""I feel betrayed after you lied to me, but I am choosing to forgive you.""
Include suggested amends, if you like. Add this to the above statement: ""I would appreciate it if we both are open and honest with one another moving forward"".
Allow the other person a chance to talk and perhaps apologize.
Research shows that when amends and forgiveness follow a betrayal, and the perpetrator and the victim constructively problem-solve together, they both have a higher chance of seeing improvements in relationship quality., If the betrayal was so upsetting that you cannot imagine ever facing this person again, or if the person died or is no longer around for you to meet face-to-face, writing a letter can be a great way to express forgiveness and get closure.


Write down your deepest and truest thoughts and feelings regarding the betrayal. Avoid demonizing the other person; instead strive for empathy and think about their flawed actions in terms of being human. Explore what forgiving this person means to both of you in the letter., Spend some time reflecting on what you have learned from this experience and how you can apply that knowledge to similar life situations.

Renew your search regularly.",How to Find Someone You Met Once1," This is the most basic method of searching for someone online. Most people have some kind of online presence, whether through work, school, or social media. If you know the person’s first and last name, you can try searching on a search engine.Also type in any information you may have gathered during your conversation with this person. Did he or she mention what school they attend? Where they work? Organizations they're members of? Type these into the search engine along with the person's name to increase your chances of finding the person.;
, Social media is incredibly popular, and there is a good chance the person you're looking for has an account on one or more of the major social media sites. These accounts might show up during an internet search, but if you don't have any luck there, try searching on the social media sites themselves.Try the major social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

, Craigslist has a section under its ""Personals"" section called ""Missed Connections"" designed for people to find others. Here, you can place an ad looking for the person you met. Also, you can search and see if that person if looking for you.

, There are websites designed to help people find each other. These work like the personal ads on Craigslist: users post a message and visitors can view these messages. You can also search the websites and see if the person you're looking for is looking for you too.You should search and post messages on several different sites to increase your chances of success.
The most popular of these websites are isawyou.com and blewmychance.com.

, Due to the speed of online data compilation, your site posts will get buried relatively quickly, so you may want to occasionally make new ones. Additionally, people make new social networking connections all the time, so just because the person doesn't have any mutual friends to help narrow the search yet, it doesn't mean he or she never will. Try not to get discouraged and renew your search from time to time."

, If you have done something wrong, illegal, immoral or something that in any way hurts someone else, try to come clean and address the issue. With that, also be prepared to face any consequences.


By addressing the issue yourself instead of allowing yourself to get caught puts you one step ahead of the game as well as ahead of anyone who will speak negatively about you.
Being willing to face any consequences will help you earn respect back because it shows that you care about your reputation.
Amends may not be monetary or mandatory, but they will help bridge you back to your family, friends, loved ones and fans.

Don't put anything in writing that you don't want to come back and haunt you.
Be mindful about what you say, even to family and friends. If you are already in hot water, having a rumor started because something that you said got misconstrued will not help in the slightest.
If you are being bothered by the media, choose one media outlet and tell your side of the story. Stick with ""no comment"" for the rest of the media unless there is an interview that you cannot turn down.
Make sure that your actions are reflecting the reputation that you want to regain. If you are trying to prove that you are not a drunk, don't be seen at a bar.

If you have a dependency issue, make sure that you are hitting the appropriate group for your recovery, e.g. Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, etc.
When the time is right, quietly re-emerge and do something positive like volunteer work. Don't call attention to yourself, and try to do it under the radar. After time has passed, having someone leak it to the media won't hurt. But, you want to have enough experience under your belt to give the appearance that you are doing it for the right reasons and not to put on a show.
Consider public speaking to make an example of your mistakes and to teach others not to repeat them. A good example of this was T.I., who filmed the documentary style MTV show Road to Redemption.

Hopefully you learned your lesson from your public disgrace and will take this as an opportunity to turn over a new leaf. Don't simply act like you are doing good things, but actually try to be a kinder, gentler, more respectful person.
Walk the walk if you talk the talk. If you say that you are going to do all these good things, then make sure that you are taking action on your promises.

Try posting in local newspapers with a description of your meeting.",How to Find Someone You Met Once2," If you met in a particular restaurant, park, or coffee shop, or public transportation, there is a chance the person you're looking for visits there regularly. Make this location a part of your usual schedule, and you might have a chance of running into him or her again.


Try to visit the location around the same time you first met. If this is part of the person's normal routine, then he or she probably visits about the same time.

, If the person if a regular at this particular location, it's possible that the staff might know who they are. Ask around and see if anyone there knows the person you met. If one of them does, then ask if you can get the person's contact information. Some people might not be willing to hand out contact information, however, so in this case just ask if the worker could pass your contact information on to the person you're looking for.

If the person you want to find sees the ad, then he or she will have an easy way to contact you.Like with posting ads on the internet, try to post in as many newspapers as possible. You don't know which newspapers he or she reads regularly, so posting several ads will increase your chances.

Personalities are something to take into deep consideration; you may have one or two personalities you like but someone else may have a wide variety.

Prove that there was a common law marriage.",How to Enter a Common Law Marriage," The most basic requirement of a common law marriage is that you live together. To start your common law marriage, you should move into the same residence.There is no minimum time limit requirement. For example, you do not have to live together for seven years (a common misconception).
Utah, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, New Hampshire, and Washington, D.C., all require this.
Alabama, Kansas, and South Carolina do not require this.;
, This might sound basic, but in several states you must actually agree that you are creating a marriage.This requirement protects someone who only wanted to live together but didn’t want to create a marriage.


You should meet with your partner and discuss whether or not you are entering a common law marriage. Both people should agree that they are.
Simply agreeing to get married at a future date is insufficient.Instead, you must agree that “from this moment on we are married.”
Every common law marriage state requires this.

, Another basic requirement to establishing a common law marriage is to “hold yourself out” to others as a married couple.In particular, tell other people you are married.For example, the woman might take her husband’s name and start using it on correspondence and for business.
Another way to hold yourself out as a couple is to file a joint tax return or to apply for a credit card as a couple.Wearing wedding bands is another way of holding yourself out as married.Every state except South Carolina explicitly require this.

, One sign that you are married is to purchase things together as a couple. For example, you can buy a car or a home together and have both names on the deed.You should realize that if you do not put your name on the deed, then you may have no rights in the house.
For example, if you end the common law marriage without getting a legal divorce, then you will not have any rights in the property unless you are on the deed.

, In several states which recognize common law marriage, you must “consummate” the marriage in order for it to be legal.“Consummate” means to have sex.

, In Utah, you must petition the court and have them recognize your relationship as a marriage.In New Hampshire, a common law marriage will only be recognized when one of the people in the relationship passes away and the other is trying to get their share of the decedent's estate.

, Currently, eleven states recognize common law marriage. Eight states (and the District of Columbia) have a statute authorizing common law marriage, and three more states recognize common law marriages as a result of judicial decisions. The states are:Alabama;
Colorado;
Iowa;
Kansas;
Montana;
New Hampshire;
Oklahoma;
Rhode Island;
South Carolina;
Texas;
Utah; and
Washington, D.C..

, Although the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergfell v. Hodges (2015) made gay marriage a right throughout the entire United States, common law marriages apply only to opposite-sex couples., You should read the state’s statute for marriage requirements. People entering common law marriages must meet the same general requirements as those applying for marriage licenses:Age. Most states require that you be at least 18 years old. Check your state’s age requirements.
Sound mind. You can only be married if you can consent to enter the marriage. Accordingly, you cannot be suffering from delusions or insanity.
Unmarried. You cannot enter a common law marriage if either person is still married to another person. However, if one person divorces while you are living together, then a common law marriage could be formed at that point.
Every state requires that you have the legal ability to marry in order to enter into a common law marriage.

, Once you form a common law marriage, you have to actually get divorced legally.You cannot simply walk out and decide to stop holding yourself out as married.


In other words, although there is a common law marriage, there is no “common law divorce.” You need to go through the divorce process, like other married couples.If you do choose to simply walk away, then you can remain responsible for debts you took out as a couple. You also won’t have rights to any property or to alimony.You also can’t get married again until you dissolve your common law marriage.For tips on finding a divorce lawyer, see Hire a Divorce Lawyer.

, You begin the divorce by filing a petition with the court. Your lawyer can handle this for you. If you don’t have a lawyer, then you can ask the court clerk if there is a printed “fill in the blank” petition you can fill out.


Some courts now have self-help or family law centers which can help people filing for divorce without an attorney.You should stop in and check to see if your courthouse offers this service.
You can also see File Divorce Papers Without an Attorney for helpful information.

, Whoever files for divorce must prove to the court that a marriage existed. In some states, there is a time limit. For example, in Texas you should prove the common law marriage within two years of separating.You can prove the common law marriage in the same manner that you held yourself out to the public. Gather tax returns, bank statements, loan applications, property deeds, and other evidence that identifies you as husband and wife.You can also have people testify that they knew you as husband and wife."

Make a list of your boundaries.,
Outline what behaviors are unacceptable.,
Be specific with your boundaries.",How to Establish Healthy Privacy Boundaries in a Relationship1," Before you can set boundaries in your relationship, you need to figure out what your privacy boundaries are. This may involve some self-reflection and consideration on your part. Think about what parts of your life you want to share with your partner and what you want to stay private.Some things that you want private now may change in the future. As your relationship grows and you learn to trust your partner more, you may be more open with them. There’s nothing wrong with being more private at first and slowly opening up to your partner.;
, As your set privacy boundaries with your partner, you should let them know what behaviors are acceptable and unacceptable. You and your partner both should talk about what is accepted in the relationship and what is violating your privacy.For example, listening in on phone calls, looking over your shoulder read texts, or reading your emails may be violations of your privacy. Be specific so you and your partner can understand what each of you need and want.
Say to your partner, ""There are some things that I would like to remain private. I do not want you reading my texts or emails. These things are off-limits.""

, When you talk about your boundaries, make sure you are specific. Vague boundaries may lead to confusion, miscommunication, and problems in the relationship. Tell your partner exactly what you feel comfortable with and what you don’t.For example, you may say, “Do not look through my texts. That is a violation of my privacy” or “Please do not follow me when I go out. That is distracting me and my privacy.”

End the fight.",How to Fight Fair in Relationships," Emotions can run high and even get out of control when you’re in a fight. Avoid saying things you regret by approaching the fight with a calm demeanor. You’ll be able to think and respond more rationally without overreacting. Also, people are more likely to consider your viewpoint if you’re non-defensive and calm in expressing your needs, thoughts, and feelings.If you need a moment to get calm, try taking some deep breaths from your diaphragm. Say, “I need a moment before continuing.”;
, Don’t make vague accusations or generalizations. If you have a complaint against the person, state it clearly. If possible, give an example or several examples to back it up.For example, say, “It bothers me when you interrupt me while I’m speaking. You just interrupted me and I feel like you’re not listening. Please wait for me to finish.”

, Perhaps you feel like unleashing all of your grievances at once. Fights can get out of hand if you start bringing up other things that bother you instead of staying on the topic at hand. If you notice the fight getting off course, bring it back to the original topic.Stay focused by saying, “I know that upsets you, but I want to finish talking about this before we move onto something else.”
Avoid bringing up previous wrongs in the relationship or changing the direction of the fight to make your position look better.

, A fight isn’t fair if you’re the only person talking. Make sure you’re taking time to listen to what they have to say, even if you disagree with it. Don’t interrupt them, let them speak. Try your best to understand why they feel the way they do without trying to prove them wrong.Ask questions about things you’re unclear about or don’t understand.
Say, “I know we disagree, but I want to understand where you’re coming from. Tell me what’s going on for you.”

, Fights can quickly escalate when blaming is involved. It’s easy to blame someone else for the fight or when you feel upset. However, blame only increasing the tension and conflict.Stay away from polarized statements like, “You always forget your phone” or, “You never clean up.”
To express yourself without casting blame, try using “I” statements. Keep the focus on how you feel instead of what they did (or did not do). For example, say, “I felt hurt when you accused me because I know I didn’t do it.”, Don’t attack the person’s character or do things you know will hurt them. Name calling, swearing, or aggressive comments are not welcome during the fight. These tactics are hurtful and do nothing to move you closer to resolving the conflict.This includes physical aggression as well. Do not hit, push, or throw things at the other person.

, One person’s needs are not more important or more valid than the other’s. You might disagree with them on something, but it doesn’t mean that there need isn’t valid. If you can’t come to an agreement, recognize the needs they have and address those.Clarify your needs and the other person’s needs during the fight. Say, “What do you need me to hear?” or, “What need to you feel is most important in this?”

, Be willing to express what you’re thinking and feeling. Often, emotions get covered up with anger, but what lies underneath the anger might be sadness, disappointment, loneliness, hurt, or even misunderstanding. If you’re quick to blow up, take a moment and tune into what you’re feeling. Then, express that feeling.When talking about interactions, use “I” statements instead of blaming or accusing the other person. For example, say, “I felt sad and a little disappointed you didn’t invite me to the BBQ.”

, Sometimes, emotions can run high and one person or both people might need some time to cool off and regroup. Take a break from the fight and agree to come back together. This can help you clear your head and come back more ready to talk.Schedule a time to come back together. For example, pick a time later that day or the next day so that you don’t ignore the issue or pretend it doesn’t exist.

, Some people shut down as a way to cope with problems. This is different than taking a break to cool off. If you tend to stop talking, look away or look down, or generally shut down when fighting, recognize that this doesn’t help resolve the conflict. Do your best to stay in the discussion.If you feel emotionally overwhelmed and need a break, take a quick walk or listen to some music then return to the discussion.

, A fight isn’t fair if you always get your own way or vice versa. Be willing to meet halfway and find compromises in the relationship. Avoid ultimatums or making big choices in the moment. Try to prioritize fairness and being open to doing things as the other person does them.Do something ‘your way’ then try it ‘their way’. Or, get your way this time and let them make the choice next time.
For example, if you struggle to agree on a restaurant or activity, switch off who gets to choose.

, Above all, preserve the relationship above being “right”. There may be times you know you’re right but need to drop an issue to not contribute to conflict. After all, there are three parts to any relationship: you, the other person, and the relationship. Be kind to all three.For example, you may say, “I care about this topic, but I care about you more. I’m ready to drop it. I don’t want to fight with you.”

, Fights can become so tense and you might start to wonder how it will affect the relationship. If you can use a well-placed joke or funny statement, this can ease the tension and help you bond, even in the middle of a fight. Just don’t joke at the other person’s expense, as this might escalate things!For example, do or say something playful, make a silly face, or high-five when you come to something you agree on.

, Don’t leave the argument dangling or unresolved. Have a definitive end to the fight where both people feel heard. Even if you don’t agree on some things, agree to end the fight and move on. This might mean finding a compromise, making apologies, or agreeing to disagree. Whatever happens, clarify that the fight is over and that both of you can move on from it.Concluding the fight is important so that the disagreements or offenses can’t be brought up in future fights. Resolution means that the fight is done and should not be used against each other.

Start a conversation.,
Remind your partner that you care for them.,
Insist that your partner sets privacy boundaries.",How to Establish Healthy Privacy Boundaries in a Relationship2," A lot of miscommunication in relationships stems from not being clear about what your boundaries are. Some people try to hint around their feelings while others assume their partner knows. Since privacy boundaries are so important, make sure to make time to tell your partner what your boundaries are.For example, you may want to tell your partner, “I want to discuss our privacy boundaries” or “We should discuss our feelings about privacy in the relationship.”

, When you are setting your privacy boundaries, make sure to tell your partner that you love and care about them. Your privacy boundaries should not make your partner feel alienated or violated. You should be focusing on healthy ways to be in a relationship.Try saying, “I love you and I care about you. However, I need you to respect my privacy” or “I care about you and want to share things with you, but please understand that there are some things I do not want to share with you.”

, When you set privacy boundaries, it should be done on both sides. You shouldn’t be the only one making relationship boundaries. Instead, you both should set boundaries together and respect each other’s wants and needs.Tell your partner, ""I have stated my privacy boundaries. Now I am interested in what your privacy boundaries are so I can respect them. I understand they may be different than mine, and that is okay.""
Be aware that your partner’s boundaries may be different than yours. For example, you may feel uncomfortable with them posting status updates or photos of you on social media while your partner doesn’t care. Your partner may want private time to themselves each day.

Set personal space boundaries.,
Tell your partner about your digital privacy boundaries.,
Discuss how you feel about sharing items.,
Spend time with your friends and family.,
Keep passwords private.",How to Establish Healthy Privacy Boundaries in a Relationship3," Privacy boundaries aren’t just with things like keeping your cell phone private or not listening into phone calls. Privacy also deals with your personal space and sexual boundaries. You should share with your partner what physical and sexual things you are comfortable with and what you aren’t.For example, you may not feel comfortable taking a shower or going to the bathroom with your partner in the room. Certain parts of your body may be private and you may not want your partner to touch them. Make sure your partner is aware of this.
You may have privacy boundaries that are different when you and your partner are in public than when you and your partner are alone. You may be okay with kissing or touching when alone but not comfortable with doing that in public.
You can say, ""I love it when you kiss me and touch me when we are home. However, I do not like it when you touch me in an intimate way when we are in public. That violates my privacy boundaries."" You may also say, ""I do not mind you coming into the bathroom if the door is open. However, if I have closed the door, do not come into the room. If you need me, knock and I will answer you.""

, Social media, cell phones, and other technology open up many different ways your privacy can be violated. You and your partner should discuss what is appropriate to share and what you do not wish to be shared.This can include anything. Make sure to let your partner know if and what photos are appropriate to post, if they can tweet or post about the relationship, if they can tag you in photos or posts, and if they can follow your friends and family.
You should also discuss your boundaries about sexting or revealing photos.
For example, try saying, ""I do not want you posting pictures of me on social media unless I okay them first"" or ""Please do not sext me. I am not comfortable with that.""

, Just because you and your partner are in a relationship doesn’t mean everything you own belongs to each other. You both should talk about what items are off limits and which are okay to share.For example, you may feel okay about sharing clothes, books, or food, but you don’t feel comfortable sharing money or a toothbrush. Tell your partner, ""Though we share the grocery expenses and most of the food, this box of cookies is just for me. Please respect that.""
Even if you live together, you should establish privacy boundaries about your belongings to make sure you don’t step on each other’s boundaries.

, Part of setting privacy boundaries is making time for you to spend with your other friends. You and your partner should be able to spend time apart with your other friends. Find time to be with friends and family outside of your partner without having to check in or detail everything that happened.You should not have to report back to your partner about what you did or talked about. If you feel like sharing details, that is your right. However, your right to privacy includes what you do with your friends and family.

, No matter what level of relationship you and your partner have, you may want to keep your passwords to social media, your phone, or accounts private. Giving your partner passwords removes the privacy you have in your own digital space. Even if you trust your partner, keeping passwords a secret is a way to ensure your privacy.For example, if your partner knows your social media password, they may be able to post without your permission or read your private messages. It may also lead to jealousy.
Allowing someone to know your banking password may lead to someone taking your money without your permission. If you give out your website passwords, someone may buy things on or access your private accounts.

Be honest with your partner if they violate your boundaries.,
Remind your partner of your boundaries.,
Consider ending the relationship if your partner doesn't respect your boundaries.",How to Establish Healthy Privacy Boundaries in a Relationship4," If your privacy boundaries have been violated, you should sit down with your partner and talk to them. You need to tell your partner what they have done that has upset you. Explain that since you have had this conversation before, they should be aware of your boundaries.For example, try saying, ""You have violated my privacy by going through my phone without my permission. We have discussed before that my phone is off-limits. This behavior is not okay.""

, During this conversation, you may need to remind your partner of your privacy boundaries. This ensures that you both are on the same page and they understand what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Encourage your partner to repeat their privacy boundaries, too.For example, you may say, ""We have discussed this before, but I want to return to it. It is very important that we remember each other's privacy boundaries and respect those wishes.""

, If you have repeatedly told your partner about your privacy boundaries but they continue to violate them or disrespect you, you may consider ending the relationship. A person who doesn't respect your wants and needs may not provide the kind of healthy relationship you need. A person who violates your privacy boundaries may not respect you and end up violating other boundaries, which could harm you in the long run.Remind yourself that your boundaries are important. You deserve to have your boundaries respected. You do not have to accept someone not respecting your boundaries.

Determine whether you are going for marriage counseling or individually focused counseling, accompanied by your partner.,
Read your health insurance contract.,
Be savvy as you research.,
Know the lingo before you call your insurance company:


""Dates and Location of Service"" is when and where you will be seen;
A ""Procedure Code"" is who will be seen.,
Have your questions ready.,
Explore alternative payment options.",How to Find Out if Your Health Insurance Will Pay for Marriage Counseling," Marital counseling implies that you are going together to work through relationship issues, but if your focus is individual counseling, you just want your spouse to accompany, and support you, in managing your own individual mental illness. In the first case, your marriage will be the focus of attention. In the second case, helping you and your spouse learn better ways of managing the challenges of your mental illness will be the focus.


If you've determined that you want help for a troubled marriage, be aware that this will be considered your ""diagnosis."" This diagnosis code is V61.1 Relational Problems in the DSM V. Knowing the difference between a ""diagnostic code"" and a ""procedural code"" will be important when you contact your insurance company.;
, Most contracts have a clause that reads something like this: “A quote of benefits or authorization does not guarantee payment or verify eligibility. Payment of benefits are subject to all terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the member’s contract at time of service.” This means that when you call up your health insurance company, you cannot rely on what the person tells you as a ""fact."" It may be, or it may not be. You are required to know your own health insurance plan.

, You are expected to understand what your health insurance policy covers, and what it does not cover. This can be confusing to most people. Most people believe that if a person from your health insurance company tells you it is so, then it is a fact. Not so. You have to be a savvy consumer and know what to ask.


Many policies state that they will pay only for treatment that they consider to be “medically necessary.” This meaning that they have the right to withhold payment if it is considered outside the scope of the policy. This is true even if you have an ""authorization code.""

, Will you be seen alone, with your partner, or with other family members?
The ""Diagnostic Code"" is what reason the patient has for seeking treatment. It describes the focus of the treatment, even if the patient has more than one accurate diagnosis. What will your clinician be focused on helping you with? This is the Diagnostic Code.

This is the most confusing part for most people. Your insurance will pay for both spouses being in the room (Procedural Code) and the clerk on the phone will say “Yes, we cover couples counseling,” because they see the Procedural Code “Couples/Family Therapy” on their computer screen. But a Procedural Code (Who’s in the Room) doesn’t kick out the claim. It is the Diagnostic Code that causes the claim to be rejected.



, When you read your policy, or call up your insurance company, ask specific questions:


""Do you cover diagnostic code V61.1 used for marriage counseling?"" You want to determine whether they consider V61.1 Relational Problems to be a medical necessity.
Some treat code V61.1 differently than other mental disorder diagnoses. If they cover it, ask how many sessions they will cover.
Sometimes health insurance companies will cover a few sessions as ""V61.1 Relational Problems,"" and then after these sessions are used, they expect the marriage counselor to label one of you as having a diagnosable mental disorder. You have a right to decide if this will happen, when your counselor is asked to provide such a label, and what that diagnosis will be.

, Some people decide that they do not wish to be given a diagnosis of a mental disorder, other than V61.1. They will negotiate with their marriage counselor for an affordable fee, in lieu of being given this diagnosis. This is your right.


Most will agree that marriage problems are stressful. This does not mean that you have to be given a diagnosable mental disorder to see a marriage counselor. If you are going for marriage counseling, that should be your diagnosis. If your health insurance coverage doesn't cover V61.1 Relational Problems, you can look for a better plan, or put your concerns in writing to them. Long-standing marital distress is linked to physical illness, and is nothing to take lightly. Paying now for this sort of help makes good business sense, as well as common sense.

Learn the three Cs.,
Keep it to one subject per argument.,
Pick your moment.,
Start as you would like it to end.,
Some arguments will never get resolved.,
Poke out your tongue.,
Too much, too much.,
Do your best not to stonewall.,
Watch your mouth and show some respect.",How to Eliminate Toxic Arguments from Your Relationship," Know the difference between complaining, criticism and contempt.


Complaining is when you address an issue or an action clearly and precisely without being personal.

We need to be able to complain; there are obviously issues that need to be sorted out and we need to be able to address them. No one wants to get landed with the dishes all the time. However there’s no place in a thriving relationship for criticism or contempt. They need to be banned.
Make an agreement with your partner right now to eliminate criticism and contempt from your communication. No ifs, buts or maybes, pay attention, be disciplined and just don't do it. Be disciplined when you complain, don't slip in a criticism or a contemptuous remark. This is often not easy in the heat of battle but if you pay attention to your words you’ll save yourself a lot of grief.
If you do slip up then a quick apology is required. Also make a note to yourself to improve. You may have to call each other on it until it becomes habit but you’ll get immediate results. The horror of the punch and counter punch is eliminated.
Another point to catch yourself on is when you try to justify your contemptuous statement. For example, if you have called me stupid and I pull you up on it; don't spend the next five minutes explaining that I actually was thick. I’m dum on a regular basis however, there are nicer ways to get me back to the land of the intelligent.


Example: ‘You said you would do the dishes and you haven't.’


Criticism is personal and often has a global statement such as ‘always’ or ‘never’.

Example: ‘You said you would do the dishes. You never keep your word.’


Contempt adds an insult.

Example: ‘You said you would do the dishes. You really are a low life.’

;
, Stick to the subject you started with. For example, if you start off arguing about the dishes then this argument is about the dishes, and the dishes only. Argue about any other issues later, and one at a time.

, Timing is everything. If your partner is already struggling to cope with a hard day, then delay until they are settled; the dishes can wait. Value your relationship higher than a single issue. If there never seems to be the right time, then you have a bigger issue to address.

, Avoid the harsh start up. The way you start is very predictive of the way you’ll finish. If you leap in all guns blazing then it will probably end in an inferno, so be really careful about your first sentence. If you want it to end with respect and understanding then set the tone right up front.

, Not all issues are resolvable. It doesn't mean you can't argue about them, it just means that holding the false hope of resolution may force you to argue beyond what is useful.


Favorite subjects may be things like the budget or being on time. Yours may be different.
There’s another clump of unresolvable arguments, these are the arguments that we don't have the skill to resolve. You can park these discussions or seek help from mentors and professionals. There’s plenty of help available if you look for it.

, The repair mechanism sometimes called a time-out or a circuit breaker is a way to ensure that things don't get out of hand.


It’s a signal or a comment that alerts both parties to back-off or slow down, that there’s danger ahead. It could be an edgy comment like, ‘Whoa this is getting out of hand’ or ‘We're off the topic’ or ‘That was unkind’ but my favorite is the poked out-tongue.
Just when things start to be a bit crazy, one of us will drop a sly little look and stick out the mouthy flesh. It's just too difficult to continue with any enjoyable venom. How can you possibly drop snide remarks on someone who is smart enough to realize how ridiculous you’re being.
It doesn't mean that the argument is not valid or should not be completed. It just means that now you’re going about it in a way that may end up damaging us, and us is more important than finishing the argument now.
Repair mechanisms are not just a way of ensuring that arguments don't get completely out of hand; they have a positive aspect too. They allow you to argue with confidence.
If you know for certain that you won't get into a whirlwind of recriminations and bitter memories at first mention of the budget, then it’s possible to start talking about it. We may not be able to reach resolution, but we can at least try.
Proceed until there’s a sense that it’s about to go pear shaped, out comes the tongue and we back off.
This is a technique that can help you feel safe in an argument or discussion. In the past there’s been a certain anxiety about entering into discussions that could get argumentative simply because there was no safety net. There was always the possibility that at any given moment a hot button could get fired up and off we'd go, into the boxing ring letting go of as many combinations as we could.
So negotiate a repair signal with your partner that you both agree to respect. When things start to go a bit crazy, use it and live to fight another day.

, Another concept that’s very helpful to understand is flooding. This is when there’s too much stimulation and you’re feeling overwhelmed.


If the kids are shouting and there's noise from the kitchen, you can often find that you have to turn the radio off, or leave the room, in order to think. There’s just too much going on.
In an argument situation it may be that the feeling has got too high. In this situation the worst thing you can do is push the ‘flooded one’. They are in a state of not being able to respond, they need to be able to collect themselves. Anything more may feel like an attack. Even innocent remarks may lead you into very tricky territory.

, The unskillful response to this is to stonewall.


It’s where you disengage from the argument completely, maybe by refusing to talk, staring at the TV or just storming out. This leaves one partner trying to engage while the other is refusing to even try.
The power struggle is intense and may be very frightening for the one who is still attempting to communicate.
Often the response is to go even harder at the stony-faced wall.
One person is feeling attacked to the point where they can not or will not respond and the other is trying to force a response. It’s like trying to pour more water into an engorged sponge; there’s no more room. No amount of force is going to achieve anything.
Stonewalling needs to be avoided. It will damage your sense of ‘us’ because one of you has withdrawn from that space.

, Sounds like something an old man might growl at you, but when you break it all down this is what we’re left with. If you apply some discipline to your words and actions then a fiery exchange does not need to become explosive. It can be emotional and truthful and daring, without being damaging or hurtful. You can say what needs to be said, express disappointment and discuss edgy topics without having to defend yourself because you’ll not be under attack. There's nothing complex here, just some discipline when under fire.

Tell your partner as soon as possible.,
Do it face to face.,
Pick the right time.,
Be firm in your decision.,
Practice your delivery beforehand.",How to End a Long Term Relationship1," You may want to delay the breakup because of how hard you know it will be, but this is not going to help the situation. Staying with your partner after you know you want to leave them is not helpful to you or your partner or considerate of either of your feelings. Just drum up enough courage to end your relationship. It will be better for everyone.This doesn't mean that you should not take your time in thinking about your decision. You cannot undo a breakup easily once it is gone.;
, Although it may seem appealing to end your relationship where you don't have to see your partner's face, this is a childish and harmful way to end a relationship, especially a long term one. It will be hard to tell your partner in person, but given how long the two of you have been together, your relationship deserves more respect than that.


Don't leave a voicemail, write them a letter, tell them over the phone, or tell them through email or social media. These are cowardly and hurtful., There is never a good time to end a relationship, but there are better times than others to break the news. Avoid telling your partner right before leaving the house, before you or your partner has to go to work, or at other busy times.


This will not give you and your partner adequate time to deal with the situation and give the breakup the attention it deserves.
You should also avoid telling them in public., You made the decision to end your long term relationship for a reason. When you tell your partner, you need to stand firm in your decision to end it. Let them know that you are unhappy and that you are not interested in trying to make it work.


If you know that your relationship will not last, make sure you don't give in to any pleas made by your partner. You are just delaying the inevitable ending to your relationship., You are going to be emotional in the moment when you break up with your partner. Practicing what you are going to say before you talk to your partner will help you feel more prepared. You will be able to think through everything you want to say so it will come out right.You can even write it down or type it out first so you can get your thoughts in order.

Be honest.,
Stay calm.,
Focus on the present.,
Don't be passive aggressive.,
Avoid blaming your partner.,
Keep your private affairs to yourself.",How to End a Long Term Relationship2," When you end your relationship with your partner, make sure you are honest. Don't avoid telling your partner exactly why you feel you need to move on and end the relationship. This will only cause problems for you and your partner in the long run.


This doesn't mean you have to be harsh. Honesty does not have to be damaging to your partner's feelings., One of the worse things you can do is get riled up and tense when you are getting ready to breakup with your long term partner. This will make the situations even more stressful for you. The process is not going to be easy, but stressing about it is not going to change it.


Take time to relax as you decide the best way to tell your partner. You want to explain your reasons for breaking up with a clear head and calm demeanor. This may be difficult, but it is possible.
If you are extremely stressed, do something that relaxes you, such as reading or listening to music., There is no reason to bring up the past when you are breaking up with your long term partner. The reasons that you want to break it off are current and about how your relationship is now. Don't bring up how your relationship used to be or any old fights while telling your partner it's over.


This will just add salt to wounds and make the breakup that much harder., Avoid changing your behavior in order to get your partner to end the relationship first. This will end up making the breakup nastier than it needs to be. Approach the situation like an adult and be honest with your partner instead of trying to make them break up with you.


Avoid being overly aggressive or petty towards your partner and don't make life miserable for both of you. This will help no one in the long run., You don't want your breakup to turn ugly, so avoid placing blame on anyone in the relationship for its failure. Relationships are complicated and never black and white, so try to focus on breaking up with them in a way that does not place blame or sound accusatory.


If there is a reason for you breaking up with your partner that is not your fault, such as your partner cheating on you, still try to take the high road. Blame and bitterness will only make the breakup harder., In the modern technology age, people have a tendency to overshare. When you are going through your breakup, avoid slamming your partner on any social media platform. This will only make the breakup get ugly. You want to give your partner and your relationship its due respect.


You can talk to your friends about your breakup, but do so on the phone or text message instead of public social media accounts."
"
Know it will take time.,
Focus on other things.,
Rely on your family and friends.,
Go easy on yourself.,
Take care of yourself.",How to End a Long Term Relationship3," A breakup, especially of a long term relationship, will not happen over night. Considering that your lives have been intertwined for so long, there is no easy break from them. You and your partner will probably have mutual friends, possessions, and routines that will make it tense and awkward for awhile.


Your routines and life will change when your relationship is no longer a factor. This will take time to adjust to.
You will also have lingering feelings, even if you are no longer in love with your partner. You may be emotional for awhile after the breakup as you cope with these lingering feelings., One of the best ways to move on is by focusing your attention on new things. This way, you are doing things that can't remind you of your partner or your breakup. This will help you heal, with the added bonus of enriching your life.


Trying new things will help you to heal. Start a new project, join a yoga class, or take an art class. Just find something you enjoy that you can focus on., After a breakup, you will need to lean on those around you. Even when you are the one who broke off the relationship, it will be emotional. Lean on your family and friends when you're feeling down or upset about your breakup. This will give you the support system you need to heal.


Spend more time with your friends and family, go out more, or talk to them on the phone. This will help you feel connected and loved when you're feeling down., You will likely not go back to being 100% happy and healthy right after a breakup, especially a long term one. When you're feeling down or stressed because of the breakup, don't beat yourself up or try to snap out of it right away. It will take time to heal.


You need to give yourself time to grieve your relationship in healthy ways so you can move on. If you push down your feelings, you may have some issues later on.
Your friends and family will understand that you need time to regroup and heal., As you cope with your breakup, you need to take care of yourself. Take time to cope and process your life without your partner. Your feelings will likely be complicated and intense, even if you are the one who ended things.

Make sure you pay attention to your own mental and physical health while you heal.

Don't let go of your healthy lifestyle just because you had a breakup. Keep eating healthy and exercising like your normally would.
If you didn't exercise or eat right before, consider changing your routine to include healthier habits so you can be healthier after your breakup."

If you are dishonest, you will continue to worry about being caught. Be honest and forthright to prevent potential future betrayal and delay the process of regaining trust.Being forthcoming will also allow you to explain your behavior in the best possible way. Your partner may assume the worst and others may exaggerate what happened, so take control of your story.;
, Your partner will likely be upset and may use negative language. Even if you know you did something wrong, this may cause you to become defensive of deflect blame. It is important to remember your partner is in great pain, and he or she needs to express that.When you start to feel the urge to defend yourself, imagine how you would feel if your partner betrayed your trust. This will help you to recognize your partner's communication as an expression of pain, rather than an attack.


Nothing you do will ever justify abuse. If your partner becomes physically aggressive, verbally abusive, or threatens you in any way, you should leave the situation immediately and seek help., Show your partner you care about his or her thoughts and feelings by restating and reflecting what he or she communicates to you. Restate his or her communication by paraphrasing. Then, reflect by stating the emotion he or she is expressing.For example, your partner says, ""You said you'd be there, but you weren't. You knew how important this was to me!""
Restate by paraphrasing ""I wasn't there, even though I promised I would be.""
Reflect by acknowledging the emotion your partner is communicating, ""I disappointed you.""

, It is very important your partner feel heard and understood. Your betrayal represents a disregard for your partner's well being. Demonstrate you care by describing how your behavior likely affected your partner.For example, ""My behavior was hurtful and violated your trust.""


Try to avoid using the phrase ""I know,"" when talking about others' feelings. While not meant to offend, some people may interpret it as patronizing.

, What drove you to betray your partner? You are responsible for your actions, but understanding the emotion underlying your behavior may trigger your partner's empathy and will help you avoid similar situations in the future.Describe how you felt and then describe your behavior. For example, ""I felt insecure in our relationship and sought attention from others.""


Use ""I"" statements to avoid inadvertently making your partner feel like you are blaming him or her.

, It is key to help your partner see how you will avoid hurting him or her in the future. Identify what led to the behavior and ways you could have avoided the situation. For instance, if your behavior was influenced by a certain person, commit to avoiding being alone with him or her. This may involve making sure you have your partner or another friend accompany you to events the person is likely to attend and leaving if you find yourself alone with the person.


Communicating and resolving your issues with your partner should always be included in the plan.

, Express genuine regret and remorse for betraying your partner. Your partner is more likely to trust you if he or she believes you will act to avoid future unpleasant emotions as a result of your behavior.Avoid making promises you can't or don't intend to keep. Failure to follow through on promises may make earlier apologies seem insincere.

, Poor communication likely contributed to the betrayal; one or both of you was not being open and honest. To ensure this is remedied, identify barriers to effective communication and ways to overcome them. This will show your partner you are committed to avoiding future betrayal.If you or your partner is uncomfortable discussing emotions, agree to write letters to each other about emotional subjects.
If you and your partner do not communicate frequently enough, schedule weekly dates to discuss your relationship.
If you are struggling to identify why you and your partner are not communicating effectively, consider enlisting the help of a couples counselor. A counselor will be able to help you identify and solve communication problems.

, You may be at a loss as to how to earn your partner's trust again. Ask your partner what you can do to help them move toward trust. This may mean communicating more regularly, spending more time together, going to counseling, being patient, or something else. Ask your partner to guide your behavior in order to build trust.

, Contact throughout the day will demonstrate you are thinking about your partner. This will help ease concerns that you are acting without regard for him or her. Your partner is more likely to trust you if he or she feels connected to you.A good way to maintain contact without being needy is to text funny photos or brief descriptions of funny interactions you have with others.

, Once you have apologized and made a plan to behave differently, try not to dwell on the hurtful event(s). Refocus attention on the present by engaging in fun activities together.If you are spending more time with your partner, he or she will worry less about what you are doing when you are apart.


Find a hobby you and your partner can enjoy together. This will increase the amount of time you spend together and can strengthen your bond.

, Show him or her how much you appreciate him or her and how important the relationship is to you. When your partner feels valued, he or she will feel secure in the relationship.Try leaving notes of appreciation in places you know he or she will see them.
If you demonstrate appreciation with gifts, be careful your partner doesn't feel like you are trying to buy your way out of trouble.
Help out around the house to show him or her you notice and appreciate how much he or she does.

, Be patient with your partner while he or she learns to trust you again. This is out of your hands, and trying to speed the process along may cause your partner to feel you are not respecting his or her feelings.Instead of focusing on something you have no control over (time), focus on the things you can control, such as being reliable and consistent.Show your partner you have made long-term changes; don't just do things for the short term and then fall back into old habits."

Use efficient communication.,

Don’t presume or assume things.,
Don’t force a conversation.",How to Develop Interpersonal Skills," Nonverbal communication includes your facial expressions, your use of touch, and your voice (not the words you speak, but how they sound).Visual cues are more important to interpret and deliver than audio cues. With visual cues, people are more likely to successfully interpret facial expressions in comparison to body language.For example, if you want to show that you are happy, it's more effective to give expressive facial cues, like smiling, than increasing your talking speed or showing happy body language. There may be times when it is advantageous to hide emotions that you may be feeling (like when you are afraid) but don’t want to show it.;
, It’s estimated that non-verbal communication makes up to 60% of meaning in interpersonal communication.To be successful at communicating nonverbally, you need to express emotions in ways that are received and correctly understood by others.


Start thinking about the nonverbal cues both you send when communicating. Also think about the nonverbal communications that you receive from others.

, Generally in Western culture if you want to convey a warm rapport with someone, focus on the following behavior: lean forward and direct your face and body right at the other person. Use gestures, and vary your vocal pitch, rate, and volume. Actively listen by nodding, smiling, and not interrupting. Be relaxed-but not too relaxed.


In other words, don’t slump your shoulders, but avoid stiffening your muscles. If you find yourself focusing too much on your body language, direct your attention instead to what the other person is saying.

, While welcoming body language might work in some cultures, it may not work in others. Good nonverbal communication skills come from knowing cultural rules related to emotional expressions. For example, in Finnish culture, making eye contact is considered a sign of being approachable, while in Japanese culture, eye contact is a sign of anger.From a global perspective, if you are native to a particular culture, many of the nonverbal norms will be instinctive. If you find yourself communicating in a culture that is not your own, keenly watch others for typical nonverbal behavior.

, It is helpful to understand gender differences when sending and interpreting nonverbal messages.Men and women express themselves non-verbally in different ways. Generally, women are more likely than men to use eye contact and smile. They're also likely to receive and give more physical touch.Women also tend to interrupt less than men, listen more than men, and are better at correctly interpreting facial expressions than men., This is an important part of successful communication. When you feel overwhelmed by emotion, you may need to take a deep breath and search for a calm feeling. Be aware of any tense signals you are sending and relax those signals: unclench your fists, don’t grit your teeth, and release any other gripping in your muscles.


In a study of Fortune 500 executives, those who were able to regulate and appropriately express emotions (like resisting the impulse to cry when given criticism) were more likely to gain trust from others., Are you getting the results you want when to talk to others? Take time to think about a recent interaction you had. Did you get what you wanted out of the conversation (for example, were you persuasive)? Did you feel like the other person really understood you? If the answer is no, think about the strategies you use to get the results you want.Here are several effective strategies:


Be persuasive: appeal to the other person's logical side. For example, if you want your roommate to take out the trash, explain that you both want to have the same amount of housework and that you took out the trash last time. Therefore it is her turn to take out the trash.
Use welcoming body language: if you're getting a cold response to a request, try building a warm rapport with body language first, by leaning forward while talking to them and engaging in active listening.
Listen: don't monopolize the conversation. Instead, monitor how you are responding and listening to your conversation partner. Allow silence and give signals that you are listening like “go on,” “uh-huh,” and “really?”
Be strategically assertive: use ""I-messages,"" like “I’m feeling overwhelmed.”Be careful about using them too much or making aggressive statements with “you-messages” like “You are making me really mad.”, Use a simple, direct request to get what you want, instead of complex, indirect messages.When you can, plan and practice what you are going to say so that you can deliver your message with relative speed and ease. Efficient communication not only helps others to understand you, but also lets you make more messages in the same amount of time.For example, you may want to ask your boss for more responsibility at your job. Instead of saying, “Hello, if you think it's a good idea, I’ve been thinking about how I would like the opportunity to maybe take on more responsibilities and tasks within our workplace” say, “I am hoping to take on more responsibilities as you see fit.”

, People expect that they will be able to contribute to a conversation equally.Letting the other person speak means that you should try to be comfortable with silences, but not for more than a few seconds.Altercentrism, or focus on the other person in conversation, makes a communicator seem more competent.For example, pay attention to how much you are speaking in a conversation. Has your story lasted for a long time? Wrap up your story and give a pause to signal that it is the other person's turn in the conversation.

, Generally, there are five principles that show effective communication: informativeness, relevance, truthfulness, politeness, and modesty.There's an assumption among people that when you talk, your speech will:


contribute information that others did not know
be relevant and of interest to everyone involved
be truthful (unless you're using sarcasm and irony)
follow social expectations about being polite, like using “please” and “thank you”
avoid bragging or being self-centered

, This can help you and your communication partner achieve your goals.Find qualities you share and build upon common understandings. For example, if you disagree on which restaurant to go to, but both agree that you are hungry, draw on your mutual hunger to reach a decision.


If you find that your conversation partner struggles to see or accept the common ground between you both, take a communication break and return to the conversation later. For example, you can say, “we both are really hungry right now, so why don’t I choose the restaurant this time and you can choose next time.”

, It's best to be completely direct and clear when communicating with others.If you presume or assume things, you'll end up misunderstanding and causing tension in your relationships.For example, imagine that you are speaking with someone who looks elderly and she asks you to repeat something you said. Do not assume that because she is older that she cannot hear and don’t simply speak louder to be heard.


If the context is unclear, try to figure out the request by your communication partner before continuing to talk. You might say, “I’m sorry, was I speaking too softly?”

, No one likes to feel as if they don’t have a choice. If you feel yourself “strong-arming” in the conversation, or trying to get the other person to do what you want through force, rethink your strategy. Try to achieve your goals through persuasion and direct communication. This approach will make sure that your long-term relationships stay intact and will be more successful overall.


For example, imagine you want to go on a road trip with a friend. Your friend has a pet emergency come up on the day of the trip and can't go. Rather than make your friend feel guilty about missing the trip, show your disappointment and offer to help somehow. Explain that you understand the position she's in.

Perform regular self-care to manage the tension.,
Anticipate moodiness and leave the space for a while.,
Prevent getting yelled at by addressing issues during calm moments.,
Consider moving if the situation becomes unbearable.,
Call out the moody behavior in conversation.,
Help your roommate learn to manage stress.,
Come up with a signal.,
Identify patterns of moodiness.,
Conduct some research.,
Talk to your roommate’s friends and family.,
Suggest that your roommate see a doctor or counselor.",How to Deal With Your Roommate's Mood Swings," Set time aside to do activities outside of your apartment/house/dorm room and on your own to help you relieve stress that builds up in the home environment. It may even be a good idea to make friends other than your roommate. If he or she is usually in a bad mood, you probably don’t want to depend on him or her for all your social interactions.Self-care activities can include virtually anything that relaxes you and relieves tension.You can go to the spa for a massage, listen to music while you walk/jog on the trails, and even go to the library for peace and quiet to study. Schedule in a few self-care activities each week to keep your stress levels down.;
, Get to know your roommate and understand the signs of a problem that is in the making. Take a walk while he or she calms down. You may not be able to avoid all of the moodiness but it can go a long way it avoiding a good percentage of the blow ups. You need to space to avoid the conflict and there is a good chance your roommate needs the space in the room to calm down.Do consider how often you end up leaving to make sure the roommate isn’t reacting in a negative way just to get the room to themselves.

, You will not solve anything yelling during an argument but you can work on the problem during calm times. Try to stay as calm as possible instead of matching your roommate anger with a louder voice. From the start of living together set up a list of house rules that include waiting to calm down before talking things out.It may be a good idea to schedule in a weekly meeting or housekeeping session to discuss any issues happening within the living space. You might say ""Hey, George, I'd like to talk to you about the rent payments. Let me know when it's a good time to have that discussion.""

, Do not hesitate in reporting the problem to your residential advisor if you are living on campus or to a landlord in an apartment or housing unit. This can be a tough process so asking to be moved should not be used as a first defense. Work with the residential advisors to explore all your options., This should take place in person and not via email or social media. Talking face-to-face allows the other person to not only hear what is being said but also see that you are concerned.Try to be careful to label the behavior and not judge your roommate. Since moodiness can sometimes have a very real and physical cause, it’s not fair to focus on the roommate being “wrong” or ""bad.""
Say something like “Hey, I’ve been noticing you’re in a bad mood a lot lately. Do you want to talk about it?”
Discuss observations of the behavior instead of evaluations of the roommate. You might tell him or her that “You come off as rude to my guests” or “Your attitude makes the living environment tense.”

, Set clear boundaries so that you can be helpful with the process, but you don't want to end up acting as a therapist to your roommate. Approach the issue as you would a friend, with a compassionate tone of voice.Bring up the subject by saying something like ""Hey, I've noticed you've been really stressed lately. I get stressed sometimes, too. How about we brainstorm some ways we can both manage or prevent stressful situations?""
Work with your roommate to identify what causes the majority of his or her stress and offer to help with possible solutions. Your roommate may become moody around finals because he or she puts off studying. If this is the case, offer study tips or to help with better time management early in the term.

, You can work with your roommate to let him or her know that a break or chill time is needed. Remember that you do not need to become best friends, but you need to set some sort of ground rules to enable the two of you to live together peacefully.For example you may tell your roommate that he or she is getting upset by telling them you can see that their mind is “working a mile a minute” or another key phrase you agree on. This will trigger them to reflect on what is currently happening and take a break to perform self-care.
Having a signal that is not obvious to those around you can be helpful to not call attention to your roommate’s moods outside of your room.

, The mood swings may be as harmless as a general annoyance or severe enough that they are keeping the friend up all night. Take notes in a journal to help you identify patterns. You may also be able to spot other factors that may contribute to the mood swings., Some mental illnesses have mood swings as a symptom. Your roommate may be experiencing an undiagnosed psychiatric disorder. Mood swings can be a symptom or even a result of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, ADHA or even anxiety. Look up the symptoms of each and compare your roommate’s behaviors to see if anything fits.Keep in mind, your goal is not to diagnose your roommate. You are simply trying to learn more about his or her behaviors so that you can have a better understanding.

, See if they have noticed the behavior. Do this discreetly. You might start by asking other friends if they see the moodiness when you aren’t around. Finding out can help you understand if it happens all the time or only at home. If it's strictly at home, you may want to consider whether the two of you are well-suited if he or she only acts like this in your presence.


If the mood swings are something you have seen occur with other people as well, ask them for suggestions as to how they handled it. ""So, you say Terry is moody around you every now and then, too, huh? What do you do when this happens?""
Explore how many people in your roommate’s family have similar issues and see if there is a pattern as far as mental health issues running in the family.

, If the mood swings have been interfering with his or her life, it may be a sign of a larger problem. It can be helpful to remind your roommate of the affect his or her mood swings actually has on life for both of you. Your roommate may not notice the issue on a daily basis, so be prepared.You might show compassion by saying ""I can see that your mood brings you down some days. It also causes tension between us. Have you thought about seeing a counselor or someone you can talk to professionally?""
Volunteer to go to the doctor with your roommate for emotional support.

Consider that subtleties may be hidden.,
Decide if subtleties are healthy or unhealthy.,
Become more self-aware: self-knowledge as a way to uncover subtleties.,
Be open to the other: most people have a blind spot to some fault or other, but we also tend to have a blind spot to our own strengths and potential.,
Negotiate a solution: listen, learn and clarify.,
Rebuild and re-structure: finding new grounds for an existing relationship can be very healthy and can infuse new life into it.,
Know Yourself: self-knowledge as a way of healing.",How to Detect Subtleties in a Relationship," Subtleties may be verbal or non-verbal. Verbal subtleties involve the use of words. We tend to adopt particular forms of verbal subtlety in an ongoing relationship and build them into the relationship. Non-verbal subtleties, on the other hand, involve the eyes, physical gestures, facial expressions, or other forms of body language. These forms of communication are very commonplace and can save us the effort of constantly having to put our thoughts and feelings into words. If these subtleties, verbal or non-verbal (or a combination of the two), are repeated over a significant period of time, they can easily become unconscious. That is, they become second nature--we continue to practice them but we are no longer conscious that we are doing so.;
, Some subtleties are healthy and some are unhealthy. If a relationship is growing and fostering communication, well-being and trust, then we can surely say that it is a healthy relationship. If this is not the case, if the relationship is unhealthy, then chances are that there is some form of unhealthy subtlety in the relationship. So some positive action is required.

, Learning to know yourself better is a great help in uncovering these subtleties. The better you know yourself, the easier it is to see yourself and the other person, and to see how the relationship is developing. Self-knowledge includes knowledge of your own thoughts and emotions, knowledge of your strengths and weaknesses, knowledge of your potential and your limitations, and knowledge of your identity.

, It is essential that you are able to listen intently to the other person. This has many benefits: you give the other person the opportunity to be heard and accepted, you can potentially be enlightened about your own weaknesses or your own strengths, and your perception can be (more objectively) compared with the other person's perception.

, Having heard the other person's thoughts, allowed their feelings to be vented, and given them the space and time just to be themselves in your presence, you are in a much better position to act. You should now know the other person and yourself much better. You are better able to make suggestions, comments and clarifications. This may not yet be a final solution, but it can easily become an important stepping stone to the final solution.

, This is not completely out of the question. Openness, trust, sincerity and kindness can overcome almost anything or anything, period. A relationship that may have started with a fault or two can be rebuilt in this way. It takes a generous heart or two generous hearts to do so, but it is not an impossible task.

, The degrees of self-knowledge are many and varied. As both parties in the relationship embark together on a journey of self-discovery, each helping and supporting the other, they can lead one another to increasing depths of emotional well-being, of trust, and of healthy and life-giving forms of communication.

Practice active listening.,
Refrain from judgment.,
Show appreciation.,
Ask open ended questions.,
Embrace differences between genders regarding communication.,
Learn how to effectively engage in difficult discussions.,
Examine yourself.",How to Get a Girl to Open up to You when You're a Guy," One of the first things you need to do to get a girl to open up is listen. Practicing active listening can help a girl feel like what she says matters. This will make her feel like she can open up to you.


Always maintain eye contact when she talks and give verbal and non verbal cues that you are paying attention. Nod, smile, and laugh at appropriate moments. Reiterate what she's feeling and saying so she knows you understand.Avoid any distractions during communication. Stay away from looking at your smart phone screen or laptop. If you get a phone call, ignore it unless it's absolutely vital to answer.If you don't understand anything, feel free to ask questions. However, wait until she's done talking and say something like, ""Could you explain that more? I'm not sure I fully understand."";
, Judgment can be toxic when trying to get someone to open up to you. If you want a girl to open up, you need to avoid passing judgment during the conversation.


Women communicate differently from men in that they're not always seeking advice or insight. They're merely trying to express and understand their feelings through communication. Therefore, it's best not to offer advice unless specifically asked. Simply listen and try to understand her feelings.Vulnerability means expressing thoughts and feelings one is uncomfortable with or even ashamed of. Try to assure your female friend her feelings, even negative feelings, are okay and she should be able to express them to you without fear of judgment.

, Tell your female friend how much you appreciate it when she shares things with you. People sometimes feel insecure about opening up as they don't want to burden others. Letting your friend know you appreciate that she feels comfortable talking to you will help foster a healthy, comfortable relationship that encourages openness., When talking to your female friend, you should ask questions that are open ended and promote closeness. There are 36 questions psychiatrists have identified that promote intimacy and closeness between two people.


Some questions are fun, ice breaker type questions. For example, ""If you could have dinner with anyone in the world, who would you choose and why?"" The questions, which need to be asked in a certain order, gradually build in seriousness. Eventually, you'll build up to questions like, ""What is your most terrible memory?"" and ""How do you feel about your relationship with others?""You can find a full list of questions online. Remember to ask them in order. Ideally, it should take around 45 minutes to ask all the questions., Men and women do tend to communicate differently. While there are certainly exceptions, and not everyone falls strictly into certain categories, there do seem to be some identifiable differences in communication between genders in a general sense.


Women like to vent when they're frustrated while men like to offer solutions to problems head on. If your female friend expresses frustration or sadness over something, understand expressing these feelings is not a means to an end for her. It's an end in and of itself. You do not need to offer a solution. Only listen and express understanding and sympathy.Women are often exploring their thoughts when speaking. If your female friend says anything that feels contradictory or confusing, do not point it out. She is likely aware her thoughts are somewhat muddled. She is expressing such thoughts to try and gleam a greater understanding of them. Allow her time to talk, even to ramble, without trying to articulate or explain anything for her., On occasion, you'll have to have difficult discussion with a female friend or girlfriend. Understand how to best engage in hard talks.


Plan to discuss the issue at a specific time and then state your intentions. What do you hope to gain by this discussion? What issues do you want resolved?If there's some kind of break or negativity between the two of you, take responsibility for your part in the issue. Remember, relationships are two way streets. Avoid trying to explain or justify your roll in the situation. Try to understand more than be understood.Be patient. Feelings of frustration and impatience are a normal part of a hard conversation. If you allow these feelings to pass over and keep going towards a resolution, you'll be able to effectively resolve the issue., Developing a sense of self awareness about what drives your feelings and reactions can help it be easier for others to open up to you. Try to understand your own needs, wants, fears, and expectations. You're more likely to catch yourself engaging with someone in a negative way if you know what factors cause you to act in fear, anger, or insecurity."

Stay calm.,
Smile at them when you talk to them.,
Talk to them!,
Help them do work.,
Take them to different places out of the house.,
Hug them!,
Make them laugh!,
Give them alone time.",How to Deal With the Emotional Impact of Aging Parents," Yes, you both may be adults and both are willing to fight it out but it just makes things worse. The older person is way more confused then you are or are just seeking attention. When people get older they feel more isolated because normally there are more younger people around them than older. Staying calm when you can sense that the atmosphere is getting ready for a fight (signs of tension). A few times you may feel this is when they think that you are not listening to them (which, trust me, is one big trigger), you are back talking to them in a rude sense, or they just want attention. In some worse cases, they cause drama to entertain their loneliness. When this does happen, stay calm;
, Smiling at them and keeping eye contact shows them that you are listening. Even if it is a forced smile, it will satisfy their attention need for them for a bit.

, Talk to them about their past. But do not let them trail off into stories that are negative. It will just lead to tension again. Ask them about how they went to school, how was their old neighborhood like, what hobbies they had when they were younger and etc...

, It will only help them appreciate you more, so they'll cut back on pestering you a lot. Plus, sometimes helping them out to do work can give you new skills or even a reward for your hard work. For example, helping your parent out in the garden to plant some vegetables, flowers or just taking out the weeds for them, it will make you both happy. You will get an awesome work out and they'll have a garden to preoccupy their mind.

, It is really hard for an old person to be in the house for more than 5 hours. They may not seem very active but depression is very active in any age. So, take them out of the house to the park or just a walk around the block. It will help clear up both of your minds.

, Hugs are one of the best medicines. Humans are made for touch. Old people who are very negatively emotional are the ones who are rarely touched. So, if they are angry or sad, sit them down or just surprise them with a tight hug. You will see an expression you've never seen before. If they resist, just hold on, but not too tight because it might hurt them. They will give in.

, Laughter is the key thing to make them see life as something enjoyable. Make them laugh, or put on a comedy show on TV for them. Laughter is another great medicine for the mind and the heart. when someone is laughing, the room's atmosphere changes into a light mood and anything seems like it is possible.

, If all else fails, distance yourself from them. They might just have pent up anger, at your or some other reason. Also, if they continuously blame you for everything, it is best to distance yourself from them. They will take advantage of you if you stick around. This can be damaging to your mental health.

If you two really do love each other for the right reasons, most people will eventually accept your relationship.",How to Deal With Being in a Relationship With an Older Guy,"

Sometimes the relationship is a superficial one, based upon the man's financial situation. This stereotype is seen often in the media, and therefore makes people immediately think that if you're with an older man, it's because of his money.
Other women prefer much older men because they are attracted to the knowledge, experience and/or wisdom that comes with those years.
Still other women prefer older men, but only if they appear to be younger than they are. This helps negate some of the ""gold digger"" comments.
Still other women choose older men because they had an unhappy or nonexistent relationship with their father, and are trying to fill that hole they feel in their lives.
Other women have a ""caretaker"" instinct that draws them to older men who genuinely care and appreciate their kindness.
Older men tend to be more grateful for their relationship with someone younger, and are somewhat less likely to cheat.;

Be responsible for your own happiness.Be self-reliant.",How to Earn Trust Back," Just because you want to rebuild trust with someone doesn’t mean she wants to participate. You must respect a person’s boundaries. It doesn’t necessarily mean that you will never have the chance, just not at the present. Test the waters before you start any process that involves another person. It takes two willing participants.You can say things like, “I know this is a difficult thing to talk about, but I’d really like to ask you if you would be willing to let me earn back your trust. I understand if it is too soon, or if you don’t ever want to see that happen. I just want to know.”
Prepare yourself for a “yes” and a “no” because it could go either way.;
, Many people react to a breach in trust by emotionally shutting down and putting up their guard. If you are the one trying to earn the trust, you will need to be open to the emotions that come with it. It won’t be easy, but it is essential. Being vulnerable can be uncomfortable, but staying open to all the emotions will deepen your ability to manage life.You can tell her, “All I’m asking you to do is be open to the idea. I don’t expect your heart to be open and ready to deal with me right now. I just need a clarification that you might consider being open.”
If she says she is open to the idea, thank her for allowing you the opportunity to make things better.

, Apologies cannot occur too quick after the incident, or too delayed. She may not be ready to hear you say, “I’m sorry” because she may view it as insincere and designed to quickly sweep your actions under the rug. Assessing if she is ready to hear it. If you wait too long you may sense additional hostility or possibly a lot of silence. You don’t want to be perceived as unapologetic, and forgetting or avoiding making an apology will never win you points.


You are the one that has to earn her trust, not the other way around. You’re right. It isn’t an even playing field, but you can earn that balance back with effort and time.
Put your ego aside and work harder than you ever have. It will be worth it to repair the damage to the relationship with your friend, loved one, or work colleague.
If you are texting or e-mailing an apology remember that your tone may come across as one-dimensional. Use additional words surrounding the “I’m sorry” for example, “I wish you could hear my voice tell you I’m sorry. You would hear that I am so sad and upset that I’ve caused things to go the way that they have. I know saying sorry isn’t enough, but please know that I am truly sorry. I would really like to know if you will accept my apology.” Awaiting the response will be hard, but once you get it you will know what to do next.

, The process of forgiveness must work its way through both parties. You will need to forgive yourself for any wrongdoing, which will allow you to release any self-hatred or shame you might have. The person who felt the brunt of a betrayal will have a hard time forgiving the person who did her wrong. Focus on the notion that forgiveness is possible and is essential to earning back trust.


Allowing yourself to forgive someone might not happen without a severe struggle.
Forgiving yourself or someone else will allow resentment to dissolve. As was once said, “Resentment is like you drinking poison expecting the other person to die.” It is damaging to your body and soul the longer you hold on to it.Do not expect anyone to “forget” what happened even if the saying is, “Forgive and forget.” Everyone needs to remember what happens to avoid making the same mistakes.

, When two people or parties have been at odds, there is a lot of ice that has formed around the relationship and needs to be broken. Collectively, everyone involved must let go of their hesitation to approach the conflict. It is that feeling of, “Okay, now that we’re all here for the right reason, let’s work this out.” This feeling of relief is like an exhale that lets everyone take the next breath and move forward.

, There’s no reason to attempt to earn back respect if you’re not sure everyone is committed. Are you serious or not? Are you just afraid to lose the relationship with the person because you view her as a possession? Are you afraid of losing and you want to win? Or worse, are you addicted to questionable behaviors such as infidelity, stealing, or eating someone’s lunch out of the company refrigerator?


Ask yourself if you are ready for the journey.
If you are trying to earn someone’s trust back ask her, “Are we both agreeing to work toward rebuilding the trust that I have damaged?” Somehow by saying it out loud you both come to a place that feels like a new start.

, You need to be able to read the signs. If you feel like you have done your due diligence and the person is not cooperating, then it may be time to move on.


You may feel extremely desperate, and may even beg the person. If you feel like you’re hitting your head against the wall, it is usually a sign that a shift needs to happen. Step back and observe the situation. It may be time to walk away, so walk.

, There are certain key qualities that are the building blocks of trust: reliability, truth, ethical practices, being sincere, keeping promises, transparency of behaviors, and acting in support of the other person’s interests. Craft all your interactions with these in mind. Do nice things that show you care. You are being observed. So be deliberate in your actions, and point out when you have demonstrated the aforementioned qualities.Let the other person know that you are living up to expectations.


If the betrayal has to do with lying about where you went, then be truthful and tell the person where you are going. Check in with her via text or call her to let her know you are where you said you would be.
You have nothing to hide, unless you do have something to hide. If you do, then stop fooling yourself and the other person.

, When it comes to human behavior, changing it can be very time consuming. The degree of hurt that was inflicted by you or the other person, can affect the length of time it takes to see improvement. It varies from person to person. Wait it out because it will be worth it.


Patience is a virtue. And a virtue is behavior that demonstrates a high standard of integrity, honor, decency, morals and respectability.
If you feel frustration building inside you, take a moment before you react negatively and tell yourself, “It took me a lifetime to get me to this point; so making a change is going to take time.”
Participate in activities that require patience such as, painting, assembling puzzles, or making furniture. You will understand and experience the rewards for being patient.

, Humans have a tendency to look for patterns in visual objects and behavior.Essentially, when you are earning someone’s trust back, you are diligently creating a pattern for the other person to observe. If she sees a consistent pattern of behaviors that are in line with her needs and wants, then trust builds.


Demonstrate consistent behaviors by showing up on time, responding to texts and phone calls in a respectable and timely fashion, and making good on promises.
Avoid demonstrating a pattern of negative behavior. If those behaviors are not congruent with her needs and wants, a pattern of mistrust will build. For example, if you make promises or commitments and don’t follow through, it will deteriorate any progress you have made.

, Out of respect for everyone involved, don’t play dumb when it comes to taking responsibility for your behavior. During a time of scrutiny, and self-analysis, it is your time to shine and show the world that you are intelligent and in command of your behaviors. Things don’t “just happen.” They happen because you made choices that you might not be proud of, but you did participate. Being smart and learning from your mistakes is part of the human experience. You are human.


You might feel over-observed and reported upon as if you were part of a naturalistic observation experiment gone bad.You might feel under the microscope, but that’s how it’s going to be for a while until it improves.
You can find a smart and creative way to stick up for yourself and your values. For example if she says something that questions your character you can say, “I know you are upset and I know I have a lot to do with that; and I hope you know that I didn’t run away from this situation because that’s not who I am. I stayed and took responsibility and I’m trying to make things better.”

, It might get tiring or challenging in ways you never knew, but showing up and giving 100% of your attention to the cause will move everything in the right direction. People are impressed by those who pay attention to the details, are attentive, openly communicate and follow through on their intentions.If you and the person attend a party together, stay by her side. This will show her you want to be with her. If your friends approach and ask you to go with them tell them, “I will catch up with you later.”
If the person is having trouble with a project at home, go to her and see if you can help.
If she needs someone to go with her to visit someone in the hospital, or take her car in to be serviced, offer to go with her.

, You may feel like you’re putting the work in and things are going well. In the back of your mind you might wonder if everything will work out. This is normal and it shouldn't stop you from being optimistic about your relationship. It is realistic to entertain these doubts as long as you don’t let them drag you down.


If you are feeling down or uncertain tell yourself, “I’m going to focus on the positive. I’m going to do whatever I can to make this work out.”
If you feel yourself doubting the future, distract yourself with something positive. For example, find a picture that reminds you of the great time you have with the other person.

, Once you have been through the experience of earning someone’s trust back, you will understand what it takes. In the event someone in your life betrays you, you will have a new level of compassion and understanding. You are forever changed by your experience.


For example, a friend crashes your car and doesn’t pay for the damage. When he comes to you months later to apologize for the mistake, give him a second chance.
If someone asks for your forgiveness after making a mistake, consider accepting it. Communicate the conditions of you acceptance to ensure the person knows that he needs to earn back your trust.

, If you need help changing the behaviors that continue to get you in trouble, there are psychologists and psychiatrists available in your local area and can be located through the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association.

, If you or the other person tries to let something go and it continues to eat at either of you, then you likely need to process residual feelings. This may include talking with the person, reiterating your desires to rebuild trust, and assuring her that you will do what ever it takes to make things better.


It can be upsetting if someone tells you to, “just let it go” if you haven’t reached a level of resolve about the matter. Take a deep breath and say, “I’m working on letting it go, but I’m not there yet.”

, As time passes and progress if made, you may notice the other person holds the issue over your head. She brings up the betrayal in an argument or discussion. Perhaps she isn’t over the hurt and still has work to do to forgive you.


Calmly bring it up and say, “It sounds like you are not fully ready to forgive me. I think we both have worked really hard to get where we are. What else can I do to help you get to a point where you don’t have to bring this up? If more apologies will help, I’m ready to do that. If you think I don’t understand the depth of the hurt that I did to you, then help me out and tell me. I’ll do whatever it takes because when you bring it up it makes me believe that you’re still hurt, and I don’t want that.”
If you refuse to hold a grudge against her for her reactions, it will help you remain open for positive improvements.Remember, you would appreciate the same respect.

, Celebrating the smallest of improvements will breathe life back into the situation. Everyone benefits from recognition for a job well done. If she begrudges the idea, tell her you are celebrating because you both committed to work together through the journey and that alone deserves a celebration.

, Whether you have to sever ties for yourself, or if someone severs ties with you, there’s no reason why two parties should continue to betray each other. If you continually find yourself in the same cycle of betrayal-forgive-rebuild-betrayal, it is time to stop the madness.


Don’t waste your time or someone else’s. Life is short so surround yourself with people who bring you joy and satisfaction. Trickery and betrayal are not virtues anyone will admire. Accepting the truth can be the first step toward real change. It’s up to you to create the fulfilling life that you've always wanted. It is possible.

, Happiness is an inside job and you are responsible to create it. It is easier to face difficult situations if you are filled with good vibes. A happier you will always make any relationship better.


You know what makes you happy, so participate in activities that will build a reservoir of positive feelings. For example, if you love the way live music makes you feel then attend concerts at small clubs and large venues.
Listen to new music to expand your knowledge.
If you love being outdoors, join a hiking group in your local area. Communing with nature is restorative.

Understand that autism makes a person unique.",How to Deal with an Autistic Spouse," Yes, your spouse is autistic - but that doesn't mean they're incapable of doing anything at all. While autism can cause notable difficulties with certain aspects of life (such as communication or executive function), autistic people are not toddlers or ""trapped in their own world"" and are capable of doing things such as holding down jobs and taking care of themselves. Just because some aspects of your spouse's life may be harder for them doesn't mean that you need to help them with everything. It's best to communicate directly with them about what they need help with, rather than ""helping"" without asking.


It's okay to offer help to your spouse if you think that there's a need for it, but just offering them help for no reason may come across as patronizing or rude. For example, ""You look stressed out by the noise - do you want me to take over so you can go somewhere quieter?"" is different than ""Do you want me to take over?"" with no real justification for it.
Your spouse is just as capable as they were before you knew they were autistic. Receiving an autism diagnosis doesn't reduce their abilities.;
, While your spouse's capabilities aren't necessarily limited, their autism may make them different from you in several ways. (These ways aren't ""bad"" or ""wrong"" - many of them are present in non-autistic people, as well.) Certain aspects of how your spouse perceives the world will be different because they're autistic. It's important to remember that this is normal for autistic people, and that your spouse isn't ""weird"" or ""misbehaving"". Seek to understand their behaviors, rather than change or reject. This will help strengthen your relationship.


Your spouse may not be as social as you are. Even if they are extroverted, they may need time away from social situations and require alone time. Focusing on what a person is saying, their tone and their body language, as well as dealing with other external factors (such as loud environments, flashing lights, etc.), can be exhausting for an autistic person.
Verbal communication may not be their preferred way of communication. Some autistic people require AAC of some sort, whether because they can't reliably verbally communicate, or because they lose the ability to speak when overwhelmed.
Eye contact is a common issue for autistic people; your spouse may either make too much or too little eye contact with others, and may be uncomfortable with eye contact. Autistic body language, which includes eye contact, is often different than the body language of non-autistics.
Speech processing may be difficult for your spouse, and they may be a literal thinker and not realize that someone is using sarcasm or making a joke.
Following rigid routines will be part of your spouse's life, and they may become distressed if these routines are interrupted. Autistic people can be spontaneous, but many prefer their routines.
Your spouse will stim, and sensory needs will be a consideration for everything they do. They may be hyposensitive and need extra stimulation, or they may be hypersensitive and require stimulation to be at a minimum. Sensory overload may also be a part of their life if they have trouble managing their sensory needs.

, Your spouse isn't suddenly a different person just because you know they're autistic, but they likely have some different needs than you do, and you may not be aware of all of them. Take some time to have a discussion with your spouse; ask them what they need from you, what their boundaries are, and if they have any specific sensory requirements that you weren't aware of. Your spouse may need things or require boundaries that you were unaware of; knowing about these will help to strengthen your relationship.


Try to get into the specifics, if your spouse wants to discuss them. You may already know that your spouse dislikes extremely flavorful food, but you may not know that the reason they don't eat certain types of food is because of the texture. The specifics can be a huge help when it comes to understanding and helping your spouse.
Be willing to make accommodations for your spouse. If they need a quiet spot in the house, let them make one (and help them, if you can). If they want spicier food than you do, and you do the cooking, be willing to give them ingredients that they can put on their food to make it spicier. You don't have to do everything for them, but at least be willing to help them get what they need to make themselves happy.
Make sure you have boundaries set for yourself, too. A healthy relationship has some boundaries on both sides of it.

, While being openly autistic is your spouse's personal choice, it's important for you to know whether your spouse is openly autistic, too. This is an option for your spouse that presents benefits as well as drawbacks, so let them decide. Then, when they decide, make sure you're aware, so that you know whether or not you can talk about their autism to others.


Unfortunately, autism is highly stigmatized, and some people will discriminate against your spouse if they know your spouse is autistic. It's possible that some of your spouse's family may even discriminate against your spouse. Be careful who you tell, if your spouse is okay with you telling.
If your spouse is not openly autistic, ask them before telling others that they're autistic. Blurting out that they're autistic is not a good idea.
You don't need to tell everyone that your spouse is autistic - to unconcerned strangers, they're your spouse, not your ""autistic spouse"". Chances are, if you're not autistic, you probably don't go around saying ""I'm not autistic"" when the situation doesn't call for it.

, Autistic people may have unusual fascinations with certain subjects, no matter how obscure, and can spend much of their time learning about these subjects. They may also have talents that they're extremely good at, which can range from the stereotypical math or science interests, to language or arts. Make your spouse aware of these, as these interests and talents will successfully increase their self-esteem and self-concept. Let them engage in ""infodumps"" about their special interests, too - you may learn many new things about your spouse's fascinations!


If you can encourage your spouse's special interests in a way that actively engages them with that interest, do it! For example, if your spouse has a special interest in cooking, help them to research recipes that they'll enjoy making, or buy them cookbooks.
Let your spouse have time to focus intently on things, whether or not those things are special interests. Deeply focusing can give your spouse time to unwind a bit.

, Stimming, which is often referred to as ""repetitive, stereotyped behaviors"" in medical jargon, is a behavior (such as hand-flapping, hair-playing, rocking, chewing, or making sounds) that helps autistic people regulate internal processes such as emotions and sensory feedback.Your spouse will most likely stim, and that's okay. While stimming may seem like signs of boredom, it actually helps many autistic people function in ways like focusing or expressing emotions.Stimming serves an important purpose in autistic people, so just because your spouse looks a little strange while hopping up and down doesn't mean that you should stop them.


Stimming should not be changed unless it causes harm to someone or something (your spouse included), or is inappropriate for the situation. Your spouse flapping their hands in public is not harmful or inappropriate, but using echolalia at the workplace could be a distraction to their coworkers, and a discreet, quieter stim would be better for the workplace without your spouse having to stop stimming.

Never physically restrain your spouse from stimming or tell them they can only stim in private. Even if your spouse's stim is harmful, don't grab them or shout at them to stop. Instead, gently ask them what they need, and help them to get what they need. (Self-injurious stims, for example, are often used to communicate distress or sensory overload, while destroying objects can indicate a need for sensory cravings.)

, Adapting to a neurotypical world can be difficult for autistic people, and it may take a toll on their self-esteem, especially since autism can be associated with what are perceived to be emotional and behavioral issues. In addition, autistic people may have mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety that make it even more important for them to be emotionally supported. Validate your spouse's feelings and make sure they understand that you're there for them. While your spouse may not know how to show it, they'll appreciate it.


You don't have to be available to your spouse at every possible moment, but if you can't listen to them at that moment, set up a time to talk later. For example: ""I'm really sorry you're having a rough day. I'm more than happy to hear about it later, but I can't listen right now - there's a scheduled conference call today for work, and it's in five minutes. The call should be done in an hour. I promise you can talk to me then."" Then follow up on it.
Make sure you have emotional support for yourself, too, especially if your spouse has a mental illness. Your spouse may be able to support you, but make sure you have friends and/or family that you can rely on for yourself, too.

, Autistic people are often considered ""socially clueless"", and may not have much understanding of how to interact in social situations. In addition, certain speech patterns or behaviors may cause their communication to be misinterpreted. They may feel awkward or confused during social interaction, and it helps to know that you have their back. However, be patient; learning about social interaction and everything associated with it (such as body language, tone of voice, facial expressions, and so forth) isn't an overnight process.


If your spouse says something that comes off as impolite or hurtful, pull them aside and let them know. Most autistic people don't intend to be hurtful, and will apologize and feel remorse when they discover that they've hurt somebody's feelings.
Your spouse is capable of learning what's considered socially unacceptable behavior (such as saying obviously mean things or refusing to apologize for hurting others' feelings). Being autistic is not an excuse to be intentionally rude.

, Rigid routines, stims, avoiding certain situations, and so forth have been developed by your spouse for a reason. Forcing your spouse to break their routines, change their stims, or engage in situations they want to avoid will not make them any less autistic or teach them how to act neurotypical - at best, they'll just be upset and worn out, and at worst, they may have a meltdown or shutdown, or be driven into sensory overload. Let your spouse make the choice to try new things or break out of their comfort zone - it's not okay to force anyone, autistic or not, into a situation they don't want to be in.


The only time you should encourage your spouse to change something is if what they're doing is causing harm. Harmful stims, for example, are something that should be changed to avoid causing injury to your spouse or to others, and poor nutrition caused by sensory issues should be addressed to ensure that your spouse stays healthy.

, Self-help and self-advocacy resources can be hard to find for an autistic person, as many resources are aimed at parents of autistic children. However, resources for your spouse are out there if you know where to look. The Autism Self Advocacy Network, for example, has resources for autistic people, and wikiHow's articles cover a wide range of autism self-help topics (including parenting while autistic!). In addition, helping your spouse find a support group or a therapist for any emotional support can have great effects, and finding disability services and accommodations can help your spouse with the hustle and bustle of daily life.


You can be a resource for your spouse, too. Taking care of chores that your spouse can't handle (e.g. vacuuming or using chemical cleaners) and encouraging them to find ways to remind themselves to do self-care tasks can be a great help.

, Autistic people are different from non-autistic people in many ways; none of these differences are ""bad"", because all of them help shape your spouse into who they are. Unless something your spouse is doing is causing harm to themselves or others, there's nothing wrong with what they're doing. It's okay for your spouse to be who they are, and it's important for you to show them love and support with all the ups and downs that come with being autistic.

, With the increasing amount of autism diagnoses these days, you probably have heard of autism and believe that you have some idea of what it is. However, if what you know about autism comes from non-autistic people or the media, your knowledge may be incorrect. Autism is:


A lifelong neurological disability.
Different for everybody. Some may be hypersensitive to certain sensory stimulation, while others are hyposensitive and can require a lot of sensory input. Some struggle with executive dysfunction or speech problems; others don't. The signs of autism are varied among people.
Part of what shapes an autistic person's personality and lifestyle. Autistic people have notable differences from non-autistic people, which help to form the autistic person's personality (just like a non-autistic's personal likes and dislikes would form their personality).
Suspected to be genetic.While being autistic may not always ""run in the family"", there does seem to be a genetic aspect that comes into play.
A disability that was formerly divided into multiple diagnoses. Prior to the DSM-V's release, there were multiple ""types"" of autism, such as ""classic"" autism, Asperger Syndrome, and PDD-NOS. With the release of the DSM-V, the diagnoses were ""compressed"" into Autism Spectrum Disorder, as the distinctions between them were unclear. However, not everybody has stopped using Asperger Syndrome as a diagnosis, so you may hear some people talking about being diagnosed with Asperger's or calling themselves ""aspies"".

, If you received most of your information about autism from non-autistic people or the media, you might have some information incorrect. Additionally, some non-autistic people will spread rumors about autistic people that causes autism to be viewed in a negative light. When looking to understand autism, make sure you understand that autism is not:


A lack of empathy. While some autistic people can suffer from a blunted empathy response due to alexithymia,plenty of autistic people are perfectly capable of empathy, and often actually feel things very deeply.Alexithymia can cause an autistic person to have trouble identifying emotions(and therefore, sometimes not notice when someone is upset), but they aren't ignoring anyone's emotions on purpose.
Curable. Autism is a lifelong condition.Your spouse's autism will not ""go away"".
A destroyer of families. There are plenty of happy families in which the children or the parents (or even both!) are autistic.
A sentence to eternal sadness. Autistic people are capable of being happy and autistic at the same time.
Caused by vaccines. There is a common misconception that autism is caused by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which was based on fraudulent evidenceand has been discredited many times.Anti-vaccination logic has also caused outbreaks of diseases that had become almost eradicated.A mental illness. Autism is a disability, but it's not a mental illness. Autistic people can be mentally ill as well as autistic, however.Correlated to an increased risk of violence. While it's possible for autistic people to get violent, just like any other person, there is no conclusive evidence that autistic people are more likely than the general population to become violent.If an autistic person is acting aggressive, they're doing it because something is wrong,and this aggression is not premeditated., Autistic people may have lopsided development of certain skills, but they're not incapable of doing anything. An autistic person will become more capable of performing skills as they get older, whether it's with speaking, socializing, self-care, or so forth. Don't think autistic people will ""never"" do something just because they're autistic; the only way to know if they'll be able to do it is to watch them learn at their own pace.

, There are many things you can pick from to read about autism, whether it's medical documents or illustrated books or wikiHow articles. Finding sources that explain what autism is can help you to understand the more technical side of your spouse's needs and behaviors.

, While writing about disability can be tough, sources that are aimed at autistic people have a much different tone than sources that are aimed at non-autistics. Autistic-friendly sources don't necessarily have to be written by Autistic people in order to be helpful, but Autistic people are the ones who are directly affected, so their views should be the main ones you're seeing. Generally, an Autistic-friendly source will:


Use identity-first language (e.g. ""autistic person"", rather than ""person with autism"")
Involve the Autistic community and actively encourage them to share their voices; non-autistics will not speak ""in place"" of Autistics
Acknowledge that autistic children will grow into autistic adults, and that autism doesn't ""go away"" as a person agesRecognize that autistic people are not just nonverbal white male children (and acknowledge that diagnosis is often harder for femalesand people of color)
Use the color red (for #RedInstead), or use a rainbow
Not use a puzzle piece, ""Light It Up Blue"", the color blue, or anything that is associated with Autism SpeaksNot talk about ""curing"" autism, as many Autistic people don't want a ""cure"", Discussing disability can be hard for non-disabled people, since the meaning of words can easily change over time, and what you thought was the proper term may not actually be the proper term. Looking for information about what the Autistic community prefers to hear will help you know how to refer to autistic people (as well as other people with different disabilities, in some cases) respectfully.


Using the phrase ""autistic person"" is preferred due to the connotations that comes with saying ""person with autism""; the latter implies that someone's autism isn't a part of them and can be ""removed"", as well as imply that autism is bad or some sort of disease.Some people do prefer to be referred to as a ""person with autism"", but unless you know for absolute certain that the person (whether or not they're your spouse) prefers this, stick with ""autistic person"".

Jim Sinclair, the Autistic coordinator of the Autism Network International, has an explanation as to why person-first language is disliked by the Autistic community. In addition, many bloggers who are either Autistic or connected to the Autistic community have expressed why identity-first language is so important.Autistic people (like other disabled people) are not ""slow"", ""ret*rded"", ""handicapped"", ""suffering from"" autism, or ""a victim of"" autism.Additionally, using ""cutesy"" terms for disability (such as ""diffability"" or ""specially abled"") is disliked by most people with disabilities, who argue that saying ""disabled"" should not be something to avoid.Drop the ""high-functioning"" and ""low-functioning"" labels. Autistic people have pointed out that with either functioning label, autistic people are dismissed; a ""high-functioning"" autistic person is too ""high-functioning"" to have their needs acknowledged, and a ""low-functioning"" autistic person is too ""low-functioning"" to have their abilities acknowledged.Additionally, these two labels are impossible to define,since autistic people all have good and bad days, as well as strengths and weaknesses.

, The best way to understand your spouse is to directly experience how autistic people live everyday life. Reading blogs and books, looking through the #ActuallyAutistic tag on social media, experiencing Autism Acceptance events, and generally hearing what Autistic people have to say will help you to view your spouse's autism a little differently - and will also open up a gateway to help you see how Autistic people view the world.


There are many autistic bloggers and writers, such as Amy Sequenzia, Emma Zurcher-Long, Lydia Brown, Cynthia Kim, and Ibby Grace. Reading what Autistic people write about their lives can help you to understand the viewpoint of your spouse and the Autistic community.
On social media, the tag #AskAnAutistic is a good resource for those who want advice from Autistic people about autism.
Unfortunately, Autistic culture does involve painful subjects from time to time, such as discussing the abuse, torture, or murders of disabled people. It's okay to not read about these things if you feel you'll be shaken up by it, but disability is not all sunshine and rainbows, and the Autistic community will acknowledge this.
The difference between an autistic person and an Autistic person is that an autistic person has been diagnosed as autistic, while an Autistic person accepts their autism as part of their identity and is part of Autistic culture.

, If there are none available to you where you live, look online for an interactive support group. These include ASD Vacations LLC, Autisable.com, AutismAsperger.net and TheAutSpot.



Avoid Autism Speaks. Autism Speaks is hateful towards autistic people, supports anti-autism eugenics, and excludes all autistic people from working with them.Autism Speaks (also called Autism $peaks or A$) has been described by autistic people to be a hate group disguised as an organization.Instead of supporting groups that support Autism Awareness, support groups that participate in Autism Acceptance, a movement that aims to work on raising acceptance of autism, rather than trying to stamp it out or look for a ""cure"".The Autism Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) and Autism Women's Network are run by Autistic people and support Autism Acceptance.

, Just like everything else in the world, there's plenty of misinformation about autism - some of which is spread without malicious intent, but some of which is intended to harm autistic people. Autistic-friendly sources will often point out places to avoid, and there are no hard-and-fast rules as to whether a source is automatically good or bad, but there are general agreements on what to avoid from the Autistic community. Keep the following in mind when looking for sources and information about autism.


Avoid looking at anything posted by Autism Speaks. As mentioned above, Autism Speaks has been described as a hate group, and has also been a massive contributor to silencing the voices of Autistic peopleand spreading misinformation(such as the MMR vaccine myth).
Don't trust sources that portray autism as a tragedy or disease, autistic people as burdens, sources that try to justify causing harm (or even committing murder) towards a disabled person, or support abusive ""therapies"" for people with disabilities. Disabled people are people, too, and they can understand when people say that they're burdens or not worth helping.
Remember the phrase ""Nothing about us without us is for us"". If the source of the information is coming from non-autistics or someone who does not have any connection to the Autistic community in some way, find a second opinion from the Autistic community.
Disability is not an insult, and a website using any disability as an insult is not reputable.

, Being autistic is different for everyone, and it shapes lives in distinct ways. Every autistic person is different, special, and worth having around. Be tolerant; autistic people are capable of being loved, and have many good things to contribute to the world, just like non-autistic people. Supporting an autistic person shows them - and you - that it's okay to be different.

Be clear about any problems as they happen.,
Recognize that she might get sick more often.,
Run interference in social situations.,
Recognize that social progress takes time.,
Recognize that you'll be introduced to her world: including how hostile it can be.",How to Deal with an Autistic Girlfriend2," Issues such as executive dysfunction, motor skill issues, social differences, sensory overload, and more can make life difficult. Your girlfriend may want comfort, or she may want to be alone.

, Autistic people may worry that their needs are burdensome or not cared about, and be afraid to speak up when there is a problem. You can help by listening to her, accommodating her needs, and asking if something is wrong if she looks upset.

, Your girlfriend might not be good at ""reading between the lines"" and recognizing when you're upset. It's helpful to use your words and explain to her what is wrong. For example...


""I'm feeling really stressed because of this report I have due. I'd like to be left alone to work for a while.""
""When you teased me about my bald spot, I felt upset. It's kind of a sore spot for me. Please don't tease me about it.""
""I know you mean well, but I'm not really looking for advice right now. I just need to vent.""

, Anxiety, depression, and stomach issues may co-occur with autism. She may also have severe sensory overload at times (which can look a lot like being sick). Ask her how you can help her (helping with tasks, giving her space, just hanging out) and follow through. She'll appreciate it.

, Your girlfriend won't always understand how to act, and you can help by clarifying her intentions to others or gently nudging her onto the right track. Tackle social gatherings as a team, and help her feel wanted and included.

, Your girlfriend will have some trouble with social skills, and this won't disappear anytime soon. Let her work at her own pace, and don't push her too hard. She is doing her best.

, Autistic people are more likely to be bullied and disliked by their peers, and you may witness some ugly behavior or even receive a little for dating her. If you love her, remind yourself that it's worth it: you're here for her, not for others' opinions.

Let her support you.,
Open up to her.,
Experience the world through her eyes.",How to Deal with an Autistic Girlfriend3," Listening is an important part of a healthy relationship, especially if her mind works a little differently than yours does. Listen to how she feels, what her dreams are, and how she sees the world.

, Too much activity can overwhelm an autistic person, making it difficult for her to focus on your conversation. Try letting her choose the setting, or searching for the most peaceful place around.

, Every woman wants to feel appreciated and wanted. Notice her quirks and compliment her. Even something as simple as ""Good morning, beautiful"" could make her day.

, Your girlfriend is most likely an introvert, and she'll need alone time to recharge so she can have the energy to spend time with you.


She may need time to rest or stim after a difficult situation, such as a noisy building or family gathering.
There may be certain things she cannot handle, such as hugs from behind or kiss marks on her cheek (which she might wipe off—it's nothing against you personally!).

, Just as autistic people's behavior may be puzzling to you, non-autistic behavior can be puzzling to her! Offer your services as a translator when needed, and answer her questions about what the non-autistic people are trying to say.

, Passions hold a special place in an autistic person's heart, so find ways to support and share hers. See if her special interest overlaps with things you like, and share them together.

, Your girlfriend may not always understand social nuances, so she might do things that are socially inappropriate without realizing it. Talk to her if she came off as rude or cold; she probably didn't know what she was expected to do.


Talk to her gently, under the assumption that she didn't know what she did wrong. Many times autistic people don't realize that they've committed a social offence.

, Your girlfriend has plenty of strengths of her own. It's okay to be vulnerable, and to lean on her when you're struggling. Let her show you how much she cares.


In general, autistic people tend to be fair, logical, nonjudgmental, compassionate, and capable of thinking outside the box. Your girlfriend may be a fantastic problem solver.

, Let her see you at your best, your worst, and your silliest. Relationships work best when communication is open, and each partner feels comfortable sharing their truest self. Embrace your quirks just as you've embraced hers.

, Your girlfriend has a unique perspective, and as you spend more and more time with her, you'll experience her life. Work on listening, understanding, and trying things her way. You might be surprised at what you discover.

Prepare what you want to say.,
Pick a good time to talk.,
Maintain a positive attitude while talking.,
Figure out what is really going on.,
Be honest.,
Be respectful and ask for it in return.,
Be open.",How to Deal With a Difficult Spouse1," Write down your concerns so you can communicate them to your spouse. This will help identify specific behaviors, feelings and solutions. If you believe there is a problem, include a possible solution.


Write down your thoughts. It will be helpful to get it all out on paper. Writing down your thoughts is therapeutic and will help organize your emotions in a way that promotes stress reduction.Practice saying your concerns out loud. Don’t worry about being perfect. If it is from your heart, that is what matters.When you talk to someone who may overpower you with their negativity, being prepared is a good way to combat the urge to be negative as well.;
, Avoid early morning conversations when you or your spouse might be grumpy; and try not to talk immediately when you get home from work. Relax and settle down before you approach. If you’ve been feeling the brunt of his negativity, you probably know what time will hold the most promise for a positive outcome.


Talking in public places might be beneficial. The person is less likely to get upset for fear of being embarrassed.
Align as many positive things as you can to set the stage for positive communication. Perhaps you could go somewhere that you both enjoy, or you could stay at home and have a great dinner.

, Express your optimism about working together to find a solution. This is your chance to make a difference in your relationship. It is your time to speak and be heard. Don’t let your spouse deter you from your goal of having a good, problem-solving conversation. You’re on a mission to be heard so focus on what’s important: creating a change for the better.Approach the subject positively by saying something like, “I really appreciate the things you do for me and I really want you to be happy. I get the feeling you’re not happy with me based on some of the things you say.” This will start things off.
If his first response is negative, try to stop him by saying, “I want to talk about this peacefully because I’m concerned about it; and if we need to change something, then we need to listen to each other.” Diffuse his response with calm, focused discussion.
If he can’t respond without getting aggressive or agitated, then simply say, “Maybe we can talk about this later.” If he is absolute in his demeanor then you have got a more serious problem on your hands. Don’t put yourself in harm’s way. Do what you can to get to a safe place.
He may respond with an open ear and show you his genuine concern. This is your opportunity to let him know how you feel about being criticized. Don’t be afraid to tell him that it hurts your feelings and makes you concerned about your relationship and its future.
Keep telling him that you love him and show your support for what he has to say.

, If you know that you haven’t been doing anything that would constitute your spouse’s negative responses, then it’s time to roll up your sleeves and get to work. This is the perfect opportunity to practice your problem solving skills.If a person is always complaining or being critical about most things in life it may be due to something that happened to him earlier in life. There could be an event or a tragedy in a person’s life that makes him behave this way.You may find out that he is very unhappy with his job or with an unrelated issue that has nothing to do with you. If he thinks his life is bad because of these things, he might be taking it out on you.
He may be resenting you for not being perfect. You need to remind him that you aren’t perfect, you weren’t when you met, probably never will be, and neither is he.
Insecurities about job performance, financial independence, and physical performance can all contribute to a person’s constant complaining and negativity.Depression may be at the root of the problem and needs to be dealt with accordingly.
He might feel the world is against him and you are part of it. You need to separate yourself from that association and reassure him that you are on his side.

, Lead by example by speaking your truth. This does not mean you have to be brutally honest and hurt the person’s feelings. Use your words carefully and keep in mind that you are trying to solve problem that will improve your communication.

, Respect is earned. If you act in a respectful manner it will set the stage for being respected in return. If you feel you are not being respected, tell the person, “I want us to be respectful to each other. I’m willing to do that, are you?”

, It takes courage to be vulnerable. Opening your heart to the possibility of improvement is essential. You may have a fear of getting hurt, but that is a risk worth taking. Once you experience the reward of being open, it will become easier.

Sit down for a one on one conversation.,
Provide specific examples of your partner’s behavior.,
Use “I” statements.,
Listen to what your partner has to say.,
Come to an agreement on what will change moving forward.",How to Deal with a Partner Who Emotionally Withholds1," The most actionable way to address your partner’s emotional withholding is to ask them to have a one on one conversation with you about the issue. Suggest having a talk in a neutral place where you will not be disturbed. If you live together, you may choose to have the talk at the kitchen table or in the living room. If you live in separate spaces, you may suggest a bench in a park or a local coffee shop that is quiet.Choosing a neutral spot where you can discuss the issue privately will allow both of you to feel comfortable and be honest about how you are feeling. This is especially important when you are trying to talk to your partner about a subject that may upset or unsettle them, at least at first.
You may say to your partner, ""I need to talk to you about something important. I am finding it hard to connect with you emotionally and wonder if we could try to talk this issue out together."";
, Start the talk by telling your partner that you feel like they have been acting withdrawn and not sharing their emotions with you. You could then mention specific examples of moments recently or in the past where you feel your partner was emotionally withholding from you.Try to be specific and speak clearly when you bring up these examples. Do not try to pass judgment or accuse your partner. Instead, simply relay your experience in your words so they know where you are coming from.
For example, you may say, ""I feel invalidated when you do not respond to my story about work."" Or, ""I feel angry when you do not answer my questions about how you feel."" Or, ""I feel disconnected from you when you don't answer my questions about your feelings.""

, When you speak to your partner, you should get in the habit of using “I” statements so you can be accountable for your thoughts and reactions. Using “I” statements can help you avoid blaming your partner or making assumptions about how your partner is feeling.For example, you may say, “I feel you are emotionally withholding from me and it bothers me” or “I feel we are not communicating our feelings as much as we could be and I would like us to try to figure out why that is.”
Try to be accepting and non-judgmental when you speak with your partner as well.

, Once you have expressed your feelings to your partner, you should listen to what they have to say in response. Because your partner is emotionally withholding, they may struggle to express themselves. Be patient and encourage them to speak to you about how they are feeling. Tell them that you are here to listen and want your relationship to be about sharing thoughts and feelings, rather than holding back.For example, you may tell your partner, “I know it’s hard for you to express your feelings and open up. But I want you to know I am here for you and ready to listen. I want you to feel you can talk to me and be honest about how you’re feeling.”

, Though it may be difficult to talk to your partner about this subject, tackling it head on can lead to a better relationship moving forward. You and your partner should try to come to an agreement on how they will be more emotionally open with you. You may both need to agree verbally to make some adjustments to your behavior and work on being more open with each other.For example, you may say to your partner, “Can we agree to be more honest with each other and share our feelings more often?” or “Can you agree to be more emotionally open with me going forward?”

Be open and honest about what you're doing.,
Tell a story that reveals you date more than one guy at a time.,
Note that guys have different ideas about what makes a relationship exclusive.,
Think about how far you want to go with one guy before you decide to date him exclusively.,
Make your opinions known.",How to Date More Than One Guy at a Time (for Women)1," If you feel there is nothing wrong with dating more than one person at a time, there's no reason to hide it. It's good to bring it up, though, because people have different perspectives on dating. Some guys might think it's only okay to date one person at a time (even if you haven't committed to being in an exclusive relationship yet) and may assume you feel the same way.;
, Example: ""One time I was on a date with a guy, we'd been seeing each other for about a month, and we bumped into another guy I'd gone on a date with a week earlier, and that was really awkward. One of them got really mad at me, because I guess he thought I was dating only him, but how was I supposed to know we were exclusive?"" How does your date respond? If he disagrees with you, or acts horrified, then you'll know he's not okay with being one among many dates.

, Ideally, a guy will ask you if he can be your one and only, and that can be the official day you become a couple, but in adult life, things don't always work out that way. So if you're not sure if he thinks you're exclusive, ask him: ""When you're dating someone, how do you know when you've made the jump from just dating, to being in an exclusive relationship?""

, Some women consider it fair game to date as many men as they want, as long as they're all first dates, but when they decide they like a guy enough to go on a second date, they stop seeing other people so they can focus on that one guy. For other women, the third or fifth date could be where they draw the line. Some women also have rules around how physically intimate they are with someone (e.g. kiss as many guys as you want, but once you start having sex with a guy, have sex only with that guy).

, In the age of Internet profiles, this is pretty easy. If you and your date know each other online, write a sentence on your dating profile like ""I'm okay with a guy going on dates with other women while going on dates with me, but when things get sexual, I think they should be exclusive, and I offer the same consideration in return."" You can also post a blog (on MySpace, Facebook, or anywhere that you know a person you're dating will read it) that expresses your views on this topic. But, the most foolproof way to get your opinion across is to say it.

Create a new ""normal.""",How to Deal With a Loved One Going to Jail," If you try to think about all the years ahead without the person you love in your life, you'll likely get overwhelmed. Instead, take it moment by moment, dealing with what each day brings you.If you have trouble staying in the moment, you can try a mindfulness technique. For instance, while you're in the shower, try really paying attention to what you're doing. Don't let your mind wander to what's going on later in the day; instead, pay attention to how the soap feels on your skin, the way the hot water relaxes your muscles, and the scent of soap in the air. Focus your attention on the sensations you're feeling, not what's going through your head.;
, This advice may seem contrary to the last step. However, you can still stay in the moment while knowing that what comes ahead may be difficult. For instance, you may begin to lose certain relationships because your loved one is in jail. People may not be as forgiving as you'd like them to be.Of course, it will hurt, but if you lose friends, know that you will probably also gain friends who are going through the same thing. In addition, you know the people who stick around will see you through thick and thin., If the person you loved provided part of the income for your household, you're going to need to get a new plan. You may need to get a second job or even move. Take a careful look at your budget to see what is necessary for you to survive.Include the extra costs of supporting your loved one in jail. Jail can be expensive for those on the outside. From making phone calls to buying items at the commissary, your loved one will need money to help her while she's inside. However, those costs can add up quickly, as even adding money to an account comes with fees.Therefore, set a budget of how much you think you can reasonably spend on the person per month, and stick to it. If you don't think it's enough, see if anyone else in the family is willing to help out.You're also not going to have their support around the house, so you may find yourself with extra housework. Don't be afraid to ask family members for support when you need it., This process is a grieving process. You're losing someone important in your life, and it's important to grieve that person. Nonetheless, don't forget you need to still take care of yourself. Try to sleep on a regular schedule, and eat healthy meals to keep you going., Most jails limit how often you can visit. In addition, the place where your loved one is held may not be as close as you would like. Therefore, you must decide how often you will be able to visit, so you and your loved one will know what to expect.You can also let the person know when you'll be able to email or write., It can be difficult to decide how much to tell other people. The truth is probably best, since some people may find out from police blotters or the newspaper. However, if you're not comfortable with that, you can say you separated or that he or she had to move away. Just be consistent in what you say.


Also, make a decision about who you want to tell. Maybe you want to keep it just in the family, or maybe you feel like you should tell certain close friends. It's better to decide upfront who will be informed.

, It's important to tell your children the truth when your spouse lands in jail, if that's the position you're in. If you don't and they find out the truth, they will feel you betrayed their trust. Be direct, and try to answer any questions they may have. Also, give them a script for what to say to people outside of the family. For instance, they could say ""He's away,"" or ""She's in jail,"" depending on what you decide.In addition, if you decide you want your kids to visit the person in jail, make sure to go first without them. That way, you can tell them what is going to happen when they get there and help calm down some of their fears., If possible, contact the jail so you know what to expect. For instance, you'll likely be subjected to search. In addition, some jails only allow video conferencing, so you may not be able to actually hug the person. Most jails minimize physical contact, limiting it to a short hug at most. Knowing what to expect can take some of the tension out of it.You won't be able to give anything to the person, such as baked goods, so it's best not to bring things like that with you., Visiting someone in jail is stressful. If you find yourself anxious, try some calming techniques. For instance, you can try putting a relaxing scent on a tissue to take with you. You may not be able to take it in with you, but you can use it immediately before or after by holding it near your nose and breathing in; however, remember that scent will be linked to that experience, so try not to use something you smell all the time.You can also try breathing techniques. If you find yourself feeling anxious, take a moment to breathe. Close your eyes, and breathe in while counting to four. Count to four while breathing out. Focus on your breathing until you feel yourself calm down., Being in jail is scary for everyone, and she may be afraid she's losing you, too. Plus, she's having to create a new life for herself in a tense situation. Try to be understanding, but don't let the person walk all over you, especially since you're having a tough time, too., Seeing your loved one in jail is going to be hard, and the whole experience of visiting a jail isn't going to be fun. Therefore, try to have someone available immediately afterwards to be with you. Go out for a coffee, and have a chat to help ease your tension., Many communities have support groups for people who find themselves with loved ones in jail. You might be able to find one through the court system. You can also try contacting local psychologists' offices to see if they know of any such groups., If a group setting isn't for you, try a few one-on-one sessions with a grief counselor. If you don't have insurance or your insurance doesn't cover counseling sessions, visit a sliding scale clinic; what you pay will be based on what you make., You may feel guilty that your loved one is in jail while you are not. Remember, that you did not make the same choices she did to land in jail, and all you can do now is support her.The first step to moving past guilt is to realize that you've done nothing wrong. It's not your fault the person is in jail, and you can't change another person's actions.
On the other hand, if you feel like you did anything to help land the person in jail, accept the responsibility for that action; one way you can accept responsibility is to apologize to the person.Once you've apologized, try to push forward. Put the thought of guilt out of your mind, and stop going over it in your head. You can't change the past; you can only move forward into a better future., For awhile, your life is going to feel out of whack. With someone you love suddenly gone from your day to day life, you may feel a little lost. However, if you can just keep working through it, you'll readjust to life without them, and life won't feel so strange.Part of creating a new normal is staying on track with the normal seasons. That is, don't be afraid to celebrate holidays and birthdays without your loved one. You don't have to sacrifice your own life just because you're loved one went away.Try creating new traditions with your family to have something to look forward to. Alternatively, you could try a new hobby to take some of your time."

, If you or the person you are seeking to form a relationship work different shifts, live a significant distance apart, or are involved in complicated family situations that demand a substantial amount of time, you may find these to be obstacles to working toward a relationship.

, This will give you insight on their history, philosophy, and expectations from a relationship.

Don’t be manipulating.",How to Deal With a Non Committed Relationship," Before starting (or agreeing to) a non-committed relationship, make sure it’s something that you want. Write down the benefits for you in starting a non-committed relationship and consider how it will work well for you.


People choose non-committed relationships for various reasons. Perhaps you’ve just ended a long-term relationship and aren’t ready for a new one, or you keep busy by furthering your career and don’t have time for a committed relationship.
Don’t let your partner pressure you into a non-committed relationship if it’s not something you want.;
, Define the relationship as soon as possible so that each of you have clear expectations.If someone says they don’t want to get married or are unsure about commitment, don’t hope that they will change their mind or ‘come around.’ It’s not your job to ‘fix’ them or encourage them to change. Ask the person, “Is this what you want?” or, “Is there a chance this might lead to something else?” and take them at their word that this is what they want.


You likely won’t be a hero for turning a non-committed person. Instead, you might just feel frustrated or disappointed.

, Don’t expect a non-committed relationship to change in any way. If you’re unclear if you’re in a non-committed relationship, clarify the nature of your relationship. If you’re with someone and you want to move toward a committed relationship, recognize that you’re fighting a very difficult battle. It’s best to accept things as they are without hopes to change them.


If you’re unhappy in a non-committed relationship, talk about what you want and see if they’re on board. If they are not, it might be best to end things.
If you are not interested in commitment, then be very careful if you notice any changes in your partner’s interest in commitment.

, If you’re going into an agreed upon uncommitted relationship, define the rules. It’s best to get clear boundaries for how the relationship will go instead of wondering what is okay and what is not okay. Ask questions and make sure it feels fair to you. Ensure that you’re both have similar goals for the relationship.Establish some ground rules regarding being physical with other people or spending time with others. Decide whether your relationship is a secret or if you can leave abruptly if you fall in love with someone else.
Even though the relationship is casual, you’re still dealing with a person, not a sex toy. Being in a casual relationship doesn’t mean either of you can treat the other disrespectfully or coldly.
Keep in mind that it is just as important to communicate in an uncommitted relationship as in a committed one. Be sure to keep the lines of communication open.

, Honesty is vital in a non-committed relationship. Just because a relationship is casual doesn’t mean either of you should lie to each other. If you’re unhappy with an arrangement, don’t hope that you’ll get over it. Say something. If you step outside the boundaries you’ve set, admit it. Little lies can easily turn into big lies, and pretending things are okay when they aren’t isn’t fair to you or your partner. Get in the habit of giving feedback and expressing how you feel.If you need the rules to change, say something. If your partner asks to change the rules, be honest in how you feel about the changes and if you’re willing to make them.
For example, if your partner says they want to have sex with multiple people at a time, weigh in on how you feel about it.

, You should have an equal say in what happens in the relationship. If your partner wants the relationship to exist only on their terms, say something. Say clearly what you want like, “I want to come over tonight” or, “I need a brief break this week.” If your partner makes a request you’re not willing to complete, say so.Make sure your partner listens to you and considers your thoughts and feelings. If your thoughts and feelings about the relationship don’t seem to matter, this can lead to resentment and bitterness.
Don’t just go along with what your partner wants, especially if it hurts you or makes you feel angry or upset. Say, ‘I’m not comfortable with that.”

, It shouldn’t just be you who clears the schedule or makes compromises. If your partner is demanding your time and energy yet makes excuses for not doing the same for you, it’s not an equal relationship. If you feel like you’re putting in much more time or energy to meet up or see each other, consider asking some questions or breaking it off. Whatever your nature of your relationship, you’ll be more satisfied if it feels like the power is balanced.If you don’t want to break it off but still want more equality, say, “I’ve been coming over to your place a lot lately, why don’t you come to mine next time?”
You can also say, “I feel like I’m putting aside a lot of my time to accommodate your schedule. Could you give me some time, too?”

, If both of you are having sex outside of this relationship, always use protection and encourage your partner to do the same. Nobody wants a sexually transmitted infection or unwanted pregnancy. If you and your partner are having sex with other people outside of the relationship, make sure you’re protected. If you’re intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, don’t have sex.Having sex with multiple people increases your chances of getting an STI and HIV.

, Do your best to keep your emotions out of this relationship. Emotional investment can lead to wanting to spend more time together, seeing the person more romantically, or wanting the relationship to progress. It can foster feelings of closeness and connection.Casual relationships do not progress, so if you’re finding yourself wanting or hoping for more, back up. Romantic relationships involve being emotionally intimate, so avoid this part of the relationship.


Avoid “pillow talk” and opening up emotionally after sex.
If the person you’re with expects you to take care of them or listen to them, recognize that this might blur the lines with a relationship. Keep your involvement in each other’s lives minimal.

, Don’t share very personal information with your partner. If you begin to share more personal information with each other, this might increase the emotional bond you share, which can lead to feelings of commitment. Sharing vulnerability and having deeper conversations can lead to increased closeness.Since the nature of the relationship is to avoid these feelings, keep things upbeat and not personal.


Keep discussions in the now. If you talk about the future often, this might indicate that you want a long-term relationship.
If you’re starting to feel more emotionally invested, back off a bit.

, Don’t introduce this person to your friends and family. Most people who want a casual relationship want to keep their lives separate, so mixing in friends or family can send mixed messages. It can blur the lines of expectations and lead to confusion. Keep your personal life private and separate from your casual relationship.


Some people are okay with interacting with friends with a casual partner. This requires a great deal of compartmentalization.

, Don’t call, text, email, or contact the person regularly. Limit contact to once each week. Spending more time together may increase feelings of affection or bonding, which can break down the nature of the casual relationship.Wanting to see the person more than once a week may indicate that you want more than a casual relationship.

, The nature of non-committed relationships is that they end when they cease to be mutually beneficial. If you’re with someone who doesn’t want a commitment and you’re finding it difficult to cope with, walk away. Perhaps you’ve made efforts to connect and make the relationship work, but find that you’re unhappy or dissatisfied with the relationship. If this time comes, recognize that you cannot change the person. If the relationship feels more negative than positive, break it off.Say, “This has been fun and I like spending time with you. However, I’m looking for a committed relationship and this isn’t it. I know this is what you want, but it is not what I want any longer. No hard feelings, but please don’t call me anymore.”

, If your partner dictates when you see each other, when you have sex, how often you see each other, and when you avoid each other, you might start to feel controlled by them. Other controlling behaviors might include criticism, feeling like you “owe” them something, or feeling pressured into doing things you don’t want to do.If you’re starting to feel controlled, walk away before they break your heart.
Don’t go along with something you don’t agree with. If you have feelings and they don’t, it’s best to break it off.

, Avoid saying things like, “I want you in my life and I can’t imagine my life without you, but I still want to see other people.” This can confuse the other person and leave them wondering how you feel. If your feelings have changed, let them know. Whether you have started having feelings for them or have lost interest, you should say something. Don’t be overly critical or judgmental of the person as a way to gain control.Casual relationships always have an expiration date. Whether one of you finds someone else or loses interest, know that it will come to an end. Just don’t hurt the person in the meantime and know when to let go.

Simply getting your thoughts out on the page can help you cope.You don't have to make a perfectly polished letter, as the letter is your tool for coping. You can simply express your feelings. How do you feel about the friendship fading? Why do you feel this way?
Share your favorite memories of you and your friend. Talk about what you'll miss. If there was a falling out of some kind, offer an apology.
Not all faded friendships disappear forever. Sometimes, friends get busy and contact may lessen. You can write a goodbye letter that mourns the loss of a certain closeness. You can talk about missing be able to talk to your friend every day, but mention how you look forward to maintaining the relationship in different ways in the future.

, Friends are important to your emotional well-being, so a good friend fading away can be difficult. It's important that you let yourself feel what you are feeling, even feelings that are unpleasant. Do not push down your emotions, but take awhile to let yourself process them.Take some time to cry, if you need to. Many feel embarrassed getting upset over a faded friendship. Remember that, if a relationship ends, it's important to feel the loss.
Sometimes, it can be difficult to get in touch with your emotions, especially if you're focused on moving forward. Grieving is important. If you're having trouble processing, do something to spur memories. Look over old social media posts. Go to a bar or coffee shop where the two of you used to hang out., If you're not as big a part of your friend's life anymore, social media can create feelings of distress. If you and the faded friend are still in contact online, seeing updates about his or her life can sting. It may be a good idea to take a social media vacation while you grieve. Log out of Facebook and Twitter for a few days, giving yourself time to process.In the future, it may be a good idea to block updates from your friend on various social media outlets until you've adjusted to the somewhat faded relationship.

, If a friendship simply faded, most of the time no one is to blame. Even if the two of you did have a falling out, ruminating over blame only makes it more difficult to let go. Blame can also damage to future friendships, as it fails to resolve conflicts and only creates animosity. If you let yourself blame now, you may get into a bad cycle of blame in the future., You may not have done anything. A lot of time, a faded friendship is due to external constraints like time and distance. You may simply not be as close to this person as you once were. However, a friend may be distancing his or herself for a reason. The loss of a friendship is an opportunity to consider the kind of friend you are and the kind of friendships you form.Has this happened to you before? Have you had other friends simply fade away over time? If this happens to you frequently, you may be doing something to drive friends away. It's also possible you're choosing companions who are difficult to get along with or incompatible with you as a person.
If the friend in question has had many failed friendships before, you may not be the problem. You may be choosing emotionally unavailable people as friends. Spend some time considering the quality of your past friendships, and whether your friends have always treated you in a way that makes you feel safe and comfortable.
If the friend in question has many longterm friendships besides you, you may be part of the problem. Consider your interactions with this person. Can you think of anything you did wrong? Try to talk to other friends. Ask them for honest feedback on whether you're a good friend. Press them for ways you could improve.

, A faded friendship is usually not personal. Constraints, like distance and other obligations, can make maintaining friendships difficult. While humans have a tendency to internalize the events that occur in their lives, the faded friendship likely has nothing to do with you.Consider where your friend is in life. Did he or she just have a new baby, get married, start a job? Did this friend move away?
While certain friendships may feel like they'll last a lifetime, circumstances can strain relationships. A friend may simply not have time to reach out. In the future, when your friend becomes less busy, you may rekindle the friendship. Chances are, if an external factor ended the relationship, your friend does not hold any animosity towards you.

, Relationships fade for a variety of reasons. If you moved away from your college town, for example, you and your best friend may have talked on the phone every day for the first few weeks. After a year or two, you may not talk or visit as often. You may think your friend no longer needs you, or that the relationship has ceased to matter. However, it may just be that you're both busy. Finding new ways to communicate can help you both see how the relationship still matters.


Text your friend. Engage with him or her on social media. You may be able to maintain the friendship, in a slightly different form, by switching up communication modes.
Your friend may have an easier time getting back to you via social media and texting, allowing you to see that the friendship, while faded, still matters to both of you.

, Talking out your feelings with another person is a great way to process any kind of loss. Another person may offer some perspective. Many people lose friends throughout the course of a lifetime, and may be able to offer you their unique insight.


However, keep in mind you should not gossip. You do not want to create further animosity or distance. Even while you may have frustrations about the friendship ending, gossiping or bad mouthing your friend will only make things worse., A faded friendship does not mean a friendship is ending. Friendships, especially long term friendships, change over time. Rather than abandoning the friendship, work on looking at the big picture. Do not think of the friendship as having faded so much as having evolved.People change with time, and change can affect friendships. A friendship's former level of closeness may no longer be practical for a variety of reasons. If you're in your 30's, for example, you may still not be intensely close to your high school friends group. If you're approaching your 40's, certain college friendships may have faded.
Even while a relationship has faded slightly, that does not make it less important. Try to accept that a dip in intimacy is common over time. You may not talk to certain close friends every day after a certain point. That's okay. You do not need to let go of faded friends. Instead, accept that the relationship has changed while continuing to think of the friendship as important.

, If you feel you did something to cause the friendship to fade, work on doing better moving forward. You can be a better friend to your existing friends. You can also work on forging other relationships with those around you.You may have noticed a pattern of behavior when examining the loss of your friendship. If you feel like you're habitually drawn to bad relationships, or that you engage in behavior that pushes others away, you may want to seek out the help of a therapist. A solid therapist can help you sort through your emotions and learn to be a more loving, caring friend.

, Sometimes, many friendships fade at once, especially as you get older. You may suddenly realize you and your college friends are not as close as you used to be, which can cause feelings of loneliness. In the wake of loss, you should strive to stay busy. The loss of a friend leaves a major gap in your life. You'll need to find something to do with yourself that helps replace the absent friend.Find a new hobby. Take up something like knitting or crossword puzzles. Join a cooking class.
You can also look for ways to make new friends. Join a website like MeetUp where you can find various clubs in your area filled with likeminded people.

, Remember, friendships often fade due to external circumstances. When things calm down for both and your friend, consider reaching out. Even if you have feelings of frustration about the lack of communication, let them go. You may be able to rekindle the relationship, to an extent, once things calm down.Many people do not want to reach out to a faded friend if they felt they were jilted or ignored. You may feel it's your friend's ""turn"" to make the first move. However, this feeling will not help the situation. You'll end up isolating yourself from someone unnecessarily.
Try to forgive your friend for the lack of contact. Sometimes, a simple phone call or text message can rekindle a forgotten friendship. Friendships go through changes, like any relationship. There will be times when you and your friend share everything, and times when you are distant. A faded friendship may not stay faded forever. If this person is important to you, it may be worth your time to reach out. You could end up bringing someone special back into your life.

Respond with the facts.,
Respond by matching these factual statements with your feelings.,
Provide very straightforward reasons that demonstrate how his or her comments hurt your self-esteem but don't labor the point.,
Decide whether or not it is worth staying in a dating relationship with this person.",How to Date a Food Cop," While it's easy to become emotional and to snap at your date, it will be more effective to supply facts that point clearly to his or her constant haranguing. This means providing your date with specific examples of the comments that he or she makes to you. Keep these in mind (or write them down if needed), so that you can respond directly to the comments when you feel it is appropriate to address the problem. Something along the lines of this is appropriate:


""Last night you told me that I would get fat if I ate that piece of pizza.""
Or, ""Saturday night you said I would not be able to wear the ski pants if I kept eating pasta.""
It's a good idea to note around three to five different occasions where the food cop behavior has occurred - compiling a pattern of the comments will also reassure you that it is actually a pattern, and not just a one-off, unthinking comment.;
, Once you have given your date the facts, it is time to let him or her know just how the calorie-hassling makes you feel. Some good approaches include:


""When you make these comments, it makes me feel upset because it feels like you are criticizing the person I am now. I feel that you are insinuating that I don't care about how I look.""
""When you say these comments, it makes me feel hurt because it feels like you don't like me looking the way I do now.""
When you say these comments, it makes me feel unloved because I feel like you aren't able to accept me for who I am, or enjoy being with me. It also makes me feel that you don't respect my own choices.""

, Instead, make your statement and leave it at that for your date to respond to.

, If he or she is a caring date, it may strike them suddenly as to how thoughtless the comments have been; it could just be a bad habit they've fallen into. If, on the other hand, your date really is a control freak who would rather treat you as an acquisition who must look a certain way to match an ideal, it's time to end the relationship and look for someone you can rely on without counting the calories. So, how will you know? The way that your date responds should reveal understanding, compassion and carry an apology. If, on the other hand, he or she shrugs it off, laughs, makes a joke out of it and continues in the same vein, your date hasn't listened to you and probably never will. Is that something you are prepared to live with? Trust your instincts.

Consider what you might have done to cause your friend to stop talking to you.,
Apologize to your friend.,
Allow your friend time to consider your apology.,

Ask your friend to talk with you about what's happened.,
Realize when it's healthier for you to let go.,
Seek solace with other friends and family members whom you can trust.",How to Cope when Your Friend Stops Talking to You," If you had an argument, accused your friend of something or failed to support your friend when needed, then you are at least partially involved in whatever influenced your friend to go silent.


Consider whether you might have said something unkind, hurtful or thoughtless that encouraged your friend to feel a need to distance themselves from you.
Listen to your gut. In some cases, it's not one thing but a series of little things that lead to a ""last straw"", when someone has finally had enough of excuses, bad attitude or broken promises. Is that possibly the case?
Have you been a bit of a self-absorbed nuisance lately? In some cases, if you've been going through an ""it's-all-about-me"" phase, such as planning a wedding or going through something major in your life, your friend may have reached the endpoint of coping with your drama or neediness.;
, Be honest about your actions and accept responsibility for hurting your friend and offer to make amends. Explain that you understand how they are hurt by what you did and that you're sorry.

, Don't push things, just let time heal your friend's feelings. With luck, your friend will accept your apology and things will smooth over between the two of you. When things are back to normal, take care not to do the same thing again that caused the rift in the first place. If your friend doesn't want to talk to you still, see the solution offered at the end of the following part.


Tell your friend that you're happy to resume being friends whenever it feels like the right time for them. No pressure, no judgment.
More help can be found in How to confront someone who is giving you the silent treatment.

, In some cases, people use silence as a means for breaking off a relationship because they lack the ability to explain their actions or preferences. If your friend has reached a decision, for whatever reason, that they don't want to carry on with the friendship, this might be an explanation as to why your friend has stopped talking to you. It's a harsh thing to realize but it might be the cause in some cases, a silent way of breaking a friendship.


Consider whether there is a new relationship in your friend's life. Sometimes a new boyfriend/girlfriend or a change in family members can cause a person to change their friendship priorities. It's not an excuse to go silent but it may be a reason behind the silence.

, He or she may agree to discuss the matter with you openly and honestly. However, if your friend refuses to talk and continues to ignore you, realize that your friend has chosen to take this passive and immature approach to cutting you off rather than being truthful with you.

, After you've tried several times to talk to your friend to no avail, it's not likely that your friend is going to change this approach. A friend who continues to ignore is no friend and ceases to be worth your time. As much as this hurts, for your own sake, you'll need to start looking after yourself by realizing that the friendship is probably over.

, Perhaps some of them can shed light on why this person has treated you like this. But most of all, they'll be able to reassure and support you through what will be a sad time. Eventually there will be a new friend who is happy to talk to you.


Put this down to experience. Sometimes people do things in life that you just can't fathom but it's down to their internal issues, not about who you are as a problem. Ultimately, it's their loss as much as it is yours.

Do not take it personally if your friend asks you to limit contact with her temporarily.
The space can be valuable for both of you. Your friends can have a chance to cool down, and you can take the opportunity to reflect on what you did.;
, You will eventually want to apologize to your friend. The most effective apologies focus on acknowledging the needs and feelings of those you've hurt. Spend the time to yourself reflecting on what your friend might need from you.Did you violate your friend's emotional needs? This may be how you lost his trust. For example, maybe you made a comment about your friend's weight. This is a sensitive topic for him, and he reacted poorly.
What does your friend need from you to move forward? He probably needs you to be more respectful and understanding in the future. He may also need you to understand which subjects are off limits for jokes.

, It may help to understand why you behaved the way you did. If you did something to hurt your friend, there may be a reason for this. Spend some time reflecting on any factors that contributed to your behavior.Ask yourself honestly why you lashed out. Were you feeling insecure or bad about yourself? Many people hurt others due to their own feelings on inadequacy.
Once you understand your behavior better, think about how to change in the future. Maybe you lashed out at your friend because you have issues with your own weight. You could talk to a therapist about your body issues and try to treat your body better through healthy eating and exercise.

, You can send this letter, if you want. You can also simply write it as a means to get your feelings out. When you apologize to your friend, having written out your thoughts may be helpful.Write a sincere letter expressing your remorse. Begin with something like, ""I'm really sorry that I hurt you.""
You can try to offer an explanation; however, make it clear it's an explanation and not an excuse. You do not want to sound like you're justifying your behavior.
You can send the letter out to your friend. You can also type the letter and email it. You can request to meet in person to apologize formally.

, The first step of a solid apology are the words, ""I'm sorry."" People need to hear this first. From there, acknowledge your mistakes. You want to make it clear you understand what you did wrong.For example, begin with something like, ""I'm sorry. I completely take responsibility for messing up and hurting you.""
From there, explain what you did and why it was wrong. For example, ""I never should have made that comment about your weight. It wasn't funny. It was insensitive and hurtful.""

, Your friend will be more inclined to listen to your apology if you seem genuinely remorseful. Be direct about how bad you feel about your actions.This can be short and simple. For example, ""I really regret being cruel and breaking your trust.""

, You want to make it clear you understand. Your friend is more likely to trust you in the future if she feels you understand the consequences of your actions. Your friend will want to know you've learned your lesson and will not screw up again.You can say something like, ""I can't imagine how hurt you must have been when you heard what I said.""
From there, once again take responsibility. For example, ""I am so sorry I hurt you in this way, and put you all in a position where you felt betrayed. There's no excuse for my behavior.""
Be willing to allow your friend to to express how you hurt her. After an apology, your friend who was hurt may restate how it affected her as a way of making sure you truly understand how she feels. Be prepared for this: listen, try to understand, and, even if you have already said ""I'm sorry,"" you may have to say it again.

, You want to end things on a good note, so ask your friend to give you a second chance. Things may not be normal again right away, and your friend may initially reject your apology; however, leave the door open for reestablishing trust in the future.Your request for forgiveness doesn't have to be long. You can simply say something like, ""I'm sorry for having hurt you. I know it may take time, but I hope in the future we can be friends again.""

, If you broke trust, your friend may expect you to make up for it in some way. You can offer a concrete means of repairing the damage when you apologize.Let your friend know if you have already done anything to make up for it. For example, ""I made you this mix CD of apology songs, and I've been seeing a counselor about my own body image issues.""
You can also tell your friend what you may do in the future to repair things. Make sure your friend knows this will never happen again. For example, ""I'm really making my own mental health a priority right now. I'm not going to stop seeing a counselor until I feel stable enough not to lash out at others.""

, Your friend may set some boundaries with you and let you know what she will and will not accept in a friendship. She may also have some ideas about how you can begin retraining her trust. You can say something like, ""I know it's hard for you to trust me right now. Is there anything I can do to show you I really mean it? Is there something I can do to begin earning your trust back?"" She may have some specific steps you need to take in order to feel you can be trusted again, depending on what happened.

For instance, if you friend found out you were talking about her behind her back, she may want you to go speak with those people and tell them what you said was untrue, and that you were wrong to say those things to them.

, Show your friend you're capable of loyalty. If he lets you back into his life, work on being a good friend. You want to make sure you do not break his trust again.Be sensitive to your friend's worries and fears. Ask your friend how he's doing if he is going through a rough time. Offer to listen if he needs to vent.
Never judge your friend. If he expresses something, react with respect and interest. People are likely to trust those who do not tell them what to do.

, It's going to take time to reestablish trust. In the aftermath of an apology, do not be surprised if your friend is still mad. She may still be stung by what you did, and it make take some time for her to work through that.

Continually put yourself in your friend's shoes. If you feel frustrated by her inability to forgive you, think about how hurt you would be in her position.

, Actions often speak louder than words. After apologizing, try to show your friend how you have changed.Work on being a more trustworthy person. Keep your promises, do not talk behind people's backs, and be there for your friend emotionally.

, You can rebuild broken trust over time. Be consistent and kind with your actions. Eventually, your friend should forgive you; however, do not expect this to happen overnight. It is difficult to trust people, and when trust is broken it can be tough to get it back. It may take many months before your friend completely forgives you."

Reach out to your friend to determine if you are being avoided.,
Consider when the avoidance began.,

If necessary, let them go.",How to Confront a Friend Who Avoids You," Perhaps you and your friend have not spoken in a few days or even weeks. Though it has been a while, this does not necessarily mean that you are being ignored. Shoot your friend a text or give them a phone call. If they pick up or respond, and the two of you chat for a while, then it is very likely that they were not ignoring you but have just been busy or forgetful instead.You might say something casual like, “Hey, haven’t heard from you in a while! What’s up?”;
, If your friend does not pick up this phone call or return your text, you may in fact be getting ignored. If so, consider when this avoidance began. If you regularly talked to your friend once or twice a day, and now you only hear back from them once a week, think back on what point your conversation started slowing down. This may give you some clues as to why your friend might be avoiding you.


Also, consider any factors that may have led them to be less communicative. For instance, if they are applying to colleges or if they just lost a close relative, they likely don’t have either the time or the desire to be particularly chatty.

, Take some time to reflect on the changes that have now occurred in your friendship. In addition to knowing when the changes began, it’s important to know exactly what changes have transpired. If your friend is no longer making eye contact with you or sitting beside you in class, for instance, these are likely very big changes for you. The level of detachment from you that they display will indicate how serious this avoidance is.


Write down how these changes have affected you.

, Most friends will not begin being distant or avoiding you for no reason. Take some time to think back to when your friendship changed and what could possibly have happened to cause this.


Consider whether or not you may have insulted your friend or lied to them about something.
If you did do something wrong, be prepared to apologize to them when you next speak or do so now.

, If your friend hasn’t reached out to you for a while and is avoiding you, you likely feel a bit sad or upset, so talk to someone you trust about this issue like your parents. They have likely been avoided in the past by friend and have advice to give you on how to move forward.Consider talking to other relatives as well like aunts, uncles, or grandparents.
You can also talk to your school counselor if it is really bothering you.
Talk to your mutual friends. Your mutual friends likely have the best insight into why your friend is avoiding you.
You might say to them “Hey, has been avoiding me lately and I don’t know what’s up. Do you know?”

, Reach out to your friend very politely and as casually as possible to see if they would be willing to sit down and talk to you soon. If possible, meet in person, but if not a phone call can work, as well.It’s best to meet in a quiet location like a park. Or you can meet at school somewhere.
Say something like “Hey, we haven’t really spoken in a while, but I would really like to find some time to meet and talk for a bit if you’re up for it. We can go wherever you like.”

, When you meet up or begin your phone call, make sure to express to your friend your honest and true feelings about being avoided or ignored. If there have been specific times that have particularly hurt you, bring those to their attention and tell them how they made you feel. Now is the time for truth with one another so that you can get to the bottom of the real issue.For instance, you might say, “It’s really hurt me over the last few weeks that we haven’t spoken. Usually, when I reach out you get back to me quickly, but lately I haven’t heard from you. It’s really been bothering me because I consider you to be a good friend.”
Frame your questions as “I” statements — asking your friend a bunch of “Why?” questions may put them on the defensive and make them feel as though they are being interrogated. Instead of saying, ""Why haven't you gotten back to me?"" try saying, “I value you as a friend, and I am disheartened that I haven’t heard from you in such a long time. Is there something I may have done to offend you or hurt your feelings in any way?”

, After you have spoken your peace, listen to your friend intently. Allow them to explain to you why they were avoiding you or whether or not they have just been very busy for the last few weeks. Don’t wait for them to finish just so you can respond but truly listen to them so you can better understand the situation and perhaps prevent it in the future.Don’t interrupt them or be rude.
Apologize if they tell you that you have offended them in anyway. Try not to argue over the point — providing an apology will help heal any pain they may be experiencing and start mending the friendship.

, Explaining to your friend how hurt you were by being avoided can be very emotional for you, and finding out that they have been avoiding you can also be really upsetting. In order for the conversation to be productive, it’s important that you remain calm and don’t become dramatic. Keep your emotions in check so that you can respond to your friend logically.Practice deep breathing to help you remain calm. During the conversation, breathe in deeply and quietly through your nose and exhale slowly. This will help keep your heart rate at a normal level.

, If your friend has been avoiding you for a legitimate reason, be very empathetic to that and tell them you’re sorry for not being more understanding. Your friend may have felt hurt by you or may be dealing with their own issues right now, but either way, you should strive for deeper understanding and love for them and work to either fix what you did wrong or support them in their difficulties.


Again, if you have hurt them in anyway, offer a sincere and genuine apology.
If they have been dealing with issues that you were unaware of, express your support for them and tell them that you will always be there for them if they want to talk about it.

, Your friend may be upset with you or may just not want to speak to you at all. In this case, you can reach out to them by writing them a letter or email expressing your feelings and apologizing if you have done anything wrong.


Since you have at this point reached out to them via phone and by letter, try to make this the last time that you reach out. You don’t want to burden them or make them feel stalked. Say your peace and let that be the end of it.
You can also write to them on social media if you don’t have their address.

, After you have reached out to your friend, whether you have spoken to them or just written a letter, give them some time to think. You have been the primary person reaching out for quite some time so allow them some time to miss you enough to then reach out to you. Your friendship will feel more reciprocal because of it. If you are always the one making the first contact, things will feel very one sided and that is not a true friendship.

, Though you likely want this friendship to be restored, you must also be prepared for a reality in which that does not occur. Your friend may be too upset with you, dealing with too much, or perhaps just disinterested in friendship with you at this point. Though that may seem overwhelming, remember that it is okay. It is always sad to lose a friend, but remember that there are plenty of others to be made.Make sure, however, if you did offend your friend in some way, to not do the same to your friends from here on out.
Consider the best and worst case scenarios in this situation. Make your peace with either situation before they even happen and just go with the flow.

, If you and your friend do reconnect, that’s great! You may be feeling happy about this, but you also may feel the need to get them back for avoiding you. Remember, however, that this will only put an even deeper strain on your friendship and in the end, it won’t make you feel better. Actively work to be the kind of friend that you want to have., Once your friendship is beginning to return to normalcy, work to do the things that you used to do before this issue occurred. Hang out at each other’s houses, go to the movies, go out to eat, and do whatever makes you happy and helps the two of you connect.

, After getting your friend back, actively work to avoid issues in the future that would lead to you being avoided again. If you upset your friend in the past, make sure to avoid the behavior that caused it. Also, make sure that you friend knows that avoiding someone is not the best way to go about things, but being direct is. Ask them to be open and honest with you in the future., After you have done all that you can do to restore the friendship, you may find that it is not enough, and that is okay. You are still a good person and you deserve friendship from someone who you don’t have to beg for it. Let your friend go and work to create new and longer lasting friendships.

Be clear rather than pretending you like the pushiness or over-the-top behavior.,
When the annoying friend invites you to do something with them, and you're not interested, say no.,
End the chats and the calls when you have had enough.,
If you are out together and need to leave, tell the annoying friend you've got to leave.,
Be friendly but firm when the friend feels left out.,
Above all, keep calm and stay polite.,
Find out things your annoying friend dislikes.,
Sit with other friends at lunch.,
Give another friend a code word or a pre-arranged signal which means ""Lets leave!"",
Demonstrate your lack of interest in continuing the friendship by acting in an unresponsive ""zombie-like"" manner.,
Hang out with someone that you like often (so you don't have another annoying person) that they can't stand.

,
Confuse or toy with the annoying person.,
End the friendship.",How to Get Rid of One of Your Annoying Friends," By saying nothing, you will get more of the same, so you'll end up suffering in silence. Instead, draw a line and make it clear you aren't going to partake in things that annoy you, behave in a way you find immature or listen to stories that bug you, etc.;
, For example, say that your friend invites you over for ""coffee"". Simply say ""no thank you"" and don't offer an explanation. If pushed, just say that you don't want to; sorry.

, What is holding you there when you've long wanted to stop talking? It's you're ""nice person"" persona, not wanting to hurt the other person. The trouble is, you are hurting yourself by continuing to talk or chat inanely when you could be doing something else you want to do. When they call, say you must hang up now because you're busy. If they ask ""doing what?"" Say, ""just busy"" and ""Bye"". There is no need for explanation; this isn't an inquisition.

, It's that simple.


Tell the friend you are in a hurry to get somewhere. If they offer to tag along say, ""No, Thank you. It must be done alone because it is personal (no questions asked). Sorry.""

, If this person asks you outright whether or not you still want to be friends, say ""I aim to be friendly with everybody, including you. However, that's different from my network of close friends."" Again, do not go into any more details.

, They may be annoying; that does not mean that you have the right to be nasty and it will reflect very badly on you if you are.


Being assertive is about letting people know where you stand. They may not like it but it's much harder to complain that someone knows what they want and speaks it clearly than to call someone a gossip, a meanie or even a bully as a result of their actions.

, Pretend you are really interested in them, and keep on talking about them to them until they get really annoyed.

, Keeping your distance from the annoying friend may help them get the hint that you don't want to hang out.

, Use this signal when you need to ditch someone in a social setting.


Text your friend or cough loudly. Don't look unnatural.
Get another good friend to call you explaining an emergency. Don't let your emergency seem too serious or the person you're ditching may get worried.

, A few easy ways to do this may be not laughing at their jokes, pretending that you weren't listening to their stories or questions or keeping a cold, expressionless demeanor.


When they talk to you, be busy with other things and pretend you're not listening. Also, you can try interrupting them and talking about one of the things they don't like.

,, Talk in a different language, sing, or if they are making unwanted phone calls, either block them or get someone else to answer it.

, If nothing else works it may be best to simply tell the annoying friend that you don't want to be friends anymore.

Use your phone as a telephone.,
Get on FaceTime or Skype.,
Make group calls with Google Hangouts.,
Shoot them a text.,
Send an email.",How to Keep In Touch with Friends1," Make the call! Whether you’ve been meaning to do so for a while now, or the thought just occurred, follow through on the desire to get in touch with someone by giving them a call. Let your friend know you’re wondering what they’re up to, and give them a quick update on your life.Know that is doesn’t have to be a long call to be meaningful. Just the sound of one another’s voice will likely be enough to bring a smile to each of your faces, whether from the next neighborhood or across the continent.
Schedule a call. If you or a friend can’t speak for long, or you can’t connect on the first try, shoot them a text offering to schedule a call later that day.
Get in the habit of keeping up with a far-off friend by maintaining monthly calls at specific times and dates.If you or a friend are particularly busy, set up calls during daily commutes.;
, Video calls are even better, as they allow you to keep in touch visually as well, and simply provide a greater feeling of togetherness, no matter your actual distance. Several video-chat applications are especially easy to use, as well as freely available.FaceTime is limited to Apple products, but is literally as easy to use as it is to make a call – the button for FaceTime shows up automatically during your call.
Skype is also easy to use, though you must install the program on your phone, tablet, or computer and set up a free account. You can also make audio calls and send text messages through Skype, anywhere you have internet access.

, Google Hangouts will allow you to video chat with up for ten friends at once. Try to set a standing weekly or monthly date and time to catch up with a group of friends consistently.Using the text messaging feature, propose themes for each call and plan to wear costumes or share relevant viral videos.
You can also use the text-messaging feature to simply remind one another of an upcoming call.

, Texts are a great way to send someone a quick note, wise-crack, or simple “thinking of you” message.Don’t let the majority of your communication with an old friend happen through texts, but texts are a great way to let someone know about something that reminded you of them.


Text internationally with Whatsapp. WhatsApp is a smartphone application that costs an initial installation fee, but will allow you to send and receive international texts – as well as video and audio messages – for free!
Note that calling, video-messaging, and e-mailing are all better mediums with which to engage in more nuanced or meaningful discourse.

, While lots of email accounts allow chatting with other users that are online, don’t hesitate to send along a good old-fashioned electronic letter. Emails benefit from the potential intimacy and breadth of an actual letter, and you can send them literally whensoever you please.To take advantage of the extra communication capabilities allowed via email, respond to one another’s emails right in the body of their text.
Use a different colored font, and respond to each of the sentences or paragraphs in a longer email to enjoy the feel of an ongoing conversation.

Write your friend a letter.,
Facebook stalk your friends.,
Use Instagram and Pinterest.,
Jump on the Snapchat bandwagon.,
Get creative with other online platforms.,
Don’t rely too heavily on the online realm to keep in touch.",How to Keep In Touch with Friends2," You may be thinking: that’s not social media. In fact, letters are the original form of social media, though the phrase has come to be associated with virtual and fleeting forms of contact – none of which have even begun to approach the depth and gravitas that can be conveyed in a tangible, handwritten letter.Start by conveying why you’re writing. A simple, “Hey! I’ve been thinking about you and wanted to write to touch base about each of our long and winding paths through life.”
Ask a few questions specific to their lives, particularly about things you know that they enjoy.
Update them a bit with a few things in your realm, particularly anything you’re especially proud of or are looking forward to.
Make it fun. Include a drawing, hard-copy photo, or scrap of concert poster you wish you could have attended together – or did attend together in the past!

, “Stalk” is used here with in an attempt at humor – the point is, take advantage of the opportunity to catch up on the happenings in a friend’s life via their Facebook posts.Tossing a “like” at a photo or comment that sticks out will bring you to their mind, too. Commenting is even better.


By browsing your friend’s wall, you’ll automatically have things to talk about next time you see them.
Make notes on your phone of things you want to ask them about next time you get the chance. Or, better yet, use your phone like a phone and call them – you already have an opening conversation in mind!

, Photo-based social media platforms can be a great way to stay in touch with friends too. With both Instagram and Pinterest, you can quickly and easily share images of the things you see while searching the web, other peoples’ profiles, or even real life.Use Instagram if you’re into taking pictures of latte art, interesting sidewalk formations, or the book you’re reading. You can simply post photos to your feed, or send them as direct messages to a friend.
Leaning towards those slightly more home-décor-minded, Pinterest has been compared to sitting around and ripping pages out of magazines with your friends.Whatever platform you choose, remember to emphasize the “social” potential by @-ing or #-ing or simply direct messaging your friends that you think would be interested!
When sending images directly, include a note about how much better it would be to experience whatever you sent together “IRL”!

, Appearing with overwhelming force, Snapchat has become the go-to social media weapon of literally hundreds of millions of humans. Some of them are your friends. Keep in touch with them and their day-to-day moments of snappiness by downloading this free photo and video messaging app on your phone.Add text and rudimentary drawings to your messages to be extra social.
Send messages to a few select friends or everyone on your contact list!
Know the distinguishing feature of Snapchat: you’ll only see each other’s “snaps” for a few moments.
Snapchat is especially fun for wild, zany, and otherwise nonsensical discourse.

, Aside from the smartphone apps you’ve probably already heard of, and all the other methods of sending messages back and forth across the web, there are other, more creative ways to interact online as well.


Check out Miniclips.com, which hosts a bunch of multiplayer games you can challenge your friends to play with you.If you have different schedules, you can always see who can get the highest score in a single player game and update each other about new achievements.
Use Spotify to setup a shared playlist that you and your friends can all add music to. You’ll learn what they’ve been listening to and vice-versa.
When you discover a new artist that they added to a shared list, shoot your friend a text to tease them (politely) for finally developing an appreciable taste in music.

, Excessive internet use – including, if not primarily, the use of social media – can have detrimental effects on your health, productivity, and happiness.If you’ve recently upped your time online and are experiencing greater loneliness, staying up later, and missing class or showing up late to work, you may be spending too much time online.
Stick to non-instant messaging tools – such as email – instead of live chatting, if your productivity or happiness may be taking hits from your time using social media.

Acknowledge any unintended distance by addressing it.,
Meet up.,
Hold an annual reunion event.,
Send invitations via snail-mail.",How to Keep In Touch with Friends3," Most friendships go through challenging times, especially when you begin to see each other less often. Keep a friendship going by articulating the fact that you want to keep in touch, even if your individual situations will require a different approach.


Make time to communicate. You can even add an alarm to your phone or calendar to remind you – though you’ll likely end up looking forward to reacquainting with one another each chance you get.
Apologize for being out of touch. State that you regret the distance that has grown between you, and that you intend to be better about staying in touch moving forward.
Everyone gets busy from time to time. Don’t be the person that uses being busy as a reason not to keep in touch – even when it’s a valid point, it sounds disingenuous.Be direct, and trust that your friend wants to get back in touch too. Try something like, “Hey! I know it’s been a while, and I apologize for my role in that – can we meet up soon?”

, If you’re within an easy bike, train, or drive of one another, make plans to meet for an evening together, or even the occasional day trip.You’ll both be looking forward to it, and planning ahead will make it more likely to actually happen!


If you’re having trouble getting together at the spur of the moment, plan ahead, even a month or so beforehand.
For further trips, plan further in advance.
You may be limited by distance and expense, so you may not be able to visit far-off friends as often, but with planning and saving, you can definitely still make meet-ups happen!

, Whether with one friend or an old crew, make a tradition to meet once a year. You can always meet at the same place, rotate between one another’s current hometowns, or go somewhere different every year.If you’re hoping to bring a bunch of friends together, have everyone pitch in and rent a space that is somewhat centrally located.
Alternatively, have the most-centrally-located person host to reduce traveling and housing costs.
Even if only for a weekend every year, seeing one another will greatly help you keep in touch.
It doesn’t have to be anything special – simply spending time together can be incredibly enjoyable and rewarding, not to mention fun.

, You don’t need a computer to keep in touch with your friends. Letters and hanging out are both far more personal – and one can even help facilitate the other. Whether simply for a dinner next week, or that annual friendship soiree in the sun, send hard-copy invitations.Include all the important details in the invitation, as well as the contact information for whomever is organizing the event.
Encourage recipients to post the invitation somewhere they’ll see it, both as a reminder of the time and date, but also to increase excitement. There’s nothing like looking forward to seeing one another to ensure yet another good time together.

Get professional help if you need it.",How to Cope when Friends Treat You Differently After Your Spouse Dies," If visits from friends become fewer and fewer and phone calls suddenly stop, don’t count it as a loss and suffer in silence. Many who are adjusting to widowhood will simply let their relationships dissolve without even asking why. If you reach out to estranged friends, you may find that they really want to be there for you, but just don’t know how.Call up your friends and candidly say, “Yes, I lost my spouse, but I didn’t expect to lose you, too. What’s going on with us? I miss you!” Hopefully, you reaching out will help them understand that, although you may need space to grieve, you are still interested in continuing the friendship.;
, The fact of the matter is, unless you have a friend who has been in your shoes, most people don’t know how to help you. And, because they feel helpless about the situation, they grow distant. You can address this by clearly stating what you would like your friends to do for you as you grieve.Giving them a solid responsibility can allow you to help your friends support you. Don’t assume they know what you need — spell it out. You might say, “Jessica, it would be great if we could continue our Thursday night movies together. I could use a distraction at least once a week.” Or, say something like “Carl, you are so good with kids. Do you mind taking the children to the park this Saturday? They’ve been cooped up inside for too long.”
You may not have a particular request for your friends, but try to come up with a few things. For example, you might ask one friend to text you an encouraging quote a few times each week, or another friend may be your go-to person for a laugh when you need it.

, Do not allow people to make you feel guilty about how you choose to grieve. Many friends may treat you differently because you are not meeting their expectations of what a widow(er) should be.For example, a year or so has passed and you decide to reenter the dating scene and a friend becomes judgmental. She asks, “Don’t you think it’s a bit disrespectful to be dating this soon?” Your impulse might be to ignore her, but this shuts down the dialogue. See this as an opportunity to share your experience — your feeling of loss, loneliness, and that you feel it is appropriate to move forward with your life.
Explain by saying, “My husband has been gone for a year-and-a-half, and I know he would not want me to spend the rest of my life in mourning. I’m not getting remarried right away, but I would like someone I can have fun with. So, I’m going to give this dating thing a try.”

, It’s time to redefine who you are as a social person. As a widow(er), you no longer have to compromise on your choices based on your spouse’s preferences. Ask yourself: What do I want for my life? What kind of people do I want to be around?Maybe you once didn’t have gatherings at home, but now you do. Or, maybe now you’re more free to visit that friend on the opposite coast who you only see once a year.
Don’t think you have to maintain the same equilibrium that existed before your spouse died. You can’t. If you no longer want to stay in contact with their friends from work or college, don’t.

, Initiate social interaction to send the message that you want and need to engage with others. Bringing a sense of fulfillment back into your social life will depend on your level of commitment and effort. Yes, some friends may become distant. But, there are probably many other friends, family members, or coworkers who would love to have a chat, share a cup of coffee, or take a gym class with you.


If you’re feeling lonely, don’t wait for someone to come along and offer their company. Seek it out. Challenge yourself to call up a different person every day. Ask people over for dinner or drinks a few times each month
In some ways, you have to train your friends on how to navigate in this new territory. If you are interested in having a fulfilling social life, you will have to build a habit of taking initiative., You have the option of maintaining old friendships and making new ones. It’s entirely up to you. Make an effort to discover what it is you want from your social life by staying open to new experiences and new people. This period of life is a pivotal time in which you can reinvent who you are as person.


Set a goal to go on an outing at least once a week. Join a support group for others who are going through the same experience.Go to church or a meditation class for spiritual enrichment. Spend time with people who value you and see you as you truly are, not those who only define you by your marital status.

, Embracing your new self also means exploring new passions and interests. You may feel deeply committed to participating in your regular book club. But, you should also challenge yourself to try out other hobbies, too. Doing so may help you add meaning to your life, introduce you to like-minded people, and help improve your mood.


There are many ways you can explore newfound passions. Start a volunteer commitment with a local community organization. Join a cooking or pottery class. Start a new exercise habit such as visiting the gym or going hiking. Keep the hobbies you like, and toss the ones that don’t serve you anymore., Mourning the loss of a spouse is different for everyone. Don’t feel forced to rejoin the dating pool until you’re ready. In the same vein, you should not feel ashamed if you do desire companionship. Try some of these strategies to make the transition to dating easier.Connect with people you knew way back when, such as high school or college buddies.
Join an online dating site. And, be sure to follow safe practices.Keep an open mind. Try not to compare every new person to your spouse.
Save intimacy for when you’re ready. Be clear with your date about your need for time.

, As a widow(er), it can be easy to fall into a rut thinking that no one cares about you or wants to be around you. Even when some of your closest pals start acting strange or treating you differently, aim to have compassion for their situation.


Imagine how you would feel in their shoes. Would you know exactly the right thing to say or do? If your answer is “no,” try to be more lenient in passing judgment about their behavior.

, As upsetting as it is, some friends won’t follow you into this new chapter of life. Some people, who only knew you as a happy-go-lucky person, may not be able to cope with your bereavement, so they stay away. Others, such as married friends, may not know how to include you in activities reserved for couples.Find the confidence within yourself to not keep around friends who are toxic, judgmental, or unreliable. Have faith that there are many people out there who can offer you support and companionship without negativity.
If you used to spend time with a lot of couples, they may not know if you still want to attend their events. Let your friends know that even though you are no longer part of a couple, you would still like to be included. Before this, however, you may also want to consider if indeed you do want that, and to prepare for challenging the idea that you are a ""5th wheel.""

, Grieving a spouse can be a long, debilitating process. If you find yourself struggling to adjust to your new reality, or withdrawing from friends and loved ones, don’t hesitate to seek the services of a mental health therapist. Therapists with bereavement experience can help you learn to cope with widowhood and develop skills to effectively maintain and build friendships moving forward."
"
If this friend wants nothing to do with you, for whatever reason, there is only one thing you need to accept.,
Accept that people change.,
If you lost a friend over a fight, such as from telling them how you feel, and they won't forgive you, it's their loss.,
Take time to mourn over your loss.,
Let go.,
Do things to get your mind off of this loss.,
Join a club, or a hobby group.,
Consider getting to know some of your current friends better.,
Rejoice in how deeply you care for people and find someone who needs a compassionate pal like you!

,
Remember that life goes on.,
If your best friend moved away rather than ended things, try to keep the friendship alive.,
Be realistic about the friendship.,
Keep in touch.",How to Get Over Losing a Best Friend," The reason for ending the friendship may be as fake, stupid, and ridiculous as this person's behavior has been, but you need to respect his or her decision to no longer be a part of your life. You cannot force a person to remain friends with you. Once one side withdraws the friendship, there is nothing left to preserve.


This does not mean that fighting for your friendship is futile. Sometimes that may be worth doing. However, you must make the decision to fight for the friendship based on respect too. This means that you must accept that even after fighting for saving the friendship, you may not succeed. Ask yourself if this battle is really worth it or whether what has caused the rift between both of you is so total and complete that it is beyond salvaging.;
, It's a fact of life and there is no getting around it. One year, you may be best friends with this person, and the next, they may have changed completely. Just know that they have lost something great, and that's you. You have to be confident and know that you are a great person.


Try to see the loss of the friendship with a dose of realism. If the friend really has changed so much as to no longer be of one mind with you and lacks the things that brought both of you together, it is better that you know than that both of you fake a friendship.
If your friend doesn't want to put the effort into being your friend, you shouldn't care any more than they do.

, And if they can't understand you then they aren't a true friend worth having.

, This big change in your daily life to not have that friend as a part of it. Cry, scream into a pillow, shout, hit the pillow, play the music at its loudest possible. Do whatever it takes to get the sadness, rage, anger, disappointment etc. out of your system. Let it out so that you can move on from these destructive feelings and so that you can cease to harbor negativity that you will continue to carry if you do not release it.


Even if you are no longer friends with this person, never forget the great memories you have had. Everything happens for a reason, but know that this change is for the better, even if it doesn't seem like it at the time.

, If this former best friend didn't want to be your friend anymore, that is definitely his or her loss. This also means that the fallout should be their problem to cope with, not yours. After you've let forth your sadness and your confusion, try to let go. Carrying around anger, resentment and bitterness for what could have been will only delay your recovery and hold you back from connecting with new friends. Give yourself a break and get ready to start anew.


Know that if you lose a friend, you can get a new one, in time.
Forgive yourself and move on. There is no use beating yourself up when it comes to mistakes of the past.

, By being active and letting the time pass in constructive ways, you will find the pain lessens and the hold this person had over you will release, so that you can move on.


As much as you like and love someone, time really can help fade the pain and wounds, until the person is too distant to give a second thought to.

, This is a great new way to make friends that are interested in the same things you are. It is also a good way to get over the loss of someone who was once such a huge part of your life.

, Perhaps there is someone among the people you're hanging around with now who is best friend material, only you've never given that person consideration before. Spend more time together with people you feel a lot of connection with and see what unfurls.

,, No matter what happens, life still goes on. It is not the end of the world. You have a lot ahead of you and people come and go. This person left for a reason and things were not meant to work out any further between you two. There are billions of people out there; many that share the same interests or hobbies as you. In time, you will find another very close friend.

, There are some things you can do to help this along.

, It is possible to maintain a friendship long distance but it is a challenge. While both of you may remain friends for life, you will probably only be able to rekindle that special connection when you actually get back together again now and then. For all the other times, both of you should discuss allowing one another the space to develop other close friendships in real time while still holding each other dear and promising to keep in touch.

, There are many websites, such as Myspace or Facebook, that can help with that, as well as through email and calling each other.


Use Skype for regular hookups.
Play online games together, such as through the Xbox or PC. Stay in touch through talking while gaming.

Take some time to mourn.,

Be patient.Healing from the loss of a friendship is going to take time.",How to Get Over Friends Who No Longer Want to Be Friends With You," Losing a friend can be very painful. Pretending like it didn't happen or repressing the hurt you feel may seem like a good idea in the short term, but ultimately it will make it much more difficult to move on. Acknowledge that you have lost something important to you and that it is okay to feel sad about it.


Don't be afraid to cry. Crying can be a great release of emotion.
Listen to some sad music or watching a sad movie can actually be very cathartic. It reinforces the fact that you are not alone in how you feel and can give you hope that better times are ahead.;
, Don’t hang on to text messages or emails that you might be tempted to go back and reread. Going back to these time and time again will only prolong the loneliness and hurt after a friendship ends.You may want to save copies to a USB drive and then give it to a friend or family member in case there comes a time when you feel it would no longer be too painful to look back on old times when the friendship was still solid.

, You’ll heal more quickly and be able to let go more readily if you aren’t constantly exposed to their Facebook posts.

, You don’t necessarily have to throw them away, though you could. Get rid of anything that reminds you of your friends like souvenirs or gifts.

, A helpful way to process feelings is to write them down. You might have questions about what went wrong or be feeling anger towards your friends. You can get all of these emotions down by writing a letter to you friends that you won’t ultimately end up showing them. When you’re done you can tear the letter up or put it away in a drawer. The purpose is just to process how you feel., Avoid seeing this as a reflection on who you are. There are lots of reasons why friendships end. Even if you feel like you had some hand in your friend or friends not wanting to remain friends with you, know that all relationships are 50/50. You can’t control other people., If you are really having trouble moving on it can be helpful to deal with these feelings in a professional setting. A trained therapist will be able to listen to your perspective of what went wrong in the friendship and help you learn from mistakes.

, When friends are the problem, sometimes turning to family can be a safe solution. If you can, try to call someone you think has gone through similar friendship breakups in the past. Perhaps a parent or grandparent with more life experience, though any family member can be an enormous comfort.

, They can listen to how you feel and offer an objective perspective on the situation. Let them know how much you appreciate their support. Remember that even though you may have lost a friend, you are still not completely friendless.

, Mutual friends may not be the best people to reach out to if you feel like you really need to process the loss of the friendship. This puts your shared friends in an awkward position. You'll also run the risk of alienating more people if you are perceived as trying to get people to take sides. That said, you can still reach out to these friends for companionship. It can be a nice reminder that you still have people that care about you.


Avoid mentioning the friend that no longer wants to hangout with you.
Try to focus on the things you still have in common with your current friends.

, It can be very emotional when a friend says they do not want to hangout with you anymore. Avoid the temptation to talk badly about them or tarnish their reputation in any way. When the emotions die down you may both realize that the friendship is actually salvageable. It may even come back together stronger after a disagreement of this magnitude. You don't want to make the situation any worse or lower any chances of the friendship being mended because you bad mouthed someone behind their back.

, Lots of people come and go throughout our lives. Your friendship might have just run its course. Think of it as an open space in your life that you can fill up with new, stronger friendships. , When a friendship ends it can be easy to focus on negative things. Take stock of the things in your life that you are grateful for. Make a list of people you still feel close to, skills you are proud of, groups you’re involved with or tasks you enjoy. Keep the list close by in a your wallet or bag or hang it above your desk so you can look to it when you are feeling lonely., If you catch yourself spending too much time in the house feeling sad get out. Go for a jog or to the gym. Go to a place where you can be around other people like a coffee shop, the library or a concert.

, Sign up for something you are interested in to keep you busy. A yoga class or meditation group can be particularly helpful in times of distress. You might also consider a cooking class, dance lessons, or learning how to play an instrument.

, Make sure you make extra time to do things that you enjoy and that make you happy. Read, play video games, go out with other friends, play an instrument. Keep busy.

, Even though you might be experiencing very real feelings of loneliness and depression, know that no feeling lasts forever and that as long as you are taking good care of yourself, you’ll be able to find the strength to pull through."

Make a plan to meet up.,
Practice what you’re going to say.,
Break up with your friend.,
Set boundaries.,
Prepare for an emotional response.,
Prepare for questions.",How to Get Rid of an Unwanted Friend1," If you have decided to have a mature conversation with your “friend” and explain to them that you need a break, the first step is to make a plan to meet. You will want to select both a place and time, just like you would for a romantic break-up. It is best to do this in person, not on the phone, and definitely not via text., Conversations like this can be tough, so it is a good idea to practice what you are going to say ahead of time. Make a list of the reasons why you want to create some distance. Remember to focus on yourself and what you need. This is more effective than pointing fingers and dishing out blame. You might say, “I just don’t think we are into the same things anymore. I don't feel like we are compatible friends.”
You might say, “I don’t like who I am when I’m around you. I feel like we bring out the worst in each other.”
You might say, “I just can’t forgive you for what happened, and I think it’s best if we don’t speak anymore.”

, When your meeting time comes, sit down with your “friend” and tell it to them straight. Make sure you take the time to listen to them just as they have listened to you. Then walk away, and be proud of yourself for handling the confrontation in a mature way.


If it helps, you can bring an outline of important things to say on an index card.
This may seem silly or impersonal, but it can very difficult to remember everything during a tense conversation.

, In some cases, you may never want to see or speak to this person again. In other situations, you may be comfortable remaining casual acquaintances. Whatever you decide, it is important for you to establish clear boundaries with this person, and explain exactly what type of relationship you’d like to have from here on out.Be as clear as you can.
You might say, “To be completely honest, I do not see us ever becoming friends again, and I’d rather not have any contact with you.”
You might say, “I think we just need some time to heal. Maybe we can try talking again in a month or two.”
You might say, “If we run into each other at a party, of course we can talk and hang out, but I just don’t see us spending time together one-on-one.”

, It can be difficult to predict how this person will respond. They may play it totally cool and just say “OK,” but they may also yell, cry, or get upset. They may even try to argue with you. Try envisioning a variety of reactions, and think about what you could do or say.


Once you have said what you needed to say, and taken a moment to respectfully listen to them, you are free to walk away.
If you’ve already made up your mind, there is no need to argue.

, When you have this conversation with your former friend, they will probably ask you a lot of questions. Think about what questions they might have in advance, and think of honest but kind ways to relay your thoughts. Here are some questions that your friend might ask you:


Why don't you like me?
Why don't you want to hang out with me anymore?
Is there something I did that made you upset?
What about our mutual friends?

"
Break off a friendship that you feel must end for various reasons that will benefit your life.,
Realize whether the problems between are you and your best friend were surmountable or not.,
Understand that the friendship ended for a reason.,
Make a clean break.,
Try not to substitute anger and corrosive hatred for sorrow and grief over the loss of your friend.,
Allow yourself some time to heal from your friendship.,
Make a pro and con list about your past friendship.,
Realize that sometimes best friends are not always ""forever"".,
Reflect on what you could have done better.,
Get busy and get healthy!,
Get input from your family.,
Keep talking to the friends you've kept and make new ones.,
Look out of your window.",How to Get Over the Loss of a Best Friend," If you have carefully considered the options and have come to your decision by considering all factors and trying various ways to avoid this, then you must do it. It is one of the hardest things to do in life especially if you have endured many obstacles and emotional moments with that person. An attachment to a person can sometimes be harder to let go of than a romantic one. But if you feel it is better for you in the long run, then chances are that you must do it. Letting go, throwing in the towel, severing ties and knowing when to quit are not easy things to do. It takes an immense amount of courage, bravery and thought to end something that you've desperately want to cling onto.;
, You can do this by writing a journal entry about your honest feelings about the friendship over the years (and do not sugar coat, do not employ euphemisms. Be direct and 100% truthful). If you realize that your problems are not surmountable, acknowledge that and make your first step forward. Chances are if the problems of your friendships were repetitious and became patterns, regardless of your attempts to fix it, things will not change.

, Whether you end the friendship or the other person does (or in some cases, gradual distance between two people becomes more permanent), acknowledge that the friendship ended for reasons. The core reason can be anything from the unhealthy, bad nature of a friendship or simply that you flourished into two very different individuals overtime.

, For some people it is important for them to try to make a clean break from the other person. Despite the fact your best friend was not an object of romantic interest from you, the severance of a friendship over several years can feel very similar to a painful break up. This is not say that you are not allowed to greet or politely converse with the person during social events but for some people the reminder of their old friend can be a hindrance in their ability to move forward with their lives. For those who can manage keeping your old friends on Facebook, Twitter, emails, Instant Messages and phones, it is fine. However, it seems like it would be easier if reminders weren't ubiquitous on such personal places.

, Before you act with your anger/resentment fueling your decisions, take a breath and do try to acknowledge that it is not the best time to execute any rash choices. You are allowed to feel angry with the other person or yourself; it happens in nature. People can berate themselves while blaming the other person for wasting copious amounts of their time, their emotions and their life on the other person. You must overcome this. Anger will not lead to progress or bliss.

, Friendships can often be taken for granted and oftentimes until the loss of a friend, people will never truly realize how much exactly a friendship meant to them. Perhaps take 4-5 days off to heal. Sad movies, sad music, sad journal entries, sad poems...the works. And the sometimes inevitable water works. Understand that you are permitted and at full liberty to grieve your friendship. Even if no one else understands precisely how you felt, you are allowed to feel the loss of someone that preoccupied your time.

, It will give you the opportunity to see why your friendship failed, what you didn't do that could potentially improve your relationships with your remaining friends, why you should not be friends with that person anymore etc. You might be surprised to see how you truly feel about your friend. Perhaps even an underlying happiness for the conclusion of your friendship might reveal itself—for whatever reason (you feel as though they manipulated you, you feel as though your friend decreased your confidence, you feel as though your friend used you etc.)

, Sometimes best friends are only intended to be best friends over an allotted period of time—maybe your time with that person is up. Maybe it was not your fault, maybe it was not their fault, maybe it was your fault, maybe it was their fault, maybe it was no one's fault, maybe it was both your faults. It doesn't matter—facts are facts: the friendship has ended. Truth is, sometimes ALL kinds of relationships (platonic, romantic etc.) are simply meant to come to an end. For whatever reason that relationship has been exhausted.

, Whether it was a friendship that fizzled out naturally or a friendship that had to be ripped from the roots out of the ground, there is always something you can try to improve. So do it for yourself and for your future friends. Want to improve yourself FOR yourself and the life ahead of you. Be motivated to be the best person you can be.

, After a period of time, get to exercising, go see friends and take time off of your day to try new activities that you, independently, wanted to try. Keep from trying new things that you wanted to do with your former friend together. It will only be a stinging reminder. Even if you feel as though you cannot continue forward without the friend that you believed to have been the closest with, your friendship has ended and you will get better with time and with determination. And you will find new friends sooner or later. So get busy!

, Friends come and friends go, but family is always there (and not just blood family, but whatever you consider to be your family). So talk to the people that matter to you the most and they will have your back. Your mother, your father, your cousin, your sister, your brother, your aunt, your uncle, your step-sister, your sister-in-law, whoever, the friend that is basically your blood sister/brother... go back to your roots. The people who have genuinely been there for you since the beginning in order for you to realize that these people are the ""forever"" that your friend was not.

, You never know who will be that friend that you can always turn to. Friends are just waiting to be made and sometimes you just have to take that first step and initiative. So don't be worried and don't be scared. Talk to them! You'll find a new best friend some day!

, When you look out, realize how many beautiful things there are in this world. Terrible things could have happened (such as your friend's death), but there are many positive things to think about (such as you got a better job than your other friend).

Stop calling or texting.,
Avoid running into them.,
Decline plans.,
Be honest.",How to Get Rid of an Unwanted Friend2," The first thing you need to is to stop initiating conversation. Hopefully, this person is more of an acquaintance than a close friend, so it won't be too strange if you don't contact them. Don’t text them about something that happened. Don’t call to talk or make plans. Encourage your former-friend to move on by failing to contact them for any reason., You will also want to avoid running into them in person. You probably know where they hang out. Just avoid going there. Sometimes this may mean missing out on something fun, but it is worth it to establish some distance. However, if you do run into them, here are some tips to make things less awkward but still distance yourself.


If you go to the same school, keep yourself busy with your schoolwork. If the person approaches you in class or after class, say that you're in a rush and a little stressed about your work.
If you're at a party, offer to help out at the party, or excuse yourself to go say hello to someone else, if you see the person.
If you do end up talking to them, have a light conversation that is not filled with deep or emotional topics.
You can also invite a third person into any conversation.

, If they manage to contact you and try to make plans, you are going to need to say no. Here are some ways that you can politely decline an invitation:


""Thanks for thinking of me, but I can't make it that day.""
""No, but thank you for inviting me.""
""Thanks, but I'm not a huge fan of that activity.""

, If your “friend” starts asking questions and pushing you to hang out, you should drum up some courage and tell the truth. If they approach you and want to talk, it probably means that the feeling to “drift apart” wasn’t really mutual. You will need to tell it to them straight and make a clear break in the relationship.Examples of things you might say include:
""I think our friendship is growing apart, and maybe we should let it.""
""I just don't feel that we are compatible as friends anymore.""
""I don't think it's a good idea for us to spend time together.""

"
"
Stop and reflect on the friendship.,
Look for “toxic” signs.,
Determine your boundaries.,
Think about mutual friends.",How to Get Rid of an Unwanted Friend3," Before taking any drastic steps, just take a little time to reflect on the friendship. Getting rid of a friend can be a big decision and you don’t want to burn bridges unnecessarily. So take some time and think over both the pros and cons of this relationship.Generate a pro/con list, listing good aspects and bad aspects of the friendship.
Be sure to focus on the present relationship, not the way it “used to be.”

, There are several signals that a relationship is bad for you. When you are reflecting on your friendship, keep an eye out for signs that the friendship is actually toxic. If you experience several of these signs, it is a good idea to create some distance.You feel drained after spending time with them.
You don’t like the way you act in their company.
There is no balance. Either they ignore you, or they want way too much attention.
They make you feel bad or try to manipulate you.
You’ve lost respect for them.

, Before you head into a “break-up” conversation with your “friend” make sure you know what you want the exact outcome to be. Will you want to permanently cut ties and never speak to each other again? Do you just need space temporarily? Will you still be cool with them in groups, but you have no desire to hang out one-on-one? Make sure you know what sort of boundaries you will need to set, and be as specific as you can., It is also a good idea to think about and plan how you will handle the issue of mutual friends. If you want a total break and never want to see this person again, it means that any shared friends will need to choose between you. It also means you may not get invited to certain events (or they may not). If you are dealing with a toxic friendship, then it is definitely worth it. But it is worth thinking about and considering how you will deal with and/or explain the situation to shared friends.

Think about the situation.,
Consider the negative consequences of not confronting your friend.,
Plan what you will say.,
Practice.,
Find the right time and place.,
Start by telling your friend you care.,
Be direct.,
Focus on your feelings.,
Keep your emotions in check.,
Take time to listen.,
Be mindful of your body language.,
Be clear about the next steps.,
End on a positive note.,
Leave the door open for future conversations.,
Live up to your end of the deal.",How to Confront a Friend," Make sure you know exactly what you're going to confront your friend about and why you want to do it.


It's easy to get blinded by emotions, so take your time to think about the situation logically. Also, try to consider how your friend might feel about the situation.
Consider if the incident you want to confront your friend about was a one-time thing or if it was representative of her normal behavior. You can still confront your friend if the situation only happened once, but be careful about blowing a small problem out of proportion.
Take your friend's intentions into account when deciding whether to confront her and what to say. Keep in mind that she may have no idea that her actions are harmful to you and confronting her might be the only way to make her realize that.;
, Sometimes having a difficult conversation with your friend is just the right thing to do, no matter how hard it may seem. If you feel like this is one of those situations, stick with your gut.


Remember that keeping negative feelings to yourself could cause you to feel resentful towards your friends and could drive you away from her. You don't want to let this situation get between you and your friend, so be honest with her.
If you are confronting your friend about some kind of destructive behavior, such as drug or alcohol abuse, she might really need you and her other friends to tell her how her problems are affecting you., You don't want to stutter when you confront your friend. Figure out what the exact reasons for the conflict are and why those reasons exist. Determine what you are feeling, and don't be afraid to tell your friend that you are upset and how the conflict is affecting you.Write down the emotions you are experiencing as a result of the situation. This will prepare you to explain these emotions to your friend.Think of specific examples to discuss with your friend. Your conversation will likely not go anywhere if you aren't able to express exactly what it is that you are upset about.
Be honest with yourself about whether you have contributed to the conflict at all. If you have, be ready to admit that to your friend.

, You need to focus on the words you are saying, not on the emotion behind them. If you rehearse, you will have a better chance of remembering what you want to say.Consider rehearsing with another friend and asking his or her opinion about how well you expressed yourself.You may want to think about responses that your friend is likely to have to you, and decide in advance what you will say in return.
If you're worried about forgetting everything you want to say, write it down. This can be a great way to keep your conversation on track and make sure you cover all the major points.
While preparing is a good thing, don't make yourself crazy by over-preparing. Accept the fact that you will not be able to predict everything your friend will say and be prepared to respond to your friend honestly., Find a good setting where you can speak in private. The last thing you need in a delicate situation is the prying eyes of others. Also, make sure you both have plenty of time to discuss the conflict.


Avoid the temptation to have the conversation over the phone, by email, or by text message. Face-to-face conversations are always best for important topics.Avoid distractions by putting your phone away and asking your friend to do the same.
If you attempt to confront your friend and she says that now is not a good time, don't get upset. Simply tell her that the conversation is important and ask her when would be a better time.

, Make it clear from the beginning of the conversation that you are having this conversation in the interest of improving your friendship. Tell her you are being honest, and that your intent is not to insult her or cause more problems. You can try acknowledging that she might feel hurt by the conversation by saying something such as, ""I need to talk to you about something that you might find upsetting, but please hear me out and know that I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.""

, Avoid talking about other things and confront the issue head-on. Tell your friend exactly what it is you need to confront her about, cite specific examples of the behavior you are talking about, and let her know how her actions make you feel.


In addition to understanding what you are confronting her about, your friend also needs to understand why you are confronting her. If you are worried for your friend's well-being, let her know. If your friend has hurt your feelings, tell her that you need to talk about the issue to keep your friendship strong.

, While it may be tempting to blame your friend for the conflict, discussing how her actions make you feel, instead of accusing her of something, will lead to a much more productive conversation.When framing your sentences, use ""I"" more than ""you."" You should be the subject of the majority of your sentences because you are talking about your feelings. For example, say, ""I feel angry when you do that"" instead of ""You make me angry.""

, No matter how tense the situation gets, do not yell or use any negative language in reference to your friend. This will only make the situation worse.There's no shame in crying as you contemplate the conflict and its effects on your friendship. Some things just hit too close to home, and that's alright.

, Once you've finished with what you wanted to say, ask your friend how she feels. Make sure to listen to what she has to say, and to respond calmly and rationally.If you don't know how to respond to something, just tell your friend that you need some more time to think about what she said.
Avoid interrupting your friend. Be respectful of her feelings by letting her finish what she needs to say before you start responding.

, Body language can portray negative feelings just as easily as harsh words can. Show your friend that you are open to hearing her side of the story by making eye contact and not crossing your arms or fidgeting.Watch your facial expressions too. Even if you don't agree with something your friend says, don't roll your eyes. This is just as confrontational as yelling.

, Talk to your friend about what you want your friendship to look like in the future and what you think you should both do to get there. Listen to her ideas also.If appropriate for the situation, set clear ground rules so that you both know exactly what kind of behavior the other finds upsetting. If, for example, your friend has called you a name that you find offensive, consider saying, ""I find it hurtful when you call me names, even if you are just kidding. Please don't call me names that insult my intelligence again.""

, Tell your friend that you're glad you had this conversation, that you feel better after talking to her, or that you appreciate her taking the time to share her feelings. Also remind her how much you value her as a friend, or consider telling her all of the positive qualities that you love about her.Even if the conversation doesn't go well, don't be negative. If you find that your friend isn't interested in having the conversation, say something like, ""I only want to have this conversation because I care about you and I want to continue being friends. Whenever you want to talk, I'll be ready.""

, Tell your friend you might want to talk about this same issue again in the future. You don't need to be nervous about revisiting the issue because you can just say, ""I think we need to continue our conversation. This is how I'm feeling about it right now."" Once you've started the conversation, you should be able to continue it without as much anxiety and uncertainty.


If your friend repeats the behavior that upset you, consider pointing it out to her right away by saying something like, ""I feel hurt by what you just did/said and I feel like it is similar to what we have discussed before. How do you feel?"" She might not have even realized that she was doing it. Don't let it build up without talking to her again.

, If your friend pointed out some steps that you could take to improve your friendship, take them! You can't expect your friend to change if you are unwilling to do the same. Work hard for a better friendship.

One of the hardest parts about having a big fight with your best friend is that when you would normally turn to them when something awful happened, you can't.,
Talk to someone.,
Write it all down.,
Think about the good times, the best memories you have of that person.,
Pamper yourself for a day or two, or a week or two, or maybe a month, pamper yourself.,
Don't spend too much time grieving your loss.,
Get back to real life.,
Accept that there's really no remedy to heal a broken heart.,
Don't be afraid to start spending more time with other people.",How to Heal when Your Best Friend Kicks You out of Their Life," Scream, act like a baby, throw tantrums. Kick, sob. At least do something to get out your anger. Cry until you don't have a single tear left. Get everything out.;
, Look around you- make a list of who truly cares about you. Think family, friends, teachers, classmates, co-workers, neighbors, religious leaders, etc. These people care about you.

, If you feel like you can't talk to anyone, get a teddy bear. Teddy bears, unlike people, will never betray you, turn their back, or walk away. They will give you their undivided attention and a shoulder to cry on. Tell them everything, even those unpleasant details you wish you could just forget.

, You could start from the day you met, or from the second she gave you the silent treatment. Just pick a place and go for it.

, Do the bad times really outweigh the good times?

, Sit on the couch and eat chocolate. Watch TV until your eyes burn out. Take long, hot baths and use every bath oil you can buy.

, Remember the good things and acknowledge the bad, but remember that there's more to life than that person.

, It's okay to grieve, and you probably will, but, eventually, you will have to move on. You can't go over every second of your relationship, analyze everything you've ever said to that person. It'll only make it worse.

, There will always be a little part of you that will never fully heal. And you just have to accept that.

, Maybe you will find a potential new best friend.

Plan what to say.,
Tell the person that you're ending the friendship.,
Find the person another friend.,
Follow through.",How to Get Rid of Someone You Don't Like1," If you want to confront the person and tell him or her that you don't want to hang out anymore, you should plan what you say carefully. If you have a random outburst or don't choose your words wisely, the person may not think that you're being serious or that you really thought it through. You're going to tell that person that you don't want to hang out with him anymore, so you can think of the best way to explain why.


If the person is just really annoying and you don't have the heart to say it, just say that you're not enjoying the friendship, that the friendship is harmful for you, or that you'd just like to spend some time apart from the person — permanently.
If there's a more concrete reason, like the person makes you feel bad about yourself, the person always talks about himself and doesn't listen to anyone, or the person is even outright mean to you, then you can tell the person this.
If you don't want to be honest, that's fine too, if you think it'll just cause major conflict. Tell the person you don't have time for friends, that you're going through a hard time and want to be alone, or that you just want to focus on your studies.;
, Pick a time and place where you can be relatively alone, and say what you have to say. Stand a bit far away from the person and cross your arms over your chest, showing that you're already retreating. Don't give the person an opening to try to win you over, promise to change, or even try to touch or hug you.


Keep it short. Don't give the person a lot of time to react.
Maintain eye contact. Show the person that you really mean it.

, If you want to be nice after confronting the person, you can steer the person toward a club, activity, or new location that can help the person make some new friends. This can not only be better for the person, but better for you. But you should only do this if you're feeling a bit sorry for kicking the person out of your life.


If the person finds new friends, he'll forget about you in no time at all.

, If you've decided to cut off contact with that person for good (after potentially steering him in a new direction), then make the decision final. Don't let the person grovel, randomly show up, or follow you into a coffee shop and force you to have coffee. No means no, no matter what. If the person continues to bug you, you shouldn't sound threatening, but be confident and decisive about your decision.

Take time to think through the situation.,
Ask to speak to them privately.,
Be as honest as possible about your motives for ending the friendship.,
Address concerns you may have about your friend.,
Put the blame on yourself.,
Tell them what you need.,
Allow yourself to grieve.,
Remain polite to the friend when you see them.",How to Get Rid of a Bad Friend1," Before you confront your friend, take some time to clarify your feelings and reflect on why you believe this person is a ""bad"" friend. The word ""bad"" is a broad term, which can encompass lots of different ideas. Also consider whether you truly want to get rid of them or if the relationship might be able to be salvaged. Try asking yourself some questions to help make it easier to confront your friend. Some questions to ask yourself include:

Do they go against your values?
Do they put you down constantly?
Are they untrustworthy?;
, Set a time to meet with them. Find a place away from other people where the two of you could talk.


You could say, “Could I talk to you today after school? I’ll meet you by the door.”
Speak where nobody else can hear you. If someone comes by, ask them to give you some privacy.

, You may feel courageous enough to address all of your concerns, or you may only feel brave enough to be vague. Be as honest as your comfort level allows, but sharing your feelings is beneficial.


Break the news kindly to your friend. Even if you are confronting them about their behavior, you can still be respectful toward them.Use “I” statements like “I felt very hurt when you made fun of me,” or “I feel like I’m being used when I hang around you.” These statements express your feelings and avoid blame. Saying things like “You use me for my car” or “All you do is pick on me” can make the listener defensive.

, If you are ending a relationship with your friend due to problems you have with their behavior -- for example, substance abuse, risky behavior, or poor school performance -- you may be doing a favor to them by pointing it out. Let them know you care about them, but no longer want to be around them when they are doing what they’re doing.You could say, “Shannon, I care about you. But it seems to me like you are drinking a lot these days. And I can’t be around that anymore. I hope you can get yourself some help.”
If you feel that discussing their behavior could get you into more trouble with them, however, you may not wish to discuss it with them.

, It is important to avoid blaming or criticizing your friend. Focus on your own views, feelings, and values. Blaming yourself for the end of the friendship could be a way to avoid arguing. You could say that the friendship doesn’t bring out the best in you, or that you don’t like how it makes you feel.You could say, “After we would hang out, I always felt really stressed. I don’t want a friendship to feel like that.”
Acknowledge your role in the breakdown of the friendship. You could say, “I was never comfortable with some of the stuff we did, but I never said anything. I’m sorry I wasn’t honest with you about it at the time.”, Inform your friend of what you want going forward. You may decide you want to end all communication, or you may want to take a break from the person. Make sure you are clear and that your friend understands.


You could say, “I’m sure it’s not easy to hear, and it’s not easy for me to say, but I don’t want to hang out with you anymore. So I’m not going to answer your texts or spend time with you. I’m sorry that it has to be this way, but I can’t keep this up anymore.”

, It’s okay to be sad about the loss of your friendship, even if was not a good one. You likely had some good times together and valued your connection.Understand that you might have some confusing emotions around the end of your friendship. You might be sad, relieved, angry, and peaceful… all at once. It might help you to clarify your feelings by writing in a journal or talking to another trustworthy friend or adult.
Take some time to yourself and do things you enjoy. Listen to your favorite music, exercise or go for a long walk, go out for coffee with a friend, or spend time in prayer. Reconnect with yourself.

, Even though you are no longer friends with this person, you can still be polite to them. It costs you nothing to be respectful to someone else, even if you don’t especially like them.


Work with them on class projects if necessary. Focus on the task at hand. If your friend tries to stir up drama, you could say “Let’s just focus on getting this project done.”

Consider the possibility that it was a mistake.,
Acknowledge your emotions.,
Talk to someone about how you feel.,
Write about your emotions.",How to Get Over Being Left Out1," People do not always leave others out on purpose. Sometimes it just happens and it is not meant to make you feel bad.For example, you might have been left out simply because there was a missed communication, such as a lost letter or unsent text message. Or, you might have been left out simply because the person was not thinking clearly and she might feel really sorry for leaving you out.;
, Being left out can cause you to feel lots of different negative emotions. For example, you might feel sad at first and then become angry and jealous.These emotions are normal, but they will pass. Instead of denying your emotions, give yourself some time to feel them.

, Sharing your feelings with someone who cares about you can be helpful. Try talking to a parent, a good friend, or someone else who you feel that you can trust. Explain what happened and be honest about how it made you feel.


The person who you share with may be able to tell you about a time when he or she was left out and may even be able to give you some advice about how to deal with your situation.
If being left out has been an ongoing problem or if you are experiencing distress as a result, then you may want to consider talking to mental health professional. If you are still in school, then you can talk to a school counselor. If you are no longer in school, then you can find a therapist.

, Journaling has a wide range of physical and emotional health benefits. It can help you to understand your feelings better, reduce stress, and improve your ability to solve problems.To use journaling to help you deal with being left out, get yourself a journal or notebook and start writing in it for a few minutes every day. Your first entry could be about being left out. You could describe what happened and how it made you feel.

Ignore the person's phone calls.,
Ignore the person on social media.,
Avoid places the person goes.,
Change your routine.,
Find some new friends.",How to Get Rid of Someone You Don't Like2," No matter how often the person calls or texts you, don't respond, not even the calls or texts sound desperate. If the person follows you around, make it obvious that you respond to your calls and texts and are purposefully ignoring that person. If he says, ""Did you get my call?"" you should look vacant and confused, like you don't know what he's talking about. This might help drive the point home.

, No matter how often the person posts on your Facebook wall, comments on your photos, or retweets something you've written, do not acknowledge him. If the he commented on one of your statuses along with a lot of other people, you should ""like"" the comments of all of the other people but not his comments. Make it clear that you want nothing to do with that person — whether it's online or in person.

, If you know that the girl you're trying to avoid always hangs out at a certain coffee shop, always goes to a certain friend's party, or always goes to the movies on Friday nights, avoid those places. If you don't go where the person goes, you'll be less likely to run into that person. But if the person is always around you, this won't help you too much.

, Stop going to the same lunch spot, the same diner, or the same bar or club. If the person you're trying to avoid knows exactly where to find you, it'll be hard to get rid of him or her. Though you shouldn't change your life completely to avoid this person, making some changes to your daily routine can help improve your life and get the person out of it.


If the person always sits near you at lunch, try moving all of your friends to a different lunch table far away from your usual spot, so the person has a hard time finding you.
If you and your friends always go to the same place for dinner on Friday nights, pick a place across town and don't mention the change to the person.
If the person always follows you around the halls, change your routine for getting to class.

, If your friends really do like that person or are too nice to be honest with that person, then you may have to find a new friend or even an entirely new group of friends. The person will be less likely to bother you if you're hanging out with all new people, and if you have new friends, it's likely you'll be hanging out at new places and the person will be less likely to find you or follow you around.

"
"
Cry — a lot.,
Talk about how great you are.,
Be a flake.",How to Get Rid of Someone You Don't Like3," You should cry or just be visibly upset most of the time when you're around that person. Talk about how you're having an emotional breakdown and how everything in the world is so sad and unfair and how you just can't stop crying and being so, so sad. At first, the person may feel honored to be allowed to help you, but if you keep this up for a few weeks, he may walk away on his own.

, Everyone loves a good narcissist. Spend all of your time talking about how hot you are, how many people love you, and how you're going to be rich and famous so, so soon. Look in the mirror constantly, reapply your makeup, mention how stunning you look all the time, and just spin around talking about how you're wearing the best outfit ever.


Use the words ""me"" and ""I"" as often as possible, and cut the person off any time he mentions himself.
When the person talks about himself, just look confused, like you can't possibly understand what it has to do with you.

, Flakes are the best kind of people. Make elaborate plans to meet up with that person, assuring him that you won't flake again. When the time comes, don't show up, and don't answer calls from that person. The next day, you can say, ""I completely forgot!"" You can also give a really bad excuse, like, ""I had to wash my hair!"" or ""I just couldn't stop watching Hoarders!""


This should make the person avoid you in no time at all.

Set some boundaries.,
Make excuses.,
Ask your parents to set limits.,
Write a letter.,
Don’t talk bad about your friend to other friends.,
Be prepared to feel uncomfortable around them.,
Find a new circle of friends.",How to Get Rid of a Bad Friend2," If you need some space from your friend and are not comfortable talking with them about it, you may decide to opt for setting some of your own limits on how you spend time with them. Determine your comfort level and stick with it.


For example, you may decide that you are only comfortable seeing your friend when around other friends, or you may only want to talk to them in school.
You could decide you want to avoid answering their calls or reading their texts.
If your friend asks you why you’re being distant, you could say, “I just need some space,” or “I’ve got a lot on my mind” and leave it at that.

, If your friend invites you somewhere, and you don’t want to go, you could make an excuse to get out of the invitation. You could say you have a family commitment, too much homework, or are not feeling well, for example. However, keep in mind that this can get complicated, especially if you have some mutual friends. You will need to keep all of your excuses straight and this can get confusing.


If your friend says, “Hey, want to hang out this weekend?” you could say, “I’m pretty busy all weekend with work and family stuff.”
Keep in mind that if your friend doesn’t know you want to stop being friends with them, you may need to keep making excuses for a long time to not see them, and that can be draining, not to mention dishonest. You will eventually need to be direct with your friend and stop making excuses. Making excuses will only lead to stress, so it’s important to only use this as a very short-term solution if you feel that it is necessary.
Don’t make up an excuse to get out of hanging out with your friend and then do something else instead. If you are saying you’re sick, stay home. Don’t show up at a friend’s house an hour later. This makes you look dishonest to everyone.

, Ask your parents to “make” you stop hanging out with your friend. Have your parents help you put some distance between you and the friend. This may be easy if your parents do not like this friend.You could tell your friend that your parents want you to spend more time on your homework, or don’t want you hanging out so late on weekends -- whatever excuse you need to employ to get out of the situation. Most parents are generally okay with being perceived as the “bad guy” in order to help their kid out of a difficult situation.
Talk to your parents about having problems with a friend. Tell them why you no longer want to be friends with them, giving specific examples of their behavior. Ask your parents to help you manage the situation.
You could say, “Lately Tara has been really mean. She’s picking fights with me, and she’s hanging around with a group of kids I’m not comfortable with. I really don’t want to to hang out with her outside of school anymore, so I was hoping you guys could help me. The next time she asks me to do something with her, could you help me find a way to tell her no?”

, Consider writing a letter if you want your friend to know how you feel, but you don’t want to confront them directly. Writing a letter allows you to spend as much time as you need to get the words just the way you want them, and it also helps you make sense of your own feelings.You could say, “Dear Juan, I know you are wondering why I haven’t been talking to you much lately. I thought I would write this letter to explain why.” Then you could tell your friend how you are feeling and what you would like to see happen going forward.

, While you may no longer like or want to be around this person, take the high road and refuse to gossip about your friend or try to turn your other friends against them. If you are no longer friends with this person because they treated you badly, it may be only a matter of time before other friends begin to see this person’s true colors on their own.If a friend of yours asks, “Why aren’t you talking to Bennett?” you could say, “I really don’t want to talk about him behind his back,” or “I’d like to keep it private right now.”
If you need to vent about your situation, talk to someone not at all connected to your social circle. For example, reach out to a friend at another school, or your cousin who lives far away and ask if you could talk.

, When there is unresolved tension in a relationship, it is usually fairly awkward to be around another person. This is why speaking to your friend in person is preferable to giving them the silent treatment if at all possible. You will likely feel less uncomfortable knowing where you stand with somebody.


If you are uncomfortable being around your friend, you could try moving away from them and trying to get some physical distance between the two of you. If you are hanging out in a group, try starting a separate conversation with someone else.

, Having a group of friends who care about and value you is important. Feeling that you belong matters, particularly if you are a teenager. If you no longer feel that you fit in or belong with your group of friends, make some new friends or find a different group of people to hang out with.If you are friendly with a group of people you normally don’t hang out with outside of school, like fellow band members or teammates, see if they want to get together outside of class or practice.
If you are involved in any activities outside of school, like a part-time job or a youth group, try spending time with people you know from those places.

End all communication as a last resort.,
Recognize when ending a friendship suddenly may be appropriate.,
Defriend or block your friend from social networks.,
Enlist help.",How to Get Rid of a Bad Friend3," Cutting off your friend without warning may seem like the easiest solution, but it is not fair to them to not give them a chance to understand what is happening. Even if your friend was a bad, hurtful friend to you, they still have the right to know what is happening.Do not “ghost” a friend just because you want to avoid confrontation (as long as you know that a confrontation would not end with a physical fight). Breaking up with a friend is uncomfortable and painful, but that doesn’t mean you should avoid it.
Ghosting a friend may cause you to lose some social clout. It makes you look like you took the easy way out. It can also cause the person you are ghosting a lot of pain and uncertainty.
Consider which method would be the best way for you to stop communicating with a friend. For example, you might decide that it is best to tell them in-person, over the phone, or via email.

, Most of the time, it is good to have a conversation with the other person to let them know you do not want to be friends anymore, no matter how vague and brief it may be. But there may be times when ghosting someone is the best option:


Your friend enables your bad behavior, particularly if it is an addiction issue.You feel controlled or manipulated by your friend, and worry how they would react to an announcement that you no longer wanted to be friends.You fear for your safety, and are concerned about your physical well-being if you talk to your friend directly.

, Cut off their access to your life on social media. Avoid messaging them or responding to their messages.If you choose to remain friends with them on social media, prevent them from seeing posts you don’t want them to see. Do not comment on their feeds.
You could also choose to unfollow them so you no longer see their updates.

, If you do not feel comfortable talking to your friend, you could ask your parents to get in touch with your friend’s parents. This is an option you may want to use if you are feeling threatened by the other person. Otherwise, you may wish to try to handle it on your own first.Ask your parents to inform your friend’s parents about the situation, and/or that you no longer want to hang out with this person. You could say, “You know I’ve been trying to distance myself from Jamal, but he won’t leave me alone. Do you think you could talk to his parents for me?”
You could also ask a teacher or school guidance counselor for help.
You could say, “I’ve been trying to work through some problems with David, but he won’t leave me alone. I don’t want to be friends with him anymore, and can’t think of anything else to do. Could you help me?”

Think about the friendships you currently have.,
Listen to what the people you can trust are saying.,
Decide whether or not it's likely to be best to leave the whole group of friends.,
Decide how you'll leave the friends.,
Consider giving yourself some time before seeking new friendships.,
Decide what you don't want in a friendship again.,
Write down what you do want in a friendship.,
Begin seeking new friends.,
Take it easy.,
Check that you really connect with the new friends.,
Make overtures of close friendship when you feel comfortable and can trust the new friends.,
Keep watch on how you feel over time.",How to Get Better Friends," Perhaps it is just a few of the friends who are problematic, or maybe it's all of the friendship group. That is something that only you can decide from what you know of them and how their attitudes and actions impact you. In working this out for yourself, consider the following:


Which friends are constantly dragging you into trouble?
Which friends cause you to give in to doing things you'd rather not do?
How do you feel when spending time with each of these friends, both individually, and as part of the group?
Can you voice your own preferences, opinions, likes and dislikes without being laughed at, told you're being stupid or shouted down?;
, Most of all, is your family concerned about your friendships at the moment? What do your parents, siblings, partner/spouse or other family members think? Have they made comments that have given you cause to think about how healthy your friendship group is?


In many cases, family can be a real help in seeing what you can't see. They usually mean well for you and don't want to see you get hurt.
In some cases, family may not be seeing the right things or understand. In that case, you are the best judge of the situation.

, In some cases, there may be a friend or two who doesn't want to stick with this friendship group either, and may like to bolt with you. In other cases, you may feel that you can't trust any of your current friends as future friends and you just want to cut ties with them all. Once again, this is dependent on your situation and which friends are behaving in which manner toward you.


Talk to the friends you trust––if you can absolutely trust them. Tell them about your intentions to split from the group. Don't force them to make the same decision; instead, suggest that they might like to think about doing the same as you and if they do, to leave at the same time you do.
How do you know if a friend can be trusted? You never do one hundred percent. But it starts with your own gut feelings, with knowing what you've been through and how much this person has stuck by your side in the past and not let your down. Go from those things and make your decision as to their trustworthiness.

, You might just up and leave, cutting all contact with them from this point on. You might tell them that you're too busy to catch up anymore. Or, perhaps tell them that you're no longer interested in doing the things they're doing. Find the angle that works easiest for you, then move out of the friendship group as best you can.

, Even though your former friends were not the best of people to be hanging with, they were people you bonded with. It'll be hard to let go at first and you may feel lonely, lost, disappointed, angry and a range of other very real and understandable feelings. Give yourself the time and space to work through this before seeking out new friendships. Family can be a good source of support at this time, as can focusing on work, hobbies, sport and learning new things.

, This will likely be all of the things you didn't enjoy in your old friendships. You will likely want to be around people you can trust, who don't intimidate or force you into doing things you don't like and who respect you for who you are and not what you can do for them. It is important to be clear about your boundaries, just so that you don't fall in with a similar crowd and repeat the pattern of problems from the past.

, It's time to be positive from this point onward. Think of all the positive things you want from friendships, such as trust, loyalty, respect, care, supportive actions, reciprocated help, clean living, pleasant nature, particular interests, etc.

, Look for friends where you are most likely to meet people who match the things you're seeking in good friends. This might be through mutual sports or hobbies, at work, in class or studies, through family or trusted friends, and so forth.

, Get to know the people you hope will become friends before considering them as close friends. Be cautious at first while still being friendly. Let them know that you need time to feel comfortable around new people if they seem a little taken aback at your caution.

, Do they have the same goals, aspirations and interests as you? Are they doing the sorts of things that will keep you on the straight and narrow, getting you where you'd like to be headed? Do you feel happy, comfortable and accepted for who you are with these people? These are all important questions to ask then answer with respect to potential new friends.


Talk openly. Do your potential friends respect your views, opinions, and ideas? Do they respect you even when they disagree?

, Explain to them that while you needed time to be sure of your friendships with them, that you feel you've bonded with them well and would like to be considered long-term friends with them.

, You'll know from past experience if you're on the receiving end of disrespect, meanness, bullying or goading. If it does happen again, confront the people in question quickly and say that you won't stand for and will leave the friendship if it continues. You must mean this for it to work. However, given all the work you've done to break the cycle and find different friends, this should hopefully not be an issue anymore and your new friends should be ideal.

Try to sympathize with those who left you out.,
Reframe negative thoughts.,
Act like you are not upset in front of those who excluded you.,
Consider asking what happened.",How to Get Over Being Left Out2," Although being left out hurts, it might help you to consider what might be going on with the people who leave you out. Chances are that their decision to leave you out is more about them and their insecurities than it is about you.


People who exclude others on purpose probably have some insecurities and biases that are skewing their ability to interact with certain people in a kind way.People who exclude others also want to be in control and they may be leaving you out because they see you as a threat to their control., Negative thinking is common when something bad happens, such as being left out. However, you can challenge and reframe your negative thoughts to improve the way that you feel.For example, after being left out, you might find that you think to yourself, “Nobody likes me!” Of course, this thought is not true or realistic. It is an overreaction. To reframe this thought, you might change it to something like, “I am a good person and a good friend. The people who really matter in my life enjoy spending time with me.”

, If the exclusion was intentional, then it is best to avoid showing your emotions to those who excluded you. Bullies often use exclusion to get a rise out of people, so even if you are upset about being excluded, try not to show it. You may be giving a bully what he wants by showing that you are upset about being excluded.

Instead, try to act like you are not bothered by it.

For example, if you were not invited to a party or some other social event over the weekend, try telling someone about something fun that you did with your family. If someone mentions the party, then try saying something like, “It sounds like you had fun. That’s awesome! I didn’t know about it, but I was too busy anyways. What else did you do this weekend?”

, If you think that you were left out by accident or if you are confused about why you were left out, then you might consider talking to the person(s) who left you out.You might find out that it was an honest mistake, or you might have an opportunity to point out to the person that his or her actions were not appropriate.


If you think it was a mistake, then try saying something like, “I think there must have been a mistake with your birthday invitations. I did not receive an invite to your birthday party.”
If you think that you were left out on purpose, then try saying, “I noticed that I was not invited to your party. It is your party, so you have the right to invite who you want, but I am just curious about why I was not invited.”

"
"
Forgive the people who excluded you.,
Look for inclusion elsewhere.,
Invite people to do things with you.,
Enjoy your alone time.",How to Get Over Being Left Out3," Forgiveness is more about you than it is about other people. Carrying resentments about people who have hurt your feelings is harmful to your well-being. Therefore, it is beneficial to your happiness and well-being to forgive the people who have hurt you, even if they do not apologize to you.Try writing a letter to the person that you do not send. In the letter, express how being left out made you feel and explain that you want to forgive the person for your own benefit.

, If a group of people have been excluding you on a regular basis, then it may be time to look for some new friends.Real friends do not exclude you. Look for people who will appreciate you for who you are and who will not do things to hurt your feelings, such as leaving you out.


Try joining a special interest club or after-school sports team to meet people who will share your interests.

, Another way to avoid being left out is to take the initiative and invite people to do things with you. Invite your friends to meet you at the mall or to go see a movie with you over the weekend. Or, throw a party and invite everyone, even those who have excluded you in the past.

, It is hard to be left out, but sometimes having time to yourself is a luxury so try to enjoy it if you can. If you are left out and you don’t have anything else to do, then try to do things that you really want to do on your own.


For example, you can read that book you have been dying to check out, finish drawing a self-portrait, take a long bubble bath, or watch one of your favorite movies.

Consider attempting to repair the rift.",How to Forget People Who Don't Want to Be Friends with You," If someone did not want to be your friend, you may find yourself dwelling on this. If a potential friend rejected you, you may have a lot of questions as to what went wrong and why. However, try to avoid dwelling. Unless they tell you up front, you will never know for sure why someone rejected you. Therefore, there's little point in worrying.Think about how close you really were to this person. If you were just getting to know someone, only to find they weren't interested in your friendship, how well did you really know them? You may be better off forgetting what occurred and moving on.
Be aware of your thoughts. When you find yourself dwelling on something, do something to distract yourself. Read a book or watch television.;
, If you're online a lot, avoid looking at social media profiles of the person who rejected you. Pouring over someone's Facebook profile will only re-open old wounds. You may start wondering why they rejected your friendship all over again.Try to block seeing the person's updates for awhile. This will help you from inadvertently seeing their pages when browsing social media.
You might want to stay off social media altogether for a bit, especially if you're struggling to accept the rejection.

, If you view rejection as solely negative, you'll have trouble forgetting it. Instead of seeing rejection as a failure, see it as one in a series of endeavors that did not work out. This way, it'll be easier for you to forget and move on to the next thing.Think about it this way. You pushed yourself out of your comfort zone and tried to make a new friend. Many people are terrified of opening up their social circles. You deserve some credit for trying to meet someone new.
This friendship did not work out. That's normal. Many people have a lot of commitments and relationships to attend to. If someone simply did not click with you as a friend, they may have decided to move on.
Look towards the future. While this new friend did not work out, there are plenty of opportunities left to meet people and make new friends.

, It's okay to feel pain after being rejected. If you try to completely forget negative feelings, you may end up feeling them more. If you really want to let go, embrace the pain briefly. This will allow you to release any anger and resentment and take steps forward.No one likes being rejected. It hurts when someone does not want to be your friend. Allow yourself to be human and grieve the loss. Give yourself a few hours or a day to be sad.
Then, focus your energies forward. Think something like, ""That was sad. I wish it would have ended differently, but I need to move on now.""

, If you're shy by nature, and have difficulty making new friends, someone rejecting you can hurt more. A good way to forget someone who did not want to be your friend is to try to expand your social network. Find places where you can make new friends.Make a goal of interacting with people more. You can start small. For example, promise yourself to make more small talk at work this week.
From there, push yourself more. Try to, say, go to a party you were invited to, or head to a social place, like a coffee shop or a community center, alone and chat up others.

, You may feel personally rejected if someone did not want to be your friend. However, this may not be personal. Try to look at the situation somewhat objectively. If you're being honest with yourself, was the rejection truly personal?Think about relationships in your own life. Chances are, you've rejected someone's friendship in the past. Maybe a classmate or co-worker kept asking you to hang out, and you kept making up excuses. Was this personal? Probably not. You likely just did not click with that particular person, or were too busy for new friendships.
The person who rejected your friendship may have done so for similar reasons. Maybe they have a lot on their plate and aren't looking for new friends. Maybe they thought you were perfectly nice, but did not feel a strong enough connection with you. There's a good chance the rejection was not a reflection of your worth as a person.

, Rejection can cause a major blow to self confidence. You may be left feeling bad about yourself in the wake of a rejection. Instead of indulging feelings of self-pity, try to find ways to build your self confidence.Make a list of everything you like about yourself. Think about everything you've done well throughout the week. Take stock of your talents and abilities. This will all make you feel like a worthwhile person.
You should also strive to remember your current relationships. Chances are, you have a lot of good friends now. Just because one person was not interested in your friendship does not mean you're not a good friend.

, If you find yourself engaging in a negative internal monologue, stop. Replace negative thoughts with positive ones. This will help bolster your confidence and sense of self-worth.Notice your thoughts throughout the day, particularly in regards to the failed friendship. You may, for example, hear the person who rejected you made plans with a friend of yours. You think to yourself, ""I guess I'm just not cool enough to be friends with this person.""
Stop and redirect your thoughts. Replace negative thoughts with more positive ones. For example, ""I didn't click with Sharon, but I know how much Felice values my friendship. I must be doing something right to have a great friend like Felice.""

, Just because you're feeling rejected now does not mean it will last forever. When you start to indulge feelings of negativity, stop and remind yourself of your worth. You are not going to feel bad about this rejection forever, even if it feels that way now. Eventually, you will move on and find new, better friends., You can learn from being rejected. Instead of seeing it as inherently negative, see it as an opportunity to build your resiliency.Rejection is a part of life. A fear of social rejection can lead you to limiting your social circle and interactions.
The more rejections you get, the better you get at handling them. Therefore, see this rejection as practice. You've learned what it's like to have a potential friend reject you. Now that you've survived this, you'll be less nervous about it happening again in the future.

, No one is perfect. Most of the time, rejection is not a reflection of you. However, could you have done anything differently? If you can think of any ways you can grow, you may benefit as a person from this rejection.Think about your interactions with this person. Did you make crude or negative comments that may have made someone uncomfortable? Did you share too much information too soon? Were you flaky on plans, or maybe too rigid about plans?
Much of the time, a rejection is not about you. However, if you think you did something, recognizing what it was can help you grow.

, How important is this person to you? If you had your heart set on being their friend, you may want to repair the rift. This is especially useful if you believe you did something to cause it.You can try sending a quick text or email addressing the issue. You don't have to go into too many details.
Try something simple. Say something like, ""Hey, I'm sorry if I was a little flaky about plans. I do want to work on being friends, even if it didn't seem like it. Let me know if you want to get coffee sometime!""

Reflect on what happened.,
Beware of assumptions.,

Talk about things that you'd like to change.,
Make plans.",How to Get a Friend Back," There is most likely a specific reason for the rift in your friendship. Consider the situation as objectively as you can. Does one of you bear a larger portion of involvement?


Even if you feel wronged by your friend, consider the possibility that somewhere along the line you have also hurt them in subtle ways that you weren't aware of.
On the other hand, if you know you're the one who made a mistake, spend some time reflecting on what you did and why, and how you can prevent doing it again.;
, If there seems to be no clear reason for your friend's distance, don't jump to conclusions. It may have nothing to do with you; your friend might have something troubling them., You may want your friend back, but until you're ready to acknowledge your own mistakes and/or forgive your friend theirs, you won't get anywhere.


That said, you may need to have a long talk with your friend before the wounds start to heal. The important thing is to make sure you feel ready and willing to put things back together, rather than nurse a grudge.

, If you feel you need to apologize, be specific about what you're apologizing for. Make sure it's sincere: what are you really sorry about?For example, if you've been ignoring your friend because you're spending all your time with a new love interest, it isn't appropriate to apologize for spending time with this other person. Instead, talk about how you're sorry you haven't been making time for your friend.

, It's probably best to talk in person if you can: body language can communicate a lot more than just your voices and may help avoid misunderstandings. However, if that's not possible, call your friend to talk.


If you ask to meet, try to avoid vague phrases like, ""We need to talk."" These can put your friend on the defensive. Instead, try a more emotionally rooted approach like, ""I miss you,"" or ""I was just hoping we could spend a little time together."", If you're too shy or your friend won't see you, writing a short note can help break down the barrier. Sometimes expressing yourself on paper is easier than in person. Try to be simple and straightforward; at the end, suggest a casual, no-pressure meeting, such as going for coffee or a walk.

, Tell your friend how important they are to you, and that you miss them. While it may be tempting to get this talk over with as soon as possible, cutting corners could work against you. This is the opportunity to wear your heart on your sleeve.


Again, avoid one-liners like, ""Let's bury the hatchet"" - such contrived phrases might put your friend on guard., Again, it's best if you approach the conversation without preconceived notions of how they're feeling or what they're going to say. Keep an open mind, and give them as long as they need to say whatever it is they need to.They may need a cue from you, like ""I'm sure I made you feel pretty awful,"" or ""I'd love to be friends again. Do you think that's possible?""Listen without interrupting, even if what they say triggers certain responses in you.

, You may have been ready to talk things through, but perhaps your friend wasn't quite. Both of you might need time to process what the other has said. You've made a big, important step initiating this talk - now step back a bit so your friend can consider.


This is especially important to keep in mind if you don't receive a positive response at first. In a few weeks or months, your friend may still come around., Your friend may need time, even more time than you expected, to mull things over. Friendships are complex, so don't expect this to mend overnight., If you are both ready to resume your friendship, this transition is a good moment to agree on a few basic things if necessary. This is also a chance for both of you to learn and grow from each other.


For example, maybe you'll agree to be a better listener and your friend will agree not criticize you so much.This doesn't mean, however, that you should make drastic changes to yourself to please your friend. If your friend makes demands you're uncomfortable with, you need to consider whether this is really a healthy friendship based on love and mutual respect.

, When you feel you've both talked everything through and things are on the mend, make a plan to see each other again. Suggesting a fun activity that you used to do together (going for a hike, making dinner, going to a movie) prevents dwelling on the problem and can help get your relationship back on track."

Know that it’s okay to cry if you feel sad. Crying is a healthy way to express and release your sadness.If you do not feel like crying, you should not feel obligated to cry. Whether you cry or not, it’s important to acknowledge and accept any emotions that you’re feeling.;
, Exercising your body releases endorphins that help you feel happier and more positive about life.Going for a walk outside has the added benefit of getting fresh air and sunlight, which can also help to improve your mood.

, Talking to someone you trust can help you process your emotions and give you an outside perspective on your situation. A friend or counselor may be able to help you see things in a different light and not feel so bad about losing a friendship.


If your former friend left town, try calling a mutual friend who might also be missing them. Talking about your former friend together can help you both get over your sadness. You can say, “Hi Mary, I’m feeling very sad since Joan left town. I really miss laughing at her jokes. Do you miss her, too?”
If you’ve had a fight with your former friend, call someone you trust to talk about your feelings of anger or betrayal. Tell them what happened in your fight and ask for their objective opinion on what happened. For example, you could say, “I got into a horrible fight with Sue last week. I asked her for the $20 she owed me, and she yelled at me and told me I was petty. Do you think I was petty for asking for her to pay me back? Do you think she overreacted?”

, Having fun with other people who are still your friends can help lessen the hurt of losing a friend. If you are feeling sad thinking about the friend you lost, call a different friend and ask them to spend time with you. You can invite them to watch a movie, have some food or drinks together, listen to some music, or play a game. Whatever you invite them to do, make sure it’s something that you really enjoy doing.

, Finding new friends is very important if you lost a friend because you moved to a new place. When you move to a new place, you may find that you don’t have any friends near you. Go to a place where you can socialize and meet new people.Look online for community meet-ups. Many cities have meet-up groups that share a common interest like playing board games, knitting, or playing music. Check social media sites and meet-up message boards to find out what’s going on in your area.
Volunteer. Look for volunteer opportunities with community service groups working in fields that interest you. Not only can you meet new people, but you also might learn something and have fun doing it, too.
Join a community sports team. Parks and gyms often host community sports activities that are easy to join. If there are no organized sports teams in your area, look for community basketball courts or soccer fields where people engage in pick-up games. People who play these games are usually friendly and welcome new people to join their teams.

, Engage in hobbies, sports, and other activities that you enjoy doing. If you’re not sure what you like doing, try new hobbies like arts and crafts projects, sports activities like bike riding or kayaking, learn to play a musical instrument, or build a birdhouse., It’s common to accumulate items that remind you of your former friend. These items can include gifts you received, objects you purchased together, or things that remind you of experiences you had together. If the object reminds you of your former friend and causes you sadness or anger every time you see it, then it is better for your mental health to put that object out of your sight for a period of time, if not permanently.


If the item is something valuable, such as a family heirloom, a piece of jewelry, or electronic equipment, consider returning the item to your former friend. You may not have the right to keep precious objects just because your friendship ended. To determine if you should return it or not, ask yourself if you would want them to return the object to you if they had something of yours that was valuable.
Other, less valuable items, such as ticket stubs or items of clothing, you may want to throw away or donate to a charity.
Think twice before destroying or getting rid of items that are irreplaceable, such as photographs or works of art. Once you have recovered from the pain of losing your friend, you may regret that you got rid of these items. If you think you might find a particular item special in the future, place it in storage by boxing it up and hiding it in a closet or attic, or asking someone else to store it for you.

, Delete their phone number, email, and mailing address out of your contact lists so that you are not tempted to contact him or her in moments of weakness or anger. Deleting this information will also prevent you from feeling angry or upset from accidentally running across this person’s name in your contact lists.


Don’t delete your former friend’s contact information if you are no longer friends because you or they moved away. It’s okay to call or email an old friend, even if you haven’t spoken to them in a few months or even years. You may take a vacation to the place they moved to one day and contact them to visit.

, Seeing posts and updates from a former friend on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, can reawaken the hurt and anger from ending a friendship. Unfriend or unfollow your former friend’s accounts to avoid reawakening those feelings and to help you move forward with your life.


Even if you still like your former friend, you may want to unfollow them on social media until you are over the pain of not seeing them regularly. Staying in continued contact with your former friend may make it difficult for you to move on with your life and meet new people.

, Certain places will remind you of your former friend for a long time, such as a restaurant that the two of you often went to together or sports facilities where you played on a team together. If possible, avoid these places until your strong feelings subside. There may be some places that are impossible to avoid, such as school, a workplace, or even your home. If it is impossible to avoid certain places, invite a different friend to accompany you there and try to make new memories in order to associate new, positive feelings with that place.

, If you are still living in the same area as your former friend, it is likely that you may run into them at some point. This experience will probably make you feel very uncomfortable the first time it happens, especially if you had a fight that ended your friendship. Do not ignore your former friend in this situation, as that can only make matters more uncomfortable and awkward. Instead, acknowledge their presence by making eye contact and saying “hi” or nodding your head.Only make conversation if you want to do so. If your former friend approaches you to start a conversation, politely tell them that you do not want to talk. For example, you can say: “It’s nice to see you, but I’m really not ready to talk to you right now.” Alternatively, you can tell them that you are too busy to talk, and politely walk away.

, Understanding what caused your friendship to break up can help you figure out what the best way to move past it is. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you more quickly deal with and overcome feelings of anger, betrayal, and sadness., Write a letter that expresses all the anger, frustration, and heartache that you feel about your friendship ending. Include everything that you will miss about having this friend in your life.Writing all these thoughts down as if you were going to say all of them to your former friend will give you a sense of closure. Once you’re done writing the letter, store it in a safe place, throw it away, or even burn it, but don’t send it. Sending the letter could make matters worse by re-opening communication and saying hurtful things., Consider whether your friendship was healthy with mutual respect or if it was a toxic, harmful friendship. Toxic friends are ones who treat you badly by insulting you, being critical, or being overly demanding of your time and energy.If you find that your entire friendship was harmful to you, be glad knowing that it is behind you.
If you find that your friendship was a very strong one, consider whether or not you really want to cut this person out of your life. You may want to stay in contact with them and look for ways to repair your friendship. Even if a friend moved far away, you can retain a friendship with them by writing to each other and talking over the internet or on the phone.

, Talking to other people who know both you and your former friend can help give you some perspective on the ending of your friendship. They may also be able to give you some perspective on whether or not your friendship was a healthy one., If you determine that your friendship was a good one and that you do not want to lose this person as a friend, contact them and ask if you can see them again. If you did something that caused them pain, apologize for it. If they did something that caused you pain, explain to them what they did and why it hurt you. Tell them that you forgive them and that their friendship is very important to you.

Does your friend only occasionally act clingy or is she constantly trying to claim your full attention? Figuring out how serious and recurring her need for your attention is can help you decide what the next step should be.Maybe your friend was recently stressed out and needs some extra attention. If this is the case, the problem should resolve itself.
You may need to try and set boundaries if your friend is constantly demanding your attention.;
, Using excuses may work, in the short-term. However, it can get tiring and it sets up a false kind of boundary. Whenever possible, try to not use one-time excuses to avoid hanging out with your friend. If you don't want to visit with her, you may have to be more direct. Being direct can help her understand your needs and boundaries more clearly as opposed to making excuses.Don't say something like “I've got a doctors appointment” to buy yourself some free time.
You will likely grow tired of coming up with excuses. Being direct can be more effective.

, If your friend is truly being over-bearing and clingy, there is nothing wrong with focusing on your needs. A good friendship should go both ways, being a kind of give-and-take that works to build a stronger bond. If your friend is taking more than she gives back, it's perfectly fine to let them know how you feel and what you need.Don't be afraid to tell your friend that you feel like she is asking too much of you.
A good friend will listen to you and give you the time and space that you need.
Your own well-being is important. Don't neglect your own needs for those of your friend.

, Thinking about your own needs over those of your friend may make you feel guilty or selfish. However, it's perfectly fine to consider thinking about the nature of your friendship and any problems it may have. Realizing that it's okay to think about what you need in a friendship can help you to avoid feelings of guilt.


It's important to remember that your own needs are just as important.
It can also help to remember that good friendships should make both people feel great and supported by the relationship.

, You may feel that your friendship can be saved. However, you may also realize that you don't feel like it can continue. Depending on how clingy your friend is being, you will need to make a choice to either work to fix the relationship or end it.


Think about steps you may have already taken to fix the relationship. Have you already spoken to your friend about your space needs? Have you tried other strategies to distance yourself? If so, what happened? Did it work for a while or not at all?
Consider how the friendship makes you feel. If it is draining and stressful to spend time with your friend, then it may be necessary to end it.
Ask yourself if seeing your friend only once per week or twice per month would be enough distance, or if you really do need to end the friendship completely.

, Your friend may feel that you are truly her only friend. If this is the case, it's easy to understand why she may want to spend so much time with you. Introducing your friend to some new people may help your friend to feel more connected to other people and start to branch out a bit more. This can be a good way for you both to enjoy the company of other people and still maintain your friendship.You can try hanging out together in larger groups to let your friend get to know other people.
Ask your other friends to try and spend time with your clingy friend.
If you tell your friend you are busy and can't hang out, suggest that they meet with other people who you both know.

, Don't feel pressured into meeting with your friend if you don't want to. Whenever you are making plans, make sure that it's a plan you think would be enjoyable and that you have time for. Always make sure that any time you are meeting with your friend that it will be good for both of you.


Don't feel pressured into meeting at a time or place that you don't want to. If you don’t want to meet up with your friend, then you might say something like, “That won’t work for me. Can we plan on a different day?”
You might also want to set some basic limits. For example, you might meet your friend once a month for a movie night. You might approach this limit by saying something like, “I like seeing movies with you, but I really only have the time and money to see a movie once per month. Let’s make the first Friday of the month our movie night.”

, If your friend is constantly calling or texting, you might need to tell her some specific days and times that are okay for her to contact you. You might be at work or busy during certain times or days and unable to speak with your friend, or you might just not want to see your friend on certain days of the week.


Try letting your friend know when you are free. For example, you might say, “I am really busy on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, so I might not be able to talk at all on those days. However, you can call me after 5pm on Tuesday or Thursday, or any time on Saturday.”

, In some cases, a friend may be clingy because of an issue that he or she cannot face alone. For example, it is possible that your friend might be clingy because of issues at home, a health problem, or something else that she does not want to face. Spending lots of time with you might be a way to distract herself from these issues.Try talking to your friend to see if you can determine if there is something going on that may be causing your friend to be so clingy. For example, you might say something like, “I have noticed that you are spending a lot more time with me. Is everything alright?”
If you friend confides in you that she is struggling with something, then you might encourage her to speak to a counselor. For example, you might say, “That sounds really difficult. I think it might be a good idea for you to talk to someone who can really help you.”

, If your friend doesn't respond to your lowered levels of attention or other statements that you would like some time apart, you may need to confront her. Try to meet in a place where you can have a clear conversation and let your friend know exactly how you are feeling and what you need from her.You don't have to be mean or aggressive. Instead, focus on being honest and direct with your friend.
You can talk with your friend about this in a friendly and understating tone. Try to state your feelings and needs while being empathetic to your friend.
Try to speak using “I” statements and explain how you feel rather than how you view your friend’s clingy behavior.
You might try saying something like “I really enjoy your company but I also need time to myself. I think we should see a little less of each other for a while.”

, To get some space for yourself, you may have to set up some clear boundaries first. By setting clear boundaries, you may upset your friend, but you will be respecting yourself in the process. To set boundaries, you will first need to identify your personal space needs.Think about how much time you need to yourself to be happy. How often does your friend interfere with this alone time?
Think about how you would like your friend’s behavior to change. What types of things would you like her to stop doing or to at least do less? Texting? Calling? Dropping by unannounced?

, Clearly setting boundaries might be necessary to let your friend know what you are comfortable with and what is not acceptable. This can help both of you express your feelings about the relationship and learn if it can continue. Be honest, kind, and understanding when setting your boundaries.If your friend invites herself along to events that you had already planned, then you might try saying “I love doing things with you, but I already made my plans for this night. Let's meet up another time.”
If your friend calls or texts you late at night or at other inconvenient times, then you will need to explain to your friend what you would like her to do instead. For example, you might say something like, “I love our conversations, but it is hard for me to give you my full attention when I am at work. Can you call me a little after I finish work instead, like at 5:30?”
If your friend gets upset or bombards you with more texts if you don’t respond right away, then you might say, “I enjoy getting a text from you but I can’t always respond right away. Can you try not to send me more than one text when you are waiting for a response?”
To get your friend to respect your privacy when you are at home or out doing something without her, you might say, “I look forward to seeing you, but it is not always convenient for you to drop by unannounced. Can you just send me a text or call me before you come over to see if I am free?”

, Having this conversation with your friend will likely be difficult. It may be tempting to give concessions or speak in a way that doesn't express your feelings or needs accurately. Always speak clearly and directly when telling your friend that you need more personal space.


Don't change your mind half-way through the conversation.
Avoid being unclear. Saying something like ""I love hanging out with you, but maybe, I don't know. Let's meet, once in a while? I mean, whenever, no big deal."" is unclear, not confident, and won't get your message across.

, Your friend may still try to enter into your personal space or go beyond the boundaries you've outlined. She may use guilt or other tactics to get you to change your mind, causing you to give in and give them attention. It's important that you stay strong and keep your rules in place.Giving in and breaking your own rules will send the message that your friend can still do whatever she wants.
Although it may be difficult, keeping your own rules in place is the only way to address this problem.

, If your friend continues to ignore your requests for time apart or doesn't like that you asked for it in the first place, you may need to end the relationship. Although it can be painful, ending a relationship with someone who ignores your own well-being can ultimately be the best move for both of you.Friends who won't give you space or time apart, especially after you talk with them about it, are unlikely to respect you.
Your friend may care more about her own needs than yours. This isn't how good friendships function.
Don't let feelings of guilt or a sense of owing your friend keep you in a bad friendship. If they aren't respecting your needs, it's okay to leave the relationship.

Go to Google, or your search engine of choice. (Not all search engines do as well accessing various social media sites, so if the first search engine you try doesn’t give you the kinds of results you would like, try another.)
Enter in the person’s first and last name and click the “Search” button, or hit the enter key.
Scroll through the results and see if anything about your friend comes up.

, A lot of times, simply entering a person’s first name and last name won’t be enough to locate the person you are looking for. This is especially likely if the person has a very common name, like “Mary Smith”, so try adding in additional information to narrow down your search. Place quotation marks around the person’s first and last name to keep them together as a search term, and then try various searches that include additional information.You might add a geographical location, and search for: ""Mary Smith"" Evergreen, WA.

Try adding a school name, such as ""John Jones"" Remington High School Colorado.

Try adding an employer name, such as ""Rachel Roberts"" Boeing.

Keep experimenting like this for awhile, chances are you will eventually hit on the right person.

, The next easiest way to track a person down is to use the social media site Facebook. Facebook is especially useful because it allows people to record (and you to search for!) information about former schools, employers, etc. If you do not already have a Facebook account, it is best to set one up so that you will be able to contact your friend when you do find her. Be sure to include a photo so that your friend might recognize your message. Then enter the person’s name into the “Search Facebook” bar at the top of the screen, and begin scrolling through the list of names that pop up.Facebook provides a lot of automated assistance in locating people, and will take information you have entered about your other friends, and your own employment and educational history to narrow down the list.
Remember that Facebook gives its users the opportunity to keep their names from appearing in public searches, so often you can find people within Facebook that you could not find using a Google search.
New social networking sites are always appearing, and you never know which one your friend might be using. If Facebook doesn’t turn anything up, try searching other sites like Google+, Ello, etc.

, At this point, you will have hopefully found some contact information for your friend, or someone who you believe is likely to be your old friend. It may be an email address, a phone number, a social media account, etc. Now it’s time to make that initial contact. It’s natural to feel nervous at this stage, but don’t be! It has become increasingly common to locate old friends online, and chances are, if your friend has social media accounts set up, this is exactly the kind of thing she is hoping for!


Make your initial message brief and to the point. There is still a chance you have the wrong person, and it’s best to clarify first.
An example contact message might be: “Hi, this is Jenny Smith from Arlington. I was just wondering if this is the same Melissa Jones who went to Smith Elementary in the early 1980’s. If so, message me back, I would love to catch up!”
If you have a potential phone number for the person, call it and be prepare to deliver a similar message.
Remember not to be too cryptic about who you are or why you are calling/writing. Make it clear that you are trying to track down an old friend, and are not working for a collections agency or something similarly unpleasant.

, You may be having difficulty locating your friend because she changed her name due to marriage, or underwent gender reassignment surgery, or for any number of other reasons that might be difficult to simply guess. If you are stumped, try contacting people that you knew in common and inquiring about your friend. You might even try calling your friend’s siblings or parents, if their contact information is easier to locate.


A simple message to send might read: “Hi, this is Chrissy Jones from Denver. I am trying to track down my friend Sarah Smith, who you also went to school with. Do you by any chance know how I might reach her? Thank you!”

, If you met your friend through a mutual employer, or at least know where she used to work, LinkedIn might be your best tool for tracking her down. First create a LinkedIn profile, and then begin to search based on the employment information you remember.Remember that LinkedIn is a website targeted towards making and finding new business contacts, so keep your profile professionally-oriented. Even though you may be using the site to look for an old friend, remember that it is something that future employers will likely see.If you do not find your friend quickly, you may still find mutual acquaintances who you can contact for additional information.
Note that LinkedIn and other similar sites frequently inform users when someone views their profile. When you finally get around to contacting your friend, don’t be surprised if she has already been alerted to the fact that you were looking for her.
Look for social networking platforms specifically targeted to your particular industry or field. For example, Academia.edu is a networking site for academic researchers and employees.Check with your own professional organization or with colleagues to find out if there is a targeted network or registry that you could use.

, Many universities and even high schools maintain alumni registries for people who wish to share their location information with former classmates. Try contacting the school you attended to see if they maintain such a registry. If not, try searching one of the various online alumni/classmate finder site, such as classmates.com, which maintain user-provided alumni information for many primary and secondary schools and universities worldwide., There are numerous websites that maintain enlistment information and contain “buddy finder” sections to help you locate old service mates. Search for “military friend finder” and specify your country of service to find a website that can search for country-specific records.You can also try calling a local office of your service branch and asking for suggestions on how you might find an old friend.

, There is a chance that the reason you are having trouble locating your friend is that he or she is deceased. To find a website that can search country-specific obituary information, try a google search for “obituaries” and the name of your country first (for example: “obituaries United States”). There are also some sites that allow you to search obituaries from a wide range of countries."

Write a letter to your friend.,
Cry about it.",How to Forget a Friend1," Keep in mind that a friendship with a best friend is a relationship just like a romantic relationship.

, Write to your former friend to explain your feelings. You might take this opportunity to explain the reasons why you are not friends anymore (if you ended the friendship).

These details might help you to narrow down your search.

, Especially if you are relatively young, your friend’s parents might still be alive and living in the same place. Reach out directly to them or to other relatives whose contact information you can find, and explain that you’re trying to reconnect with your old friend., Former classmates, colleagues, or mutual friends might have stayed in touch with your friend, even if you’ve lost contact. They might also know other people, such as siblings, who are likely to have information about your friend.


Be direct about what you want. Say: “I’m trying to get in touch this friend again. Do you know how I might be able to contact her?”
Take no for an answer. A mutual friend or relative might feel uncomfortable passing along your friend’s information for many reasons.

, If you want to pay someone to search for your friend, make sure that you hire someone who is licensed as a private investigator. Contact consumer organizations to make sure that the investigator has a good reputation. Insist on a written contract that explains exactly what the investigator will do for your fee., Even with a wealth of information, you might not be able to find out where your friend is now. At a certain point, you will need to give up searching and move on.

, If searching directly doesn’t help, try looking at the contacts of friends from the same era or place in your life. Roughly seven out of ten people have used social media to reconnect with old friends., You might be able to find out roughly where your friend lives through websites that collect public information, such as listed telephone numbers or property records. Be wary of sites that charge for this information: many are bogus, while others might not provide more than a thorough search of records on your own.Put your friend’s name in quotation marks to search more effectively., Add the names of family members, schools, or terms related to a profession.

There are websites that allow families to post obituaries or tributes and may also have links to published obituaries and death records., Your old friend could be searching for you! Or, more likely, if you contact your old friend, he might want to get a sense of who you have become by looking at your online presence before he commits to a meeting. Use your last name and any previous names on public social media accounts, or start a website or blog., While contacting old friends can rekindle warm relationships and revive happy memories, contacting former boyfriends, girlfriends, or lovers can rekindle romance. Don’t assume that you can simply be friends now if you were something more in the past.While rekindled old romance can be very satisfying, don’t lie to a current partner in order to try it., Give your friend time to remember you and to make a decision about whether she wants to get back in touch., Maintain privacy settings on your accounts so that you can pace the amount of information you disclose to your friend., If you don’t hear back, it’s ok to try one more time.

Clear your recent call and text history so that her number isn’t listed there either.

, Delete your friend’s email address so that you’re not tempted to send a mean email or reminded about the hurt you feel.


If your email program keeps auto-loading her email address, try clearing the cookies on your web browser.

, Unfriend this person on Facebook, stop following her on Twitter, and undo your connection to her on other social media sites. You might still see her if she’s friends with your friends, but at least you won’t be constantly reminded about her every time you log in.

, If you have anything that belongs to your friend, return it to her. Otherwise, get rid of it. Remove this extra clutter from your life so that you don’t have these constant reminders about your former friend.

Don’t make your friends take sides.,
Don’t keep complaining about your former friend.,
Value your other friends for who they are.,
Be a better friend.",How to Forget a Friend3," When you have ended a friendship with one friend, this doesn’t mean that this person is completely out of your life. Your other friends may still be friends with her. It’s best to remain neutral, or at least as much as possible. Don’t make your other friends take sides or make them feel bad for continuing their friendship with that person., There is a short period of time after you’ve ended a friendship when you can talk about the hurt you feel. But then you need to move on. If you truly want to forget about your former friend, don’t keep talking about her with your current friends. They don’t want to rehash the same conversation over and over with you.

, The loss of one friend might make you try to fit another friend in their place. If you ended a friendship with your favorite dancing partner, you might try roping in another friend to go dancing. But if that person hates dancing, then accept their preference.

, Use the experience of your former friendship as a way to become a better friend for your other friends. If your former friend ended the friendship and you may have been at fault, think carefully about how you treated her. Use this as a lesson to keep your other friendships going strong.

Think about what clashed in your personalities.,
Make a list of what you need in a friend.,
Branch out your social circle.,
Don’t expect instant friendship.",How to Forget a Friend4," Think about the reasons why you’re not friends with this person anymore. They might have stolen from you or treated you poorly. Your personalities might just not click together. Think about the things that you didn’t like about this person or that bothered you.

, When you end a friendship, you will likely start looking for someone to fill that spot. Use this opportunity to figure out what you really want out of a friendship and which qualities you admire in a person. What do you need to stay away from? While no one is perfect, a new friend can fulfill many qualities that you’re looking for.

, It can be difficult to make new friends. Adults might be busy with family and work, and lacking in leisure time to put in the effort to develop friendships. As well, if you’re at a small school, the pool of potential friends might be pretty small. Think about ways to branch out from your usual group of friends or acquaintances and meet new people.


Join a club, go to the gym regularly, or volunteer with a nonprofit organization. Finding people who share your interests can be a great way to develop new friendships.

, Making friends is hard work, and even when you click with someone, it still takes effort to build the friendship. Perhaps your former friend was someone in your life for 10 years. Your new friendship won’t feel quite the same, in large part because you don’t have any history together yet. Be patient and let the friendship develop naturally.

Pursue some of your own interests.,
Remember the good times.,
Talk it over with someone.,
Be cordial if you see your friend.,
Reconnect if it feels right.",How to Forget a Friend5," Take time to reconnect with what you like to do on your own. At this time, you don’t have to compromise your interests to accommodate your friend, so take the opportunity to see the movie you want to see, or eat at your favorite restaurant.

, As more time passes from the time of your “breakup,” you’ll start to think fondly about the good times that you had with your friend. It’s much healthier for you to think about why you became friends in the first place. You can still acknowledge the bad times and the reasons why you aren’t friends anymore. But use these instances as starting points for thinking about how you’ve grown, rather than the entire focus of your friendship.

, If it’s been upsetting to end your friendship, talk it over with someone who can give you some perspective and help you figure out ways to move on. For example, you might talk with a family member or even a counselor.


Refrain from talking with someone who is still friends with the other person. This might draw them into the middle of things, which is an uncomfortable role to place another friend in. You might risk losing another friend in the process.

, If you live near your former friend, chances are you might run into her again. Plan out ahead of time what you might say to her in this situation. Above all, be cordial and mature when you see her. You don’t have to like her, especially if she hurt you.


Make it clear that you are not interested in restarting your friendship. Say something like, “It’s nice to see you. I wish you the best.” This statement tells her that you have closed the door on the friendship.

, If you miss your friend and you are ready to forgive her, or you decide that it’s worth the trouble to stay in touch even though you live 3,000 miles (5,000 km) from each other, then go for it. If your friendship has been strong in the past, you might have something to build on.Acknowledge that both of you have changed and you have different lives now. Don’t force the friendship back to being exactly what you had before. You have both evolved as people, and your friendship should evolve as well.
Don’t become friends again if the friendship was toxic for you.

Verify your friend’s name.,
Ask other people for information.,
Use any old information you already have.,
Hire an investigator.",How to Find Old Friends from High School2," Memories can fade over time, so make sure you double check your friend’s name and any other relevant information before you begin your search. Bring out all of those old high school yearbooks if you can't remember the full names of your friends. When trying to find your high school friends, it's considerably easier if you know both their first and last names.Also, by looking through your yearbooks you might remember another friend that you'd like to get together with sometime.

, Consult other people who might have known the person and ask if they have any information that might be helpful for you in your search. Ask people you know from high school that you still keep in touch with if they know how to reach your other friend.Perhaps they will know if your friend got married and changed their name, or if your friend moved to another city or works at a certain place. These are all important pieces of information that could help you find your friend.
Try asking your parents or other family members if they remember anything else that might help you find your friend from high school.

, If your old friend ever gave you their home phone number, their cell phone number, their email address, their home address, etc., consider calling them, emailing them, or going over to their house to see if they'll respond.Although most times your friend will have moved out of the house that they lived in during high school, talk to their parents or the current owners of the home and try to find out where your friend lives now and if they'll give you any updated contact information.

, If you are desperate to find a friend from high school and none of the other methods have worked, you could consider hiring a private investigator. A trained professional may have better luck tracking someone down for you.This will cost money, so keep that in mind before deciding to go this route.

Send them a message.,
Invite them to meet.,
Plan a fun event.",How to Find Old Friends from High School3," If you find your friend on a social media platform, consider sending them a message. This is a very common way to contact a person these days, so don’t feel too shy about it. Remind them who you are (be wary of assuming everyone always remembers you) and tell them that you are interested in catching up some time.But remember that Facebook has a feature that filters out messages from people not on your friends list and sends them to a separate “other messages” folder. It may take a while for your friend to see the message because of this if you don’t add them as a friend first.

, Tell your old high school friend that you would like to meet up to catch up and see how things are since you both left high school. Invite them to coffee or lunch, or to your home if you feel comfortable with that.If your friend lives too far away to meet up, consider calling them or Skyping with them.
Or you can just catch up with some messages or emails back and forth.

, Consider planning an outing for you and several of your old friends from high school. This could be a fun gathering for all parties involved. Ask some of your other friends from high school if they would like to meet up and then mention it to your old friend once you have found him or her.


Making it a group event may also take away some of the pressure when you see your old high school friend for the first time.

When holding your ferret, they may be trying to climb out of your arms.,
Ferrets always walk backwards before using the bathroom, when both urinating and defecating.,
If your ferret has just woken up, they will most likely need to use the bathroom.,
Some ferrets make high pitched sounds when they need to use the bathroom desperately.,
Ferrets lift up their tails when they need to defecate.",How to Tell when Your Ferret Needs to Go to the Bathroom," When a ferret is trying to climb onto a nearby object, it may just want to explore. But if it seems as if they do not want to be held, this may signify that the ferret needs to use the toilet.;
, They usually sniff the area before they decide to mark it, and also normally back into a corner to drop their waste (ferrets are clean animals). A ferret will continue to urinate when picked up, so be careful.

, Ferrets can sleep many hours a day, up to three times the amount a human can. You can imagine how a ferret would need to use the bathroom after napping so long.

, If your ferret is making these sounds, let it use the bathroom right away. Making a ferret hold its tiny little bladder is not only unjust but might hurt it.

, Although they also lift their tails up on many other occasions, so this cannot be depended on.

Create a ferret escape-proof environment which is not the easiest task in the world.,
You could simply build a hutch, but try to go one step (a giant one) further, and give the little rascal a true habitat.,
Your materials will be hardware cloth, 2x2's and 2x4's.,
Put your frame together as though you were building a small building or shed.,
Perches should really be built, at various levels from the ground and connected by your paths; put some in sun and some in shade, so that they are inviting, year 'round.

,
They will also need small boxes for denning; this is where they'll sleep and feel safe.,
If you choose, you can run pathways to a covered area of the pen, and place their boxes there.,
Don't forget the litter boxes, except that these can simply be boxes of sand.,
Food and water must not be forgotten, of course.,
Start your ferret's residence outside, in the middle of spring, when chance of frost is completely past.",How to Move Ferrets Outdoors," It is strongly recommended that you use ""hardware cloth"", the same wire used in rabbit cages.;

, You might even use 4x4's for the corners, and 4'square or larger pieces of plywood, preferably covered in a good weather-resistant cloth. You will want to provide a ""path"" for your pet(s) to various areas of the pen. Trust me, they'll use them, and your pleasure in watching them will be greatly magnified. This can be done with wooden ramps, pieces of corrugated ""drainage pipe"", the black kind used to move water by drainage and available at any builder's supply, PVC pipe, or heavy rope, VERY heavy rope, such as the kind used on boats, for tie-up. There are other materials out there, as varied as your imagination is active.

, Attach the hardware cloth with staples, good, sturdy ones, and don't skimp on the number of staples. There should be no gaps or ""escape routes"". Make sure the door fits closely. An in-stock, screen door works admirably, but put a lock on it. Don't forget, ferrets are climbers, so, yes, there must be a roof. You can either use wire, for the ""natural"" effect, or any of the clear or tinted plastic roofing sections. Again, simply be absolutely sure that it is secure. Also, you'll have to put in a ""floor""; this can be hardware cloth, or chicken pen wire. This will prevent digging out (or in; don't forget about outside predators, including the family dog. You want your ferret colony to be safe.

,, These can be placed on the various platforms, rather than on the ground. You can house several ferrets in this area, each with their own sleeping box, if they prefer (they may pile in for a 'sleep-over', you never know), and you have room to play with them, comfortably.

, Either way will work.

, They will have to be cleaned, but not nearly as often.

, If the entire pen is open to the sky (with wire), then the food should be in something that is covered. A tiny ""pavilion"", four posts and a cover, would be plenty. The water can be in pans, or drinking bottles, or both. It would also be nice to have a small ""pond"" for them, during the summer. Not just any kind of pre-fab pool, but something much smaller, to accommodate their size. and shallow, to prevent any kind of terrible surprise when you go out to play with them.

, The sleeping box and the sunny perches will provide warmth during this time. As the summer comes on, the fur will become thinner. As fall approaches, the fur will naturally thicken. By the time winter arrives, you will be amazed at the beauty of your pet.

Pay attention to your ferret's diet.,
Clean the litterbox.,
Wash the bedding weekly.,
Go easy on the bathing.,
Consider an internal deodorizer.,
Try a daily spritz or ferret deodorizer.,
You may start to think your ferret smells quite nice- certainly better than a wet dog or dirty cat box!

",How to Reduce Ferret Odor," Ferrets are obligate carnivores, so make sure you're not feeding him/her anything (diet or treats) that has corn, wheat, fruit, vegetable, fruit juices, or sugar as one of the first three ingredients. Fish ingredients also greatly increases the smell of the food and the ferret. Just because a bag of food has a picture of a ferret on it or was being fed to your ferret at the pet store does not mean that it offers your pet a nutritious, less smelly diet. Appropriate food will have 35 to 40 percent protein and no less than 19 percent fat. A good diet will give your ferret well formed droppings that won't smell too bad as well as soft shiny fur, bright eyes, high energy, and overall happiness.;
, Your ferret's litterbox should be cleaned daily. But be sure to leave a small amount of soiled litter in the box so he knows where to go. If the litterbox smells to his/her discerning nose just like the rest of the cage, you could end up with some 'presents' all over the place instead of in the odor-fighting litter. The litter in the box should be pelleted paper or soft-clumping plant-based granules. Never use hard-clumping clay or silicone as these will cause problems if ingested or stuck to the ferret's rear end. Also never use wood-shaving litter as it can cause respiratory problems and won't do a very good job at odor control.

, His/her hammock or sleep sack gets dirty just like your clothing does and needs to be washed. This will greatly reduce cage smells. Use hot water and an unscented laundry detergent (some ferrets are allergic to fragrances).

, Contrary to what you may think, ferrets should not be bathed often. The body odor you smell on them is their skin oil. If you wash them even with a gentle ferret shampoo, it irritates their skin and causes their oil glands to kick into overtime, making them smell even worse. Now, if your ferret sleeps in his/her dirty litter pan or rolls in some unidentifiable smelly substance outside, you may need to bathe him/her. If so, you should use a ferret shampoo, warm water (tepid water feels cold to them), and a ferret conditioner afterwards to minimize drying of his/her skin. Other safe and gentle pet shampoos and conditioners are fine, but watch out for allergies in your ferret.

, There are some products on the market that claim to deodorize your ferret from the inside out. If you have done all of the above, you should not need these products, which don't work very well anyway. Some people observe that these products give their ferrets loose stools. You should wait a few weeks after buying your ferret to try this stuff so you will be able to discern any change in your ferret's behavior or droppings.

, Some have nice scents like vanilla or melon and can really cut through his/her body odor. If you have done all of the above, you should not need these either. Most ferrets hate being spritzed too.

Use some toys for chase.,
Run and play chase with them.,
Consider a ""chase"" companion pet.,
Play ball!",How to Play with a Pet Ferret1," Because ferrets are predators, they love to chase. Cat toys that involve a ""fishing pole"" set-up with a teasing toy at the end are popular with many ferrets. Also battery-operated and remote control mice designed for cats are usually a hit.


You can also make chase toys by simply tying your ferret's other toys to string, or by prompting the ferret to chase a towel or old clothes you dangle in front of him. Keep in mind, the ferret will grab hold of whatever it is chasing, so don't prompt your ferret to chase anything you don't want damaged.;
, Ferrets will also chase you as you walk around the house. You can run away from your ferret to prompt him or her to chase you more, but be careful not to step on your pet. Ferrets also like to be chased, so you might notice your ferret jumping on you and then running away or hopping backwards in an effort to get you to chase him. Go ahead and play along, but be careful not to fall or step on the ferret.

, Ferrets will also chase other pets. You might consider getting more than one ferret so they can chase each other. Make sure the ferret gets along with any dogs or cats in your home before allowing them to play ""tag."" Do not allow your ferret to chase rodent, reptile, or bird pets you might have, because these are natural prey for the ferret and might be injured or killed during ""play.""

, Items that roll are fun for ferrets because they can chase the items. Balls are a good choice, so long as they are not a material the ferret can destroy.

"
"
Make them a dig box.,
Cut two holes in the lid that are big enough for the ferret to crawl through.,
Fill the tupperware with dry rice, sand, plastic balls that are sold at the pet store for ferrets, or a combination.

,
Let the ferret explore the box!",How to Play with a Pet Ferret2," Ferrets love to dig! First get a medium sized clear tupperware box with a plastic lid.

, Make sure the edges are smooth, which might require you to sand them down with sandpaper.

,, He or she will most likely immediately start digging around and having a blast.

"
"
Get suitable toys for chewing.,
Use short-term chew sticks if desired.,
Provide some rope.",How to Play with a Pet Ferret3," Ferrets are chewers, but the material has to be right. Very sturdy dog toys can be good for ferrets, but not the soft rubbery toys. Ferrets will chew up and might swallow soft toys. Kongs are suitable for ferrets.

, Pet stores sell sticks and other items made just for ferrets to chew. Most ferrets love these, but typically will eat them, so they are not a long-term chewing toy.

, Sturdy ropes made for dogs can be enjoyed by ferrets. Some ferrets like to play tug-of-war with these ropes just like a dog.

"
"
Get tunnel toys.,
Give your ferret access to a large blanket or towel to tunnel around in.,
Let them rummage around.",How to Play with a Pet Ferret4," Similar to digging, any toy or game that simulates tunneling is a hit with ferrets. There are specific tunnel toys designed for ferrets carried at most pet stores. Also, tunnel toys designed for cats can work work well for ferrets.

, Ferrets will crawl underneath to satisfy their digging instinct. The more wrinkly you make the blanket or towel the more fun it is for your ferret to navigate.

, Piles of clothes, toys, boxes, or plastic bags are fun for your ferret. All of these items allow the ferret to explore and tunnel around.

Choose a litter that's safe for ferrets.,
Pick a big enough litter pan.,
Place your litter box in your ferret's cage.,
Put feces and urine in the litter box.,
Litter train your ferret in the cage at first.,
Move accidents to the litter box.,
Praise your ferret for using the litter box.,
Clean the litter box regularly.,
Clean up accidents completely.,
Fasten your litter box to the cage if your ferret digs a lot.,
Put water, food, and toys in areas where your ferret is going to the bathroom.,
Do not scold a ferret.",How to Litter Train Your Ferret," Not all litters are safe for ferrets. Ferrets have a tendency to roll in or sniff their litter and many ferrets have very sensitive respiratory systems; therefore, a dust-free, unscented litter that does not clump is safest for ferrets.Denatured wood litter pellets, recycled newspaper pellets, and alfalfa pellets all make good litters.
If you run out of regular litter, you can use cat litter if it's unscented and un-clumping in a pinch. You can also use shredded newspapers.
Avoid cedar and pine shavings as litters. The chemicals can irritate your ferret's eyes.;
, Your ferret should be able to fit all four of their paws in the litter pan comfortably, so make sure pick a box or pan that's big enough. You also want a litter pan or box with lower sides. Ferrets will have an easier time getting in and out of a litter pan with lower sides., You want to start litter training in the ferret's cage. Set the litter box in the corner of the ferret's cage. Fill it with your chosen litter. Make sure you don't use the litter anywhere else in the cage. You want it to be clear to your ferret they need to eliminate in the litter box., Ferrets are not like cats. They do not instinctively opt to use a litter box; therefore, you need to teach your ferret what the litter box is for. Place some urine and feces in the litter box. The scent will encourage your ferret to go in the area., Keep your ferret their cage when unsupervised until they are litter trained. This is the easiest way to keep accidents contained and teach your ferret to use their litter box. Keep your ferret contained until they are regularly eliminating in the litter box and do not have accidents in other areas of the cage.You should take your ferret out of the cage whenever you can during litter training. You do not want to keep your ferret locked up all the time. Whenever you're able to supervise, let your ferret out of its cage.

, When you see your ferret has gone outside the litter box, move the accidents to the litter box. This will teach the ferret this is what the litter box is for. It will also help develop a scent in the litter box. Ferrets are likely to eliminate in areas that smell like urine and feces., Ferrets respond to positive reinforcement, so offer your ferret some praise when they use their litter box. If you catch your ferret eliminating in the litter, offer them verbal praise once they are done.You can also give your ferret a small treat for eliminating in the litter box. If your ferret loves a particular type of treat, giving your ferret this treat can help encourage them to use their litter box.

, Your ferret is unlikely to use a litter that's very dirty or smelly. To encourage your ferret to use their litter box, clean the litter box once a day. Use a litter scooper to remove feces and any clumps of urine. Once a week, completely dump the contents of the litter box and replace them with fresh litter., Even after your ferret is using its box regularly, it may have an occasional accident outside the box. If an area smells, a ferret is more likely to eliminate there again. To prevent this, clean up accidents completely after they happen.Treat the stain as quickly as possible. You need to thoroughly deodorize the area or the ferret will be drawn back to this spot and will think it is an appropriate place to eliminate.
To prevent reoccurrence, spray something like lemon or apple bitters near the spot. Ferrets dislike these smells and will be discouraged from going in these spots again.

, Ferrets may dig in their litter box. This can cause the box to slide around the cage, making the ferret more likely to eliminate outside of the cage. If your ferret is pushing their litter box around, drill holes in the litter box and attach it to the side of the cage using wire.Make sure the sharp ends of the wire are outside of the cage so your ferret does not injure itself.

, If your ferret keeps eliminating outside the cage, start putting its toys and food in these areas. Ferrets are less likely to eliminate near where they eat, sleep, and play. Having food, toys, and bedding in the places where your ferret has accidents will discouraged future accidents., Ferrets, like most animals, do not respond to scolding. If you scold a ferret for going outside its litter box, it's likely to simply get agitated and stressed. This will not encourage litter box training and will only serve to upset your animal."

, A hammock adds more comfort for your ferret––they love to climb on them and sleep.

, Though they do like to snuggle together, they all need their space.

, It is important that you clean the cage every other day. However, if you have more than one ferret, clean the cage daily to avoid odor.

,, After cleaning the cage and making sure it is completely dry, add fresh bedding or litter.

, For washing machine safe items, use baking soda, as detergents or bleach may irritate your ferret's skin. For hand-washing items, just use hot water.

, Pine bedding or cat litters are not recommended, as the fumes and dust can cause your ferret to become ill with respiratory problems. A cat scooper works well for removing ferret waste and soiled bedding or litter.


Completely replace all litter every three to five days.

, You will need a non-spill food dish and a water bottle or non-spill dish. Ferrets tend to make a mess, so it's a good idea to keep something under the eating area if you have a drop bottom style cage.

, Providing healthy food is very important for your ferret. Provide food designed just for ferrets, with high protein and high fat content. It needs to be as close to zero carbohydrates and sugars as possible, as ferrets are carnivores. There are two choices for a diet: kibble, or mice. You can keep a ferret alive on kibble alone, and you can give it both mice and kibble, but never have it on a strict diet of mice. Raw animals from the pet store help a ferret's teeth and can help it to live a longer life, while kibble keeps protein and fiber in balance. Treats can also help to fatten up for winter and have a healthy source of taurine.


Ferrets are strict carnivores, which means no vegetables, fruit, nuts, or grains of any kind. If you cannot find a treat that your ferret likes, you can, however, feed it very small amounts of banana or watermelon. Any mildly flavored, non-acidic fruit can sometimes substitute for treats, but do not give it a lot or give it only fruit. The ferret will not benefit from it, except for taste.
Another treat idea is warm––not hot––pieces of meat.

, Grains will generally make your ferret sick, so it is important to avoid giving these. Among other things, milk, chocolate, dog food, and cat food are not good for your ferret. Ferrets have very delicate stomachs and these items can give them diarrhea and make them very ill. However, this isn't a fact, as there are vets saying that you can feed ferrets kitten food, as long as the first ingredient listed is meat, and it doesn't include corn or grain.

, Bi-odor can be put in the ferret's water to help reduce odors. It is best to use bottled water, or have a water softener. A ferret's water should be room temperature and not ice cold or it will avoid drinking as much as it needs and could risk getting a cold. Ferrets need a lot of water or they will dehydrate.


To tell whether your ferret is dehydrated, pinch the skin on its scruff ( the back of its neck) gently, pull up, and let go. If it snaps back like the skin of the back of your hand does, it's healthy. If it takes a while to flatten or sticks up straight, see a vet.

, Ferrets are smart and social creatures that need lots of exercise and interaction. Let the ferret out of its cage at least once a day and play with it, or just let it romp around and sniff your stuff.


Ferrets get bored very easily, so provide a variety of toys for it to play with. Switch out toys they can play with every other day.
While some people like to keep their ferrets in 'play pens' for playtime, ferrets do just fine roaming around the house with, of course, supervision.
Most ferrets generally get along with cats and dogs. However, some like to nip or mouth, at which the other animals might get agitated.
Taking your ferret on walks is also great.
An ideal playtime for a ferret is four hours a day, at least.

, Ferrets are, essentially, little tornadoes consisting of fur and pure energy. They need a lot of attention to stay healthy. If they are cooped up in their cage all day, they become more likely to damage the cage and/or themselves by ripping things up in an attempt to vent their energy. Make sure you can commit to at least an hour of exercise a day for your ferret.

, You can help keep it from getting sick, as well as catching illnesses earlier when it is still easy to treat them. Ferrets have a high risk for immediate allergic reactions when it comes to vaccinations when compared to other domestic animals, such as dogs and cats. These reactions are almost always deadly; try to avoid them if they are not necessary. If concerned or unsure whether to vaccinate your ferrets, talk to your veterinarian.


Ferrets can catch a cold and the flu from people.If you are sick, wash your hands before touching ferrets and their stuff. Avoid contact with your ferret until you are well. This is hard to do but will prevent costly vet bills and having to give your ferret medicine.

, This lessens the effect of cancer for your pet and helps keep the odor away from them.They will be much happier fixed and less cranky.

, Bathing it too often can result in dry skin and over activated stink glands, causing even more ferret smell. Some people advise not bathing it at all, and just relying on it to naturally clean itself. You may wish to only bathe it if something is spilled on the ferret by accident.


Use ferret shampoo, which can be found at a pet store.
A ferret's coat is important to its health. If its coat is soft, full and doesn't have an unusually smelly odor, then your ferret is healthy and kept well. If any excessive hair is missing on a ferret, other than the tip of his tail, see a vet, because this could be a sign of adrenal disease.

, Aside from playtime, your ferret needs its sleep to prevent it from getting sick. Ferrets like to sleep in dark, quiet places, so cover the cage with some blankets when you're in the room and make as little noise as you can.

Avoid letting your ferret play with other pets.,
Monitor your ferret closely.,
Understand that ferrets are very small and agile.,
Provide a litter box.,
Learn about foods that are dangerous to ferrets.",How to Ferret Proof a House," The first thing you need to do is determine what areas of your home your ferret will be able to roam freely in. Once you decide this, you’ll then be able to focus most of your energies on making sure these rooms are safe and can contain your ferret from escaping. Most of your efforts will focus on making sure that there are no dangers or easy escape routes that will enable your friend to get out of your home.


Pick an area of your home that is easy to block off.
Consider a bonus room or a master suite in which you can close the door.
Avoid high-hazard places like the garage, kitchen, or laundry room.;
, While you’ve already done some work ferret-proofing the area that your ferret will roam in, now you need to make sure that all escape routes in your home are blocked. The reason you need to do this is that although the area you’ve cordoned off is now safe, your ferret could still find his or her way into the other areas of your house. From there, freedom could be as easy as a doggie door or an open window.


Make sure all doors shut correctly.
Close all windows and other entrances into your home.
Repair any structural problems that could offer your ferret a way out of your home. , Chemical hazards are one of the most common dangers to dogs, cats, babies, and of course ferrets. In order to protect your friend from these hazards, make sure your home is chemical free. After all, the danger of your ferret ingesting a chemical is much scarier than the work it would take to remove chemical hazards from your home.


Remove poisons and pesticides.
Secure household cleaning products in a closet or cabinet that your ferret can’t access.
Secure garden fertilizers and similar chemicals so that your ferret can’t get into them. , Electrical hazards might be one of the biggest dangers to your friend. This is because as very curious little animals, ferrets will explore and even chew on things in order to figure out what they are. In order to avoid danger to your ferret, scout out any potential electrical hazards and fix them.


Coat electrical cords with a bitter solution to repel chewing.
Wrap electrical cords with electrical tape or other appropriate material to provide an extra layer of protection.
Hook the cords to the wall about a foot or two from the ground.
Plug up any vacant outlets with protectors., If there are certain things you really care about and don’t want chewed on, pick them up. While ferrets are not really destructive animals, sometimes (depending on age and other conditions) they might chew on plastic, rubber, or even wood.


Pick up new shoes.
Move or box up collector’s items or children’s toys that you don’t want damaged.
Pick up expensive clothes., Household appliances represent huge and common dangers to ferrets that ferret owners should be aware of. This is because many appliances in our homes offer warm places to explore and are easy to get into. In addition to climbing inside the back of an appliance, there are a variety of other appliance-related dangers. Consider:


That your ferret might like to sleep in dirty laundry and can easily get thrown in the washer or dryer by accident.
Always checking inside your dishwasher or oven before running them.
Making sure your ferret can’t get inside the back of your refrigerator or freezer.
Securing any large appliances that might have holes small enough for your ferret to climb inside., One way to keep your ferret out of trouble is to keep him or her occupied. The best way to do this is to provide your friend with toys and other things to play with. Consider:


A ferret maze. Ferrets are very inquisitive and like to explore and play. Buy or build a maze for your ferret to play in. You can purchase one at a pet store or build one out of cardboard or other materials.
Buying your ferret balls, crinkle toys, or other plastic toys to chew on.
Playing with your ferret and find out what he or she likes to do. This way, you'll be in a better position when it comes to supplying your ferret with toys., Communicating with everyone you live with is extremely important in ferret-proofing your home. Although you’ve gone out of your way to make your home safe for your little friend, other people (if they are careless) could easily undermine all of your work. Make sure to:


Talk to roommates or family about your ferret and things that pose a danger to him or her.
Explain to your roommates and family about how your ferret could easily get out if they don’t close doors and windows.
Remind your roommates and family of your efforts to ferret proof the house every couple of weeks – so they don’t forget or get lazy.
Put up signs to remind people that your home is a ferret-friendly zone., One of the most common ways that ferrets get out of people’s homes is when there are visitors who don’t realize how important it is to close doors after themselves. As a result, whenever you have visitors to your home, make sure you put your ferret away. This will help you avoid the horrible situation of a friend accidently letting your ferret slip outside., Take some time to remove small hazards that you or your family might leave around the home. This, though, will really be an on-going battle as you and your family will constantly be creating small hazards for your ferret. The biggest dangers to consider are:


Small pieces of plastic that your ferret might chew on and swallow.
Garbage with food on it that might be toxic to your ferret.
Garbage like aluminum cans and plastic that could injure your friend if he or she were to investigate it., While it may be tempting to let your ferret roam freely in the same area of your home as your dog or cat, this could be extremely dangerous for the ferret. As a small animal, ferrets are extremely vulnerable to larger pets – especially cats – who have well-developed predator instincts. In addition, ferrets are not harmless themselves. They’re actually very capable hunters and can deal out considerable damage to larger animals.


Set aside a room or part of your house just for the ferret. Restrict other animals from this area.
If you think your ferret needs a companion, consider another ferret.
If you must let your ferret and another pet roam together, make sure to introduce them slowly and then monitor their interactions very carefully.
Never leave your ferret and another pet unattended while you are not at home., When your ferret is freely exploring your home, you should monitor he or she closely. Watch where he or she goes. Take note of his or her favorite places to hide or to play in. Chances are, your ferret will wind up in places you never considered.


After watching your friend, make sure that any places you’ve neglected to ferret-proof are now safe.
Consider re-thinking the area that you’ve ferret-proofed if your ferret finds clever ways to escape or get into trouble. After all, a little work is worth avoiding the heartbreak of losing your little friend.
Tell your friends and family about places your ferret likes to go. This could be extra important if your friend likes to crawl into a couch, arm chair, or go behind a door.

, Ferrets are very small and agile. They’re not like dogs and cannot be restricted or penned up the way dogs are. As a result, you need to be aware of your ferret’s capabilities and what they can and cannot do. Knowing your ferret’s capabilities may save you a lot of time when it comes to ferret-proofing your home.


Ferrets will climb walls, fences, or other obstacles to get where they want to go.
Ferrets are very small and get through cracks under doors and other spaces that you really wouldn’t expect.
Ferrets can also be very adept jumpers and can jump from a table to another table, down stairs, or more., Ferrets can be litter trained just like cats. As a result, one aspect of ferret-proofing your house is to make sure your ferret does not mess in your home. In order to avoid this, make sure to provide your ferret a litter box and to litter train your little friend. By litter training your ferret, you’ll avoid potential messes and make your ferret a much more well-adjusted member of your family.


When your ferret is young, and is not house trained, make sure to put litter and a litter tray in your ferret’s cage.
When your ferret messes outside of the litter tray, move his or her mess into the tray.
Clean the litter tray at least once a week., There are a variety of household foods that, if consumed, can harm your ferret. These foods are foods that people commonly consume and might be left out in the open on a regular basis. When you add a free-ranging ferret to this, you have a potentially dangerous combination that could result in your ferret going to the vet. Avoid:


Dairy products. Ferrets can't digest dairy. Keep dairy away from them at all costs.
Garlic and onions.
Sugar.
Fruits and vegetables.
Grains, when possible. Some ferret food will contain grain. This is okay."

Weigh in other general costs of care.",How to Decide if a Ferret Is the Right Pet for You," Before you get a ferret, you will need to spend a great deal of time setting up. You will have to run many errands gathering supplies, and then take an afternoon to assemble them in your home. In the event you move, you will have to repeat the process. Be honest with yourself about whether you have time for ferret proofing.You will have to fill in any holes or gaps in furniture or walls, ferrets love to crawl and hide in such areas. You will also have to hide heavier objects, like stereos and speakers, in cupboards. Ferrets love to climb, and can knock such objects over and get hurt.Staircases need to be blocked off, and household furniture made of products like wood will need protection. Ferrets will chew such objects.
Cleaning and upkeep of your home will be more timely when you have a ferret. Ferrets will chew almost anything, and can get hurt if they chew or swallow the wrong object. Therefore, you will have to keep your home very clean if you're housing a ferret.;
, Ferrets are social animals. They will not be happy if they don't have time to play with a human companion. A ferret is, by no means, a hands off pet, so make sure you can dedicate adequate time to playing with your ferret.Ferrets do sleep a lot. They tend to be sleeping for about 18 hours a day. However, during times when they are awake, they are very active and need a lot of stimulation.
Do not leave a ferret in a shelter or cage for the entire day. You will need to spend several hours a day playing with your ferret to keep it healthy and happy.

, Litter training is important for a ferret, as you don't want a ferret having accidents around the home. Also, ferrets must be taught proper behavior. You will need to dedicate time to training your ferret not to bite and scratch.Ferrets are intelligent and highly trainable. However, like any animal, training takes time and persistence. You will have to train your ferret over the course of several weeks, and always punish negative behaviors like biting. This can be time consuming, so you should not adopt a ferret if you don't feel you have time to train it., Ferrets have a litter box that must be changed daily, like a cat's litter box. You will also need to periodically clean their cage. While these are small chores that do not usually take long, keep them in mind when thinking about time. Every core needed to keep a ferret adds up, and you should not adopt a pet unless you can commit to all aspects of its care., This is especially important if you're purchasing a younger ferret. Ferrets don't live as long as some pets, like smaller dogs and cats, but their lifespan is not brief. Ferrets live between 6 to 10 years. You do not want to adopt a ferret if you will potentially have to give it up in a few years.Think about the stability of your living situation. If you're going to be moving from year to year, it can be difficult to find places that allow ferrets. Unlike dogs and cats, there may be specific rules against ferrets or similar animals in certain places due to their odor.
Consider other factors. Are you going to start a new career, finish a school program, travel, or make any other big changes? If so, it may be difficult to keep your ferret in the long term.
If you want a ferret, but worry your life is too unsettled, you can always consider adopting an older ferret rather than a baby.

, Ferrets do not do well with young children. Ferrets will bite if handled roughly. If your children are not old enough to know how to gently handle an animal, a ferret is not the pet for you.Ferrets can get along well with older children, however. If your kids know how to safely handle an animal, and have been gentle with animals in the past, a ferret can be a great addition to your home.

, If there's a lot of coming and going in your home, there are two major concerns. First, ferrets are underfoot a lot. If there are frequently a lot of people around, a ferret could easily get stepped on. Second, ferrets have tendency to escape. If doors are often opening and closing, there is a safety risk for your ferret.Ferrets tend to do best in quieter homes, where there is not a lot of commotion.
Doors and windows need to be closed to safely keep a ferret. If you like natural airflow from open doors and windows, you will not do well with a ferret.

, Ferrets generally do best in a home without other pets. Cats and dogs are often aggressive with ferrets. Ferrets will pray on smaller animals, like mice and rats. If you already have pets, a ferret may not be your best option.Some people do keep ferrets with smaller dogs or cats. If you decide to get a ferret despite having a dog or cat, only allow supervised interaction. Even during play, a dog or cat could accidentally harm a ferret.

, Ferrets come with a strong odor. The scent glands a ferret uses to mark territory secrete oil, leaving a musty scent in your home. If you live in a smaller home, or an apartment, a ferret smell can become very noticeable.The smell of ferret is something like the scent of a skunk.

, Just because the pet store sells them doesn't mean that they are legal to own in your area. In some countries and states, owning a ferret is outright illegal. They are also sometimes illegal to own in certain cities or areas, and you may need a license to own a ferret some places.Check with a local Humane Society or Department of Wildlife for regulations in your area.
Also, think about legally housing a ferret. If you're renting, ferrets may not be allowed in your building even if they're allowed in your area. Check with your landlord before adopting a ferret., Ferrets are not cheap. The cost of purchase will vary depending on the humane society or pet store you're working with, but it ranges from $75 to $250.In general, if you're adopting a ferret from a shelter, you can expect the cost to be lower.

, Like all animals, ferrets need basic vaccinations to prevent diseases like rabies. Check with vets in your area to see what the average fee for vaccinations are. Also, like any pet, ferrets will need annual vet visits to stay healthy.Make sure you can find a vet in your area that takes ferrets. Not all vets are familiar with treating ferrets.

, If your ferret is not already spayed or neutered, it's important to have the procedure done. Unless you're specifically buying a ferret to breed, you do not want to end up with unwanted babies. Sterilization is especially important if you have two ferrets of different genders.While costs will vary from vet to vet, sterilization generally costs between $200 and $300. There also may be other fees for any medication your ferret needs after surgery., Between the cage, accessories, food, treats, toys, litter, and other items, your ferret could cost a large amount of money upfront. Make a list of all the things you will need to buy and add up the total cost. This will give you a sense of whether you can truly afford a ferret in the present moment.You should also have some extra money in case of unexpected circumstances. A ferret could, for example, contract a cold from a pet store or shelter. You will need extra money for vet bills.

Handle your ferret often.,
Make sure visitors know not to approach your deaf ferret from behind if they want to pat the ferret.",How to Look After a Deaf Ferret," Deafness in ferrets is linked to the same genetic characteristic which makes some white cats deaf, also some white dogs and also humans who have a white flash of hair on their heads.;
, If the ferret fails to respond to your voice or any sounds made close to its ears, then it is probably deaf. Your vet should also be able to confirm the ferret's deafness.

, You can help your ferret grow to love you and feel comfortable around you, with the right care.

,, Since the ferret cannot hear you, if you approach it from the back to pick it up, it will twist around and bite out of fear. That is its only form of self-defence. Instead, always approach your deaf ferret from the front.

, With a ferret that can hear, you can train it not to bite by clicking its nose softly and saying the words ""Don't bite"". But this does not work with a ferret that is deaf. The best way to teach the ferret not to bite is to wave your hand in front of its face when it is attempting to bite; it soon learns that if you wave your hand in front of its face it means that it should not sink its teeth into your finger.

, Another characteristic of a deaf ferret is that it will be very noisy. It will talk to you and make lots of sounds and if it has run out of food, it will make sure you know all about it by jumping up and down and making a lot of noise. Ferrets that can hear generally keep silent, whereas ferrets that can't hear seem to be talking to you, telling you things that it hopes you might perhaps understand.

, A deaf ferret will enjoy going on walks on a lead.

, All ferrets enjoy being picked up and handled. In time your ferret will never bite because it trusts you.

, It is probably best for you to handle the deaf ferret first, then pass the ferret across to the other person, so that the ferret can see what is happening at all times.

Most states in the United States permit ferret ownership, but some states—California and Hawaii, for example—do not.Other states, such as Rhode Island, require you to acquire a permit for owning a ferret.Check with your local police department or other state animal control agencies to make sure you are following all laws when it comes to ferret ownership.;
, In order to ensure that you will be compatible with this type of pet, take some time to socialize with them before you make a purchase. Drop into a pet store that sells them, or contact known ferret owners or breeders and see if they’ll let you come by for visit.


Take a good whiff and make sure that you can tolerate their odor. Ferrets belong to the Mustelidae family, meaning that they secrete an odor when placed in hazardous situations. Most people agree that the ferret carries a unique scent even when it is not alarmed, so you should check your olfactory approval rating before committing to a ferret.Think about how well you respond to their playfulness and energy level. If you find the ferret’s busy antics overwhelming when you’re just dropping by for a visit, chances are you’ll find them overwhelming as a permanent pet.

, Because they are social animals, ferrets create special bonds with other members of their species and enjoy having a playmate at all times.


Some pet stores apply a discount for buying ferrets in pairs. Petco, for example, charges $75.00 for a single ferret, and $125.00 for a bonded pair., Make sure you can afford to buy a ferret by investigating breeder and provisions costs beforehand.


At the pet store, a ferret will generally cost about $100.00. Additionally, all of the supplies for housing a ferret can run between $150.00 and $300.00., Ferrets require yearly exams and vaccines, so be prepared to fork out regular costs for health care in addition to the initial cost of purchasing and providing for your ferret.


Like dogs, ferrets need yearly distemper and rabies vaccines. Anticipate between $150.00 and $200.00 for these expenditures.You should neuter or spay your ferret after you purchase it, and this procedure typically costs between $100.00 and $250.00.An animal savings account is highly recommended in case your ferret ever needs emergency surgery or contracts a serious condition like cancer.

, While common practice used to dictate that a ferret be treated similar to a cat in medical terms, modern veterinary research has shown that ferrets are unique and should be treated as such..


If there are no exotic-only vets in your area, contact the local veterinarian and see how much experience they have with ferrets.

, Before you bring your ferret home, make sure you set up his cage and toilet so that it will have a private place within which to acclimate.


Don’t forget to place a bed inside the cage. Ferrets sleep at least 14 hours a day, so a good bed is important! You can use a sleeping tube from the pet store, or just an old t-shirt or sweatshirt.
Avoid using cedar or other wood shavings as the bedding material for your ferret. While many pet stores use this material, it can create a dust build-up in the air which is not healthy for your ferret to be breathing.Expect to spend around $130.00 on these initial housing expenses., For those times when you need to transport your ferret or take your ferret for a walk, you’ll need to have special supplies.


The most important thing about your new carrier is that it be well-ventilated. It should also have a solid floor panel so that the ferret has a stable surface beneath it at all times. Many widely available cat carriers meet these criteria and won’t break the bank.You should be able to find a leash and collar at any pet store. A nylon kitten collar or leather puppy collar should work fine, just make sure that the fit is not too tight., Ferret food can be found online or at most pet supply shops, or, in a pinch, you can opt for a premium, high-protein brand of cat food.Use a food dish with a steep, high brim so that the ferret cannot dig its food out of the bowl.
Ferrets can drink water from water bottles or dishes, but they prefer to lap it from a dish., Crawl around on your hands and knees in order to look for any hidey-holes into which your ferret could burrow and get stuck.Look out in particular for holes under the refrigerator, between cabinets, or behind laundry machines.
Use wood or wire mesh to block holes. Avoid Styrofoam or other padded substances as your ferret can chew and destroy them.

, Your ferret will be both inquisitive and dexterous, so take the time to ferret-proof all the furniture and shelving that can be opened.


Latching your drawers will help you avoid the nuisance of a rummaging ferret, and, more importantly, it can be a life-saving measure for your pet. Ferrets have been known to ingest cleaning and other household solvents, so keep these dangerous toxins safely locked in ferret-proof cabinets., Ferrets can chew a hole in soft furniture in order to make themselves a secure burrow. In addition to the damage this causes your furniture, it can also be dangerous for the ferret, so make sure that any tempting mattresses or bedding are protected., Most ferrets cost about $100 from a store or private seller.


You can also check with local animal shelters, as they may have ferrets available to adopt

, Before handing over your money and taking your ferret home, check to make sure that you are buying a healthy ferret.


The ferret’s eyes should be clear and bright, the gums should be pink, and the teeth should be clean. Make sure the coat is clean and free of fleas, and also check the feces to verify that they are firm.Look for signs of problems like a runny nose or sluggishness., Whether you’re buying from a store or breeder, or adopting from a shelter, ask an employee to make copies of any records relating to your ferret.Find out if the ferret has already been neutered or spayed, and which, if any, vaccinations or medical treatments the it has received to date.
Also save documentation showing the ferret’s sex, weight, age, and whether or not it has been de-scented.

, Just to be safe and make sure you’re not bringing any parasites or diseases into your home, swing by your local exotic-only veterinarian clinic to have your ferret checked out.Refer to the records and certificates acquired from the adoption facility in order to determine if you need to have any vaccinations or additional procedures done.

, Moving your ferret from the pet store or shelter to your home can be a stressful time for your new pet, so try to make the transition as smooth as possible by keeping noise and distracting sights to a minimum.As soon as your ferret feels more secure in its new surroundings, you can slowly introduce it to the customary bustle of your household.

, For the first couple of days, keep your ferret in its cage so that it can start feeling at home.


Make sure its cage is well-stocked with food, fresh water, and clean bedding.

, On the first day of your ferret’s introduction, have each family member make friendly contact with the ferret.


Carry out introductions so that the ferret meets only one family member at a time. The ferret has a limited attention span, so keep each introduction brief and friendly., Ferrets are energetic creatures so they will need a fair amount of exercise outside of the cage.After a couple of days sequestered to its cage, have your ferret come out and explore the house for a while.


For this first exploration, you might want to limit the time to fifteen minutes or so. After that, though, let the ferret roam for as long as you can be available to supervise.

Compare how they treat you.,
Notice when you’re spending more time together.,
Listen to how they speak.,
Listen to what they say.,
Look for flirtatious behavior.,
Look at how they present themselves.",How to Tell if Your Best Friend Loves You1," When you two are spending time with your mutual friends, see if they treat you differently than how they treat other people they are friends with. They may be more affectionate with you, try to talk more to you, or make comments about your relationship.


When your best friend treats you the same as any of their other friends, it’s unlikely that they’re interested in you romantically. A friend that treats you like they treated their exes may be interested.
This can help you determine whether they are just being their normal friendly selves or if they are interested romantically in you.;
, Naturally, you’re going to spend time with your best friend. However, ask yourself whether the things that you do together seem like dates.For example, do you go out to dinner and a movie? If so, is it usually just the two of you?When someone starts to become interested in someone romantically, they’ll want to spend more and more time with them. If you notice that the two of you are spending way more time together than you normally do, and that those hangouts start to feel like potential dates, they may be interested in you.
You should also notice if they start to tell you how much they enjoy spending time with you one on one. This might be a way for them to try and tell you that they’re looking for something more than just friendship.

, Listen to how they speak about you to other people and how they speak when they are talking to you. When people are attracted to someone, they may speak in a special tone of voice reserved for that special someone. They may also be a little nervous around you and blush.


Pay attention to how much they laugh at your jokes or things that you do. If they laugh more frequently than usual, it might be because they like you.
Friends aren’t awkward with one another, so if you start noticing that they seem shy and bashful about certain topics, it could be a sign that they’re interested in you. For example, they may become shy when you bring up school dances or dates that you've been on.

, They may be trying to tell you how they feel in a subtle way. They may try to bring up romantic subjects or ask whether you are interested in someone right now. They may also try to deepen your connection by asking you very deep questions about your life, dreams, goals, and desires.


Since this is your best friend, they probably pay attention to what you say already. But, you may notice that they start to remember small details about your life that they would otherwise forget, like when you have a test or a special appointment. They might show you that they remember these things by wishing you luck or commenting when the day is here.

, Flirting can signal that they are attracted to you, or it could mean that they are a naturally flirtatious person. You’ll need to distinguish what their flirting means, but you have the benefit of knowing their personality already. Look for signs of flirting like:They compliment you frequently.
They smile and gaze at you when they talk about you.They touch their hair or face when speaking to you.
They laugh at all your jokes, even when they aren’t that funny.
They gently tease you or playfully poke fun at you.

, You may notice that they start to pay more attention to their appearance when they know they are spending time with you. For instance, they may wear nicer clothes or clothing that they know that you like or wear makeup and do their hair. When someone is attracted to someone, they often try to present their best selves.If you start to notice that they consistently seem to be spending more time on their appearance when the two of you are together, they may be interested in you.

Breeding ferrets that are related or have behavioral and/or physical health problems could introduce undesirable traits into the ferret population. For example, breeding closely-related ferrets could result in health problems in the babies (e.g. blindness, deafness) or pregnancy-related problems for the mother (e.g., small litters, premature death of babies).If you already have a male and female ferret, you may want to have them genetically tested to make sure they are not closely related. Speak with your veterinarian about genetic testing options.
Prior to breeding, take your ferrets to your veterinarian to ensure they are healthy.;
, Ferrets reach sexual maturity during the first spring after their birth. This will be about four months of age for females (‘jills’) and between six and eight months of age for males (‘hobs’).The spring coincides with the ferret breeding season, so start to look for signs that your ferrets are ready to breed when the days get longer and the temperature starts to warm up.A jill in heat will have a swollen and enlarged vulva,which is part of her external genitalia. You will notice a pink and watery secretion coming from her vaginal area.On your hob, you will notice that his testicles drop (hang lower from his body) and become larger.The hob equivalent of being in heat is a ‘rut.’Your hob’s personal hygiene will take a nosedive when he’s ready to breed. He will urinate to mark his territory and even drag his stomach through the urine.He will also secrete oil to mark his territory.Male and female ferrets that are ready to breed both develop greasy skin and become quite smelly., When you put the ferrets together, sit back and wait for the mating ritual to begin. Be aware that the ferret mating process is anything but romantic—the male will bite the female’s neck and even drag her around the cage. You may even hear the female scream.The biting will look disturbing, but it actually has a purpose—biting the jill’s neck releases the hormones in her body that will stimulate ovulation (egg production).Jills are known as induced ovulators, meaning that she has to be bred to start egg production.The mating process can take anywhere from several hours to several days, and occur over several sessions.The ferrets’ violent mating ritual may cause you to want to separate them. Don’t do this! The male ferret’s penis is curved such that it ‘locks’ the female in place until mating is over. Trying to separate them will do more harm than good., After mating, move the jill back to her cage. If the mating was successful, she will gain weight and start nesting. She will also start pulling fur out of her tail and body.Jills also make clucking noises when they are pregnant.You can tell if the jill is pregnant starting about two weeks after a successful mating. You could also have your veterinarian perform an abdominal ultrasound on the jill, but this would be expensive.Jills can have phantom pregnancies, meaning that they act as if they are pregnant when they are not.High levels of hormones can cause your jill to become bloated and look as if she is pregnant.Keep in mind that your jill will need to eat more as she approaches the end of her pregnancy so she can handle the energy demands of giving birth and nursing.If the mating was unsuccessful, try again. Jills remain in heat unless they are bred, which can lead to serious health consequences, including pyometra (infected uterus),, bladder infections,, and anemia.Your female ferret must be bred or spayed if she is in heat.

, A jill’s pregnancy typically lasts about 42 days.Pregnancy and giving birth can take a toll on your pregnant jill’s health. She will need to take in more calories and protein to meet her increased energy demands.Feeding your jill more dry food will also give her the extra protein she will need during nursing.Feed her the highest quality ferret food that you can find to ensure she is in optimal health before giving birth.The diet for a pregnant jill should be at least 35% fat and 22% fat.To give her even more protein, supplement her diet with cooked meat (e.g., chicken) and liver.A pregnant jill that does not eat enough in late pregnancy can develop a very serious condition called pregnancy toxemia. This is an emergency situation—your veterinarian will need to perform a Cesarean section to save your ferret’s life., As with her food intake, your pregnant jill will need to drink a lot more fresh, clean water to get ready for birth and nursing. Increase her water intake to two to three times her normal intake. Put her water in a dish instead of a water bottle—she will likely drink more water from the dish.If she does not drink enough water, she will also not eat enough food. Without enough intake of food or water, your pregnant jill would not be able to produce enough milk for her babies., Your jill can stay with the hob through most of her pregnancy. About two weeks before the end of her pregnancy, you should move her to her own cage. Put fresh paper bedding or pine shavings in this cage.Your jill will use the bedding or shavings to make a nest.Place her cage in a warm, quiet part of your home so she can stay warm and prepare herself for giving birth.Ramp up her food and water intake when you move her to this separate cage., Jills are typically pregnant for about 42 days. When your jill gives birth, give her time alone with her babies (‘kits’) for at least a week. Jills may eat their kits when feeling scared or threatened—you definitely don’t want your jill to do this!


You will need to feed her during this private time. Being as stealthy as you can, slip food and water in her cage when she is distracted.Jills can develop mastitis (mammary gland inflammation) and some of the kits may die after birth,so you should take a quick look at the mom and her babies when you put the food and water in the cage.Call your veterinarian if the jill doesn’t look well, or if you see dead kits that should be removed.

, Now that your jill is nursing, she will need just as much energy as when she was about to give birth. Continue to feed her two to three times her normal intake.Be mindful that if she has a large litter (more than 10 kits), she will lose weight no matter how much you feed her. With such a large litter, the caloric and energy demands will always outweigh how much she can eat., Undoubtedly, your jill’s cage will become smelly after she gives birth. However, you should change the bedding only to check for neglected or abandoned kits.Just like when you put food and water in the cage, be stealthy when you change the bedding.


If you have the cage in an enclosed room, the smell could become unbearable. Increase the air circulation in the room by keeping a door open., When the kits are born, they are only two inches long and are completely dependent on their mother. Their eyes and ears are sealed shut, and they have only the slightest amount of pink fur on their bodies. You can start handling them when they are about one week old, keeping in mind their complete dependence on their mother.You may have to wait longer than a week if the jill doesn’t seem thrilled with you being near the cage as she cares for her babies. You don’t want your eagerness to handle the kits to be the reason she becomes scared and eats some of her babies.
Because kits are so small when they are born, you can probably hold each one in one hand.
As the kits get bigger, you would pick them up by gently grasping them between their neck and shoulders with one hand and supporting their hind legs with the other hand.Hold the kits for only a few seconds before placing them back in their cage.When the kits are about a month old, hold them for longer (a few minutes) and speak softly to them.Do not interrupt feeding time to hold the kits., Start introducing the kits to solid ferret food when they are about three weeks old. They will still be nursing at this point.They will also still have their baby teeth, so you should soak the solid food in water before feeding it to them. It may help to put the softened food in the refrigerator to let it soften a little more.You could try feeding the kits baby food as well.Ferrets can be picky eaters, so you may need to add some kitten milk replacer to the kibble to make it a little tastier.Check the label for the ferret food: it should be high in protein and low in carbohydrates. The protein source should be meat based, such as chicken.Cat foods are usually not ideal to feed ferrets, since they do not have enough fat to meet a ferret’s nutritional needs., The kits should be weaned they are about six weeks old. Their adult teeth will start growing in by this age, so you can start soaking their food in less and less water until you can feed them completely dry food.A kit will have its full set of adult teeth by about nine months of age.Keep in mind that kits should stay with their mother until 12 weeks of age.Although they will be able to eat solid food and should be more comfortable with human handling by six weeks of age, they should stay under their mother’s care for a little while longer.

, Your veterinarian should look over each kit to make sure it is healthy and growing well. The kits’ physical examinations will include checks for parasites, ear mites, fleas, and birth defects.Your veterinarian will make treatment recommendations based on the results of the physical examination.


The kits will also need to receive several vaccinations: canine distemper vaccine at two and three months, and the rabies vaccine at three and four months., Before you make the kits ready for adoption, you should train them in a few areas, such as potty training and training them not to bite. A simple way to potty train the kits is to watch first where they usually go to the bathroom. Place a litter box in that area and encourage them to use the litter box.It may help to give them a little treat each time they use it so they associate the litter box with something good.
Ideal litters contain no dust. Examples include recycled paper pellets and fine softwood shavings. If the wood shavings contain cedar, the amount will likely be too small to cause toxicity in your kits.Clumping litter is not recommended because the kits can make a mess of it and possibly inhale it into their lungs., Kits tend to explore their new world with their mouths, which means they will probably want to bite or nip at just about everything. The biting and nipping are also ways that kits establish hierarchy with their litter mates.To discourage inappropriate biting behavior, give the kit a firm ‘No!’ if it bites when you pick it up. It may take a long time for the kits to get the message that they’re not supposed to bite you, but they will eventually learn.Do not cuddle the kits until they learn not to bite.Discouraging a kit from biting at a young age will help them become better socialized by the time they are old enough to be adopted.
Kits that are well trained and socialized will not bite and nip as much when they become adults. However, they will probably continue to nip at their toys and other cage items throughout their lives."

Just blurt it out!","How to Tell Your Best Friend You ""Like Like"" Them"," If you are wanting to tell this person how you feel, it would be best to do so in private. This way, you both have the opportunity to hear each other out and say what you really feel without any interruptions or comments from others. Don't come off too strong, but also try not to hold any feelings you have back. If you only want them to know, and nobody else, it's best to find a way to get you alone instead of asking them to talk alone, for this can make it obvious. If for some reason you can't get them alone because of some friends or their busy or something, text or call them to try to meet up somewhere you can be alone and you both feel comfortable.;
, Doing something that you both enjoy together is a brilliant ice-breaker. For example, if you both like to draw, bring some paper to keep each other occupied. Or, if you both like jumping rope or browsing at the video game store, you can do that. Once you are both enjoying yourself, you can begin to hint that you like this friend.

, Start off casual, you don't want to leap straight into it and start off too strong. If your friend is not the 'open' type, try to slowly ease onto the topic. Keep it casual and calm.

, You don't want to become the 'other person' in the relationship. If your friend isn't single then it is best to just remain friends until (if)the relationship is over. Do not make your friend chose between you and their current spouse.

, If you followed the previous step, casual conversation should be established by now. Slowly but surely work the love topic into your conversation, you can do this as subtly or not, as you like.

, You can also try write a love poem if you can. If they are the romantic kind they will really appreciate this! Write them a cute, kind letter and they may just fall for you.

, If the suspense is killing you, just say it. This is risky, but is also by far the easiest!

Look for body language cues for attraction.,
Notice increased physical contact.,
Notice when they initiate physical contact.",How to Tell if Your Best Friend Loves You2," When people are attracted to someone, they often display this attraction through their body language. There are a number of different body language cues for attraction, and when you notice your best friend displaying them consistently it can signal that they’re attracted to you. Look for signs like:They maintain eye contact and gaze at you.
They smile subconsciously while they’re talking about you.
They try to be physically close to you by initiating physical contact.
When you talk, their feet are pointed towards you.
They mirror your body language when you two are speaking.
They touch their hair and face while you’re talking., When someone is interested in you, they will try to initiate physical contact more frequently. The two of you might go from not hugging frequently to hugging every time you see each other.The type of physical contact that you have may start to be different as well. Rather than punching you on the arm affectionately, they may initiate a hug. Or, they may start to touch your knee or your arm.

, Physical contact between friends is normal and healthy, but you may start to notice that they are initiating contact much more frequently than they normally do. They may try to be physically affectionate by hugging you, putting their arm around your shoulder, or touching your hand.They may try to “accidentally” brush against you when the two of you are close. This could mean that they are nervous to initiate other kinds of physical contact, like a hug, but they want to be near to you.
If you feel uncomfortable with the amount of physical contact, you should let them know in a gentle and kind way.

Determine how you feel.,
Look at how you’re acting.,
Talk to your friends.,
Talk to them.,
Approach the topic carefully.,
Tell them how much you value their friendship.",How to Tell if Your Best Friend Loves You3," Are you romantically interested in your best friend? Ask yourself whether you would be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with this person if they did like you. How you feel about them as a romantic partner will influence your reactions towards their behavior.If you are interested in them romantically, try to be honest with them about how you are feeling. If the signs are there, they might be interested in you as well. You could try to hint that you have a crush on someone to see how they react, or ask them if they are interested in anyone.
For example, you could say ""Jen, I've been thinking about our friendship a lot, and I think we could be really great together as more than friends.""

, You may be giving them signals that you are interested in them without you realizing it. For example, you could be flirting with them, being more physically affectionate, or opening up more to them emotionally. If you are not interested in your friend as a romantic partner, you should try to stop these overly affectionate behaviors, since they could be giving them mixed signals.


If you are interested in them, you can continue giving them signs that you are interested.

, You may still be confused about whether your best friend really does like you in a romantic way. You can talk to a close friend to ask their opinion and to see whether they know if your friend has a crush on anyone.


Do this carefully, you don’t want word to get back to your best friend that you’re talking about them behind their back. Only talk to friends that you really trust and who have a good perspective on the situation.
You could also casually talk to one of their friends to see if they know whether your best friend is interested in someone. You could say something like, ""Hey, I noticed that Zach hasn’t been talking about Caroline anymore. Do you know if he's interested in someone new?""

, If you're still not sure, just ask. This is the only reliable way to figure out if they are interested in you romantically, but it can come with some risks. For one, the person might not want to jeopardize the friendship, and so will feel uncomfortable telling you.


Be sure you want the relationship to move onto a romance before asking. If you don't, it's better to just avoid the question and let the feelings slowly pass. If the best friend suddenly makes a move or comes out and tells you, then you can address it.
If you want to ask, say something like, ""I don't want to weird you out, but I've noticed things changing a little between us lately, and wondered if it's because our relationship has shifted a little bit."" This will give them an opportunity to share their feelings.

, If your friend doesn't open up, or says something dismissive like, ""No way, what, are you crazy? We're friends, that's all"", you should let it go. You can diffuse the situation by saying something like, ""Hey, no problem, I was just curious. It's cool, either way.""


If your friend is scared to tell you, or is wrestling with their feelings, it may take some time for them to come clean about it to you. Be patient and compassionate, and don't pressure your friend.

, Let them know that your friendship is important to you and that you care about them as a person. Whether you and your best friend end up together or not, your friendship is special and you don’t want to lose them.


If they are interested in you romantically, and you don’t share the same feelings for them, they may need to take a break from your friendship. This will hurt, but they need time to process their own feelings and move on.
Tell them that you do care about your relationship by saying, ""Ben, your friendship means a lot to me. You’re a great friend and I’m glad that I have you in my life. I don’t have romantic feelings for you, but I hope that we can still be best friends.""

, Go on a huge roller coaster together, or do something like skydiving or zip-lining. Doing something like this will help you associate amazing memories with your friend.

, If you are too clingy, it will make you grow apart. If your friend goes on a month long trip, have fun emailing her, but make it occasional. The space will help you bond, because you will actually begin to miss the fun you usually have together, and it will make you want to stay friends more.

, Make a craft together. You can make build something, record a duet, make a two person film, choreograph a dance, make a website, make custom t-shirts, start a business, make some food, start a club, anything. If you have the know-how, teach your friend and you can do it all together.

, If you have a fear of heights and they have a fear of the dark, go on a huge roller coaster as late at night as you can. Anything to help you get over your fears, or at least face them.

, Find a time when everybody is out of the house where you can just be alone together. This way, you can say and do what you want without people hovering over you. Being alone does wonders for a friendship.

, If they are talking, don't space out. It greatly helps your friendship if you know as much about what's going on as they are willing to share. This is a two way thing, though. They should be listening to you, too.

, Call, text, or email them. Get Facebook, Twitter, Myspace, Youtube, Instagram, Pinterest, Skype, or Vine. Any of these ways insure that you will be updated electronically during your time without them.

, Try some trust exercises, physical or mental. You want to know you can trust them, right? Well, they probably want to do the same.

, Find a time to go buy a scrapbook, scrapbook paper, stickers, etc. One you have all of those things, find and/or print out any pictures of you together that you have. Glue and label them, and make the scrapbook fun. Periodically add pictures and update it. Don't be afraid to add pics of you separately. It's still you and them, just no together. Pics of you without them also make a great conversation piece if you forgot to tell them about what happened.

, Find all the videos you have of each other together and apart, and put them together into a big compilation on a program like iMovie. Add transitions, labels, and effects, and always update it. Make sure you both have access to and can watch it at any time.

, Hang out, play games, eat stuff, watch shows and movies, have your mom make a scavenger hunt, pull an all-nighter, fall asleep as soon as you see it's morning, beg your parents to let you stay over later, whatever you want. Sleepovers are a great way to bond.

, Go to a concert, party, pool, amusement park, dance, beach, haunted house, theater, city (like NYC...if you're old enough), local fair, sports game, or mall. Anything you both enjoy can be amazing.

, Arguments can be the death of a friendship if you don't fix it immediately. Try being the bigger person and apologizing first. If you take that step, they might too. Plus, if they try being the bigger person too, the argument will be over as soon as it started. Even better, try ending the argument before it starts by agreeing to disagree.

, If you are jealous of your friend, nothing will ever be fun. Be happy for them, and hope that they are happy for you. They are luckier than you sometimes, and sometimes you're luckier than them. There will always be someone better and worse than you at just about everything. Accept it and move on.

, Laugh, giggle, and smile, or rant, scream, and cry. It's okay to express yourself. Let them know what you do and don't agree with or like, however...expressive you get. It's okay, you guys are close already, so you shouldn't hold back. It's not a turn off if they really are your friend.

, Don't only have one friend. This can make you clingy, and in the end, you will end up making them have only one friend too. Be open to others. Also, don't exclude them in what you do with others, because it will make them feel bad.

, Ask questions. You should know as much about them as they are willing to tell. Just don't intrude upon what they aren't willing to share. Somethings are too personal to tell, even if you are close.

, Sometimes you shouldn't have to ask. Tell them everything. Secrets shouldn't be kept from best friends. Don't hold back with them. If you can really trust them, they won't tell a soul.

, For things like birthdays and Christmas, or for the little things like a good job on something/no reason at all. Anytime you feel like giving a gift, give one.

, Comfort them, celebrate with them, whatever they need. They need you, whether they admit it or not. For the moment, forget how you feel and just think about how they feel. And remember, don't make a joke out of the problem unless it's appropriate.

, Help them get adjusted to moving, or help them with homework. Whatever they need help with, you should help them to the best of your abilities.

, Two good ideas would be Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks, since you can meet there whenever just for a snack. It's a good idea just to be able to eat breakfast every Saturday with them, just to have a set time and place to meet in case you haven't seen each other in forever.

, Some friends even meet every day right off the bus if they can. It's a great system to have you you can relax with a friend right after school.

, That only creates a barrier that make you grow apart whether you like it or not. Always tell the real truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

, It's always nice to have something that only you can laugh at together. It's also a great way to cheer each other up when you're down.

, Even in bed, have a phone near you in case they need to call you at 2am. Always be there for them. If they need you to come over, come over! It's okay to miss an activity once or twice if your BFF is about to break into tears. Emergencies are emergencies, and sometimes convenience can't matter.

, It's always nice to hear a compliment from someone you are close to. And besides, there gotta be a reason you're friends, so use that as a compliment.

, Virtual relationships never work out if you don't meet in person a few times. In-person meetings are vital, even if they only happen every other year.

, If you like acting, do the play together. If you like singing join choir. No matter what you love doing, if they love it too, it can become a vital part of the glue that holds you together.

, If you don't have fun together, it will never work. Friendship is about the ups and downs, so you have to make sure there are always abundant ups, tainted only by occasional downs.

, Some friends will form a band. Others will move in together. No matter what, find a way to make your bond last for life.

, If you start dating, make time for both people, and if dating gets in the way, stop dating them. Best friends before boy/girlfriends. Also, avoid the ""dating my BFF"" situation. If you break up, it will make it REALLY awkward between the two of you.

, By now you should be like family. It's time you got to know their real family, like brothers, sisters, and parents. Your friendship won't work if you don't know the family.

, That puts your friend in a seriously awkward position where they feel like they have to make you happy. The thing is, you are responsible for your happiness, and even though your friendship makes you happy, your friend shouldn't have to all the time. Be positive and your relationship will grow.

, Looks don't matter. No one should have to say that, but this is just a reminder.

, We've all been bullied, and no one likes it. So make sure to stand up for your friend. That way, they won't have to experience the bullying anymore.

, Don't let jealously, anger, etc get in the way of your relationship. You want to be close, so don't let ANYTHING get in the way.

, Don't forget what you know. That could make your friend feel like they are unimportant in your eyes. That creates a barrier that is hard to take down.

, Be yourself around them. You are close, so you don't have to hold back. You can be sad, mad, happy, surprised, or whatever around them.

, If something happens, don't let it ruin your relationship. Forgive each other, and let it go. Let it be a learning experience for you, and don't let it get in the way.

, Say they can't make it to your party. Just remember that they might not be able to help it. Don't be mad at them if you have no reason.

, Do homework together. Take walks. Eat meals. Whatever you regularly do, do it with your friend. It will make them feel loved and included.

, If you both really want to go somewhere, and one of you gets to go, see if you can go together. Vacations are a great way to bond.

, If your mom is making you go to an antique show, invite your friend and put the clothes on, taking pictures in black and white. Family outings are always more fun with your ""extended family"".

, You are best friends, but are you like one person. Try to practice finishing each other's sentences, saying things in synchronization, knowing when the other is acting differently, etc. Once you are this close, there's hardly a chance at all that you two will stop being friends.

, Talk it out if you're having disagreements to remain friends, and don't keep many (if any) things from them. Be open and honest in your communication, but treat them well throughout.

, Many people need more than just one individual, and it's important to allow them to fulfill their social needs. If you have an unbearable dislike of one of their other friends, then talk it over and come to an understanding.


Never let anyone get in the way of your relationship with your life-long friend, even if it's their spouse. You're in it together, so always come to an understanding!

, Try opening up and sharing your interests.

See if the girl is open to kissing other girls.,
See if she'd be open to kissing you.,
Find a private place.,
Make physical contact.,
Make her comfortable.,
Move closer.,
Have an unforgettable first kiss.",How to Get a Girl to Kiss You if You Are a Girl," Before you try to get the girl to kiss you, you should make sure that your advances will actually be welcomed, so don't be too forward/harsh. If the girl is a lesbian or bisexual, then she's obviously open to kissing girls, but if she's just bi-curious, open to new experiences, and loves to experiment, then you may have a shot at it too but be gentle in your approach and give signs that you are interested. Though you can always ask her what she thinks, there are some other ways to know if she's open to kissing girls:


If you want to know whether she's open to kissing girls, you can bring up some lesbians in the popular media, such as K.D. Lang, Ellen, the Indigo Girls, or a number of other women. If she's excited to talk about them and mentions more gay content, then it may be more likely that she's open to kissing girls. Though liking these women doesn't make her a lesbian, it indicates that she's accepting of women who like to kiss women.
If you know the girl pretty well, you can also just try casually asking her if she's kissed a girl before. Even if you're both just bi-curious, this conversation shouldn't make her feel too uncomfortable if she knows you well enough.
You can also just bring up other girls kissing to gauge her reaction. You can say, ""Did you see Mandi and Anna kissing each other in the halls?"" See what she thinks.;
, Even if the girl is a proud and open lesbian, that doesn't mean that she'd want to kiss any girl who comes in her path just because she's gay, and that's including you. Read the signs to see if the girl is into you or not. If she flirts with you, leans close to you when she talks, occasionally runs her hands through your hair, and gets very touchy-feely with you, then it's more likely that she wants to kiss you.


If she's always complimenting your looks and doesn't do it in a superficial way, then she may be telling you that she likes you.
If she's looking at your lips and makes intense eye contact, then she may want to kiss you.
Just keep in mind that if you're both straight and just want to experiment, then it's different from you being straight and wanting to kiss your lesbian friend just for fun. If you think it would be ""cool"" to make out with your lesbian friend but don't really have feelings for her, she may be very offended and think that you don't take her sexuality seriously.

, You want to make sure that you keep this between the two of you for now. Unless you're looking for that drunken make-out in a bar situation with your straight best friend, it's best to keep things private if the girl means something to you. Unless you're both out as lesbians, she won't be comfortable kissing you in a public, or even a semi-public setting, and the kiss will mean more anyway if you're alone. Here are some private places to try to kiss the girl:


Invite her over to watch a movie. Dim the lights and watch her body language as the movie progresses. You could try to kiss her during the movie or afterward.
Invite her over for a sleepover. If you're the right age, then having a sleepover can be a good way to get more intimate with the girl and to try to get her to kiss you in a private place. Just make sure you read the signs carefully and try it when it's almost time for bed. If you try to kiss her right away and she's not into it, that would make for an awkward evening.
Go for a walk to a private place in the evening. Go for a walk through a park or garden as the sun is setting and find a private spot there. This would also be a more romantic setting.

, If you've chosen a bedroom, lie on the bed next to her, then move closer and try to snuggle a little and see how she responds and try to give her a little hug but not too obvious and then lean over a touch her lips with yours and see how she responds. If you're standing up, try to touch her face. If she touches yours, or adjusts your hair or picks lint off your jacket, those are good signs. Only go forward if she seems open to your advances so far. If she seems standoffish or tries to make a lot of jokes, looks around the room, or seems distracted, back off.


Try touching her hair. Tell her you like her hair or the way she's styled it.
Touch her bracelet or earrings and tell her you like them. This is a sneaky way to get closer to her.
Gently graze her arm or shoulder. Keep making physical contact as you're talking.
Lean closer to her. If you're lying down, move your body closer to her as you speak.

, Put her at ease, and try to make her feel safe. She may want to kiss you but she could also be scared about it at the same time. Talk to her and act casual, but not too casual. Make sure she has a hint that you like her as more than a friend. Here are some things that you can say to put her at ease:


If she resists at all, calm her nerves by saying, ""Are you scared?"" If she says yes, tell her not to be, and just give her a nice hug and let her go.
If she says ""A little,"" ask, ""Of me?"" If she says no, you should move closer to her.

, Nuzzle into her a little bit, but if she backs off, tries to move away, or squirms, stop immediately. If she nuzzles into you or returns any kind of affection, look at her. If she is gazing back at you, look at her mouth. If you notice that she's looking at your mouth, she is definitely ready. If her eyes are closed or half closed, reach under her chin and gently tip her face up so that you can look at her.

, Don't shove your tongue down her throat, and don't make it a marathon. Kiss her gently at first. If she responds warmly, by kissing you back, you can kiss her again, and let the kiss deepen as the moment grows. But for a first kiss, try to use some restraint and make it really romantic and wonderful.


That doesn't mean you make it a chaste, boring kiss either - part your lips slightly, making sure they're kissable and soft by licking them slightly.
When you kiss her, hold her and make it romantic and sweet. If this is your first kiss of many with this girl, you'll both have very fond memories of this moment, so make it count.
If your kiss starts getting more intense, you can let your hands wander if you are exploring each others' bodies. If the girl is shyer, she may be waiting for you to make more of the moves. Making ""the"" move is the most detrimental part of getting her to kiss you. You need to be 100% prepared and sure that this is the decision you're willing to make. Do you need to be sure that if this has a potential to ruin your friendship, do you really want to go through with it? After you kiss her smile don't look awkward and uninterested, you can also give her a hug and snuggle together.

Practice saying “No.” Learning how to say “no” is an important part of being assertive.,
Tell your friend what you need.,
Explain how certain behaviors affect you.,
Give gentle reminders.",How to Not Be Controlled by Your Best Friend1," However, if you often say yes, even if you don’t want to, then this can be challenging. Try to remind yourself that saying no is not selfish, it is healthy.Try to pay attention to your needs and say no when you feel that you should.


For example, if you friend has asked you to help her with her homework, but you already have other plans, then it is okay to say no. You are not responsible for your friend’s work.
Don’t give lots of excuses when you say no because this can provide ways for your friend to try and talk you into doing what she wants. Instead, just keep it simple by saying something like, “No, I can’t do that.”;
, If you don’t express your needs in a clear way, then it will be hard for your friend to know that something is bothering you. Instead of staying silent, be direct and tell your friend what you need.Your friend will probably appreciate your honesty and want to preserve the friendship.


Tell your friend that you want him or her to stop bossing you around by saying something like, “It upsets me when you tell me what to do. I would like it if you could stop doing that.”
You could also mention specific things that you need. For example, you might tell your friend, “I need you to listen to me sometimes.” Or, “I need you to be more supportive and less critical of my decisions.”

, A lot of times, your best friend may not realize that he or she is being controlling. In many cases, it is simply their personality to take charge. Explaining that your friend’s behavior is upsetting to you sometimes can help your friend to make changes.


For example, you could say, ""Hey, I know you don't mean to, but most of the time I feel ignored when you don't pay attention to what I want to do.""
You could also try, ""I know your heart is in the right place, but I want to be in charge sometimes. It feels like you don't care what I think, even though I know you don't mean it.""
For an even more assertive approach, you could say something like, “I am going to take the initiative and plan our lunch date this time.”

, After you have explained that you are unwilling to be controlled by them anymore, you can set in place a system that helps your friend learn new ways of interacting with you. For example, instead of being rude and insulting them the next time they try to take over in a situation, you can be polite and say, “I get what you’re trying to say, but I want to figure this out on my own.”Since your friend is learning a new habit, it may take weeks of reminding them that you don’t want to be controlled anymore for them to get it.
Be gentle in your reminders, saying something like, ""Hey, remember when I said that I wanted to decide where we go more often?""

Understand how to recognize a gay-friendly church, based on terminology.,
Realize that the definitions and use of gay-friendly terminology vary.,
Contact the church you are interested in attending to better understand the church's use of gay-friendly terminology.",How to Find a Gay Friendly Church1," Many churches that welcome gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals use the terms ""Welcoming Church"" or ""Affirming Church"" in their marketing materials.;
, There is no standard definition for exactly what a welcoming or affirming church is. Some affirming churches do not consider homosexuality to be a sin, while others may welcome gays in worship but do not recognize gay marriage or allow gay members to hold leadership positions in the church. The definition and use of welcoming and/or affirming may be set at a denominational level or by an individual church, which accounts for the variances in the terminology.

, Because of the diverse understandings of the terms welcoming and affirming, the best way to discern whether the church is truly gay-friendly is to contact the church directly and have a conversation with the pastor or other church leaders.

Stay calm.,
Respond to insults with questions.,
Explain how you would like to be addressed.,
Cut down on the amount of time you spend together.",How to Not Be Controlled by Your Best Friend2," Some people enjoy making other people upset. If it seems like your friend often pushes your buttons just for fun, then don’t give her the satisfaction of seeing you get flustered.Stay as calm as possible and address her in a calm, even voice.


Using assertive body language may also help. Try to stand tall, face your friend, and keep your arms loose at your sides., Insults put the focus on you, but you can turn them around by responding with a question.If your friend comes at you with an insult, then do not get upset. Instead, ask a question to return the focus to your friend.


For example, if your friend says something like, “You are so dumb,” then you can respond with something like, “If you talk to me that way, then I am going to leave. Is that what you want?”

, If your friend has a habit of bossing you around, then correct her. Tell her how you want her to address you instead. For example, if your friend says, “Go get me a can of soda,” then you could correct her by saying, “I think you mean ‘Can I please have a can of soda?’”


If your friend refuses to address you in a respectful manner, then refuse to do what she wants. Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect., If your attempts to address your friend’s bossiness don’t work, then you may need to cut back on the amount of time that you spend with her to show that you are not willing to put up with this treatment.Try limiting your time with this friend to one outing per week, or less if she is treating you really badly.


If your friend asks why you don’t want to spend as much time with her, then you can say something like, “I don’t like the way you treat me. Until that changes, I can’t see you as much as I used to.”

Determine if they always decide what’s best for you.,
Discern if you always have to do things their way.,
Decide if you feel this friendship is fun.,
Determine if you feel suffocated.,
Listen to how often they tell you no.,
Notice if they get angry when you are with other friends.",How to Not Be Controlled by Your Best Friend3," If you’re feeling controlled by your best friend, you may want to confirm that what they are doing is not healthy. One way to do this is to notice if when you are hanging out, they like to decide what is best for you. Do they place your order at restaurants? Do they pick out your clothes when you are going out together?


A sign that someone is manipulating you is first promising you that they will fulfill some desire you have if you agree to go along with what they have decided., Not only do controlling friends like to decide what you should do, they want things their way. Ask yourself: Does my best friend ever let me decide where we are going? Do they let me choose what kind of food we will eat? Do they let me plan outings? If not, your best friend may feel the need to be in control, which is a sign of a manipulative person., If you notice that your friendship is stale and lacks spontaneity and fun, it may be a sign that your best friend is controlling you.This can happen when your friend makes all the decisions for you, forcing everything in your friendship to be all about them.

, Feeling smothered doesn’t just happen in romantic relationships. A feeling of being dominated and smothered can occur in a controlling friendship. If you feel that your best friend is domineering and that they are suffocating your life, this is a sign that they are controlling you.You know you feel suffocated when you are angry that you can’t make decisions for yourself.
You can also feel smothered when your friend wants to take up all your time and does not have consideration for what you in your daily schedule., How often do you hear, “No” from your best friend? Perhaps they say, “No, I think I want to do something else,” or, “No, that’s not a good idea.” Hearing “no” constantly from your best friend is a sign that they are repeatedly taking over situations.

, If your best friend becomes upset and jealous when you spend time with other friends, this is a sign that they are controlling. When you are with other people, you can’t be controlled as easily. Controlling or manipulative people want to constantly be in control, and when they see you with others, they feel threatened.They may yell at you for spending time with other people, or they may try to sabotage your friendships without telling you what they are doing.

Define your legal problem.,
Approach an organization or group of lawyers that specializes in LGBT rights or LGBT clients.,
Research the existing law and make a plan of action.,
If you need legal representation, choose a lawyer who is excellent in the area in question.",How to Get Legal Help for LGBT People," Different legal issues require different kinds of help. For example, if you're looking to make a change to a discriminatory law, you need to find an organization willing to lobby the appropriate lawmakers, or if an existing law is being interpreted unfairly, to bring a test case to court. If your legal trouble involves a crime--for example, assault motivated by sexuality or gender identity--you might be looking for a sympathetic organization's support in dealing with the police. If you're dealing with civil or administrative issues like housing discrimination, employment discrimination, or benefits, then you need to find the appropriate lawyer for that area.;
, Search online for a local organization, or contact someone at a national organization who might be able to point you in the right direction. Some examples in the United States include Lambda Legal's Help Desks, the National Center for Transgender Equality, and the LGBT Bar Association Directory of LGBT Law Partners and LGBT-Owned Firms. These organizations can help you with researching the existing law on your issue, as well as finding legal representation.

, Before you take action, decide how best to approach your problem. How much time and energy do you have to commit to this? Are you willing to go to court? Often, a problem can be solved at an administrative level rather than waging a full-on legal challenge. If a law is in place to protect you, but a low-level official is ignorant of the law or willingly violates it, you can get recourse without ever going to court. Ask a law librarian or public library reference librarian for help in researching the law and decide where to go from there.

, Just because a lawyer is sympathetic to LGBT issues doesn't mean that he or she is an expert in the field. Look online for references to the lawyer you're considering, check credentials and ask around. For example, if you're dealing with a transphobic sexual assault, a lawyer whose expertise is same-sex marriage litigation can't necessarily help you. It may be better to hire a sympathetic attorney with limited LGBT experience but great success in the area of law you need help with.

Conduct an Internet search for gay-friendly churches.,
Utilize a gay-friendly church directory.",How to Find a Gay Friendly Church2," Using the search engine of your choice, search for a church, using keywords like ""gay church"" and the name of your town or city. You also may choose to use the terms ""affirming church"" or ""LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) church"" in your search criteria.


Search for a specific denomination or type of religious organization by adding that to the search criteria. For example, if you are looking for a gay-friendly Presbyterian church in Seattle, use the search criteria ""Presbyterian affirming church in Seattle.""

, There are several websites that provide resources to the LGBT community, including church directories. Some church directories allow you to search by geographic area, while others are organized by Christian denomination.


Be aware that most churches and religious organizations provide their own information to the gay affirming church directories, and many directories cannot guarantee the accuracy of the site content.

Understand that not all gay-friendly churches are sanctioned by their denominations.,
Consider the following gay-friendly denominations or affirming groups within denominations:


Find an affirming Baptist church.",How to Find a Gay Friendly Church3," Some denominations have adopted gay-friendly beliefs in which they do not consider homosexuality to be a sin. However, while many mainline Christian denominations welcome gay Christians, most do believe homosexuality is a sin, and these denominations may limit the role of gay individuals in the congregations. Many churches have action groups or member-organized groups that lobby the denomination on behalf of the gay population, but those groups are not necessarily associated with the actual denomination.

, The Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists (AWAB) advocates for full inclusion of LGBT populations within the Baptist denomination. Baptist churches that are members of the AWAB welcome all people without regard to sexual orientation.
Find an affirming Pentecostal church. The Affirming Pentecostal Church (APC) is a movement within the Pentecostal denomination to welcome people of all sexual orientations and gender identities. Look for a Pentecostal church that is a member of the APC. Global Alliance Affirming Apostolic Pentecostal (GAAAP) and Fellowship of Reconciling Pentecostals International (RPI) are also affirming.
Consider a gay-friendly Catholic church. The Ecumenical Catholic Church welcomes all people, without regard to sexual orientation, gender, marital status, race, education, social background or financial status. The Ecumenical Catholic Church is a separate Catholic denomination and is not affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.
Seek a gay-friendly Christian (Disciples of Christ) church. The Gay, Lesbian and Affirming Disciples (GLAD) Alliance advocates for full inclusion of LGBT individuals in the Disciples of Christ denomination. The alliance has a training process for Disciples of Christ churches who wish to become GLAD-certified.
Find a gay-friendly Episcopal church. Integrity is a grass-roots organization, advocating for full inclusion of LGBT individuals in the Episcopal denomination. With a focus on inclusiveness, Integrity works in the areas education, worship, fellowship, communication, mission and outreach to welcome estranged LGBT Episcopalians back to the church.
Seek out a gay-friendly Lutheran church. Lutherans Concerned is a group dedicated to the full participation of all people in the Lutheran denomination, including people of all gender identities and sexual orientations. The group is opposed to discrimination against homosexuals in the Lutheran church.
Look for a gay-friendly Presbyterian church. More Light Presbyterians is an advocacy group that works on behalf of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people within the Presbyterian Church (USA). More Light Presbyterians provides inclusive ministries, educates churches and presbyteries on LGBT issues, and funds legislation to achieve social justice for LGBT populations.
Find a gay-friendly United Church of Christ (UCC) church. The UCC Coalition for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Concerns offers support and sanctuary to LGBT individuals and families. The coalition advocates for full inclusion of LGBT people and works to create open and affirming congregations within the UCC.
Look for a gay-friendly United Methodist church. Affirmation is an independent group, dedicated to inclusivity for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. The group challenges the United Methodist Church to advocate for social justice for LGBT people. Additionally, the Reconciling Ministries Network (RMN) is a movement of United Methodist churches, ministries and individuals who advocate for full participation of all LGBT people in the United Methodist Church.
Seek out a gay-friendly Metropolitan Community church. Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) was the first church founded on the principles of equality for LGBT people. MCC congregations focus on human and civil rights for all people, regardless of sexual orientation.
Many non-denominational affirming churches are established in a number of cities. Covenant Network is a network of Bible based, Spirit filled affirming churches under the leadership of Bishop Randy Morgan, who is also the founder and senior pastor of New Covenant Church of Atlanta.
If you're looking for a different kind of church or spiritual community, you can search for a Unitarian Universalist church or congregation. They are not usually considered Christian as the Bible is just one source they embrace. Unitarian Universalists were at the forefront of the gay rights and same-sex marriage movement and continue to fight for the rights of all people based on their first two of seven principles, which include ""the worth and dignity of all"" and treating people with respect and compassion.
Unity churches are considered progressive Christian. They describe themselves as a ""positive path for spiritual living"". They are welcoming and inclusive and usually have many LGBT people in their congregations. Their services are upbeat and have contemporary music. For a location near you: unity.org

Think it through carefully before you decide to confront your friend.,
Look at how you are around your best friend.,
Talk to your friend.,
Stand up to your best friend.,
When they reply, they will either be aggressive with you or peaceful.,
Decide what is the best way to end the fight or disagreement.,
Try to forgive your best friend.,
If she/he doesn't listen to you, get your other friends to either talk to her/him about it, or hang about with them instead of your best friend until she/he gets the message.

,
If all else fails, you can either try to sort it out until they agree to stop or walk away.",How to Stand Up to Your Best Friend," Your best friend may be upset or going through a hard time and needs you more than ever.;
, See if you have given her or him any reason to put you down. You might be unconsciously doing the same. Equally, recognize when you're in an unequal relationship, where your best friend is calling all of the shots and not leaving you with much choice.

, Take your friend to a quiet place on your own so that you can speak clearly without interruption. Tell your friend that you're very concerned about things as they currently stand.


Confronting your best friend may be easiest to do on text or any other messaging software. Sometimes personal confrontation is awkward and difficult. Make sure that person is alone, not surrounded by people. The best time for this is early evening, because they will be wide awake but there is less of a chance that they are with someone.







, This may seem mean, but this method has a very strong effect. Straight out list all of the major problems that you have had with them. Do not call them names, or be rude; rather, just say what is bothering you. Do not be afraid to hold back.


Tell her/him how much what she has been doing or saying to you has offended and hurt you. Be aware that they may not know that what they are saying is hurting you, and also that you could be oversensitive. If so, you need to explain that to your friend.







,


If they respond aggressively, and say that a) they didn't do anything or b) blame you for something, then be factual in return, without being upset or mean. List examples of times they have been particularly bad, and ask them for times you have been mean. You never know, you could be just as bad as they are! If they are peaceful, and apologize or say that nothing is wrong, carefully look over what they say.






If they apologize, maybe they realized what they did was wrong and want to change. As tempting as it is to keep fighting, it is very important that you accept the apology. If the problems continue, next time do not be as forgiving. If they say nothing is wrong, calmly state what you are having trouble with, and see what they say.







, Either apologize to them as they apologize to you, or say that you are still angry at them and end the conversation. Sometimes time will mend the fight. Other times you won't be friends anymore. You never know, maybe ending the friendship is for the best. As long as both of you have separate friends to hang out with instead, the loss won't be overwhelming. Just remember during this step, they are your best friend, and is what they did really worth ending your friendship?

, Only leave your best friend as a last resort if the problem can't be solved. Remember that this is the one person in the world you will tell everything to and she will tell you everything. This is bound to bring up some friction as she/he may be worried that you will spread her/his secrets. Remind yourself that the two of you are best friends and of all the times this person forgave you and all the times they helped you.

,, Think very carefully about this, as you might not be able to go back. It will hurt, but it might hurt more in the long term.

Introduce the topic to them.,
Explain what asexuality is in your own words.,
Use an analogy, if it helps.,
Explain the asexuality umbrella.,
Offer to answer questions.,
Expect to clear up some basic misconceptions.,
Don't worry if you can't or don't want to give a comprehensive explanation.",How to Explain Asexuality to Somebody," It could be something such as: ""Do you know what asexuality is?"" Some people already understand asexuality, so you may save yourself some explaining and awkwardness if you ask what they know first.;
, Do this especially if you yourself are asexual. People are more likely to be receptive if you are sincere. Give a general definition.

, Some people find it difficult to imagine life without sexual attraction, so it may take a little elaboration to help it sink in.


""Imagine that an attractive person's bedroom is like a magnet. Sexual people are like metal, so their innate nature is usually to go to it. Asexual people are like plastic. There's no force driving us that direction, but we can go there if we want to.""
""To me, sex is sort of like anchovies. You can eat all the anchovies you want. I don't think any less of you if you eat anchovies. But there is no way in heck I'm touching that.""

, Asexual people are very diverse, and one asexual person may feel very differently from another asexual person in regards to sex.



Demisexual: A person who only experiences sexual attraction towards people they have a strong romantic bond with

Gray-asexual: Someone who has some sexual attraction, but not very much or not very often

, Asexuality can be confusing at first to people who do not understand it, and it can help if you field any questions they have.


If a question is uncomfortable to you, say ""It's personal"" or ""I don't feel comfortable answering that."" You are never obligated to provide answers!

, Most people think of sexual attraction, sex drive, and romance as part of the same package, so they may be a little confused at first as you try to explain the differences between these. You may need to explain that...



Asexual people are not necessarily aromantic. Aromantic people do not experience romantic people, and may be happily single for life. Most asexual people are interested in dating, falling in love, and marriage.

Not all asexual people are sex-repulsed. Some enjoy and seek out sex, some are okay with it, some find it unsatisfying, and others are grossed out by it.

Asexuality is not necessarily lack of a sex drive. It is possible to have a sex drive, without feeling sexual attraction. These people may identify as gray-asexual.

Asexuality is a real orientation. Asexuality is as natural and innate as being straight, gay, bisexual, et cetera. Most asexual people are asexual throughout their entire lives.

, Educating others is nice, but optional, and you are never obligated to hand-hold someone through their discovery of the letters in LGBTQIA. Feel free to end a conversation at any time you want to, and refer them to AVEN if they want to learn more.

Think about the people who attract you.,
Reflect on your feelings for other women.,
Think back on your actions.,
Talk to those who identify as lesbian.,
Take your time.,
Consider talking to friends or family if you feel safe.,
Know that you do not have to label yourself.,
Explore your attractions.,
Consider the sexualities beyond “straight” or “gay.” Though there are many lesbians in the world, know that there are sexual orientations beyond being straight or gay.,
Evaluate the difference between gender and sexual orientation.,
Accept that sexual orientation can evolve.,
Accept that you cannot change your sexual orientation.,
Accept that sexual and emotional attraction are different.",How to Figure Out Whether or Not You Are a Lesbian," After you know more about sexual identities, take some time to reflect more on your own. Considering the following questions can help you assess where you are on the spectrum:What thoughts have you had that make you think you might be a lesbian? Have you ever had sexual thoughts for men? How often do you have both?
If you had a thought that another woman is pretty, know that this does not indicate sexual identity. Being able to recognize beauty in others in normal.;
, Beyond your thoughts, begin to consider your feelings for other women. Perhaps you have even felt that you have been in love with a woman before. Know that this does not inherently mean that you are lesbian, but it could mean that you are not heterosexual. Consider the following questions in assessing your feelings:Have you wanted to kiss, touch, or do something romantic for other women? Have you ever had thoughts about men in this way? Which feelings bring you more pleasure?

, In addition to your thoughts and feelings, think about what you have done with other women. If you have been on dates, been in relationships, or had sex with women, then you might be a lesbian, especially if you have no interest in doing these things with men., One other way to help assess your feelings is to talk to lesbian women. You might want to find out how they realized that they were lesbian or if they always knew, what their same sex attractions were like to them, and if they ever had feelings for men. Try to find someone who you know well who you can feel comfortable asking personal questions.


Make sure that you trust this person as well so that they don’t out you before you are ready.

, After you have taken some time to reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and history, take the pressure off of yourself. Allow these reflections to sit with you and don’t feel that you have to make a choice or tell anyone until you are ready.Consider watching some television shows or films that feature lesbian characters. If you identify with them more than the straight characters, you might be gay.
You might also want to read some books with lesbian characters, as well.

, If you feel that your friends and family will be supportive of you regardless of your sexual identity, talk to them about your confusion. Perhaps they have observed some behavior in you that you may not have even noticed in yourself, like staring at other women.You might say something like “Hey Monica, I consider you as being one of my best friends. I hope you won’t judge me, but lately I’ve been wondering if maybe I’m a lesbian or not. Have you ever thought that maybe I am?”
If you're nervous about telling your friends, you can ask them what they think about LGBTQ issues in general. You can say something like, ""I'm glad gay marriage is legal now, but I think there are still a lot of obstacles before LGBTQ people are treated equally in our country. What do you think?""
Don’t talk to your family or friends if you have good cause to feel afraid of their reactions. If you are likely to be abused or cut off financially, protect yourself.

, At the end of the day, labeling yourself as a lesbian before you are sure is not a good idea. At the same time, pretending to be straight if you know you are not is also not ideal. Know that regardless of your sexual orientation, however, you do not have to label yourself until you are ready and sure. Be who you are apart from labels.If you aren't sure, you can tell people you are ""questioning.""
You can also choose to identify as ""queer,"" a label that doesn't specify whether you feel a difference in your orientation, gender, or both.

, Take some time to explore your attractions. Flirt with women and see how it makes you feel. Give a guy your number if you like him and want to chat. Consider going on a few dates with people from both genders and assess who you are attracted to more, emotionally and physically. But most of all, have fun!

, Some people experience sexual and romantic attraction to people of both genders, and may identify as bisexual. Some might not be concerned about gender at all when selecting a partner and may identify as being pansexual or queer. Though you may very well be a lesbian, recognize that attraction is not always black and white., Know that sex is the gender that you were assigned at birth, either male or female, based on your reproductive organs. Sexual orientation is your sexual identity based on the gender that you are attracted to.Gender identity is how you identify yourself beyond what is listed on your birth certificate. You might be listed as female but have always identified with men and feel that you are a man. In this instance, your gender identity would be a transgender man.

, Know that your previous attractions don’t necessarily determine your future ones. Today, you may really want to kiss a certain woman that you know, and tomorrow you might want to kiss a guy and never think about a woman again. Recognize that attractions can change. However, if you have never been attracted to a man, and only have feelings for women, you may be a lesbian., Figuring out that you are a lesbian might be difficult for you. Perhaps your family is very religious or you live in a small town and you are afraid of the backlash you might receive should people find out. No matter your circumstances, however, know that you can’t change your attraction. You are who you are. Work to keep yourself safe, but don’t lose yourself in the process., Though some people might confuse the two, recognize that sexual and emotional attraction are inherently different. For instance, perhaps you have a friend who is a woman who you always want to kiss or touch, but you do not necessarily want to go out to dinner with her. Or you may know guys who you would really like go on a date with. Know that the two attractions are different and assess what is more important to you.Also be mindful of the way that women and men are primed and conditioned to think about those of the opposite sex. People of all genders are conditioned from a young age to think only about those of the opposite sex in a romantic context. Know that if your feelings for women seem purely sexual, this could be a reason why.

Practice self-care.",How to Explain to Your Partner that You are Questioning Your Gender," This topic will likely be confusing for both you and your partner. You should know ahead of time what you want to share with your partner. If you are nervous that you will forget or get off topic, write down the things you want to talk to your partner about.Just telling your partner “I’m questioning my gender,” is a good start, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions. It can help to tell your partner something more explicit like “I feel like I was born the incorrect gender. I am uncomfortable living my life as the gender I was assigned at birth, and I am questioning whether I want to continue living as that gender.”;
, Be clear with your partner about how questioning your gender affects how you view the relationship. If you are interested in continuing the relationship, make sure your partner knows that. If a new gender identity means you plan to leave the relationship, be sure to tell your partner that.If you are not sure what you want, then tell your partner that. Avoiding the truth, or outright lying to your partner, will make your partner uneasy. This can make it harder for them to trust you, especially in a time that can be confusing for them.Being honest also allows you to share yourself with your partner and live your life in a genuine way.
Reassure your partner by saying things like “I know this is confusing to you, but it makes me more comfortable. I still love you and want to be with you, and this change can be positive. For example, I feel more in tune to myself and to you.”

, Many people know little about the life of a transgender person. You will need to help your partner understand. Tell them stories, collect scientific research articles, and carefully explain your situation.Many people may not even understand what gender dysphoria is. This is a good place to start explaining things to your partner from a scientific and medical perspective.
For example, you might say something like “I know that it is hard to understand, but some people are born this way. I haven’t ‘decided’ to feel this way, it is just part of me.”
Make sure to give your partner materials that they can read over in their spare time. It is likely that they will not retain a lot of the information you give them, so allowing them to read through it in their own time will be helpful for them.

, With not understanding your situation comes not understanding your needs. Even the most sympathetic of partners may have a hard time knowing what they can do to support you during this time. Be clear and honest about the ways that your partner can be there for you.For example, you may need to talk to your partner about your gender daily. On the contrary, you may feel most comfortable if your partner doesn’t bring it up. Say something to your partner like “You can come to me if we need to talk about it, but otherwise, I would prefer not to dwell on the subject every day.”
Be sure to ask about their needs as well. Try saying something like, “How can I help you process this?”

, The big news that you are questioning your gender should not be dropped on your partner lightly. Plan a date to go out to the park, take a weekend trip, or do something that you and your partner enjoy. Make sure that you and your partner are both as relaxed as you can be.Your partner may have a harder time processing any big news after a long stressful day.

, The two of you will have a lot to discuss. Rather than bringing this up at a restaurant, talk over dinner at home. You could also plan a getaway and have a fresh change of scenery for your conversation. Make sure the place you choose is calm and private so that you will not be interrupted.If you are afraid that your partner will react violently, you should not disclose this in private. In fact, leaving the relationship altogether might be a good idea. If your partner has negative opinions of transgender people, this might be a warning sign.
A good option for facilitating a conversation between you and your partner is to meet with a mental health professional, such as a therapist. Try saying something like, ""I've started talking to someone about things going on in my life and I'd like you to join me for a session.""

, This will help you be more comfortable with what you want to say. If it helps, you can practice in front of a mirror. If you know where you will be having the conversation, you can go practice there so that you are more comfortable at the time of the conversation.

, Once you make a date and pick nice private place to talk, you can start the conversation. Be clear and direct with your partner. Explain how you feel, and when you are finished, allow them to respond.For example, you can just say “I set this date up because I wanted to talk to you about the way that see myself. I am questioning my gender, and want to include you in the journey.”
Keep in mind that this will likely be very emotional for you. If you start to cry, don’t try to hold it in or feel ashamed. Just take a few deep breaths and take a moment to compose yourself before continuing.

, Even though you have probably known for a long time that your current gender feels uncomfortable, your partner is no mind reader. This can come as a big change for your partner and your relationship. Answer any questions that you can and reassure your partner that you are still the same person and feel the same way about them.Your partner is likely to ask things like “How long have you felt this way,” or “Why didn’t you tell me before?”
Your partner may also ask something like “Will you change your mind?”
Your partner may also start to question the entire history of your relationship and wonder whether any of it was real. Make sure to validate this because it is a normal stage in this process.

, How you see yourself and your body is your choice alone. Your relationship, however, is comprised of two people. Your partner has a right to their own feelings the same way that you have a right to yours. Allow your partner to express those feelings and be as respectful as you expect them to be of your feelings.This does not mean to tolerate abusive or demeaning behavior. Your partner has a right to feel happy, confused, sad, angry, excited, or any combination of emotions, but they do not have the right to lash out at you.
For example, it is okay for your partner to say something like “This is really confusing for me, and it makes me uncomfortable.” It isn’t okay for them to say something like “You disgust me! I hate you!”

, You have been thinking about how this news would impact your relationship for some time before you told your partner. Now, they may need a turn to think. Do not rush your partner to respond or force them to talk again before they are ready.There is no set amount of time that is right. You and your partner will have to feel out the situation and decide how much time is needed.
Discuss with your partner your feelings about them talking this over with a close friend or family member, or if you would prefer that they find a counselor to speak with for now.

, Having a support system will help you to understand who you are and how you feel. It is important to surround yourself with positive people who will not reject you for questioning your gender. It is also a good idea to consider having contact with support groups or other individuals who have gone through the same experiences you are now living.


GLAAD, PFLAG, and the Human Rights Campaign are especially helpful resources., Suppressing your feelings is unhealthy and can manifest in a variety of mental and physical ways from headaches to depression. Take the time to allow yourself to question, decide for yourself who you are, and accept yourself. Keep up with your hygiene, both physical and emotional, by exercising regularly, eating well, and resting.

Inform whomever you’re talking to that you want to get involved with the fight. You can give her an idea of the issues you’d like to address or what your knowledge of those issues are.
Ask questions if you have them. Remember to keep your questions informative rather than nosy, and don't ask questions to people who are not comfortable answering, as discussing discrimination can be potentially triggering to some transgender people.
Be honest with the person. If you are not transgender, most individuals will be receptive and explain their experiences if you are open about your intentions and knowledge level. You can say something like “I’ve recently witnessed discrimination against a wonderful colleagues who is transgender. It made me realize how difficult her life can be and I’d love to promote transgender rights. But I don’t know anything about the issues and am worried about offending someone. I’d love to hear your perspective and get some tips about how best to approach this.”
Remember that you share the same goal of equality, even if you don’t agree on the best way to get there.;
, Your efforts to fight for transgender rights are very admirable. But if you don’t have much experience with the issues or advocating for them, it’s important to inform yourself so that you can be a strong and convincing advocate for rights. Remember that a the civil rights and equality of transgender people are at stake.Getting improper information before you begin your fight can have serious consequences, including offending people or hindering your ability to fight for equal rights in the future.

, There is a wide and complex variety of issues related to transgender rights including workplace discrimination and difficulty getting gender acknowledgement from legal institutions. Staying on top of the latest information about transgender issues can help you better understand them and make you a much more effective fighter for equal rights.Sign up for news updates from organizations that fight for and promote transgender rights.Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Lambda Legal, Human Rights Campaign (HRC), and the National Center for Transgender Equality provide a broad array of resources on their websites that can help you learn more about specific issues or initiatives.Many of these groups have mailing lists you can join that provide information.
Consider reading information put out by groups opposed to transgender rights. This might be counterintuitive, but informing yourself on their viewpoints can help you undertake initiatives to counter their efforts. For example, if you attend a rally for transgender rights, there are likely to be participants demonstrating against them. Anticipating their arguments through research can you effectively craft counter-arguments.

, Concentrate on a couple of issues that interest you. This will allow you to become especially well-versed and active in your fight. For example, maybe you want to ensure transgender people have a safe and welcoming workplace and equal access to healthcare.Focusing your efforts deeply on a couple of issues may be more effective than tackling a broad range of them. However, you should keep yourself informed of general themes and issues within the transgender community.

, Many people and organizations, such as the ACLU, have engaged with transgender issues for decades. Talking to individuals or representatives who actively fight for transgender rights can broaden your understanding of issues and how you can best participate in the fight for equality.Find other advocates by contacting organizations that fight for transgender rights. Most of these groups have ways to contact them including phone and email.They may also have local chapters or advocates with whom you can work.
Expand your understanding of relevant issues by networking at transgender events. Ask other participants about how you can best contribute to the fight for rights.

, Many transgender groups organize rallies to promote political awareness at key moments in legislation or even simply at local events. Find a local, national, or international demonstration as a way to publicly show your support for transgender rights.Check for rallies or demonstrations on the websites or social media accounts of transgender groups or organizations that fight for transgender rights. Many list upcoming demonstrations and ways you can participate.
Ask a fellow advocate or friend if there are any political events you can attend and if there are any organizational tasks that you can do in support of it.
Be aware that while many countries allow persons to demonstrate in support of transgender rights that some do not and this may put you at risk of arrest or prosecution., Transgender rights are a hot button issue in the politics of many countries. If you are able, contacting your local legislators or representative to discuss their position and presenting yours may help the person understand difficulties transgender people face. In turn, this may set in motion the wheel of change in your local area or beyond.Bring notes on specific points you’d like to discuss. This can keep the conversation focused and provide information if the representative has questions. Don’t push your agenda too much by being overly argumentative. Remember that you can win more bees with honey than vinegar.Participate in the campaign of an elected official who fights for transgender rights. Attending her person’s political events can create awareness about transgender rights. In many places, you can also demonstrate against officials who hinder transgender rights through their voting record.

, In addition to political rallies, there are often events to raise awareness and funds for the transgender community. Attending lectures, galas, or even fundraisers can not only show your support for transgender rights but also help make a difference to transgender people struggling with issues such as medical bills or bullying.


Check the websites, email updates, and other social media of organizations and persons who support transgender rights. Most keep a list of events throughout the US and world that you may want to attend.Be aware that many events require that you pay something or make a donation towards such items as decreasing their administrative costs or promoting transgender rights.
Consider organizing a local event for transgender rights. There are many different types of things you can do from having a fundraising banquet to inviting a speaker to give a lecture on transgender issues. Use the proceeds from your event to make a donation to an organization that fights for transgender rights. You may also want to post your success on social media or in the local news.

, Personal or professional commitments may keep you from dedicating significant time to fighting for transgender rights. However, donating money to a local or national organization can also show your support and keep the fight going.Dedicate as much money as you are able to the organization of your choice. Many will give you a subscription to their newsletter or magazine in return. Remember that your donation is tax-deductible.Specify if you want your donation to support a specific issue or event. For example, you can say you’d like your donation to help at-risk youth or public education.

, Depending on your training and commitment to fighting, consider applying for a job with an organization that supports transgender rights. This might help you make a bigger difference in the fight and give the organization much-needed support and skills.


Figure out how your skills could benefit an organization that advocates for transgender rights. Many groups work on legal, educational, and advocacy issues. For example, if you are a great writer, consider a support role that includes composing letters to legislators.Send a letter of interest and resume to different organizations and express your desire to work towards transgender rights.

, Consider volunteering with a group, organization, or other institution that supports transgender rights. Give as much time as you can to help continue the fight for equality.


Consider some of the issues that confront many transgender persons including poverty and harassment. These may help steer you towards organizations or local groups that help transgender persons and fight for their rights.For example, you could work for a local suicide hotline or at a health clinic that specializes in supporting the LGBTQ community.

, If you’ve made the decision to actively fight for transgender rights, make sure you follow through in supporting transgender individuals and issues. Taking the opportunity to defend transgender persons or educate colleagues about transgender rights confirms your willingness to be an advocate for rights.


Be confident in standing up for transgender rights. Every human deserves equal rights irrespective of their gender or sexual identification and defending this principle keeps the fight alive. For example, if hear someone making inappropriate comments or jokes to a transgender friend, say “I’m sorry to interrupt, but Barney, that’s just not an acceptable way to talk to Alan.” You might find that Barney appreciates your support and Alan learns something from the situation.
Discuss the importance of the equal rights. In many cases, the negative attitudes come from ignorance. Explain the injustices many transgender people face and answer any questions that might arise.

, Unfortunately, it is still common for transgender people to encounter discrimination.If you see or know of any discrimination, such as harassment, violence, or not hiring a person specifically because she is transgender, let a superior or local organization know about it.


Tell an immediate superior about the discrimination in written form. This registers the incident in writing and obligates the supervisor to address it.
Contact an organization such as the ACLU if you wish to confidentially report discrimination. Many organizations, including the ACLU, have local chapters or groups with whom they work that can further help you.Be aware that there is different legislation about discrimination in different places. For example, in the United States, only some states have nondiscrimination laws.This may help you get the right type of support in reporting discrimination.

, One great way to fight for rights and raise awareness is to publish about issues on the web. Consider starting a blog or posting stories or pictures relevant to transgender right to your social media accounts.


Ask a friend or advocate for help in setting up your online presence. They may have useful additions or suggestions on expressing your message to fight for transgender rights.

Once she knows, she’s more likely to pick up on subtle cues that you’re interested.If you’re not out of the closet to her, you can casually say something that indicates your sexuality. You could mention an ex-girlfriend or say something like, “It feels so great to be able to be out at my new job.”
Sharing your orientation with her may prompt her to say something about her sexuality, but not necessarily. If you feel comfortable, you could say something like, “Do you think you could ever try being with a woman?”;
, You may be dying on the inside, but try to keep a cool outside. You’re still trying to get a feel for if she’s interested or not. If you’re too overwhelmed by your feelings, you won’t be a very good observer of hers.Spend time with friends or doing activities that will take your mind off your crush.
Don’t put your friend on a pedestal. Focus on the things that make her human—not an idealized version of herself.

, The better you get to know her, the more you’ll be able to read her feelings. This will also give her a chance to get to know (and like!) you better.Notice if she also initiates spending time together. If you’re always the one to suggest hanging out, she might not be interested.
Notice the quality of your time together. Are you always in a large group? Does she seem distracted by her phone or someone else? These could be signs that she’s not feeling romantically toward you.

, People show their interest in a number of ways. Look for some classic behaviors that could indicate that she’s into you.Friends aren’t usually awkward around each other. So if she’s acting shy or awkward around you, that could be a good sign.
Does she text or message you just for fun? Does she remember little bits of your conversations and reference them? Does she do thoughtful little gestures for you? These are great indicators that she could have feelings for you.

, Find someone who is trustworthy. Even if you don’t confess your crush, your mutual friend will probably get the idea. However, if you have a friend whom you know can keep a secret, ask for their advice. They might know more about your crush’s dating history or current status.


You can ask your mutual friend if they know more about your crush’s sexual orientation.
If you feel very comfortable, you can confess your crush and ask your mutual friend for advice. However, don’t take anyone’s advice too seriously. Always trust your own intuition.

, Confessing a crush on a friend often alters the relationship. Be honest with yourself. How will you feel if your friend feels really awkward or freaked out? Is that something you’re ready to deal with?Understand that you may lose this friendship by confessing your crush. However, that can sometimes be less painful than keeping your feelings bottled up.

, Start with subtle signals and see if you get a response. This is a great way to let your feelings show without being too vulnerable at first. If your friend notices the messages you’re sending, she’ll likely start considering that you may have a crush on her. She’ll likely be at least flattered.Eye contact is a great flirting tool. When the two of you make eye contact, hold it just a second too long and then look away. This is often read as a sign of romantic interest.
Initiate casual touch. It’s best to touch someone in a way that still seems friendly—not romantic. You can touch her on the arm or shoulder when you ask her how she’s doing. Or give her a hug before you part ways. If she begins to initiate touch too, that could indicate interest.

, Be thoughtful when planning this. Consider that your friend might feel awkward when you tell her. She might not know how to respond. Choose a time and place where you can be alone and have time to fully discuss both of your feelings without distractions.Invite her to go for a walk. Choose a place that you can both feel comfortable and enjoy.
Invite her over to your house—as long as it’s easy enough for her to leave, should the conversation become uncomfortable.

, Don’t dance around your feelings, but stay collected. She doesn’t need to know how many times you’ve looked at her Instagram, or how long you’ve been pining for her. Simply let her know that you’re interested.Rather than telling her exactly how you feel, you could simply ask her out on a date. Be clear that it’s a date, though. If you usually say, “let’s hang out next week,” be more explicit. Say, “I’d really like to take you on a date. Would you be open to that?”
Let her know that you don’t need her to feel the same way. You can say, “So, I actually have a crush on you. I’m not sure if you could tell. But I wanted to let you know. And I totally understand that you might not feel the same way.”
Give her the space to think about it on her own. You can say something like, “I know this might surprise you, but I’ve had feelings for you for a while. And I felt like I needed to say something. But please don’t feel like you need to say something right away.”

, She might be surprised and need some time to think about it. Or she might have questions for you. If she wants to talk, be honest and keep communication flowing.If she expresses interest in you, that's great! Let her know that you're happy to hear that she feels the same way.
If she returns your feelings, you may want to initiate a more romantic form of touch, such as holding hands. You can also let her know that you're happy to take things slowly.
If her response is hurtful to you, let her know. There are ways she can let you know she’s not interested without being cruel or insensitive.
Be graceful when she responds. Let her know that you understand her position, even if it’s hard for you.

, If she returns your feelings, you'll likely be making steps toward romance. If she doesn't, make sure you're both invested in remaining friends. Either way, communicate about where you'd like things to go from here.


If you're going to become romantic, you could say something like, ""If things don't work out, I hope we can still remain friends afterward.""
If she doesn't return your feelings, it's okay if you need to take a break from the friendship while you get over her.

, When a friend confesses a crush, we often assume they only like us because they’re interested in us sexually. Assure her that you value her as a friend and a person.


You can say, “I understand that you’re not interested in me romantically, but I really hope we can keep this friendship intact. I really value having you as a friend.”

, Acknowledge that your feelings have clearly changed things between you. Let her know that you want to do what’s necessary to get the friendship back on track.


You can say, “I understand that telling you my feelings may have made things awkward between us; but it was important for me to do. Now that I know how you feel, I really want to do what I can to get our friendship back to how it was.

, If your crush was pretty intense, you might need to take some time away from your friend. You won’t be able to stay friends with her unless you’re really over her.Be honest with her if you need some time. You can tell her that you respect her feelings, but you need some time for yours to heal.
Let her know if you’d prefer for her to not contact you. You can simply say, “I think I need some time to get over you. Would you mind letting me do the reaching out for a while? I’m not sure if I’m ready to keep hanging out yet.”

, Most likely, your friend simply isn’t interested in women, even if she thinks you’re an awesome friend. Don’t take the rejection personally.Spend time with other friends whom you feel good around. This can help boost feelings of self love.
Say positive affirmations to yourself. Tell yourself that you're a great person, and that you've got a lot to offer.

, There are plenty more fish in the sea. The longer you dwell on this one case of rejection, the longer your heartache will be. If there’s someone else who strikes your fancy, shift your energy towards them.Experiment with online dating. You’re likely to meet other people who share your sexual orientation, and who are outside of your social circle.
If you’re not ready for dating, spend time with family or friends.

, Eventually, you’ll be over your crush. You’ll likely want to reach out. Let her know that you’re excited to see her again. Ask her if she’d like to get together as friends.


Try not to hold out hope that she'll have changed her mind.
When you do see each other, avoid anything that could be read as flirting. Maintain good boundaries.

Give yourself some time to get to know co-workers before bringing up issues in conversation.


Co-workers will be less receptive to learning about gay and lesbian issues if they don't know or trust you.;
, It's important to conduct yourself professionally and responsibly when educating co-workers about gay and lesbian issues. It's admirable to be an advocate for the gay community, but letting it distract you from your duties could get you in trouble.

, Remember that not everyone will want your insights into the issues faced by gay and lesbian people. This could be because they don't agree with it or just because they don't feel the workplace is the right place to discuss it. Respect the wishes of individuals that don't want to discuss gay and lesbian issues at work.

, Bring up topics related to the gay and lesbian community casually to begin the discussion. Relate them to something already being discussed. Co-workers will likely be more receptive to discussing issues if you reference current news items or events that are related than if you just bring it up suddenly.

, Diversity training gives workers the tools they need to be sensitive to the differences among their fellow employees, as well as the differences among the people they come into contact with as a part of their job.

, Offer co-workers resources for further information if they want to know more than time in the workplace permits. Suggest articles or websites that will further educate them and help them understand the process of coming out, the meaning of pride activities, and current issues in the gay and lesbian community.

, If you are gay or lesbian, you can educate co-workers by just being your normal self while out. Be honest about your sexuality and try to represent the gay or lesbian community in the best way possible.


Remember that co-workers that know you're gay may view you as a representative or advocate of the gay lifestyle. If you are interested in educating them, be kind and willing to teach them about your life and the struggles you face due to being a gay or lesbian person in a homophobic society.

, Help co-workers that you know are gay or lesbian feel comfortable by asking about their partner and their home life. Joining in office discussions about home life, pastimes, spouses and future plans is a normal part of work life, and gay and lesbian workers should be included in that.


If you are gay or lesbian, you can mention your partner, gay pride events and advocacy groups you support during these ""water cooler"" conversations. This shows co-workers that you want to talk about your life and it could show them how many similarities exist between your life and theirs.

, Because of pervasive homophobia in some communities and businesses, many gay and lesbian workers choose not to come out. This is their personal choice and that choice should be respected and followed., One of the ways that gay and lesbian employees will feel comfortable in a work environment is to make them equal in that environment. If you are gay or lesbian, or just interested in creating a positive work environment for gay and lesbian people, have discussions with management about your benefits. For example, make sure that the partners of gay and lesbian workers are covered by your medical coverage in the same way that straight partners are covered.


Your company should also have a non-discrimination policy. This should outline a variety of things including appropriate and inappropriate language around sexual orientation, a list of penalties for incidences of discrimination, and how employees will be protected from retaliation., It's important to walk the fine line between making a gay or lesbian employee feel like they can be open about their life, while also not making them uncomfortable by putting a spotlight on them, so to speak. Have conversations with gay and lesbian employees about how comfortable they are and whether they want to be out to the whole office or company.


You should also avoid asking a gay or lesbian employee every question you have about gay life, culture, or issues. It is up to you to figure these things out and not put the burden on them.
If you are a gay or lesbian employee, feel free to set some personal boundaries. While you may feel good about helping others to understand the issues you face, don't feel obligated to. Being burdened with educating a whole office or company can quickly become one of the issues that bother you in an office.

, There are a variety of ways that a company can do this, from putting pictures of same-sex couples on advertisements or pamphlets, to making a bold and clear statement about diversity.If a company actively fosters an atmosphere that is inclusive, it will make gay and lesbian employees feel more at home, more welcome, and more invested in the company they work for.

Keep your temper in check.,
Don't belittle the beliefs of others.,
Rely on the science of human biology.,
Use logic in your discussion.,
Turn the hot seat around and have your opponent sit in it for a while.,
Address the objection, do not dance around it:


The other person may remark that gay men and women have sought treatment and changed their sexual orientation.,
Require your opponent to abide by his or her own rules.,
Listen to the other person's argument.,
Decide that what you believe makes the most sense after reflecting on the discussion.

,
Be aware of fallacies commonly used by the other side.",How to Defend Your Views on Gay Rights," Although you may become angry, do your best to remain calm and discuss, rather than argue.;
, It won't win you any points to question anyone's moral or religious beliefs on homosexuality.

, Point out that, even though there are no conclusive studies that people are born with a ""gay gene,"" recent studies have found that there are notable differences between the physiology of a straight male and a gay male (researchers believe that being gay is not entirely environmental, but also has a genetic component).

, Stress the fact that although there may not be a gay gene, likewise, there is no straight gene either; so if that were the only factor, any person could choose to be gay or straight whenever they wished to.

, Ask the person you are discussing the issue with: if a gay person could choose to be straight, then could a straight person choose to be gay?

, Address this by explaining to them that evidence from these groups is usually not long term, and that the fall-back rate is staggering and made much worse by the fact that, by the time the so-called ""gay"" admits that the ""cure"" didn't stick, s/he might have married and produced children, who will be devastated by divorce. It might also be the time to point out that the American Psychological Association has said it is unethical to apply pressure to change someone's |sexual orientation and there is no reason to do so except for ""societal comfort"".
The other person may express that since gay men and women can't reproduce, that will open the door to adoption. You can address this by calmly recognizing that family is the basis of society, and there are many kids without homes. Having loving and committed gay (or of course straight) parents is much better for children than to be raised in the foster system, where they are often the victims of sexual predators, or neglect or abuse. Also, point out that a gay man's penis and a lesbian's vagina are perfectly capable of producing kids.
If the other person expresses the idea that gay parents will raise gay kids, respond with something like ""If that were true, then straight parents would only raise straight kids."" Again, using logic.
Some people may bring up certain statistics claiming that gay people are more violent/abusive/prone to drugs etc. Although the accuracy of those reports is usually quite dubious, another way to address this is via logic. Correlation doesn't imply causality. Just because two events are correlated, doesn't mean that one causes the other. Eg. Correlation: Joe robs a bank. Joe is also diabetic. Irrational causation: Being diabetic caused Joe to rob banks; or diabetics are bad people who rob banks. Another one: Correlation: The sun sets. At the same time, the street lights go on. Irrational Causation: Turning on street lights causes the sun to set. When someone brings up statistics about gay people, break it down in a similar manner. John is gay, John also robs a bank. Does that mean that being gay caused him to rob banks? Of course not. Reduce it further and it's more obvious: John is attracted to other men, thus he will rob banks. Obviously, this makes absolutely no sense. John can love football, ice cream, and mathematics, but no one would claim that football lovers and mathematicians were immoral and will all rob banks.
If you are in the USA, remember the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution
The Declaration of Independence: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights."" While the Declaration of Independence is not legally binding, it does express the moral sentiments which are legally codified in the Constitution. Remind the person you are talking with that the Constitution is supposed to guarantee every American the same rights regardless of who they are. It is to apply equality equally to all American citizens.
The First Amendment of the Constitution: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion."" If someone brings up God as a reason why same-sex marriage should be banned, remind them that they live in America, and not everyone is Christian. The very first right of the constitution basically bars religion from entering a debate involving the law.




, Often, examples of prohibitions which seem to support their arguments are snipped from the Bible out of context, disregarding verses that do not seem to support their position. The key here is knowing the material well enough that you can complete the passages that they often truncate. If the other person uses the Bible as a reason for being against gay rights, then point out that the Bible also condemns the cutting of side hairs, the killing of any creature, and specifies that one may not eat anything that has crawled on the earth. If the person you are talking with insists that the Bible must be interpreted, reply with, ""Yes, that's exactly my point"". Then point out that a message of hate is not what any prophet would want. Alternatively, note that using the Bible to live your life is fine, but to use it in a debate is circular reasoning. The veracity of the Bible is supported by the fact that the Bible says that the Bible is true.

, Be respectful in allowing them their right to a differing opinion.

,, For example, many people will argue that gay and straight people have exactly equal rights: both can marry partners of the opposite sex; neither can marry partners of the same sex. This is, technically, true, but rather besides the point. An analogy might drive this home. Both Jewish Israelis and Arab Israelis have difficulty marrying a Palestinian partner. The law is not technically discriminatory. But since a Jewish Israeli is unlikely to want to marry a Palestinian, the law has a discriminatory effect. And here's a simpler analogy: In Iran, everyone has the right to worship Allah.

Seek professional help.",How to Deal With Internalized Homophobia," Sometimes it may feel easier to ignore your feelings and push them away. All this really does is build them up until they become totally overwhelming. To deal with internalized homophobia, you need to be willing to tap into these feelings and address them head on.


Make a conscious choice to identify and eliminate your internalized homophobia. Although it may be difficult, remind yourself why you are doing this. For example, your goal might be to overcome the negative feelings regarding your sexual orientation and to feel happier as a result.
Keep in mind that internalized homophobia can also cause relationship problems due to the distress it causes. People with internalized homophobia may suffer from shame and anxiety. They may also have a poor outlook of other gay people, including their partners.;
, You can determine if you have internalized homophobia by asking yourself some simple questions. If your answer is yes to any of these questions, then you may have internalized homophobia.Some questions to ask yourself include:


Have you ever wished you were not attracted to those of the same sex?
Have you ever tried to make those feelings go away?
Have you ever felt that your sexual attraction to the same sex is a personal shortcoming?
Have you tried to make yourself attracted to those of the opposite sex?
Do you avoid interacting with lesbians, gay men, or bisexual people?
Do your feelings of attraction to the same sex make you feel alienated from yourself?

, Consider the ways in which homophobia has shaped your attitudes, behaviors, education, and life choices. Perhaps your internalized homophobia has stopped you from making friends with other LGBT folks or stopped you from attaining some of your life goals.


For example, perhaps you have avoided mingling with other gay people because of your own rejection of your feelings. Or, perhaps your belief that gay people can’t play sports prevented you from pursuing your passion for soccer in high school.
Internalized homophobia can even influence how you function in a romantic relationship. Those with internalized homophobia have been shown to have more conflict in their same-sex relationships. This can even lead to domestic violence between same-sex partners.In order to fight your internalized homophobia you can try one of the things you have always wanted to do but haven't done yet. If you always wanted to play soccer, join a league. Even better, you may be able to find a gay soccer team to play on!

, It's important to turn the effects of internalized homophobia around and goal setting is a good place to start. Try setting a goal to do an activity that you have avoided because you thought gay people couldn't do it. For example, if you like sports, you could set a goal to join a gay/lesbian/LGBT sports league.If there isn't a LGBT team in your favorite sport in your area, consider starting one.

, This can be easier said than done and may take some time. Try doing things that build your self-esteem. For instance, develop a sense of style or find a way to express yourself that you weren't able to do in the past. These things will help you to build your self image and your self esteem.


Do daily affirmations. These are things you say to yourself to remind yourself of all of your positive attributes.You can even try leaving yourself notes about how great you are. Having self-affirming messages all over your home can really help you to accept that you are wonderful.
Treat yourself to a massage, facial, or other treatment that makes your body feel good. If you feel good in your body you are more likely to feel good about yourself.

, Often if you have a bad case of internalized homophobia, your social surroundings are entrenched in anti-gay thought. Homophobia can be overt, as in someone saying something derogatory about gay people, or unstated, in which negative feelings about gay people are simply hinted at or are below the surface of a conversation. If someone you are around has exhibited either type of homophobia, you should avoid that person until they change their ways.


Were there any out LGBT people when you were in high school? Did your parents talk about how much they hated gays? Perhaps your church was anti-gay? Consider distancing yourself from these anti-gay influences or, alternatively, setting boundaries with the anti-gay people in your life.
Eliminating other people’s homophobia from your life can benefit your mental and physical health., Do you work or go to school with someone who makes negative remarks about gay people or who tells jokes about gay people? If this is the case, try to keep your distance from that person.


You may also want to report the person to a human resources representative, a teacher, or a school counselor because these kinds of remarks are unacceptable. Having an advocate can help to improve your school or work environment.Being exposed to negative attitudes about gay people can take its toll on your self-esteem and your self-perception, so it is important to get away from people who have homophobic attitudes.

, Finding a 3rd party advocate when someone makes a homophobic comment may not always be possible. For example, if you have a friend who sometimes makes homophobic comments, then you may need to say something to get your friend to stop.


When you do so, identify what comments were homophobic. For example, if a friend makes a homophobic comment, then you might say something like, “I feel uncomfortable about the way you just used the word ‘gay.’ Can you please find a different way to express yourself in the future?”
Make sure that you focus on the behavior rather than labeling the person. In other words, don't call the person homophobic. Instead, explain that the remarks the person made are examples of homophobic speech., If you are dealing with someone who is homophobic, then ask other LGBT people how they deal or have dealt with homophobia in their own lives. Also, just being around LGBT people on a regular basis can help to you to feel less alone when you are dealing with other people’s homophobia. Forming close relationships with other LGBT people may also help you to fight off any lingering feelings of disgust or self-hate.Try spending time volunteering for gay charities or going to a gay community center. Doing a good deed while simultaneously helping yourself overcome your internalized homophobia is a win-win situation.

Deny their denials.,
Address common misconceptions.,
Plan for biphobia conflated with homophobia.,
Counter possible biphobia from supporters of gay and lesbian rights.,
Understand bullying motivations.,
Don't stand for bullying, though.",How to Deal With Biphobia1," One of the most common forms of biphobia is the denial of the very existence of bisexuality. Sometimes this denial is caused by malice, but just as often it is the result of misinformation.


Reputable studies clearly indicate that bisexuality is a very real fact of life for many people. Actually, one recent study revealed that more Americans self-identify as bisexual (3.1%) than gay or lesbian (2.5%). This would indicate that there are roughly ten million self-identified bisexuals in the U.S.Often, a denial of bisexuality is based more on the assumption that it is a temporary situation within a transition between hetero- and homosexuality. The typical view in this sense is that “bisexual” simply means “on the way to gay.”However, although it may not fit neatly into the binary views of existence (gay / straight, male / female, etc.) that many people tend to embrace, bisexuality is a very real state of being in and of itself.;
, Those who do accept the existence of genuine bisexuality, and may even consider themselves supportive, can still harbor misconceptions and stereotypes that can add up to a less virulent but still harmful biphobia. Curiosity and questions should be welcomed, but “loaded” questions that indicate a prejudicial point of view need not be seen as acceptable.Some assumptions are clearly prejudicial, such as saying that a bisexual is just “confused” or “lying to himself,” needs to “make up her mind already,” is “trying to have it all” or avoid the difficulties of being identified as homosexual, is “just going through a phase,” or is just “trying to look cool.” Even if there is supportive intent, such statements denigrate the distinctive existence of bisexuality.
You have every right to respond to such questions or views by clarifying that bisexuals are not “undecided” or “confused” — they are living life on their terms. Don’t be hostile or judgmental yourself, especially when dealing with someone who wants to be supportive; educate them on what it means to be bisexual.

, Many people simply place people in the binary categories of “heterosexual” or “not heterosexual,” often with the first option as the only “right” one. In so doing, they conflate homosexuals, bisexuals, and anyone else who does not fit neatly into these two supposedly rigid categories.Some people will simply have trouble believing that a bisexual is anything other than a homosexual who is literally “trying to have it both ways” out of confusion or convenience. Be prepared to address the differences between homosexuality and bisexuality, while confirming their equal rights to respect and tolerance.
Even as a bisexual (or advocate for them), then, it pays to understand common prejudices more specifically targeted toward homosexuals as well. See How to Deal With Homophobia as a good reference.

, Not surprisingly, you will find some of the strongest champions for bisexual rights among the gay and lesbian communities. At the same time, however, some people who crusade against homophobia can actually espouse strong biphobia, for various reasons.Advocates for gay and lesbian equality sometimes express biphobia because they see bisexuals as only “half” of an oppressed minority, or because they are defensive about guarding the unity and priorities of their specific cause.Homosexuals can be misinformed about bisexuality just as easily as heterosexuals, but are perhaps more likely to respond to reasoned discussions of the challenges and prejudices bisexuals face on a daily basis.

, While a good deal of biphobia will be based on misinformation, confusion, or good intentions improperly expressed, it can be expressed in more virulent forms as well. Bullies target differences and perceived weaknesses, often seeking to avoid or ignore their fears or problems by attacking others.Identifying the likely causes of someone’s biphobic bullying can help you to counteract it. Understanding does not mean accepting or legitimizing the bullying, though. Consider factors like peer pressure, social / religious background, or factors unrelated to bisexuality that may be causing the person to lash out at a perceived “flaw” in someone else.

, If you’re lucky, a healthy conversation with the bully may be enough to convince him to stop the behavior — if not necessarily change his mind on bisexuality. But, if you are subject to ongoing bullying (for whatever reason), never hesitate to talk to people you trust, like friends, teachers, counselors, etc.If you are harmed or fear for your safety, by all means contact the authorities. No one has to tolerate bullying.

Address your discomfort.,
Face your fears.,
Take a hard look at yourself.,
Stop the “blame game.” Oppressed minority groups always make convenient scapegoats for the world’s problems.,
Put yourself in their shoes.",How to Deal With Biphobia2," Put it in the simplest of terms: Why do bisexuals bother you? Why do you care how they live their lives? Instead of relying on simplistic justifications like “it’s unnatural,” “it’s just wrong,” “it’s impossible,” or “it’s disgusting,” work to identify the deeper reasons why you harbor feelings of biphobia.


As mentioned elsewhere in this article, bisexuality often causes discomfort because it challenges binary notions of gender and sexuality, which are often connected to the binaries of “right” and “wrong” or “good” and “bad.” Many people tend to prefer simple, clearly-defined categorizations.This desire for ""either / or"" clarity can lead some people to question what makes someone bisexual — do they have to be attracted to men and women at a “50/50” split? Does “80/20” still count? — instead of accepting another person’s self-identification., Perhaps you are biphobic because you believe it goes against “traditional values,” or threatens the “social order.” If you set aside your fears, however, and examine the issue rationally, does it seem all that likely that the romantic predilections of 3% — or even 10% — the population is likely to really throw everything into ruin? And why does “different” have to equal “worse”?Even if you cannot, for religious or other reasons, bring yourself to approve of bisexuality, should this necessarily be an issue that makes you fear for our future? On the long list of problems in this world, should this really rank high enough to trigger active discrimination on your part? Perhaps you can reconsider your ""fear priorities.""

, People can be uncomfortable with or disapproving of bisexuality for a host of reasons. Active biphobia, whether revealed as bullying or discriminatory actions, though, often contains an internal component that has at least as much to do with the biphobic as his or her target(s).The idea that someone might be “protesting too much” — actively discriminating in order to deny or hide their own proclivities toward that way of life — can be true in some cases. More often, though, an aggressive person who has to deal with Biphobia may be dealing with an unrelated personal fear, trauma, or disappointment.
If you want to understand and deal with your biphobia, you may need to refocus your energies from the question “What is it about bisexuals that causes me problems?” to “What is going on in my life that is causing me to target bisexuals for discrimination?” Identifying and addressing your own issues may be the first step to a change in perspective towards bisexuality.

, Bisexuals have been blamed for everything from causing the spread of AIDS, to breaking up solid marriages, to interfering with the progress of gay and lesbian rights. The fact is that bisexuals are no more or less to blame for society’s problems than anyone else.Yes, there are promiscuous bisexuals, for instance, but how is that any different from any other group? Beyond the focus of their sexual attractions, how are bisexuals fundamentally different from anyone else? They deserve the same blame and the same praise as everyone.
Instead of trying to figure out who to blame for the problems you perceive in society, focus your energies on trying to make things better for everyone.

, It’s such a simple idea, and yet so true. Think about how you would feel if you were treated as “confused,” “lying,” or “perverted,” and consequently as somehow a lesser person, simply because of the nature of your attraction to other people.Even if you can’t bring yourself to approve of bisexuality, you should be able to treat bisexuals with the respect and dignity you would want from someone who disapproved of some aspect of your life.

It is illegal in most places to own a European hedgehog. However, it may also be illegal to own an African hedgehog in your state or country.An African hedgehog is sometimes called a “pygmy hedgehog.”;
,, Chances are it will bite when it is wild and young.

, It is likely unhealthy. Missing patches of quills are a sign of mites and should be treated immediately.

, They will also bite if they feel threatened.

, Set it on a flat surface with at least two square feet of roaming space.


Ensure that the floor is not made of wire or wood. Wire is hard to crawl over and wood can be unclean and infested with mites.
Find cages at pet stores that are meant for rabbits or guinea pigs. You can use an aquarium or plastic tub as long as it has places to enter and exit and some airflow.

, Smell is key to taming a hedgehog, since it is their strongest scent. You can even put an old unwashed t-shirt in or near his cage to help him get familiar with you.

, He should be left alone to feel safe and secure in this place before you take him out or let him roam.

, Talk to him quietly and stroke him lightly to put him at ease. You may need to try this several times before he sits still and stops curling up.


Repeat for one month so that he gets used to your voice.

, If he associates you with food, he is more likely to accept you as a friend and trainer.

, As he becomes tamer he will start to use it for napping, rather than hiding. Try adding short toilet paper rolls as play things.

, Try cat toys without catnip and teach your hedgehog to play with them and you. They like to crawl and tug them, so they are an excellent way to domesticate a hedgehog further.

, Allow him to smell and taste it. If the hedgehog spits on a new toy, that is a good sign, because they are anointing it with their smell., This will make your hedgehog’s home more desirable and give him plenty of exercise. If you don’t have paper towel tubes, igloos and tunnels, the animal may hide under furniture or dig into carpets and plants.

, This will keep him tame once you have domesticated him.

, Consistency is key.

, Don’t set the wheel in the area until he is litter trained. It can be a distraction, since hedgehogs regularly defecate and urinate on their wheels.

, Pick up the droppings and place them into a litter pan. Place the litter pan in that spot, where he is likely to return to do his business.

, It should be shallow in front and back with higher sides. Fill the litter pan with shavings, such as Aspen or Carefresh.Although some people use non-clumping cat litter, other people say this can be harmful to hedgehogs.

, The time it takes to litter train a hedgehog depends upon the hedgehog. It can take a few days or a few years.


Even if your hedgehog is well trained, they don’t always use the litter tray.

, Move it if your hedgehog starts using a different spot.

, It is natural for them to do this. They may need a bigger litter pan where they can use a portion for their litter and a portion to roll around."

, A hedgehog may bite because it is emotionally upset. There can be a number of stimuli that may startle your hedgehog into biting.


Loud or sudden noises
New or strong smells -- lotions, other animals, perfume, etc
Wrong time of day -- hedgehogs are mostly nocturnal. If you wake up your hedgehog in the middle of the day to handle it, it may bite
Fear -- it may be not fully tamed or not used to you
Sudden temperature change -- hedgehogs must be kept in a warm environment (75-80 degrees fahrenheit, or 23-26 degrees celsius), A hedgehog can ‘’learn’’ to bite if conditioned to do so. Be careful not to accidentally teach your hedgehog to bite!

When holding him, talk quietly and make slow movements.
Avoid fast, jerky movements that might startle him.
Give him treats if he is acting appropriately. Do not reward for bad behavior, but you can give a treat (like a mealworm) to get him to trust you.

, Hedgehogs are naturally curious creatures that use their strong sense of smell and taste to get to know their world. One way they do this is by nibbling and/or licking an unknown area. Knowing the difference between these two actions is critical in behavioral training.Nibbling is usually accompanied by not using pressure with teeth and licking the area.
Biting can be quick, sharp, and painful. It might be brought on by a stimulus.

, If your hedgehog is well fed and watered, it may be less likely to bite out of hunger or thirst.

, Keeping your hedgehog healthy will reduce stress on both you and the hedgehog. It will reduce the reason for bites.

In some places it is illegal, whereas in others you may be required to have a special permit. Check with your local state, city, and county ordinances to learn more about any laws or regulations on owning exotic pets in your town.


If you need help finding out about your state's specific regulations, or you need to find a safe home for a hedgehog that you're not legally allowed to have, contact an animal welfare organization or one specifically dedicated to hedgehogs.;
, Hedgehogs bought from responsible breeders are more likely to be well socialized, and because the breeder is familiar with the hedgehogs parents, chances are better that you'll get a healthy pet. That said, it is important to find a good breeder. If you don't, you could end up with a grumpy or sick hedgehog.


Be sure the breeder has quality, pedigree stock with no Wobbly Hedgehog Syndrome (WHS) or cancer in their lineage.
See that the breeder is USDA licensed. In the US, hedgehog breeders are required to have a USDA license. The purchasing process involves paperwork, in which they will provide you with their license number.
Be wary of breeders who post on Craigslist or other online classifieds.
Ask the breeder if they offer any health guarantees. Policies may vary, but you are likely to feel more comfortable with your selection if the breeder offers some option to return or exchange the hog if unexpected health problems arise early on. This also alerts them to possible health problems in certain lineages, so concern in this area is a sign of a responsible breeder., There are several signs you can look for in a healthy hedgie before making your selection.


Clear eyes: The hog should appear alert; the eyes should not be crusty, sunken, or swollen.
Clean fur and quills: While some anointing is normal (see below), fecal matter around the anus may indicate diarrhea or other underlying health issues.
Healthy skin: Crusty skin around the quills could indicate dry skin or mites - if it's the latter, you'll need to treat the hedgehog. Look for fleas, as well (small, pinhead-size brown points that jump quickly) - these also need treatment.
No scabs or injuries: If there is a scab or injury, the breeder should be able to explain what happened, and it should be clear that the animal is healing well. While some hedgehogs can survive infant injuries (such as blindness, loss of a limb, etc.) and go on to lead healthy and happy lives, you'll need to consider the care this animal requires and whether you're realistically able to provide that.
Alertness: A hedgehog should be alert and aware of its surroundings, not lethargic and non-responsive.
Droppings: Check the cage to make sure there are no green droppings or diarrhea. If there are, it might be a sign that the hedgehog has some health issues.
Moderate weight: A hedgie that's obese has fat ""bags"" around the armpit areas and cannot roll into a ball. One that's too thin has a concave belly and hollow sides. Both may be signs of health issues.
Healthy feet: The toenails should be clipped short enough that they do not curl under. If they're too long, ask the breeder to show you how to clip them., Before purchase, make sure you have everything you need set up and ready to go. Allow the hedgehog at least a month to become familiar with you, the new scents, and the new surroundings. It has just experienced a huge change in its life!


Hold the hedgehog every day as you let it get used to you. This may be as simple as placing it in your lap and talking to it. Encourage trust by giving it treats by hand, and add an old t-shirt you've worn for a day to its enclosure so it gets accustomed to your smell., One of the most unusual behaviors of hedgehogs involves excessive salivation in the presence of a new food, scent, or salt. The hedgie twists into an S shape, turning its head to the rear, and spreads the saliva onto its quills. While no one is quite sure why this happens, it's postulated that this may help make the quills better weapons by coating them with an irritating substance. For this reason, you may notice some slight irritation when you first handle your hedgehog.

, Hedgehogs need a large cage to be comfortable in: they like to explore their living space, and their natural territory is 650 to 1000 ft (198 to 305 m) in diameter. There are other factors to consider, as well, when choosing a cage for your new friend.


It needs to be large enough. The cage should be a minimum of 18 x 24 in (45.7 x 61 cm), but if you can afford a roomier space, so much the better. A 24 x 30 in (61 x 76 cm) cage is preferable, and 30 x 30 in (76 x 76 cm) is very generous.Sides of the cage should be about 16 in (40.6 cm) high. While some recommend smooth walls,others caution that ventilation of smooth-sided enclosures is more difficult.Do be aware that wired sides may create a problem if your hedgehog likes to climb! Hedgehogs are master escape artists. Ensure that the cage is secure with a closed top, or, if it doesn't have a top, that the hedgehog can't climb out.
The house should have a solid floor, as their tiny legs can slip through wire floors, causing injury.Houses should not have more than one level as hedgehogs have poor eyesight and their legs are all too easy to break. Wire cages that they can climb can also be dangerous if you have a climber! Include space for food bowls, toys and a litter tray when considering buying or making a cage.
Make sure the enclosure is well-ventilated. Air flow should be available all the time. The only time you should impede airflow is if the room rapidly drops in temperature (for example, during a power outage) and you need to wrap the cage with a blanket.

, Hedgehogs like wood shavings, but be sure to use aspen shavings rather than cedar: the latter has carcinogenic phenols (aromatic oils) that, when inhaled, can cause cancer. Alternatively, you can line the cage with a sturdy cloth (twill, corduroy, or fleece) cut to size.Carefresh is a commercial product resembling ground-up grey cardboard. While some recommend this, be aware that particle material can get lodged in male genitals or in between their quills. Also, be aware that Carefresh could harm your hedgehog because of a new formula of Carefresh Bedding. , You'll need to add a few things to the enclosure to provide for your hedgehog's needs.


A hiding spot: As a primarily nocturnal prey animal in the wild, hedgehogs need a safety zone for ""time-out"" from prying eyes, light, and general activity. An igloo or sleeping pouch will do well.
Exercise wheel. Hedgehogs need lots of exercise, and the wheel is perfect for nocturnal running sprees. Wheels should have a solid floor - mesh or bar wheels tend to make hogs get stuck, ripping off toenails and even breaking legs.
You must keep bedding out of the water at all times. Chemicals from the bedding can get into your hedgehog's water, which would sadly kill him.
Provide a litter tray with no more than a 1/2 in (1.25 cm) lip to provide easy access and prevent broken legs. Be sure that you use only non-clumping kitty litter, if you decide to use litter, or you can use a paper towel. The litter pan must large enough for the hedgehog and you should clean it every day. You can use a cookie sheet or commercial plastic litter box. Most owners keep the litter tray under the wheel, since that is where hedgehogs do most of their business.

, Hedgehogs need a slightly warmer room temperature than most people keep their homes at, around 72ºF (22.2ºC) to 80ºF (26.6ºC). Anything cooler and the hedgehog will likely attempt ""hibernation,"" which can be LETHAL (as it may lead to pneumonia), while at much hotter temperatures, heat stress occurs. Adjust the temperature if you see your hedgehog spread out in the cage as if it's hot. If it's lethargic, or the body temperature is cooler than normal, warm your hedgehog up immediately by putting it under your shirt and using your body heat to warm it.


If the hedgehog is still cool after an hour, take it to a vet immediately.

, Hedgehogs are primarily insectivores, but will also taste other things like fruits, veggies, eggs, and meat. They tend towards plumpness, so care must be taken with the diet to prevent a hedgehog from putting on too much weight. An overweight hedgehog cannot roll up and may have ""bags"" of fat hanging down, which will impede its walking ability.

, While a hedgehog's exact nutritional needs are somewhat mysterious, high-quality cat kibble is considered a good choice for a staple diet, which should be supplemented with other various foods, discussed below. The kibble you choose should be below 15% fat and around 32-35% protein; look for foods that are organic or holistic - avoid kibble that has by-products, corn and similar things listed. Provide about 1-2 tbsp of the dry cat food every day.


Avoid low-quality hedgehog foods as they tend to have a lot of poor quality ingredients. Higher-quality foods may be acceptable, such as L'Avian, Old Mill, and 8-in-1., Many owners free-feed their hogs, giving just enough food for there to be some leftover.

, Supplement the kibble diet with a small amount of other food - just 1 tsp every day or every other day. Some ideas:


Cooked, unseasoned, skinless chicken, turkey, or salmon, chopped up
Small bites of fruits and veggies, such as watermelon, cooked mashed peas or sweet potatoes, or applesauceScrambled or hard boiled & chopped egg
Mealworms, crickets and wax worms: These are also an important treat to the hedgehog's diet. As insectivores, they need mental stimulation that eating live prey provides, in addition to vital nutrition. Feed a few insects one to four times a week. Never feed your hedgie wild-caught insects (e.g., ones you catch in your yard), as they may have toxic pesticides in their systems, or parasites that will infect your hedgehog.

, While hedgehogs appreciate a wide variety of foods, there are some things you should never feed him: nuts/seeds, dried fruits, raw meat, hard uncooked vegetables, sticky/stringy/hard foods, avocado, grapes or raisins, milk or dairy products, alcohol, bread, celery, onion and onion powder, raw carrots, tomatoes, junk food (chips, candy, anything sugary, salty, etc.), anything very acidic, or honey.

, Reduce the amount of food you're giving your hedgehog if you notice she's getting a little plump, and increase exercise.

, Hedgehogs have a crepuscular nature, so they are active around twilight. If possible, feed them once a day around this time.

, The bowl should be wide enough for the hedgehog to access and heavy enough so that the hedgehog cannot tip it over (and start playing with it).

, Fresh water should be available at all times.


If using a bowl, make sure it is heavy and shallow enough not to tip over. Wash it thoroughly every day and fill with fresh water.
If using a bottle with a drinking tube, make certain your pet knows how to drink from it! It should have learned this from its mother, but it may need to be shown. Note that water in bottles also needs to be changed daily to prevent bacteria build-up., Don't house the hedgehog under your stereo player or television. As a prey animal in the wild that depends largely on its sense of hearing, your hedgehog will find too much noise and activity very distressing. Ensure that noise, lighting and activity levels are low in its vicinity and move the cage if the noise levels increase for any reason. Hedgehogs can get used to noise if introduced gradually.

, Hedgehogs are prone to putting on weight, so exercise is a must for them. This means plenty of toys, along with its hedgehog wheel. Toys should be something they can chew, push, nuzzle and even tip over, as long as they cannot chew pieces off or swallow. Be sure their nails or feet can't get caught in any loose strings or small holes.


Possible toys include: rubber balls, old kids' toys, rubber figures, baby teething rings, empty toilet paper tubes cut in half lengthwise, cat balls or bird toys with bells inside, etc.Let your hedgehog play in a larger playpen occasionally. You can purchase a large plastic tub or let it explore your bath (without water, of course).

, Hedgehogs are notoriously good at hiding ailments, so it is extremely necessary to be aware of your hedgehog. Keep track of any changes and call your vet to see if there's something that needs to be checked out.


If your hedgehog doesn't eat for one or two days, something is wrong and it needs veterinary attention. Hedgehogs that go for a few days without food are at risk of developing fatty liver disease, a life-threatening condition.Watch out for scaly, dry skin around the quills: this could be a sign of mites, which can be debilitating if left unchecked.
Wheezing or crackly respiration as well as discharge on the face or wrists are signs of respiratory infection, a common and serious condition in hedgehogs.
Soft stools for more than a day, or diarrhea combined with listlessness or lack of appetite can be signs of a parasite infection or other illness.
Hibernation, though occurring in the wild, is not safe for hedgehogs living in captivity. As mentioned above, if your hedgie feels cool on the belly, try to warm him by putting him under your shirt next to your skin. If he does not warm within an hour, bring him immediately to the veterinarian's., A hedgehog's familiarity with being held comes with being handled frequently. Always be confident when handling a hedgehog: they are not as fragile as they seem. The general rule is at least 30 minutes a day of handling.


Approach your hedgie quietly and slowly. Pick it up by lifting it from underneath, then hold it cupped in both hands.Make time for play. As well as handling your hedgehog, don't be afraid to join in with play. Your hedgehog will accept your involvement in play if you join in regularly.

, Clean the dishes and water bottle/bowl daily with hot water. Clean the wheel and spot-clean daily, changing bedding weekly or as needed.

, Some hedgies are cleaner than others, so you may need to bathe it more or less frequently.


Fill a sink with warm (not hot) water to the level of the hog's belly. Water should not get in their ears or nose.
Add a mild oatmeal bath (such as Aveeno) or puppy bath to the water, and use a toothbrush to brush out their quills and feet.
Rinse with warm water and snuggle in a clean, dry towel until your friend is dry. If she'll tolerate it, use a hair dryer on low - otherwise, stick with the towel. Never put a wet hedgie back in its cage., If they get too long and curl around, they can get ripped off while running on their wheel.


Clip your hog's nails with small manicure scissors, trimming off only the very tips.
If bleeding occurs, dab a little cornstarch on the spot with a Q-tip. Don't use commercially available powders, which are apt to sting., Quilling is the hedgehog equivalent of our losing baby teeth or a snake shedding its skin. This begins to happen at six to eight weeks of age and can happen throughout their first year of life as the baby quills make way for adult quills. This is a normal process and not something to worry about unless there are signs of illness or discomfort present, or the quills are failing to grow back. Your hedgehog may be irritable during this process and less amenable to being held; you can try an oatmeal bath to ease their discomfort. It is only a phase.

Put the cage in a room your dog can't enter.,
Place the cage somewhere that your dog can't reach.,
Make sure the cage is secure.,
Keep your dog out of the room when your rat is roaming.,
Consider the breed of your dog.",How to Keep Pet Rats Safe from Dogs1," One of the easiest ways you can keep your pet rat safe from your dog is to put its cage in a separate room. This room should be one that has a door you can keep closed to prevent your dog from entering. Consider putting your rat's cage in a room that you can easily keep your dog out of to help keep it safe and secure.Even if your rat escapes its cage, being behind the room's closed door will keep your dog and rat from meeting.
Don't forget to keep the door to the room shut, even if you aren't in the room itself.
You could also try using a dog-gate or baby-gate to keep your dog out of the room. However, you will need to make sure your rat can't climb over or around the gate when it's out walking around.;
, If you don't have a room that you can keep your dog out of, you can try placing your rat's cage on a surface that your dog cannot reach. You could try putting the rat's cage on a special high table or a sturdy shelf to keep it up and away from your dog. Look around your home for any elevated places you could use to keep your rat separated from your dog.Make sure the space you choose is safe and is capable of supporting the rat's cage.
It's good to check that your dog won't be able to jump up and reach the cage.

, Rats are clever creatures and may try to escape their cages. A rat that escapes while you are away may have a potentially dangerous encounter with your dog. Always check the rat's cage to make sure that it is sealed properly and there is no chance of your rat sneaking out.Check that all doors are securely latched and locked.
Make sure there are no loose areas of the rat's cage that could come undone.
Look for any spots that you think your rat might be able to squeeze through and seal them up.

, Whenever you want to let your rat out of the cage for some playtime or exercise, make sure your dog is securely held in another room. Keeping your dog out of the room while your rat plays will help keep your rat safe and allow them time to explore their space.Make sure the door to the other room is securely shut.
If you can't put your dog in another room, try putting them outside or having someone hold them on a leash.

, Some dogs will do better than others when it comes to introducing them to your pet rat. There are some dog breeds that have been bred to hunt small game and may view your rat as prey. Other dog breeds might get along just fine with your pet rat. Take a look at some of these dog breeds to learn which ones might get along well with your pet rat:Australian Shepherd
Basset Hound

Research types of nonlethal trap.,
Bait your trap.,
Locate the mouse.,
Set your trap and wait.",How to Trap a Mouse Without Harming It1," There are multiple types of inexpensive humane traps that will allow you to catch a mouse without harming it.Popular types of nonlethal traps include:


The Havahart Mouse Trap is a small steel cage with a trapdoor on either side. Mice are lured in by the smell of bait, and their weight triggers a mechanism which shuts the trap doors. These traps have plenty of room for the mouse inside, but can only trap one mouse at a time.
The Smart Mouse Trap is made from transparent plastic. It has a single door; mice are lured in the door by the bait and, like the Havahart trap, their weight triggers a trap-door mechanism. This trap is recommended by many animal rights organizations.
The Mice Cube trap is a long rectangular plastic box, with a one-way plastic door on one end. The bait is placed on the far side of the box and, once the mouse is inside, the door snaps shut behind it. This trap is the easiest of the three to use, but does not provide any ventilation to the trapped mouse.
Once you decide which nonlethal trap to buy, check your local hardware store for availability.;
, The bait is the material that you will place inside of the mouse trap, in order for its scent to attract the mouse to your trap.If you have an inadequate bait, mice will not be drawn into your trap. Common types of mouse bait include substances that either put off a pungent odor, or that mice like to eat. Bait your trap using:


Oatmeal or crackers.
Peanut butter or bacon.
Dry beef jerky.

, You need to find specific locations which the mouse frequently moves through; these will be the most effective places for you to set your trap.Listen along the walls for mice—they make a light scratching sound.
If you’re lucky, you might see a mouse emerge from its
Check along the floorboards; especially in dark, dry places.
Look for mouse droppings, as these will indicate where the mouse is most active.

, Mice are mostly active at night, so you may need to wait several hours (or even days) for the mouse to be caught.


While the trap is set, keep small children and pets away from the vicinity.

Know that rats and mice are different and think about what you want from a pet.,
Rats: rats grow much bigger than mice and so will need a much larger cage - to know how big try the rat cage calculator given under sources.,
Mice: Male mice are difficult to keep together in groups without fighting.,
Both rats and mice: should be kept in a wired cage.,
Buy a large enough cage for your mouse or rats.,
Stock up on a safe substrate.,
Consider getting rescue rodents.,
Give healthy treats for your mouse or rat.,
Make sure your pet has plenty of toys and nests.,
Be prepared to take your pet to the vet if it needs it.,
Rats need to be out of their cage (under observation) at least an hour per day.",How to Take Care of Pet Mice,";
, Female rats are much livelier than males, male rats tend to be better to just hold and sit on your shoulder. Being bigger, they are more intelligent than mice and tend to bond better with their owners. In general, they smell more than female mice. The male rats are also more allergenic than the female rats.

, A trio of female mice is best, so if one dies unexpectedly you are not left with a lonely mouse. You can also get a male mouse neutered so he can live with a harem - but you must wait 6 weeks after the operation to avoid pregnancy risks. Male mice smell more than rats. Female mice love climbing so it is important that they have a tall wired cage. For male mice, floorspace is more important. A single male mouse will bond with an owner as well as a rat, though he may be less likely to learn commands.

, They must not be kept in tanks, or modular systems due to the serious health and enrichment issues. Mice must be in a cage with bar spacing of 1 centimeter (0.4 in) or less to avoid escapees. Both rats and mice need essential enrichment such as a solid based wheel - large and medium sized respectively, and plenty of hammocks, ropes and chew toys. They both need multiple nests and hideouts and would benefit from a layer of hay to chew to aid their digestion. They should be handled frequently and have fresh fruit and veg on a regular basis.

, See the rat cage calculator under sources, for mice a good guide is simply to double the numbers given and remember bar spacing must be 1 centimeter (0.4 in) or under.

, Nothing pine or cedar based and no sawdust. Something like Megazorb, Finacard, Bedexcel or Carefresh is ideal. You can also shred old newspapers for bedding.

, Rescues often get them as pups due to unexpected litters from pet shops mis-sexing. You also don't run the risk that you do with pet shops that you might be supporting rodent farms. Rescue or ethical breeders give much better support and advice than pet shops. See under sources for a list of UK rescues that take rodents.

, Always check a food is safe first before offering it.

, Rats and mice are very intelligent and can suffer greatly from boredom. It's a good idea to rotate the toys used and give new layouts every clean out.

, If you cannot afford the veterinary care then you should not get any pet. Female mice and rats are sadly prone to cancerous tumours, which in rats can be removed with an easy but costly operation. Any change in behaviour or coat condition should be checked out. Is is rare that you need to isolate an ill mouse or rat - they gain a lot of comfort from their companions whilst ill.

, Some sites will tell you that the cage isn't the rats home, no, it's just a place where they are when you can't have them out of the cage.

Get the right aquarium size.,
Use a wire cage.,
Add substrate.,
Place the enclosure in the right location.,
Avoid dangerous houses.,
Clean the cage regularly.",How to Take Care of Mice1," An aquarium can be a good choice to keep mice. If you opt for an aquarium, make sure it's at least 10 gallons (about 38 liters) and has a mesh lid to prevent a mouse from escaping. If you have more than one to three mice, a bigger aquarium is necessary.Four to five mice need at least a 15 gallon (about 58 liters) aquarium. Five to six mice need a 20 gallon (about 78 liters) aquarium.
In general, however, bigger is better for any mouse. Get as big of an aquarium as you can fit in your home.;
, A wire cage is also an option for mice. While an aquarium is usually a better option, you can opt for a cage if you cannot find an aquarium. If you get a cage, make sure to select one that's safe for mice. The size of the cage should be at least 24 by 12 inches (about 61 by 30 centimeters). There should be no more than a quarter inch between wires, as this will prevent mice from escaping., Substrate is the material lining the bottom of the cage. For mice, opt for shredded paper that does not contain ink. Line this on the bottom of the cage. A few centimeters of substrate is adequate for a mouse., Mice are sensitive to heat and cold, so it's important to keep them in an area that's consistently room temperature. Do not put your mouse's enclosure next to heaters, furnaces, or other sources of heat. You should also avoid cold, drafty rooms., Certain types of houses are dangerous for mice. Never keep a mouse in a cardboard box or a wooden enclosure, as mice may chew through these materials. You should also be careful about mice habitats, with a lot of tubes and accessories, sold at pet stores. Mice can get trapped and injured in these kinds of enclosures., A mouse's enclosure needs daily cleaning. Each day, use a cat litter scoop to remove soiled bedding. Once a week, you should give the enclosure a thorough cleaning.Place your mice in a separate container. Remove all the bedding, any cardboard toys, and food and water bowls.
Use dish washer detergent and water to wash the insides of the enclosure, as well as food and water bowls and plastic toys. Allow everything to dry completely.
Replace all the bedding with new material. Place food and water bowls, as well as plastic toys, back in the cage. Discard old cardboard toys and replace them with new ones.

Consider how much space you have.,

Research what kind of habitat you need.,
Talk to other rodent keepers.,
Find out where you can buy the things they need.,
Make sure you can meet their dietary needs.,
Remember to make the habitat as natural as possible.,
Know the dangers for your chosen rodents.,
Research how many animals you need, and of what gender.,
Locate a good exotic vet.,
Build the habitat.,
Buy your animals from a reputable breeder.,
Let your new pets settle into their new home.,
Keep in contact with people that keep the same exotics.,
Keep your cage secure at all times.",How to Choose Which Exotic Rodent to Own," Animals such as kangaroo rats or chipmunks require a huge habitat. If space is limited, pygmy mice in a tank might be a good idea.;
, Harvest mice and African pygmy dormice for instance need plenty of climbing space and height, an arboreal vivarium is ideal. Multimammate mice can be happy in a wired cage, providing you give them plenty of enrichment. Remember that barred or plastic cages are easy for many rodents to escape from or chew through. Remember some rodents may need a higher temperature than others so you may need to invest in extra heating., There are plenty of exotic rodent forums that can help you find someone with direct experience of the pet you want to try keeping. You may find for instance that your chosen pet is very vocal, or smells a great deal because it scent marks. Finding out this before you own the pet will help you make sure it's a good match for your lifestyle. Exotic rodents can have a long lifespan, so you must be committed to them.

, Does your rodent need a particular type of mineral in its diet? What kind of substrate does it need? Megazorb with layers of hay is often a good starting point and many stables will have it as a horse bedding.

, African pygmy dormice for example need maple syrup as a good substitute for nectar as well as forms of protein and plenty of fruit. Its also about knowing what your animals CANNOT eat. Mediterranean lemmings for instance are sugar intolerant.

, Think of the habitats you see when you visit zoos, with plenty of nests to hide in, and wooden branches and hideaways. Remember that you can use some woods from your local wood(providing it has fallen and isn't still attached to the tree) but you MUST place in the oven for at least 20 minutes on 200 degrees before giving it to a rodent. This helps remove any dangerous bacteria or fungi, but does restrict the size of branches you can get.

, For instance, Pygmy mice can drown in normal water dishes, so you should get something smaller or place some pebbles in so they can climb out. If you choose dormice, you should know how to avoid torpor and what to do if it occurs.

, Stick with the same gender, you should never breed without having kept the animals as pets first as it can be very complicated. Some rodents are colony animals, like dormice, and should be kept in at least trios and ideally four or more. If kept in only pairs then they will be much shyer and more stressed. Some rodents should never be kept alone.

, These can be very costly, especially with animals that are new to the pet trade.

, Always go as large and enriching as you can afford and remember it is much better to concentrate on just one pet or pets, with a fantastic habitat such as this for a dwarf hamster

than have several types of pet that only have adequate housing., Once you are sure you've researched them and have the money saved for any potential vet bills its time to get your animals. Like any pet make sure that you go for animals that have clear eyes, a good well groomed coat, and are moving freely. Never go with a breeder that cannot guarantee the gender of your pets - if you ended up with a single female with two males for instance they could potentially fight to the death.

, It is important to let your pets get used to their new environment before you intrude, especially if you've had to travel to get them. Remember that some exotics you may never be able to handle.

, Rodent care isn't static, improvements are being made all the time and its important to keep informed and get ideas from other keepers.

, It can be very difficult to find and trap an escapee.

Don't be in a hurry to have your rat and dog become friends.,
Make sure your rat is comfortable being handled.,
Introduce your pets through their cages.,
Allow your pets to interact outside their cages.,
Keep a close eye on your pets.,
Put the rat back in its cage.",How to Keep Pet Rats Safe from Dogs2," You won't be doing either your dog or your rat any favors by forcing a friendship. You'll need to let the animals bond at their own pace. Pushing a friendship too quickly can result in a potentially dangerous situation for your rat. Always monitor your pets and work at their pace when getting them familiar with one another., Before you introduce your rat to your dog, it's a good idea to make sure your rat is comfortable with you holding it. If your rat is nervous about being handled, it may be difficult to control or more ready to start a fight when you introduce it to your dog. Your rat should be totally comfortable with you and with being handled before you attempt any introduction.If your rat is new to your home, allow it at least two days to relax and get used to the new environment.
Whenever you pick your rat up, place one hand under its front legs and the other under its rear legs.
Your rat will prefer to sit or walk on your arms, instead of being being held.
Introducing your rat into a large room can make them nervous. Try to let them roam in a smaller room that they can get familiar with.
Never pick up your rat by the tail.

, To help make the first introduction a safe one, try putting both your rat and your dog in their own cage or kennel. Once they are securely placed in their cages, you can bring the cages next to one another and allow your pets to meet each other. The cages will prevent any serious fights or injuries from occurring if one pet becomes nervous or aggressive. If you don't have a dog crate, try keeping the rat in its cage and your dog on a leash.
Your pets will be able to get used to each other's scents by being next to each other.
Keep introducing your dog and rat in this way to build familiarity before allowing them to meet without their cages.
Make sure your dog and rat are comfortable near one another before introducing them outside their cages. Neither pet should seem afraid or aggressive towards the other.

, If your dog and rat don't seem to mind one another through their cages, try introducing them outside the cage. Keep in mind that this step can be dangerous and you will need to keep a close eye on both your pets. Watch how your dog and rat interact as they meet each other outside their cages for the first time.Keep your dog on a leash while introducing it to your pet rat.
Be ready to hold your dog back if it attempts to bite your rat or becomes aggressive.
If you are worried about your dog biting your pet rat, try putting a muzzle on your dog.
It can be a good idea to introduce your rat and dog in a space that neither of them feel is their territory.
Never leave your pets alone. Even if you feel they are getting along just fine, you will still need to watch them., While your pets are getting used to one another, you will need to provide constant supervision. You'll want to keep a close eye on their behavior, watching for any signs of aggression or fear from either of them. If you do notice any unwanted behavior, separate them immediately and try again some other time.If your dog displays any growling, hair raising, barking, snarling or starts biting, remove your dog immediately.
If your rat fluffs up its fur, bites, scratches or chomps its teeth, remove your rat and place it back into its cage.

, Once your pets have had some time together, it's time to return your rat back to its cage. This will give both your pets some time to rest and calm down after their initial encounters. Let your pets rest up and try another introduction at a later time."

Allow your rat to come out and play.,
Let your rat and dog play together.,
Never leave your pets alone.",How to Keep Pet Rats Safe from Dogs3," If you feel that your dog and rat can safely be together, you can try letting your rat out to play. Allow your rat to wander around the room or play with whatever toys you've provided. Your rat will enjoy being with you and your dog as it plays and has fun.Many people enjoy building a small obstacle course for their pet rat. You can use old shoe boxes or cardboard tubes to build an engaging playground for your rat.
Having a box of loose cloth or fabric can give your rat a fun place to burrow in.
Rats can enjoy running on an exercise wheel.

, Once your dog and rat have become comfortable with one another, you can let them out to play together. Many rats who are comfortable with dogs will often enjoy climbing around their canine friend or playing tag. Dogs that are friends with rats may try to groom a rat or gently play chase with them. The more time your pets spend together, the more comfortable they will become with one another.Make sure your dog doesn't get too excited while playing with your rat. Even though they may be having fun, your dog is much larger than your rat and may accidentally hurt it.
Your dog and rat will play in whatever way they are comfortable doing. Don't try to force any interaction between them.
You will mainly be supervising your rat and dog as they play, giving them both lots of love and attention.

, Whenever your rat and dog are playing, you'll want to keep a close eye on them. Although your pets can be fine together, they may act differently if you leave them alone. You'll want to be ready to step in and separate them if an issue arises. Always be in the room that your pets are playing in to help keep them safe.Rats and dogs can become very good friends.
No matter how long your pets get along, you should still watch them while they play.

Collect the necessary supplies.,
Put two creases in the toilet-paper tube.,
Place a small spoonful of peanut butter on one end of the toilet-paper tube.Smear the peanut butter on the flat bottom of the tube (in between the two creases you’ve made).

,
Place the toilet-paper tube on the edge of a table or counter.,
Place the large 5-gallon bucket under the toilet-paper role.,
Wait for the mouse to fall into the trap.",How to Trap a Mouse Without Harming It2," Although there are multiple methods for constructing a nonlethal mouse trap, for this trap, you will need:


A toilet-paper tube,
A large 5-gallon bucket, and
Mouse bait. For this trap, peanut butter works well., This will let you set the tube down on a flat surface, without it rolling away.


To make each crease, fold the toilet-paper tube firmly from front to back.

,, This should be done near an area where the mouse has been seen, or where its droppings have been spotted.


If there is no table or counter near the mouse’s area, move a table to a convenient location.
The tube should be positioned so that the peanut-butter end is over the edge of the counter. It should be about halfway over the counter’s edge.

, The bucket should be next to the table or counter.


Although some plans for constructing this trap direct you to fill the bucket with a couple inches of water, you should avoid this step. Trapping the mouse in a water-filled bucket will drown the mouse.

, You may need to wait overnight for the mouse to come out and seek out the peanut butter.


The mouse will walk across the table and through the toilet-paper role to eat the peanut butter. The role will fall off the edge of the counter and into the bucket, effectively trapping the mouse.

Take the mouse several miles away from your own home.,
Release the mouse outdoors.,
Understand that the mouse’s life may still be at risk.",How to Trap a Mouse Without Harming It3," This way, there will be no risk of the mouse finding its way back.If you were to release the mouse in your yard or front lawn, it could easily sneak back in your house again.

, Once you have successfully trapped the mouse (or it has fallen into your bucket trap), you need to move it outside of your home.


As a courtesy to your neighbors, you should also avoid releasing the mouse near another house or residential center.

, Unfortunately, mice that were born indoors or have become used to living in a house are poorly suited to live in the outdoors.


Mice that are trapped and released outside may not live long in nature."
"
Block holes or cracks in the foundation of your apartment.,
Keep mice away with peppermint scent.,
Keep mice away with dryer sheets.,
Clean up after meals and keep food sealed.",How to Trap a Mouse Without Harming It4," Even after you have successfully trapped a mouse and removed it from your home, you will want to make sure that other mice cannot get in your home.


Have any cracks in concrete or your foundation repaired by a professional.
Use steel wool (or copper wool) to block small or hard-to-reach holes.You should use a caulk to secure the steel wool in place.

, Mice dislike the pungent odor of peppermint, and it will keep them from coming into areas that are heavily peppermint scented.Buy peppermint extract from your local grocery store; then soak cotton balls in the peppermint oil. Lay the cotton balls around—or outside—your home in areas where you are concerned that mice may enter.

, Mice dislike the smell of dryer sheets, and will avoid an area in which dryer sheets have been placed.Although dryer sheets are light-weight and can blow away if placed outside, they work well indoors. If you want to use dryer sheets outside, use a small stone or two to weight down the corners.


You can also use dryer sheets to block holes in walls or concrete that mice may be sneaking in through.
Since the scent will wear off eventually, switch out the dryer sheets for new ones every month.

, Mice have acute senses of smell and, like many other invasive pests, usually come inside your home looking for a meal. Mice love to eat grains (including cereal and oatmeal), and will often gnaw through packaging to get at these foods. Keep grain products sealed in airtight containers.

"
"
Provide commercial food.,
Add treats on occasion.,
Feed your mice at the right time.",How to Take Care of Mice2," Pellets and seeds are sold in pet stores specifically for mice. Mice do not require a lot of food. A tablespoon of pellets or seeds per mouse should be enough.Go for a ceramic bowl over a plastic one as these tend to be sturdier and more resistant to chewing.
Pick a smaller bowl. You do not want the bowl to take up a lot of space in your mouse's home.
Make sure to place the food bowl far away from the bathroom area.

, Healthy treats are okay once in awhile and can help with your mouse's health. Dog biscuits or treat branches are good for chewing. You can also give your mouse fresh fruits and vegetables from your own kitchen.Feed your mouse things like greens, blueberries, and apples once a day. Opt for small amounts and chop bigger fruits into pieces to help your mice easily swallow them.

, Mice are nocturnal, so it's best to provide food close to nighttime. You should also provide a continual supply of water at all hours of the day.Make sure to set some kind of alarm or alert. Mice need food every day, so you should not skip meals.

"
"
Handle your mice properly.,
Make sure your mice get enough exercise.,
Watch for signs of health problems.,
Avoid extreme heat and cold.,
Keep your mice away from other household pets.",How to Take Care of Mice3," Mice are generally afraid of people, so minimize how often you handle your mouse. When you do pick up your mouse, do so in a safe fashion. Grab a mouse by the end of the tail (not the tip) and gently lift it with one hand. Then, set the mouse in the palm of your other hand. Keep your hand on the base of the mouse's tail at all times to keep it from escaping. You can then pet and interact with your mouse. If your mouse is squirming and nervous, place it back in its cage.Never grab a mouse by the tip of its tail and do not squeeze a mouse with your fingers.

, Mice are active animals that need plenty of exercise to stay healthy. An exercise wheel is vital for any mouse's cage. However, always opt for a plastic one over a wire one. Mice can easily get trapped and injured or even killed in a wire wheel.You should also provide toys. Inexpensive toys, like cardboard rolls from paper towels and toilet paper, are safe for mice to play with. You can also pick up commercial toys from a local pet store.

, Mice should be active and alert. They should eat and drink regularly and breathe and walk steadily. If you notice any of the following changes in behavior, see a vet:Lack of appetite
Lethargy
Discharge from the eyes or nose
Diarrhea
Weight loss
Skin lesions
Overgrown teeth

, Extreme temperatures can cause health problems and even death in mice. Make sure you keep your mice in a area in your home that's room temperature. If anything causes a sudden change in temperature, such as a heat outage, move your mouse to a location where temperature is stable., Household pets like cats and dogs may view mice as prey. Pets like ferrets and snakes may also prey on mice. Keep mice in separate rooms from other pets and make sure their cages are secure at all times."

",How to Raise Hedgehogs1," While this guide will give you a detailed summary of what you need to know, this is by no means the only guide you should look at.;
, It is often better to get a hedgehog that is around six to eight weeks old, especially if you have children in the house. Younger hedgehogs will be able to get used to being handled better than some older ones. Make sure the breeder handles the baby hedgehogs from a young age.

, Look for healthy looking skin and quills, and a generally healthy look about it. If possible, get a veterinarian’s opinion before bringing the hedgehog home.

, Hedgehogs are fine living alone, and may get into fights if they are kept in the same place.

,, Do not use cedar shavings, as these can cause respiratory problems. Also do not use pine shavings as they can cause skin irritations. Care fresh and aspen shavings are good to use. Lay about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of bedding at the bottom of the cage.

, This takes time, but it can be done.

Pick up the mouse gently from its cage.,
Position the mouse to view its genital area.,
Look at the distances between the anus and the genitalia.,
Determine a mouse as female.,
Determine a mouse as male.",How to Tell if a Mouse Is Male or Female1," The best way to do this is to softly pinch the base of its tail to lift up the mouse enough to slide your hand underneath its body. Keep holding the tail while you lift the mouse out of the cage.


Remember you are much bigger than the mouse and an untrained mouse will be frightened of you. Never try to scoop it up from the cage or squeeze the mouse. It might jump out of your hand and hurt itself.
Alternatively, you can train your mouse to crawl into you hand. The easiest way to do this is to put your mouse's favourite treats in your hand to entice them to enter your hand. However, if this is your first time, it may take a while before your mouse trusts you enough to eat off of your hand.;
, Take the mouse by the scruff of its neck, and turn the mouse on its back. If it's not comfortable with that position, hold the animal in your hand with its rear end facing you. Then, holding onto the base of its tail, lift it so that the genitals are in clear view.


It's important to lift the mouse at the base of its tail and never to have all of its feet in the air. Have at least the mouse's two front legs touching a surface. If you hold the mouse by its tail and let it hang, you risk the chance of breaking its tail or even snapping its back. You don't want to harm the mouse or cause it any pain.Pinkies, or newborn mice, can get cold very fast. So only handle them for brief periods of time. They are also extremely fragile so avoid lifting them by the tail.

, The anus is the opening directly under the tail. Depending on the age of the mouse, it can be quite obvious or too difficult to sex. Young mice are very difficult to sex and the anogenital distances between sexes can almost look the same, so don't feel silly if you sex them incorrectly.


It would be helpful to compare multiple mice side-by-side until you are able to see a difference in distances.
In some cases, you may not have more than one mouse or all the anogenital distances look quite similar. Consult a book on mice or search the internet for pictures or diagrams demonstrating the sex differences between mice. Many sources provide visuals of mice's sex differences in every stage of growth.

, A female mouse has a genital area that is much closer to the anus. The urethra is usually within about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) on an adult mouse.


Females will have a vaginal orifice behind the urethra which may appear to look like a bump.

, A male mouse has a genital area much farther away from the anus than in females. You may also see its testicles if they are dropped. A good way to tell the difference between testicles and a female's urethra, is if there is a vaginal orifice or opening behind the bump.


You can also try to look for the presence of testicles. Adult male mice will have dropped testicles and can be quite obvious to spot. However, you may have to be patient, because a male mouse can withdraw his testicles into his body. One way to get a good look is to wait for the mouse to eat while 'standing' on the rim of its food bowl. Most of the time his testicles will descend during this position.However, the absence of testicles does not necessarily mean a mouse is female. Other methods may need to used to confirm the sex of the mouse.

Buy a cage.,
Put your empty cage somewhere warm where there's no drafts and away from large pets.,
Get bedding.,
Hiding spots are a must for a hedgehog.,
Exercise is also very important.,
You can buy a litter box; they will most likely use it.

,
Obtain a water and food bowl.",How to Make a Home for Your Hedgehog," This should be at least 36"" by 18 the best are probably rabbit cages. Aquariums are good also if secured by a wire top. Since very few cages are specially made for these prickly pets, ferret and chinchilla sometimes work too. Do not use Rubbermaid containers or multi leveled cages for your hedgehog. Also wire cages are not recommended because some hedgie escape artists can climb up the wires and get out also when there is wire on the bottom hedgehogs can break their limbs on it.;
, Since hedgehogs get cold easily, be prepared to provide extra heating if your house is colder than 70 degrees.This can be done by placing a space heater or heating lamp by the cage.

, Aspen or paper bedding like Carefresh are safe. Cedar has been linked to tumors and respiratory problems in hedgehogs and pine causes skin irritations.

, Make it simple. Even a small tube of PVC pipe works like a charm.

, Wheels are very important for a healthy hedgie life. Make sure to buy a wheel with a solid surface for the hedgehog to run on, and be about 11""(27.9cm) in circumference. Carolina Storm makes good hedgehog-specific wheels, but off-brand wheels work just as well. Go for the non-noise ones because hedgehogs are nocturnal and are very likely to use the wheel at night. Another means of exercise is the balls for other pocket pets. These are great if you are not willing to let you're hedgehog out to roam about your house.

,, Make sure it is heavy enough that your hedghog cannot flip it over. Ceramic is ideal. Do not use a water bottle hedgehogs can amputate their tongues or break their teeth on them there are also story's of them ramming into them and hurting their eye.

"
"
Provide good meals.,
Provide treats, too.,
Provide adequate water for your hedgehog as well.

",How to Raise Hedgehogs2," Pet food made especially for hedgehogs does exist; however, it is not very common in pet stores. Hedgehogs can also eat (and seem to prefer) high quality cat food. They need a diet high in protein and low in fat. When it comes to kibble, avoid:


by products, animal digest
""animal fat""
Blood Meal
beet pulp, pea hulls, brewer's rice, wheat gluten
corn (this includes any kind of cornmeal)
BHA, BHT, Ethoxyquin -- these all cause cancer
sweeteners (corn syrup, sucrose, propylene glycol...)
coloring additives
nuts and seeds

, Hedgehogs also enjoy crickets and meal worms as treats or sprinkled on top of their food.

When it comes to treats, avoid:

grapes/raisins
avocados
oranges/lemons/lime/citrus anything
nuts or seeds
chocolate
milk/dairy products (exception is cottage cheese and that should be only a little)
alcohol
bread
celery
onion and onion powder
raw carrots
tomatoes
human junk food (chips, candy, anything really sugary, etc.)
honey
raw meat (ANY meat you feed a hedgie should be cooked!)
Wild caught bugs
Make sure the crickets and meal worms have been fed nutritious foods, such as vegetables and fruits.

,"
"
Brush your hedgehog gently with a toothbrush and warm water to remove dirt from their coat.

,
Make sure you handle your hedgehog gently and frequently.,
If they curl up, do not place them in water to get them to uncurl, as some people do.,
Clip their nails frequently while you are firmly holding them.",How to Raise Hedgehogs3,", Start out slow so that your hedgehog gets used to your presence.

, This puts the hedgehog under unnecessary stress, which is inappropriate when the hedgehog is already scared. Instead, place the hedgehog in a safe, quiet place. Take things slower the next time so that the hedgehog gets more comfortable with you.

, You can also place a rough rock in the cage so that the nails wear down more naturally so that you do not have to cut them so frequently.

"
"
Make sure the pan is low enough so that the hedgehog can easily climb in, about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) high.

,
Fill it with non clumping cat litter.,
Place the litter box on the other side of the cage from where you keep the food, or wherever you notice the hedgehog tends to go to the bathroom.

,
Place droppings in the box.,
Place the hedgehog in the litter box when he starts to show signs of needing to use it.,
Keep in mind that not all hedgehogs take to the litter box right away.",How to Raise Hedgehogs4,", Take care of the pan the same way you would take care of a cat’s litter box.

,, This can help clue your hedgehog in.

, Some common times are after the hedgehog wakes up or after eating.

, Some never learn to use it, while some may suddenly start after months of not seeming to get it. Others are able to be completely litter box trained within a couple days.

"
"
Position the mouse to view its stomach.,
Look for nipples to determine a mouse as female.",How to Tell if a Mouse Is Male or Female2," Take the mouse by the scruff of its neck, and turn the mouse on its back in your hand. However, nipples may be obscured by fur on the mouse's stomach. Try to part the fur or feel the belly to see if you can spot the nipples. They may look like bald spots if the mouse is young.


It can be difficult to spot nipples on pinkies but with good lighting and an observant eye, you can spot nipples as early as three days after birth.

, Male mice do not have nipples. While female mice have 10 nipples and should look like little indentations. The most prominent nipples are the two by the genitalia.


Pregnancy is usually an easy visual determination of sex, as the doe's nipples will swell and drop, forming ""saddlebags"" around the hip area. However, not all mice will be as obvious, and for some, obese males may look just like pregnant females. Try gently palpating the ""saddlebags"". You might be able to feel distinct nodes, which are likely the pups.

"
Have a veterinarian diagnose your rat.,
Check for lumps on your rat.,
Note other symptoms or changes in behavior.,
Growth rate of the lump.,
Take your rat to a vet if you notice any of these symptoms.

,
Consult with your veterinarian about surgical options.,
Consider your rat's health.,
Consider your rat's age.,
Consider your finances.,
Consider your schedule.,
Offer lots of soft bedding for your rat to snuggle in.

,
Switch to fabric bedding.,
If movement is difficult for your rat, consider switching to a single-level cage.,
Make food and water more accessible.,
Health care.,
Try to keep the best interests of your rat in mind.,
Consider how far the cancer has progressed.,
Consider your rat's quality of life.,
Consider your rat's age.",How to Take Care of a Rat with Cancer," Scrapings or samples may be required for correct diagnosis.  If you have any questions or concerns about your rat's health, seek professional advice.;
, Where is the lump located?  A lump may be a tumor, a cyst or an abscess. These can be easily confused by the average person. The location and size of the lump may give you some clues.



Is it on the foot? If it is on the foot, consider the possibility of bumblefoot.  Do you use wire floors?  Has your rat suffered a leg or foot injury recently?

Is it small and located on the back?  This is the most common place for cysts to erupt.

Is it located in or around the ear or mouth? This is likely to be an abscess.

Is it in the throat? If the lump is located in the throat, it could be an inflamed gland or lymph node.

Is it in the belly or groin area? Benign and malignant mammary tumors often occur in these areas.

,



Head tilt, falling over, bugging eye(s), confusion, running into things, seizures and stiffness in the legs. These may be symptoms of a pituitary tumor. Pituitary tumors occur inside the animal's brain and are not usually detectable from the outside.  

Heat or pain.

If the lump is warmer than the rest of the rat, you may have an acute infection.
Pain is associated more with abscesses than tumors.



Discharge. Is there discharge?

Discharge is often associated with abscesses. Abscesses are pockets of infection and can occur anywhere on the body. Look for an initial injury - a scratch, bite or scab - that could have introduced an infection.
Blood and pus are very normal for an abscess.   If there is blood and/or pus coming from a wound on the lump, it is very likely infected.



, Was the growth of the lump sudden or prolonged?


A sudden onset (within 2-4 days) is suggestive of an abscess, especially if there is a wound already present on the lump.
A more prolonged onset (2 weeks to a month) is suggestive of a tumor, either benign or malignant.

,, Surgery is an option that is available depending on the size and location of the tumor.


For many mammary tumors, surgery can remove the tumor.
Benign tumors have a lower chance of growing back than malignant tumors.

, Surgery is stressful to an animal; is your rat strong enough to handle the stress?  Will it be able to recover quickly?


Is the tumor interfering with movement, eating or other bodily functions?
Is your rat otherwise healthy and active?
Is your rat lethargic and uninterested in toys or attention?
Is your rat refusing food and water?

, How old your rat is can affect its chances of surviving surgery.


Rats live between 2-3 years. Is your rat still young or is it older?
Older rats may have a harder time and take longer to recuperate from surgery.
Is your rat fairly young?  Would your rat have time for a comfortable life after recovering from surgery?

, Surgery is expensive.  You pay for the anesthesia, antibiotics, board, etc.


Do you have money saved if there are complications with the surgery?
Do you have money for antibiotics after the surgery?

,


Will you be able to take your rat to and from the vet's during their office hours?
Are you able to go to follow-up appointments?
Will you be able to pick up your rat's medications?
Will you be available to give your rat its medication?
Are you able to check on your rat several times a day in the week after the surgery?

,, Fabric bedding is softer than many commercially available beddings. Fabric bedding also makes it easier to monitor bowel movements. In addition, it is:


Reusable and easy to clean.  Just shake off the bedding, wash, dry, done.
No dust.
Toxin-free.
Inexpensive.

,


This is especially recommended for rats with pituitary tumors or large tumors.

,


If your rat is recovering from surgery, consider mixing its lab blocks with water, almond milk, or coconut milk to make it easier to eat and digest.
Provide your rat with a shallow food dish, one the rat doesn't have to reach too far into to eat.
A water bottle can be less messy and easier to place in a good position than a water dish.  Be sure to use glass so the rats don't chew through it.

,


Some tumors become infected.  This is treated with antibiotics and sometimes lancing.  Others may open on their own.  Clean the wound with rubbing alcohol once a day until it finishes draining and closes.
Set an alarm to remind you to give your rat its medication.
Ask your vet if the medication can be flavored to make it easier to take.
Monitor any surgery sites for redness, inflammation, pus or blood.  Call your vet if you observe any of these symptoms.

, This is the hardest decision a pet owner has to make, and although your feelings are important, it is more important to consider the quality of life your pet has.  If it is suffering and you cannot do anything to relieve the suffering, then it is time to consider euthanasia.

,


Is surgery an option?  Have you already tried it?
If surgery is not an option the tumor will continue to grow until the rat can no longer move comfortably and is drained of energy.
If it is a pituitary tumor, it cannot be surgically removed and the symptoms will get progressively worse.

,


Is it able to move comfortably?
Does it suffer from seizures?
Is it able to eat and drink?
Does it need pain medication or are they on a lot of medications?
Can it still play with toys or their friends?
Can it still play with you?

,


Is your rat younger or older?
How long do you expect your rat would live without the cancer?
If your rat is younger, it will be able to adjust to living with cancer, surgery or even amputation better than an older rat.
With older rats, it is best to leave the tumor alone and give them the most comfortable life possible.  Cancer is known to come back and older rats do not adjust to surgery or amputation well.

Take care of your mouse at home.",How to Treat Mice With Penile Prolapse," A penile prolapse is easy to recognize. Your mouse’s penis will be outside of the prepuce and dragging along the cage floor.It will also be swollen,red,and possibly dry and bleeding. You may also see a swollen band of the prepuce behind the head of the penis.The skin of the penis will be damaged from the constant dragging.In severe cases, the penis will turn a dark red due to a prolonged lack of blood flow.A penile prolapse can be extremely painful for your mouse, so he may flinch and become very sensitive to you touching the affected area.Be very gentle with your examination.;
, A penile prolapse can make it difficult for your mouse to urinate.This is because the urethra, which carries urine out of the body, can become blocked with a penile prolapse.Check the cage bedding periodically to see if your mouse is urinating. You can also put a towel in his cage to see the urine more easily.


An inability to urinate can lead to serious medical problems. If your mouse is not urinating, take him to your veterinarian as soon as possible., If your mouse has a mild case of penile prolapse (mild inflammation, little to no pain), you can treat him at home with noninvasive treatments. More severe cases, however, will require invasive veterinary care. In severe cases of penile prolapse, the penis has become infected (yellow discharge) and significantly enlarged with fluid. Some of the penile tissue may have also died due to no blood flow.A complete lack of urination also indicates a severe case of penile prolapse.
Penile prolapse becomes severe if left untreated. Early recognition can prevent the prolapse from becoming severe and requiring intensive veterinary treatment.

, To treat your mouse’s penile prolapse at home, you will need some supplies to clean, disinfect, and treat the affected area. For cleaning, you will need a handful of sterile 2 x 2 gauze or cotton balls, as well as some warm water and mild soap.Instead of soap and water, you can use saline as a cleaning agent.


Purchase chlorhexidine to disinfect your mouse's penis and prepuce. If it is not available at your local pharmacy, ask your veterinarian for recommendations on other disinfectant solutions.
Have a few clean towels on hand to keep the treatment area clean and dry.
To reduce the swelling, make a small icepack (ice in a plastic bag) or put a small amount of granulated white sugar in a bowl.You will also need some oil (e.g., olive, vegetable, canola) to lubricate the penis and keep it from drying out.If the prolapsed area looks infected, you will need some human triple antibiotic ointment, which is available at your local pharmacy., To get your mouse out of his cage, gently grasp the base of his tail and let him walk into your cupped hand in the bottom of his cage.You can let go of his tail when he is comfortably settled into your hand.When you grasp his tail, make sure he is not holding onto anything—his tight grip could cause you to injure him by pulling the skin off his tail.You definitely do not want to make him feel any more pain of discomfort!


Place him gently on a clean towel.

, It will be easier to access your mouse’s penis by placing him on his back. To put him on his back, hold the base of his tail in your dominant hand and place your thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand just behind your mouse’s front legs. Gently squeeze together the skin behind his ears to scruff him and turn him on his back.If you are right-handed, you will scruff him with your left hand.
When you have him his back, tuck his tail between your fingers to keep it out of the way.

, Dampen some gauze or cotton balls with your cleaning solution of choice and gently clean your mouse’s penis. Be careful to remove any debris that may have gotten stuck on the penis. When you have finished cleaning, pat the area dry with another piece of gauze or a clean towel.Be extra careful around areas of damaged skin (cuts, bite wounds).
Patting the area dry with a cotton ball may not be a good idea, since the fibers of a dry cotton ball could get stuck on the skin.
Apply some chlorhexidine (or other recommended disinfectant solution) with another piece of gauze or some cotton balls, and pat dry again.
You may need to treat the penis for several days with a disinfectant and antibiotic ointment to adequately treat the inflammation. Your veterinarian can provide you with guidance on how long to treat.

, If the penis is swollen, you will need to reduce the swelling so the penis can slide back more easily into the prepuce. One way to reduce the swelling is to sprinkle some granulated sugar on the penis and surrounding area. The sugar pulls in the fluid from the prepuce and penis, thus reducing the swelling in both structures.The effect of the sugar may not be immediate, so be patient as the swelling goes down.
You can also apply a small, wrapped ice pack to your mouse’s penis to reduce the swelling. Apply the ice pack in short intervals to prevent your mouse from getting too cold., Putting oil on your mouse’s penis could get a little messy, so apply the oil with some gauze or cotton balls. The lubrication will make it easier for you to manually reinsert the penis back into the prepuce.You do not have to use a lot of oil.

, With the penis sufficiently lubricated, pull it out a little bit further (if possible) and lubricate the shaft of the penis. With your thumb and index finger, gently push the penis back down into the prepuce.Contact your veterinarian if you are not successful with reinserting the penis.


Depending on how much pain your mouse is in, he may not let you do this.

, If you were able to reinsert the penis, observe your mouse to see how well he is recovering. Watch to see if the penis prolapses again, and take note of any bleeding or discharge you see from the penis or prepuce. Continue to monitor your mouse’s urination, and look for blood in the urine.Take your mouse to the veterinarian if your mouse is showing any signs of illness or discomfort following your treatment.

, If your mouse has a severe case of penile prolapse, or your treatment attempt was not successful, he will need further treatment by your veterinarian. One treatment method your veterinarian may want to use is the puncture technique, during which he or she would use a hypodermic needle to create tiny puncture holes in the prepuce to release the fluid causing the swelling.Your veterinarian may also inject a substance called hyaluronidase to further reduce the swelling.The puncture technique requires anesthesia., If your mouse’s case of penile prolapse is particularly extreme, or the penile prolapse keeps occuring, your veterinarian may recommend surgery to enlarge the opening of the prepuce. With your mouse under anesthesia, your veterinarian would apply a local anesthetic to the surgical area before enlarging the opening.Surgery is not without risk and may be expensive. Talk with your veterinarian to decide if surgery is a practical treatment option for your mouse.

, After your mouse has gone through intensive veterinary care, you will need to take good care of him at home. For example, you will need to keep the surgical area clean—your veterinarian can provide you with instructions on how to do this. In addition, put clean white towels in his cage where he can lie without the risk of getting bedding near the incision site.The white towels can also let you know if your mouse is urinating.
Take your mouse to back to your veterinarian if the penis has prolapsed again, or you notice that the surgical area is bleeding or looking infected.

Take your mouse to your vet.,
Give your mouse oral ivermectin.,
Treat your mouse with fenbendazole.,
Monitor your mouse for side effects.,
Clean the cage regularly.,
Take everything out of the cage.,
Clean and sanitize the inside of the cage.,
Clean and sanitize the cage accessories.",How to Treat Pinworms in Mice," A pinworm infection requires veterinary treatment, even if your mouse doesn’t look very sick. Your vet will prescribe an anthelmintic, which is a medication that kills intestinal worms. Ivermectin and fenbendazole are the main anthelmintics used to treat pinworms in mice.Before prescribing the medication, your vet will confirm that your mouse has pinworms.
To identify pinworms, your vet can examine a liquid solution of your mouse’s feces (‘fecal float’) with a microscope. They can also stick a piece of clear tape to your mouse’s rear end and examine the tape with a microscope.Two species of pinworms affect mice.They are treated in the same way.;
, If your vet prescribes ivermectin, you will give your mouse 2 treatments by mouth, 10 days apart: give your mouse the first treatment, then give the second one 10 days later.You could also add ivermectin to your mouse’s drinking water, but this would require changing the water every day, which may be time consuming.Oral ivermectin will be a liquid solution that you will administer with a syringe (without the needle).
To give your mouse oral ivermectin, pick up your mouse by the base of its tail and place it in the palm of your hand, with its back against your palm. Gently scruff your mouse by the neck, place the syringe of ivermectin in the mouth, and slowly dispense the medication.Ivermectin can be applied directly to your mouse’s anal region with a spray bottle.This may be a little tricky to perform, though, so your vet will probably prescribe the oral formulation.

, Medicated diets containing fenbendazole can also treat pinworms.If your vet recommends the therapeutic diet, you would feed it in a ‘one week on, one week off’ schedule for as long as your vet prescribes.During the off weeks, you would feed your mouse its regular diet.


Purchase the diet through your vet.

, Ivermectin can cause serious neurologic problems. It can cross the ‘blood brain barrier,’ which is in place to prevent certain drugs from entering the brain. If ivermectin enters the brain, it can cause such side effects as coma, depression, and sudden death.If your mouse seems really sad (no energy, not eating much, not playful) or looks unconscious, tell your vet right away.


Ivermectin side effects are more common in newborn mice.Fenbendazole usually does not cause serious side effects in mice., Pinworm medication will kill the adult worms inside your mouse, but not the eggs. The eggs can actually go airborne, so they could be anywhere in your mouse’s cage, even though you won’t be able to see them. Therefore, cleaning your mouse’s cage is a very important aspect of pinworm treatment in mice.Clean the cage at least once a week.Male mice leave their scents in their cages. Frequent cleaning would remove that scent and cause the mice to ‘mark’ the cage even more, making the cage quite smelly. If you have a male mouse, prevent excessive marking by rotating when you replace the bedding and litter., First, move your mouse to a separate cage by gently picking it up by the base of its tail and sliding your other hand under its body.Slowly lower your mouse into the other cage. Next, remove the bedding and litter and take out all cage accessories (toys, food bowl, water bottle).

, Cleaning the cage will remove the dirt and sanitizing will kill the pinworm eggs. Use hot and soapy water, along with a sponge or scrub brush, to clean the cage. Rinse out all of the soap before sanitizing. To sanitize, spray a bleach solution (1/2 tablespoon bleach/1 gallon water) throughout the cage. Let the bleach solution dry on its own—do not rinse it off.Unfortunately, pinworm eggs are resistant to many types of disinfectants.However, bleach is recommended for killing pinworm eggs.

, Use 3 buckets to clean and sanitize the cage accessories. Fill the first bucket with hot, soapy water and clean the accessories. Fill the second bucket with hot water to rinse off the accessories. Fill the third bucket with a cold bleach solution (1/2 tablespoon bleach/1 gallon water) and let the accessories soak for about 30 seconds. Let the items air dry before putting them back in the cage.A toothbrush may help clean the edges or hard-to-reach spots of the accessories."

Identify additional symptoms of a respiratory infection.,
Look for behaviors associated with illness.,
Eliminate possible allergens.,
Get a veterinary assessment.,
Give your mouse antibiotics.,
Keep your mouse's cage clean.",How to Stop Your Pet Mouse from Sneezing," If your mouse's sneezing is a symptom of a respiratory infection then it may have other symptoms as well. These can include a runny nose and congested breathing.To check for a runny nose, look for moisture under your mouse's nose.
To check for congested breathing you will need to get your mouse close to your ear and listen to its breathing. Congestion in the lungs can make the mouse's breathing loud and rattly.;
, When a mouse is fighting off some sort of illness it can become lethargic and it may have less interest in eating.If you notice one or both of these symptoms, and your mouse is sneezing a lot, then your mouse is likely ill.


Keep track of how much your mouse eats on a regular basis so that you will be able to more easily notice if it begins to eat less.

, Try eliminating possible allergens from your mouse's cage to see is that is causing your mouse's sneezing. In most cases of an allergy, the mouse is allergic to its bedding. This means that when you are eliminating possible allergens you should clean the mouse's cage out and replace its bedding.Use a bedding that is paper based and dust free. In a pinch you can simply use shredded up paper on the floor of your mouse's cage.
Bedding that is made of wood shavings is likely the cause of your mouse's allergies. In particular, cedar shavings are known to increase the likelihood of respiratory illness.If your mouse was allergic to its bedding then the sneezing should clear up in a week or two after the bedding is replaced.

, If your mouse is repeatedly sneezing and you suspect that it has a respiratory illness, then you should have it checked out by a veterinarian. Keep track of your mouse's symptoms and how long they have been occurring so that you can tell your veterinarian this information.It can be difficult to find a veterinarian that is experienced with treating rodents. Call around to veterinary offices in your area to see if any have experience with mice. Even if they do not, you can ask them for suggestions about veterinary practices that do.

, If your veterinarian thinks that your mouse has a respiratory infection they are likely to prescribe antibiotics. These are usually given orally, either just in liquid form or added into the mouse's food.Antibiotics cannot eliminate all respiratory infections. However, even with those they do not eliminate, they can assist the mouse's immune system to keep the infection under control.

, Keeping your mouse's cage clean can help your mouse fight off any illness that it has. Eliminating bacteria and viruses in your mouse's environment will help it's immune system to focus on eliminating the infection in its respiratory system.Doing a weekly cleaning is important for your mouse's health, whether it has a respiratory illness or not.When cleaning out your mouse's cage, replace all the bedding and clean all surfaces thoroughly.

Become a pack rat.,
Design your hangout.,
Once you know what you want your clubhouse to look like, cut some doors and secret passageways, even some windows.,
Using care to keep the holes lined up, glue the boxes together.,
Add ramps, ladders, and bridges.,
Add graffiti to the outside of the clubhouse!",How to Create a Rat House1," Gather as many boxes as you can get a hold of, from cereal boxes to packages. All of these are needed for making a good clubhouse.;
, Fool around with a few ideas by stacking the boxes in different places, decide what you like best.


Make sure you plan according to your rat's mobility. For instance, if you have an older rat, you might want to stick with a single story clubhouse or a two story house with wide bridges and wide ramps.







, Please be careful when cutting holes, as slipping can hurt quite badly. Make sure that there is a way to get into every box.

,


Allow the boxes to dry before continuing.






Be sure not to nudge the boxes out of place while drying.

,


Ramps can be made out of thick, clean sticks or pieces of wood. (Make sure there are no splinters!)






Ladders can be made out of thick rope, or parrot ladders available at nearly any pet store.






Bridges can be made out of thick rope, pieces of wood, or anything else that is strong and sturdy.






Just be sure to stabilize these to avoid injury to your rats. You can take a half filled water bottle to test out bridges. Press lightly on ramps and ladders, just about how much you think your rat would pull.







, Personalize it in every way you can think of! Non toxic markers are the best way.


This step is optional.

Find a house or nest for them to sleep in.,
Choose some bedding.,
Choose a food bowl and a water bottle.,
Choose some toys.,
Choose some rat treats.,
Make sure your rat cage is not in the draft of a vent or fan.",How to Decorate a Pet Rat Cage," Rats like having a little home to sleep in when they're tired--you'll find that if you don't have a house in their cage, your rats will sleep in a corner or near the sides of the cage, usually not flopped out in the middle. In the wild, rats have burrows. It's the same with domesticated rats. Instinctively, they like to have a cozy little place to sleep in.

Anything will do for a house--a small shoebox cut in half will do. Ferret hammocks also work well, or you can look in the rodent section of your local pet store. Hamsters also like houses to sleep in, so you'll find some colorful igloos and huts in that section of the store. Just make sure it's big enough! Rats, especially more than one, will need more space than a little hamster.;
, Not the regular sort of wood shavings, paper shreds, or whatever else you use to simply cover the floor--rats like to have special soft material for their nests. ""Fluff"" (such as Care Fresh) or recycled paper bedding will work well. Small towels and fleece work well, too--just prepare for them to be shredded! Kleenex works just fine for rats, as well. It's soft and easily shredded. Be careful that the bedding is unscented or it may cause infections (URIs).

, You might want to get a food bowl that can be screwed into the side so they don't knock it over and make a mess. Additionally, rats love fresh fruit and veggies, so grab a second bowl specifically for ""wet"" foods. That way, you can keep dry food from molding and easily take out and wash the dish after a couple of hours. Make sure the water bottle holds at least 8 oz.

, Rats are fun-loving creatures and get bored easily. They love to play! A rattle, a bell, even cat toys are good sometimes. You can buy edible toys like a stuffed log chew. You'll also need wood chews to keep your rats teeth down as the grow non-stop. Have fun with this step, as these toys are what will make your cage look colorful and will entertain your rats.


Rats love to climb, so give them hammocks and ropes! You can buy a hammock from the store or sew some scraps of fabric together to make your own.
Small rats enjoy wheels like hamsters, but once they get a little bigger you're going to need to invest in some rather large wheels--otherwise, you might hurt your rat's back. The Wodent Wheel is a good choice, as it's very big in diameter and your rat won't have to squish into a tiny wheel to run.
One man's junk is another rat's playhouse! Used things from around your house--toilet paper rolls, glass jars, tree branches balanced against the corner of the cage (just make sure there's no pesticides on them!) are all super fun for rats to climb through, gnaw on, and play with. As long as there's no small parts the rat could choke on or get hurt with, most anything is fair game.

, High sugar is a bad idea. You can buy something like dried apple slices, or if you're on a budget just cut your rats some veggies or fruits. Veggies and fruits are needed to supplement their diet too. Be sure to give your rats veggies or fruits on a daily basis. Hiding treats inside of things is always a fun game for your rats--inside of a hammock, a cat toy, or hidden in the bedding, rats love an adventure, especially when food is involved.

, Rats don't like fluctuating temperatures, and it can stress their little bodies out to the point where they become very sick and unhealthy. Additionally, make sure their cage is in a room where there's not much noise. You wouldn't like to live next to a construction site, and neither would your rat.

Maintain the cage’s cleanliness.",How to Socialize Pet Rats," Rats can be stressed by new environments.Minimizing her stress the first few days you have her can make it easier to socialize her.The following can help your rat get used to her environment:


Preparing her nesting box before she arrives
Using the type of food and bedding she’s used to before slowly introducing new products
Allowing her to settle by not handling her.;
, In order to socialize your rat most effectively, start training her as soon as she appears comfortable. Babies to older rats respond well to socialization with the proper guidance from early on in your relationship.


Avoid being discouraged if your rat is older. You can socialize her as soon as she joins your family and is comfortable in her new environment. Just be aware that it might take a little more time, effort, and patience on your part.Remember that rats are intelligent and social. Proper handling and behavior from you can help ease the process., Once of the best ways to start to get your rat used to you is to give her treats.This can help foster her trust that you are her friend and will care for her.Give her treats like a piece of cooked pasta or a bit of pizza crust.Open her cage and gently place your hand inside with the treat in your palm.
Allow your rat to sniff your hand and take the treat. If there are multiple people in your household, make sure everyone gives your rat occasional treats so she learns to trust them.
Continue giving your rat treats until she takes the treat without sniffing you. This is a good sign she’s ready for handling.
Avoid feeding her treats through the cage bars, which may teach her to snap at your fingers., If your rat appears comfortable with you from giving her treats, try picking her up.Be aware that rats are very active and may not want to be held or only want held when they’re sleepy.Allow your rat to come out of her cage on her own accord. Don’t invade her space by putting your hand in the cage.Place one hand under the bottom of your rat and the other under over her back to provide her adequate support.Use a small towel to pick her up if she nibbles or bites because rats are less likely to bite a towel.Avoid using gloves., Rats may not initially enjoy being handled. Keep your initial handling sessions short to give her time to get used to them.Keep sessions to about a minute to start.Gradually build up the time you handle her.

, Rats can scare easily, especially in the early phases of socialization.Give your rat reassurance through talking and other behaviors while you’re holding her.Talk to your rat in a soft voice throughout the handling session. Consider positive reinforcement that you repeat consistently. For example, “what a beautiful girl you are Sophie, aren’t you nice.”Pet her gently while holding and talking to her.Keep the area as quiet as possible. Avoid loud noises such as yelling and keep other pets like cats or dogs in another room.Allow your rat to burrow to help her feel secure during the sessions.Give her another treat before you put her back in the cage. This helps her trust you and associates handling with treats., Rats may not initially enjoy being handled. Keep your initial handling sessions short to give her time to get used to them.Keep sessions to about a minute to start., When your rat is hand-tamed and comfortable with you and her surroundings, it’s time to let her play outside the cage. This can keep her stimulated and physically fit.Remember that rats need a lot of stimulation because they’re social. If your rat doesn’t have a companion, she’ll need about 4 hours of human interaction a day.Set up a secure play area outside of your rat’s cage. You can place some toys in the area and should make sure you’re present to enjoy her and keep her from chewing on anything.Be aware that out-of-cage play time is vital to the health of your rat.Go back to handling if your rat seems scared by the playtime outside of her cage. Continue to handle her for a bit and then try reintroducing her to playtime.Give her a treat when playtime is done., Part of socializing your rat is making sure she has a comfortable and clean home.Put together a cozy cage for your rat to promote her health and socialization.


Get a solid-bottom, powder-coated wire cage in the largest size you can afford.A ferret cage or aquarium with screen top will also work.Put the cage away from strong heat sources like radiators or the sun or in any breezy or unheated areas.Place it in an area that isn’t brightly lit, which can damage her eyesight.Line the cage with bedding from aspen or pelleted recycled paper.Be aware that pine and cedar chips contain oils that can harm your rat.Put a small box or flower pot in the cage for your rat to sleep or rest.Add toys such as PVC piping, swings, ropes, and a chew toy., Rats have a lot of energy and a high metabolism, so feeding them properly is important to their health. However, rats are also prone to obesity, so it’s equally important to make sure you’re giving them the right amount and types of food.Give your rat a small bowl of lab blocks every day.Give her about one tablespoon of fruit and vegetable treats every day. For example, you can give her some greens and a broccoli floret, or a slice of apple or whole strawberry.Give her a hard treat like a dog biscuit or branch from a fruit tree once a week to keep her teeth healthy.Feed your rate at night because rats are nocturnal.Place an attachable water bottle in the cage so she can drink continuously., Rats are very social and it’s recommended to keep them in pairs at a minimum.Consider giving your rat a companion to keep her happy, stimulated, and healthy.Get a pair of females if you’ve never had rats before.This can minimize the risk of rats breeding.Make sure the rats are neutered or spayed if you want a male and female rat.Be aware that two male rats may fight if introduced later in life.Introduce your rats in a neutral territory that is not their respective cages.Rats associate by smell. Consider adding a little vanilla essence, which is non-toxic, to eat animal’s back so that they get used to each other.Place a new nest box and place to hide for each rat., It’s important to your rat’s well being to keep her cage clean. Clean the cage every day and do a complete cleaning once a week.Take out any soiled material, dropping, and uneaten food every day.Clean and refill the water bottle every day.Replace dirty bedding and scrub down the cage with soapy water once a week."

Get your mice.,
When taming, find out where your mice are if possible, and don't be there.",How to Use an Aquarium As a Mouse Cage," For three female mice or one male mouse you should have at least a 20 gallon (75.7 L) long tank. Bigger is always better. Petco has a $ a gallon sale which sells tanks cheaply.;
, It should be chew proof. Also get a way to clip it on securely. Pet stores such as Petco or Petsmart will sell you everything you need.

, When your mice are babies, a 5 inch (12.7 cm) wheel may do, but as they grow a 6.5+ wheel will be needed. Flying saucers are recommended because they don't bend the mouse's tail. Don't use a barred wheel- for some mice, mesh may be okay, but solid is always best. For multiple mice, more than one wheel is a good idea.

, Have it be tall and climbable- this will be one of their options for climbing onto the mesh lid upside down, which mice love to do. Even if they don't, it will be excellent exercise.

, Get toys that hang from the top- your mice will love scaling them. You can even buy mouse climbing walls. The important thing is to provide plenty of opportunity to climb.

, All of these are pretty easy to find- you can walk into Walmart and come out five minutes later with a suction cup/ aquarium holder water bottle.

, At least once a week do a full cleaning.

, No pine or cedar.

, If they come in a cardboard box (if you have a long ride home, bring a safe carrier) you can put that in the cage for them to climb. Watch out, though- it will get disgusting and need to be removed fairly quickly. Remember to let them settle in, otherwise you'll terrify them.

, Always put your hand down away from them and then approach from the side. It's best to let them come to you.

If you start to notice an ammonia smell, you've likely waited too long. Set up a cleaning schedule so that ammonia never injures your rat.Natural rat litters made from materials like hay/straw and aspen wood shavings will need changing more often.;
, Before cleaning your rat’s cage, you should remove him. Your rat could easily get loose during cleaning if you don't secure him. You also don’t want to expose your rat to cleaning products.


Place your rat in a temporary bin with a lid and air holes.
Make sure you place either litter or bedding into the temporary bin to absorb waste.
Clean and disinfect this bin after you move the rat back into his cage.

, Take apart your rat’s cage so you can clean it more easily. Remove all the toys, bedding, and rat litter, disposing of the litter and bedding in a trash bag. Be sure to detach the top or bottom if your cage is made to be taken apart.

, There may be soiled litter or bedding stuck in the cage. For example, litter can clump together and solidify to the sides or bottom. After the cage is empty, spray down the interior with plain water. This will soften the residue so you can wipe it out later. , Take a washcloth, rag, or sponge and get it wet and soapy. Regular dish soap is fine. Wipe out the interior of the cage, pausing to scrub any residue that doesn't come up right away.Submerge all toys and accessories in soapy water. Scrub them with dish soap or degreaser if needed.
Rinse and allow them to air dry.
If any accessories are dishwasher safe, you can place them in the dishwasher instead of hand washing.

, You may find that there is still residue in the cage even after wiping it down. If this is the case, grab a scrub brush and place a pressure nozzle on a garden hose. Scrubbing the stuck-on residue and spraying it with high-pressure water will help it come off.A degreaser, also called a solvent cleaner, will break down grease and other tough residue. They are especially useful on metal cages., If you have towels, hammocks, etc., in your rat cage, be sure to thoroughly wash and dry them. If they get soiled between cage cleaning days, wash them immediately to prevent dirtying the rest of the cage., After you're done washing and scrubbing out the cage, make sure you thoroughly rinse both the cage and accessories. You don’t want your rat ingesting any soap or degreaser. You should wipe out the cage with a clean cloth after rinsing it to clear away any soap residue. , You don’t have to disinfect your rat cage every single time you wash it because soapy water will remove most bacteria; however, using disinfectant is good practice and will do no harm. Disinfect it just before introducing new rats to your cage or if your rat is sick.Rat diseases to look for include skin disorders (like fleas and mites), roundworms, parasites, and so on., You can use pure bleach or another disinfectant (such as Lysol) to disinfect your rat cage. Mix the disinfectant with water to dilute it — 15 parts water to every one part of bleach. Then apply the disinfectant to all surfaces and cage accessories.You may want to mix up the disinfectant solution in a spray bottle so you can easily spray down all surfaces.
Otherwise you can saturate a cloth with the disinfectant solution and wipe everything down.

, For best results, allow the disinfectant to remain on all surfaces for about 15 minutes. This allows the bleaching agent to kill all germs. After this, rinse everything again.Make sure to disinfect any water bottles and feeders. They are the most likely culprits for spreading diseases. After rinsing, set out all the items so they can be air dried.

, Once the cage is clean, disinfected, rinsed, and dried, you can replace everything. Of course you should add unused litter and bedding so that everything is fresh. Spread the bedding so that it is about a quarter inch thick.

, A smelly cage is one that isn't cleaned often enough. Key to good hygiene is keeping the cage clean so that odors do not develop., Some cages are better for rats than others. For example, avoid cages made of uncoated metal. You should also stay away from cages with a mesh floor or a pullout pan. Both styles cause odors to build up.Exposed metal retains odors so that it is hard to wash smells out.
Pullout pan cages allow waste to drop down below the cage and sit there. Rats walking directly on the litter (as in other types of cages) reduces smell, so this pullout style will need to be cleaned two or three times as often.

, You can actually reduce the odor of rat urine by adding agents to their water and food supply. Adding two drops of apple cider vinegar to 8 ounces of water should be enough.You may also be able to purchase products at the pet store that do the same thing.

, If you want to reduce how often you clean the cage, focus on areas where they urinate the most. For example, rats are known to urinate where they sleep. Replace bedding where they sleep between cage cleaning days. If they have a spot they like to urinate in, change the litter here more frequently.Try training your rat to urinate in the same place every time. Place a small box of litter in one corner. Leave the rest of the cage bare without any litter.Try placing small litter boxes in every corner of a rat’s cage since they naturally urinate in corners.
Pick up feces and place them in the litter boxes to help rats see where they are supposed to defecate.

, Any wood, cloth, paper, or cardboard accessories can soak up a lot of urine. Change out these things three or four times per week to keep ammonia buildup under control.


One idea is to use a plastic igloo-style house for sleeping instead of a hammock.

Once you have finished this sheet of wax paper, quickly but gently move it into the freezer and allow them to freeze.,
Once you see that the drops have hardened, pull them out and place the paper on the counter.,
Keep the bag in the refrigerator until you plan on using the drops.",How to Make Yogurt Drops for Pet Rats,"


Grab a sheet of wax paper of nearly any size. Set it down on your counter flat and weigh down the corners with something heavy. This will keep it from flying around while you squirt the drops.;
,


Roll the top of the icing tube about two inches so that you can easily see the bottom. Pick your cap and prepare your icing tube however it requires. The cap can be a simple circle or you can use fun shapes. If you have the patience, you can even make many different shapes by switching out the caps after each or every other row.

,

Puff out any air bubbles back into the yogurt bin until it seems smooth enough to work with.



,


Squirt a small drop onto your wax paper an inch from either edge. Every half inch plop another drop on the paper.

When you are ready to start another row, space them half an inch from the other rows. This way, if they start to run when you move them to the freezer they won't get mixed together.



, This could take overnight or throughout the day if you start in the morning.

, Use a dull knife to scrape them loose from the paper. Carefully roll the paper up and pour the drops into a plastic bag and seal tight.

, Feed them sparingly to your rats and they will love you forever!

,
Add toys and games to the pool.,
When you're done, dry off your rats before returning them to their cage.",How to Make a Swimming Pool for Your Rat," It should be big enough to hold all your rats, with room for them to move around comfortably. It should be about as tall as your rat so that water won't spill out, but short enough that your rat can escape if it needs to.;
, Make sure not to add too much water, but don't worry about your rat drowning. They are excellent swimmers. Add water up to about your rat's stomach. This will be enough water for it to play around in without being dangerous.

, Your bathroom or kitchen usually work best, as it will be okay if water spills. Close the door to the room so that if the rat escapes from the pool, it will be easy to catch again - you don't want your rat running freely around the house. Put a towel down on the floor, and place the pool on top of the towel.

,, Add frozen corn or peas along the bottom of the pool and watch your rats fish for their food. Disguise the corn or peas in piles of small pebbles so that your rats have to dig through the pebbles to reach the treats. You can also add tunnels, hoops, ladders, or anything else you think your rats might enjoy.

, Make sure the area around the pool is clean and dry and your rats are safe and happy.

"
"
Choose your food containers carefully.,
Provide a variety of food.Rats have particular palettes and should be able to make some choices about what food they want to eat.,
Introduce new foods slowly.If a rat eats too much of a food that disagrees with their constitution, they might have stomachaches or diarrhea.,
Ensure your rat is getting an adequate amount of food.,
Permit natural behaviors.",How to Feed a Pet Rat1," Metal bowls can produce sound frequencies which may disrupt the rats.Use ceramic bowls instead. Ceramic bowls are also heavier, and therefore harder for the rats to tip over when feeding. Finally, choose a small bowl; the larger the bowl, the less cage space the rat has., Maintaining a healthy but diverse diet will keep rats curious about and interested in their food.


Hard-boiled eggs or food encased in a cardboard wrapper that needs to be opened somehow will stimulate rats and provide them with a learning opportunity.

, When they have a small quantity, though, they will learn whether or not they should leave it next time they encounter it.


If you have several pet rats, make sure that when introducing a new food, you give all of them a taste. If only one rat gets a treat and the others don’t, they will smell the new food on the lucky rat later and become aggressive., Always make sure food and water are available to all rats. This requires providing enough food for each rat as well as ensuring water bottles are within reach of the baby rats, who are more vulnerable than adults to hunger and dehydration.


Rats can be aggressive. If you have several rats to a cage, be sure to provide a sufficient amount of food for each. Alpha rats (the leaders of the pack) or aggressive rats may hoard food for themselves. Always provide at least two food and water sources when housing multiple rats together.
Rats should eat between 10% and 20% of their body weight each day., Whether it’s handling food, consuming cecal pellets, or digging for food, rats should be given space to follow their biological instincts.


Rats eat their own feces – called caecal pellets – in order to gain important nutritional content. Preventing or disrupting this behavior could result in nutritional deficiencies in your pet rat.Let your rats handle small nuts and seeds. Do not feed them these foods frequently, however, because they are high in fat.
Rats like to forage and search for food. If you place a small snack in a sealed cardboard tube or in an unusual place, rats will seek it out.

"
"
Give your rat enough protein.,
Go organic.,
Provide fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Show some love.,
Choose a good lab block.,
Provide fresh water.",How to Feed a Pet Rat2," Lab blocks are often available in varieties with varying levels of protein meant to be matched to an individual rat’s unique nutritional needs. Rats are omnivores and can eat meat as well, but it should not be a normal part of the rat’s diet. Pregnant rats, babies, and young rats need more protein than normal adults. Watch for signs your rat may be protein-deficient, such as:Chronic infections
Stress fractures in bones
Hair loss

, Pesticides have a variety of harmful impacts on rats, including thyroid disruption, reduced antibody count, and complications of the endocrine system.In order to ensure your rat stays healthy, buy as much organic produce as possible.If you buy conventional produce:


Scrub surface of your fruit/veg vigorously with a soapy solution
Rinse with water
Peel or scrape the outer skin off and discard

, In addition to rat pellets, rats should eat a variety of fibrous fruits and veggies. But not just any vegetables and fruits will do.Acceptable fruits include apples, pears, bananas, melons, berries, and citrus fruits.
Acceptable vegetables include broccoli, cabbage, celery, carrots, parsley, and fresh corn.
Unacceptable fruits include mangoes and green bananas.
Unacceptable vegetables include raw sweet potato, dried corn, avocado, raw beans, and raw artichokes.
Approximately one tablespoon of fruits and veggies per day is enough for a healthy adult rat., Like humans, rats enjoy the occasional treat. Semi-sweet chocolate, orange juice, cookies, and potato chips will be happily consumed by rats.However, don’t make foods high in sugar, fat, and salt a regular part of the rat’s diet. Doing so could lead to obesity and other health problems.

, Lab blocks provide the best nutrition for rats. These are specially-formulated food compounds designed for rats in captivity to receive all the nutrition they need. There are a multitude of lab blocks available. Some of the more reputable brands include:


Oxbow lab blocks come in two types: young and “regal” (adult).
Harlan Teklad offers varieties of lab blocks differentiated by the protein content: 14%,16%, 18%, and 23% varieties depending on the rat’s needs.
Mazuri and Purina, both owned by the same parent company Land O Lakes, also produce high-quality lab blocks.Lab blocks are available for sale online or in pet stores.
Don’t buy mixes containing lab blocks and seeds, nuts, corn, and fruit. Rats will select the latter and leave the blocks untouched, leading to nutritional shortfalls.Issue a small bowl of lab blocks once a day to your healthy adult rat., Having fresh water at all times ensures the rat is not at risk for dehydration. You can either provide a bowl of water or a bottle. In either case, fill and change the water each day.


If you provide a bowl of water, the rats can also use it to bathe themselves. Be sure to wash the bowl daily.
If you provide a bottle of water, make sure the mouthpiece is accessible by even the smallest rats in the cage. Check the mouthpiece regularly to ensure it is free of blockage, and give the bottle a few taps to make sure water flows freely. Be sure to empty and clean it weekly, as algae can grow inside.

Look for mice that get along and go for at least a trio of them - but make sure you've chosen a big enough cage.,
Set up the cage!",How to Set up a Mouse Cage," Also make sure that the cage you are about to buy is a good size depending on how many mice you are buying - a good guide is to double the numbers given in the fancy rat cage calculator under sources. If you can't fit a big enough cage in your room, then you shouldn't get your mice. Remember that mice, especially females, love climbing so height is important. Wired cages should be used with bar spacing of 1 centimeter (0.4 in) or less to prevent escapees.


Modular systems are generally not suitable for rodents. As well as being vastly too small they have a whole host of associated health and enrichment problems.
Tanks are a good option for mice. Make sure that the tank is at least 10 gallons, getting bigger the more mice you get. Ensure that the lid provides enough ventilation, and is escape-proof.;
, It is a bad idea to keep one mouse all alone, as this leads to stress and a lot of loneliness.

, This is a favorite to all rodents, and this will be their bed (probably) so add a lot of soft bedding in that area. You must have more than one.

, Get safe substrate, not cedar, pine, or cat litter. A good bedding is CareFresh, as it's soft and comfy for your mouse and is safe. Aspen is a safer alternative to pine or cedar, as pine and cedar have natural oils that can harm your pet. You will find it at most pet stores. Megazorb is a much cheaper alternative to CareFresh. Bedexcel and Finacard are also good. Never use sawdust or anything pine or cedar based for any rodent as it can cause serious respiratory problems.

, You also need some safe bedding for your mice to build nests with. Do not use fluffy cotton wool type as limbs can get caught and broken in these. A good fun bedding is to buy cotton pods as your mice can then chew through and release their own bedding. Another alternative is shredded toilet paper or newspaper, and hay.

, Hay is good for mice to chew - it aids digestion.

, It cannot be the smallest size as that cause spinal problems and it should not have spokes as mouse tails could get trapped and their feet will deform.

, Would you want to be locked in a room all day with food, water, and a treadmill? Didn't think so. Never forget some small wood chews for your mice to chew on! If they don't have something to chew, their teeth will grow, and you will have to go to the vet to get his/her teeth clipped. Some good mouse toys are: Paper towel tubes are great and entertaining. Hammocks, rope toys and nest are great. Don't get treated wood. A good natural toy is a cotton pod, this allows them to chew and release their own bedding to spread around.

, Make sure the pet food is made for mice! If you want to give your mice some extra enrichment, don't put their food in a bowl. Instead, hide it in the substrate in their cage. Most importantly, make sure they can easily get to their water. A small water bottle that you can attach to the side of the cage is a good option, as they won't be able to throw their substrate in it. Bottles, however, can get blocked, so check it regularly. All of this stuff is probably in the rodent section of the pet store.

, Rescues often get them as pups due to unexpected litters from pet shops misinterpreting the gender of the mouse/animal. You also don't run the risk that you do with pet shops that you might be supporting rodent farms. Rescue or ethical breeders give much better support and advice than pet shops.

, A good guide is to double the numbers given in the rat cage calculator under sources. Some rescues can offer you a neutered male mouse to go with a group of females, but make sure you've waited the 6 weeks after the operation so you don't run pregnancy risks.

, Put stuff where you think it would look good. Remember, around every few weeks you will be cleaning it, so you can always arrange before that. Put in the bedding first, quickly get a friend to get the water in the water bottle, and you put the food in the bowl. The food and water should be around each other. Then put in all the toys. When you're done, put the mouse/mice in the cage, and you're done!

Prepare your supplies for the rat cage.,
Fill your cage with nice warm bedding.,
Put a rat hammock in the cage.,
Attach water bottles to the cage.,
Fill food bowl and place it in the cage.,
Bring plenty of toys for your rat.,
Place your rats in their new home.",How to Set up a Pet Rat Cage1," Before you put the rat into the cage, make sure to have all the supplies you plan to put into it. That way your pet rat will not be disturbed from its cage. Consider including the following supplies:


Dry bedding
Hammocks
Small water bottle
Food bowl
Toys;
, Rats can generally handle cold temperatures well, but it’s important to give them good bedding. Use materials such as paper or cloth for the best bedding, but make sure to avoid aromatic cedar or pine, since it can be dangerous to your pet rat.Shredded paper is a good bedding material for your rat, though it will need to be changed often. You can also use cloth bedding, such as old clothes, as long as the material does not unravel easily.
Stay away from aromatic cedar or pine. This bedding can damage your rat’s liver and respiratory system.

, You can either purchase or make a rat hammock. Pet rats love cuddling in these hammocks, which can also keep them warm during the colder months.If you want to make a rat hammock, you can use fleece or t-shirt fabric cut into squares or rectangles. Hang the hammock with safety pins, so the hammock is secured.
You can also buy rat hammocks at many pet stores. Rats will occasionally chew in their hammocks, so it’s important to have the hammocks be made of materials that cannot be easily chewed through. Otherwise, it’s possible your rat could fall from the hammock onto the floor of the cage.

, Rats will knock over any water bowls, so it’s important to attach a bottle to the side of the cage. Your water bottle should be changed on a regular basis, since rats need plenty of water.Secure your water bottle to the side of the cage so it won’t fall. Rats will chew on the water feeder, so place a protective covering such as a can or small plastic bowl on top of the bottle if the rats can get to the bottle.
It may even be useful to have multiple water bottles, especially if you may not be around your rat on a consistent basis. This way they will always have plenty of water.

, Rats will knock over any light food bowls, so make sure the food bowl is heavy and low to avoid spillage. You can also consider a mounted food bowl.


Food bowls can be easily spilled, so make sure it is secured in the cage. You can use a food hopper that dispenses food if spillage is a problem for your pet rat.
Have separate bowls for wet and dry food for your rat. Additionally, remove any perishable food so it does not begin to go bad while in the cage.

, Supply your pet rat with a variety of toys, including toys that hang off the top of the cage, toys on the floor, and mental stimulation toys. Rats need something to do while in the cage, so mental stimulation toys are the most important.


Put in a wheel runner for your pet rat. Female rats tend to run more than male rats, but both gender should use it.
Give plenty of climbing toys. Rats love to climb, so make sure they are able to climb up ropes and ladders while in their cage.
Rats need plenty of mental stimulation, so toys like mazes, toilet rolls, and paper balls can be great for them. They like solving puzzles, so any toys that make them do that can be beneficial for your pet rat., Let them roam around and get used to things. Don't hold them for their first 2-3 days while they are getting used to their cage and surroundings.


It takes rats awhile to get comfortable. However, they should settle into their new rat cage pretty quickly.
Your rat may need additional supplies once they get in the cage. Observe your rat to see if you need anything else.

"
"
Provide good ventilation for your rat.,
Protect your rat's feet.,
Make sure the cage can be cleaned easily.,
Have a cage that you can easily access.,
Keep the bar spacing safe for your pet rat.",How to Set up a Pet Rat Cage2," Your rat's cage should give your rats plenty of ventilation. Don't use aquariums or fully enclosed cages, but instead use wire cages with plenty of open air.Aquariums and plastic enclosures keep in dust and ammonia in the cage. These can make your rat sick because they are not getting enough fresh air.
Wire cages, made of either plastic or metal, are better for giving your rat plenty of fresh air. A solid body bottom, rather than wire bottom, can be better for your rat's feet.

, A solid body bottom to your cage can protect your rat's feet. If you have a wire floor to your cage, consider getting a solid body covering for the bottom of your cage.


If you have a wire cage bottom, your pet rat can contract bumblefoot. This condition can cause swelling and infection in your pet rat's feet.
You can buy plastic laminate, which is used on kitchen floors, in wire cages to protect your pet rat's feet. This material can be purchased at most hardware stores.

, Plastic cages can usually be cleaned easily when necessary without any damage. If you get a metal cage, it's best to be Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coated to avoid rust and general cage damage.


If you have a plastic cage, make sure the plastic can be cleaned without cracking. Plastic cages that crack will not last as long as those that stay in good shape.
Metal cages need PVC coating to avoid rust. However, PVC coating will still wear, but not as quickly or thoroughly as metal cages without finish.

, You should be able to reach into the cage and move around the cage supplies. Additionally, you want to be able to get your pet rat out safely without squeezing them.


Shelves and doors should be easy for you to reach. Your rat should not be closed in by the size and shape of the cage.
The door of the cage should easily pop open so you rat can come out or you can take them out. If you have to move your hand around too much to reach your rat, the cage may be too small and cause you to squeeze your rat when taking them out.

, In a wire cage, it's important for the bar spacing to be far enough apart to not cause your pet rat to get stuck. Additionally, you want the bar spacing to be small enough that your rat cannot escape.


For baby rats, bar spacing of about 1/2 inch is ideal. For adult rats, up to 1 inch spacing between bars is better.
Consider the size of your rat when choosing the bar spacing. You may need to get a bigger cage with different bar spacing as your rat grows up.

"
"
Get the best cage for your baby rat.,
Purchase a large cage for your adult rats.,
Think about special circumstances for your rat cage.",How to Set up a Pet Rat Cage3," If you get your pet rat as a baby, it's important to have a cage that fits their size. Don't get a cage that's too big, since they may be able to escape through the bars.Baby rats are about 1.25 inches at birth. They are also blind and without fur. By two weeks, they can see and begin growing fur.A cage that is too large for a baby rat can be intimidating for them.They want to feel safe and comfortable, but may feel exposed to predators in a large cage.
Cages for baby rats will not last long. After about three months, they will outgrow a small cage. You can use a rat carrier or travel housing as your starter cage for your baby rat., Rats like to play, so they need plenty of space. Otherwise, they may become defensive towards you and their surroundings.


Your cage should supply about 2 cubic feet per rat. However, this is a good minimum, but the larger the cage, the better it will be for the rat.
You should be able to place plenty of toys and things to do in your rat cage without crowding it. If your rat's toys make your cage look cluttered, it may be time to get a larger cage.

, There may be some particular circumstances that dictate the type of cage you get. If you are in any of the following conditions, make sure to consider them in setting up your rat cage.


You will need to clean the cage on a regular basis. However, if you live in an apartment, you may want to get a cage that can comfortably fit in the bathtub, since you will likely not be able to take it outside to clean it.
Children can stick their fingers in the cage and get bitten by your pet rat. Have a big enough bar size that your children will not be able to stick their fingers inside.
A cage that's easy to take apart may be useful if you plan on moving. Cages can be a hassle to move if they cannot easily be taken apart. When they can't be taken apart, wheels on the bottom of the cage may be useful.

Consider using wood.,

Decorate your maze.",How to Build a Mouse Maze," Before you begin designing your maze, you will need to think about what you are hoping to learn from it. Different styles of mazes will challenge your mouse in different ways and teach you different things about its behavior.You may want to see how fast your mouse can complete the maze and whether or not its performance improves over time. In this case, you would want to build a maze with only one end-point.
You may want to gain insight into your mouse's habits or preferences. In this case, you would want to build a maze with two or more end-points so that your mouse can choose which one it prefers.;
, Once you've decided what you want to learn about your mouse from the maze, you can choose the style of maze that best meets your needs. There are five basic designs to choose from for your maze, and you can customize them from there.If you want to build a maze with one end-point, you have two basic designs to choose from. You can build a classic maze, which is rectangular and has a series of paths, some of which turn into dead-ends. With this design, it is possible for the mouse to have more than two choices at each intersection. Alternatively, you could build a large maze that consists of several interconnected T shapes. With this design, the mouse must choose to turn either right or left at every point where one T connects to another. One choice always leads to the next T and the other always leads to a dead-end, which makes it very simple to calculate how many mistakes the mouse makes along the way.
If you want to build a maze with multiple end-points, you can build a T-shaped maze, a Y-shaped maze, or a maze with several radial arms (which will end up looking like the spokes on a wheel).

, Some mazes are simple and consist of just a few twists and turns, while others are much more complicated. Consider whether you want to start out small and give your mouse an easy maze, or if you want to challenge it with a much more complicated design.If you are building a maze with a single end-point, you can make it more challenging by adding lots of different branches and dead-ends along the way. Your maze can have has many twists and turns as you like, as long as there is a way to get out.
If you are building a maze with multiple end-points, you can make it more challenging by making the corners sharper. T-shaped mazes are generally tougher for mice to navigate than Y-shaped mazes. You could also consider adding more than two arms to your maze.

, Once you've settled on a basic design for your maze, start drawing so you know exactly how you want to lay it out. Your initial drawing does not need to be to scale; it just needs to be an accurate representation of where the different paths will lead.


Once you're done with your drawing, double-check that the maze really does have a solution. You wouldn't want to put your mouse in an impossible-to-solve maze.

, Start with a flat piece of cardboard that is the same size as the maze you want to build. This will be the floor of your maze.If you are starting with a cardboard box, you may be able to leave the sides in place so that you won't have to attach exterior walls later on.

, Now that you know exactly how big your maze will be, it's time to draw out your design on the piece of cardboard that will be the floor of the maze. Drawing your design out will make it much easier to assemble the maze.Consider using a pencil so you can erase your lines if you make a mistake.
Make sure the paths are all wide enough for your mouse to fit through.

, Use a separate piece of cardboard to construct the walls of your maze. You will need to measure the length of each wall, use your scissors or knife to cut a piece of cardboard to the appropriate length, and secure it in place with hot glue. Do this for the interior walls (which you marked with pencil) and the exterior walls, along the entire perimeter of your maze.It may be easier to start from the center and work your way out so that you don't need to lean over the exterior walls in order to attach the interior ones.
Make sure all of your walls, both interior and exterior, are the same height.
You can use other types of glue as well, but hot glue is a good choice because it dries very quickly. Be sure to hold the wall in place until the glue begins to harden.
Run a bead of glue along the corners where two walls meet as well. This will provide extra stability.

, In order to motivate your mouse to find the end of the maze and reward it for solving the puzzle, place some kind of a reward at the end. Rewards are usually food, like unsweetened cereal or peanut butter.If you're using a maze with multiple end-points, you may want to add two different rewards. For example, you could place cereal at one end and peanut butter at the other end to find out which one your mouse prefers.
In some cases, you may not want to add a reward. If, for example, you want to test whether your mouse has an innate preference for turning right or left, you would probably want to let it run the maze a few times with no reward.

, It's a good idea to add some kind of transparent lid to your maze to prevent the mouse from climbing over the walls. You can use a piece of hardware cloth or a thin sheet of plexiglass with some holes for ventilation.Whatever you use, make sure it is transparent enough that you can still see the mouse through it, and that it is ventilated so your mouse has plenty of air.
The top doesn't need to be secured in any way. Just rest it on top of the maze so it's easy to remove it when it's time to put your mouse inside. If you find that your mouse pushes up on the top to try to escape, you can put some pressure on it with your hand or place something else on top of it (like a book, for example).
If you add a top, be sure the walls are high enough so that your mouse can easily navigate the paths without being squished. If you choose not to put a top on your maze, you should build your walls extra high to discourage the mouse from trying to climb out.

, If you want your maze to be extra sturdy, you can use wood for your floor and walls instead of cardboard. You will build your maze the same way, but you will need to use a saw to cut your wood to the appropriate size and construction adhesive to hold the walls in place.A wooden maze will last much longer than a cardboard maze because mice can easily chew through cardboard.
If you are using a material that's heavier than cardboard, it's very important to make sure that the walls are sturdy so that they won't fall down and injure your mouse. You may want to use some screws or nails in addition to your adhesive.

, Another fun and easy way to build a maze is to use interlocking building blocks. Simply stack them on top of each other to create whatever pattern you want.This works especially well if you have a base plate for your building blocks that is the same size as the maze you want to build. This will help ensure that your walls don't fall over.
If you choose this method, you probably won't want to draw your design on the base. That's fine because there's no glue involved, so you can easily change the location of your blocks if you make a mistake.

, If you want to be able to change the layout of your maze frequently without using blocks, consider attaching Velcro strips to the bottoms of your interior walls and to the floor instead of gluing the walls in place. If you choose this modification, you will still use cardboard as your main building material.


You will probably have to add more Velcro to the floor if you want to change the location of the walls.
Consider adding Velcro to the sides of your walls as well so that they stick to each other. This will provide extra stability in case your mouse leans against the wall.

, No matter what you built your maze out of, you can decorate it to make it a little more personal. Use your imagination to make your maze just the way you want it.


If you used cardboard, you could glue colorful construction paper to the outsides of the maze and decorate it with stickers and markers.If you used wood, you could paint the maze or draw directly on the wood with markers.
If you used blocks, you probably won't want to apply glue or paint to them, but you could still use construction paper to decorate the outsides by simply taping it in place.

Coax the foster mother out of her nest.,
Change the scent of the wild baby mouse.,
Put the baby wild mouse with the other babies.,
Return the mother mouse to the cage.,
Leave them alone.,
Assist with feeding multiple wild baby mice.,
Consider purchasing a foster mother from a pet store.",How to Save a Baby Wild Mouse1," If you have a domestic mouse with babies roughly the same size, you may be able to get the mother mouse to take care of the baby wild mouse. Lure the mother mouse out of her nest and put her in a separate holding area, so she can't see what you're doing.Fostering is less risky than hand-feeding a baby that is less than one and a half weeks old. (About the time they first open their eyes.);
, Very carefully, rub the wild baby mouse with bedding from the mother mouse's cage.Use only clean bedding – soiled bedding materials can harm the baby mouse.

, Place the baby wild mouse in between and underneath the existing baby mice. Try not to touch the babies any more than you need to, and be very gentle., Place the mother mouse in her cage, slightly away from the nest. Allow her to find the babies on her own – don't force her to join the group., Do not hover over the cage to watch, or try to disturb the mice in any way. If the mother becomes even slightly upset, she may abandon all the babies.Be aware that there is a very real risk that the mother may abandon the new mice (or all the babies.)
Be very careful when introducing the baby mouse, and leave mother and babies alone when you don't need to handle them.
You will hear loud squeaks if something bad happens, so there is no need to watch the cage.

, If you need the mother to foster several wild baby mice at once, she will probably not have enough milk to feed them all. Coax the mother away from her nest several times a day, and place her in a separate tank. Hand-feed the babies the same way you would feed an orphaned baby mouse.If the babies have “milk bellies” (a visible white band or area on their stomach, which is the actual milk in their tummy), they are getting enough milk from the mother without your help.
Check the babies several times a day during the first few days, to make sure they have milk bellies and are not losing weight. Babies can lose weight very quickly, and will need to be fed right away.

, If you don't have a mother mouse, you may be able to buy one that has recently given birth, along with her babies. If you have a very young baby mouse, its chances of survival are much better with a foster mother than if you hand-feed it yourself.Moving them carries the risk that the mother will abandon her babies, so weigh the risks very carefully before trying it.

, Rats aren't blind, they usually have a pretty good sense of elevation. They probably won't run off the edge but if you're worried you can build a low safety fence out of sturdy cardboard or colorful combs for a more attractive presentation. The fence is just to provide a boundary in case they slip. Apply the fence all along the edges. If you bought the surface just for your rats you can glue the fence directly to the surface or make a mat and glue the fence to it, in order to preserve the surface for later use.

, We will use these to build a ratty fort.

, Place one box on top of another and cut a hole in top of the bottom box all the way through to the bottom of the top box in order to create a fort with multiple floors.

, You may want to add some pretty colors or give the fort a name to write on the front.

, Twigs, old pieces of cloth, strips of paper, bubblegum packet wrappers, old books, and toilet paper rolls work well. Also rats love anything shiny. You could put these in the fort but ratty will probably want to do this himself.

, Now that your rats are rolling fly with their cool crib, they need a swimming pool.

, Most rats love to go fishing for their favorite snacks!

Make sure the nest has been abandoned.,
Call a wildlife rehabilitator.,
Take cat victims to a vet immediately.,
Make the baby comfortable.,
Keep the baby mouse warm.,
Obtain a small feeding syringe.,
Rehydrate the baby mouse.",How to Save a Baby Wild Mouse2," If you find a nest with no mother, you may have inadvertently frightened the mother away or she left to find food to eat. Leave it alone and check back later – if the mother has not returned, she will most likely not return.Try to handle them as little as possible, but don't worry too much about this. Unlike birds, mice will not reject their young simply because they have human scent on them.
After 4-6 hours, if you check the babies and they do not have white bands on their tummies (“milk bellies”), this means they have not been fed. The mother is either deceased, or has abandoned the nest.

, If you find a baby wild mouse (or an empty nest of baby mice), call your local wildlife rehabilitation office. Transferring the baby mouse to a wildlife professional is the best chance it has for survival. In the meantime, there are things you can do to try to keep the baby alive.If there is no rehabilitation office in your area, the next best option is to try to hand-feed the baby.
When you call, ask the rehabilitator what they plan to do with the mice. They may try to raise them, or they may use them to feed other animals they are taking care of. If you don't want your baby mouse to wind up as owl food, you'll need to care for them yourself.

, If the mouse has been attacked by a cat, bacteria in the cat's mouth will almost always cause a fatal infection called septicemia. You can take the mouse to a vet for emergency treatment, but it is unlikely to survive., Line a box with clean, soft rags. Trim off any loose threads that might become tangled around the mouse's legs.Always wash your hands after handling wild mice. They can carry a very dangerous, highly contagious virus called Hantavirus.
If the baby survives the first few days, transfer it to a glass or plastic ventilated container that it won't be able to chew through.

, A baby mouse should be kept warm – 80-100 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal (you can check this with a thermometer.) Turn a heating pad to its lowest setting and wrap it in a soft, clean towel or rag. Place the heating pad under the box, below the mouse.Be sure the heating pad isn't too hot – if it feels even slightly hot to your hand, let it cool in the box for a minute before pressing it up against the mouse.
If you don't have a heating pad, try using a bottle or bag filled with warm, cooked rice. You'll need to keep warming or refreshing the rice as it cools. Use any kind of bottle that can be reheated – a plastic bottle or thick zip-lock freezer bag would work well.
A healthy mouse will be able to maintain its own body temperature at about 2 and ½ weeks old, as long as its container is in a warm, indoor room.

, An eye-dropper is too large to feed a small baby mouse. You will need a tiny syringe (without the needle.) Pet stores often have small syringes with slender, curved spouts specifically for feeding baby rodents.

, Unless you are certain the baby was with its mother less than an hour ago, you should rehydrate the baby before feeding it formula. Feed 3 - 4 drops of a non-flavored electrolyte beverage like Pedialyte directly into the baby's mouth. Wait an hour before feeding formula."
"
Determine the baby's age.,
Be very careful to avoid aspiration.,
Time the baby's feedings according to its age.,
Feed the baby mouse according to its size.,
Encourage the baby mouse to go potty.,
Feed an older baby mouse hard food.,
Give older baby mice a water bottle.",How to Save a Baby Wild Mouse3," In order to feed the baby mouse correctly, you will need to determine its age. Consult a chart that shows photos of a baby mouse as it develops, and match your mouse to one the same size in the pictures.Baby mice begin to grow fur at about 3-5 days old.
Baby mice will open their eyes at about 10-14 days old.
Soon after a baby mouse opens its eyes, it enters the “flea” or “popcorn” stage. A healthy mouse at this stage will jump around a lot and will be extremely difficult to hold.

, Feeding or hydrating a baby wild mouse can lead to aspiration (drowning), if even the smallest amount of fluid gets into its lungs. If you see a bubble come out of the baby's mouth while feeding, the mouse has probably aspirated. Hold the baby upright (vertical) when feeding it – never rest it on its back, like a human baby.
If you do see a bubble, immediately flip the baby upside down (tail up, head down) to prevent any more liquid getting into its lungs.
Sadly, a young baby mouse is unlikely to survive aspiration. There is a very slight chance that an older baby will survive, if you turn it upside down immediately.

, An abandoned mouse may actually be a little older than it looks, because it is under-fed and malnourished. Feed the baby according to the age it appears to be.A newborn mouse will need to be fed every 1 to 2 hours if it is to survive, all day and all night. Someone will need to stay up through the night to feed it.
When the baby's eyes open (around 2 weeks old), you can decrease feeding times to every 3 to 4 hours.

, A baby wild mouse should be fed about .05cc per gram of their own body weight, each time it feeds. A 10 gram baby mouse, for example, should be taking in .5cc of milk every time it feeds. A feeding syringe should show cc measurements.Feed your baby kitten formula, watered down to half strength. Baby mice can't digest the thicker formula.
Hold the baby upright when feeding, to avoid getting any formula in its lungs. Grasp the baby around its middle portion (where a human's waist would be), with the baby's head at the top and its back feet at the bottom. The front feet will probably be inside your hand, depending on the size of the mouse and the size of your hand.
Dispense the kitten formula into the side of the baby mouse's mouth.
Be very careful not to get any milk in the baby's nose – the mouse will suffocate. You can dab its face with a Q-Tip after each dose of milk, to keep the airways clear.
If the baby appears to be losing weight, try to increase the amount of food.
Never force the baby to eat – feed it gradually.
If the mouse is extremely small, you can use a (new, clean) fine-tip paintbrush instead of a syringe. Dip the brush into the formula, then dab it into the corner of the baby's mouth.

, Baby mice will not eliminate their bowels on their own, and they will die from being backed up if you don't encourage them to go. After feeding, gently rub the baby mouse's belly and anus with a fluffy Q-Tip soaked in warm water, until it goes potty.Be careful not to rub so much that you irritate the baby's skin.
If the baby mouse will not go potty after several minutes, let it rest. Come back half an hour later and try again.

, Once the baby has its eyes open and seems healthy, you can add solid mouse food to its milk feedings. Continue to feed milk until the baby is 3 ½ to 4 weeks old.Suitable hard foods include: premixed rodent food (hamster food is best), cooked rice (they usually prefer white over brown rice), human baby food, and kitten food.

, An older baby that already has its eyes open can be given a rodent water bottle. Hang the bottle on the side of its cage, with the tip of the spout low enough that the mouse can reach it. Allow the mouse to use the water bottle on its own – it's okay if it doesn't want to use it at first.Don't give mice water in a bowl – they can easily drown.

Hide treats and chew toys around your rat's little town, a running wheel or little perhaps, anything else your rat likes to play with.,
Store when needed.,
Change the layout of the town every now and then, to give your rat more opportunities for problem-solving and fun adventures.

",How to Build a Safe Playground for Your Pet Rats2," Use simple shapes, squares, rectangles, occasionally triangles. When you design a pattern with multiple layers, make sure there are rectangles for each corner, the same height as the house, to sew in between the other pattern pieces so you can just slide in the dowels through either top or bottom.


A simple pattern is a square house (cube) with a hole in middle of the front of the cube so they can get in and out (you can make multiple entrances and exits). You can make the 6 square pieces one layer, or two (for insulation, another fleece pattern, whatever you like).
Use wooden dowels (must be a safe wood for the rats) for supports on the outside.

, You can connect entryways and exits with cloth tubes with supports, little popsicle stick ladders, rope ladders, etc. If you want, you can make a cardboard (or other type of sturdy material) wall around the little town, to keep your rats from wandering off when not supervised.

, You can put a little swing in there, a small swimming pool, whatever you want that's safe for the rats.

, This little town can be put away in a clear storage tub (also the ""walls"" if you decide to make them and they can be folded), after you remove the dowel supports of the buildings. Depending on how you make them and what fabric you use, they can be washer-safe (put them in a pillowcase to avoid damage, though).

Position your mouse.,
Locate your mouse’s spine.,
Look for your mouse’s hip bones.,
Look at your mouse’s overall physique.,
Consult with your vet.,
Feed your mouse a small portion of pellets.,
Add small amounts of fruits and vegetables to your mouse’s diet.,
Stop feeding your mouse seeds.,
Scatter your mouse’s food through its cage.,
Put an exercise wheel in your mouse’s cage.",How to Know if Your Mouse Is Obese," Body condition is an assessment of how an animal looks. It ranges from emaciated (extremely underweight) to obese (extremely overweight). To determine your mouse's body condition, you will hold it still and examine a few parts of its body. Hold your mouse still by holding the base of its tail with your thumb and middle finger.Hold your mouse in its cage or on another flat surface, like the floor or a table.


The base of the tail is where the tail is attached to the body.
Do not squeeze the tail too tightly. This could hurt your mouse and damage its tail.
Your mouse may not want to stay still for long. If it starts squirming, let the tail go in the cage or place your mouse back in the cage.;
, How well you can see and feel your mouse’s spine is a good indicator of body condition. If you cannot see the bones (‘vertebrae’) of your mouse’s spine, and cannot feel them when applying firm pressure to the spine, then your mouse is obese.To apply pressure, use one or two fingers from the hand not holding the tail and press down on the spine. Do not press down so hard that your mouse becomes uncomfortable.
The vertebrae of a mouse at an ideal weight would be felt with only slight pressure to the spine. For an underweight mouse, you would be able to see the sharp points of the vertebrae without even touching them., The ability to see and feel the hip bones is another indicator of body condition in mice. The hip bones are located near the bottom of your mouse’s spine. In underweight mice, the hip bones would be very easy to see because they would not be covered with much flesh, causing them to stick out like sharp edges. If your mouse is obese, though, you would not be able to see or feel the hip bones at all because they would be covered with a lot of flesh and fat deposits.For a mouse at its ideal weight, the hip bones would not be visible. However, you would be able to feel them with slight pressure., If your mouse is extra squirmy and won’t hold still, you could simply at look at your mouse to determine if it’s obese. Looking down at your mouse from above, if your mouse looks really bulky and wide, then it is obese. If you look at your mouse from the back, it would essentially look like a large, wide mound if it is obese. You would not be able to make out any bony structures., If your mouse is obese, it should lose some weight. Before you start making changes to your mouse’s diet and daily routine, talk with your vet first. Your vet can determine your mouse’s ideal weight and give you suggestions on how to help your mouse gradually lose weight. In general, you will need to reduce your mouse’s caloric intake and increase its activity level.

, Overeating is a frequent cause of obesity in pet mice. Give your mouse only 1 tablespoon of pellets per day.This may not seem like a lot, but it will be enough for your mouse. Use a measuring spoon to make sure you give your mouse the proper amount of pellets.

, Fruits and vegetables will add important nutrients to your mouse’s diet. Pet mice don’t need a lot of fruits and vegetables each day, though. Think of these foods as treats and feed them in only small amounts. Examples of fresh produce are an apple slice or a few blueberries.Celery and peas are also good feeding choices for mice.Some fruits and veggies, like grapes, raisings, and rhubarb, are toxic to mice.Do not feed these to your mouse.
Wash the produce with water to remove pesticides.

, Mice like eating sunflower seeds. However, because these seeds are high in fat, a pet mouse could become obese by eating too many of them.If you have been feeding sunflower seeds to your mouse, take them out of its diet.


Food mixes containing seeds and grains can also make a mouse obese.If your mouse is obese, do not feed it a seed/grain mix.

, In the wild, mice will forage for their food. To help your mouse become more active, scatter and bury its food in the cage. This will encourage your mouse to move around to find and eat its food.When you clean your mouse’s cage, remove bits of uneaten fruits and veggies to keep them from spoiling., In addition to eating less, your mouse will need to exercise more to lose weight. Exercise wheels are a great way to get your mouse to exercise. If you do not already have an exercise wheel for your mouse, purchase one that has a smooth surface so your mouse’s feet don’t get stuck between the wires. The wheel should be at least 6 to 8 inches in diameter.If your mouse is obese, it may not spend much time on the exercise wheel at first. However, as it loses weight from eating less, it may use the exercise wheel more and more.

Clean your mouse’s cage and its accessories.,
Disinfect the cage and its accessories.",How to Spot Mites on Pet Mice," Mites are only a small fraction of an inch long (1/32 inch).On your mouse’s fur, an adult mite will look like a small black dot. A mite egg will look like a round speck.Given the tiny size of mites, you may not be able to tell the difference between an adult mite and a mite egg.


Mites have 8 legs.If you have a black mouse, the mites may look like white specks of dust on his fur.;
, A magnifying glass will help you spot mites in your mouse’s fur.With the magnifying glass, look for tiny specks in the fur. Since mites can cause intense itching around the shoulders, neck, and face, start your search in those areas.If you do not have a magnifying glass, you can find one at your local pharmacy.

, Rather than using a magnifying glass, you could use tape to spot mites on your mouse. Take a small piece of tape (an inch or two in length), place it on an affected area of fur, then remove the tape and see what stuck to it.The mites would look like black specks on the tape.


Be gentle when taking the tape off. You do not want to hurt your mouse.
Keep in mind that not all mice show signs of mites. The mites on your mouse may not cause him to itch very much, so you may not see a section of affected fur., If you have spotted mites on your mouse (or if he’s extremely itchy), take him to your vet. Your vet will take a close look at your mouse’s skin and fur. They will take a sample from your mouse’s fur and look at it under the microscope to confirm your mouse has mites., If left untreated, mites can cause your mouse to itch and scratch constantly, making feel him worse and worse over time. Your vet will prescribe one of the available mite-killing medications. These medications can by injected (by your vet), given by mouth (by you), or put on your mouse’s skin (by you).Follow your vet’s treatment instructions carefully.


A drug called ivermectin is a common mite-killing treatment for pet mice. Although ivermectin can be given by mouth or applied directly to the skin, skin application is the safer and more effective choice.If you are unsure how to give the treatment, ask your veterinarian to show you how.
Since you will need to clean your mouse's cage, keep him in a separate cage with all of his necessities (food, water, toys) until he has finished treatment., Bedding is a common source of mites in pet mice.To prevent your mouse from getting re-infected with mites, remove and discard all of his cage’s bedding. Clean and disinfect his cage before you put fresh and clean bedding in the cage.

, After removing the cage accessories, clean the cage with hot water, detergent, and a scrub brush. To clean the accessories, put them all in a large bucket filled with hot, soapy water and clean them with a scrub brush (not the same one you used to clean the cage). Use a second bucket to rinse the accessories before disinfecting them.Use an unscented dish soap.Clean the inside and outside of the cage.

, To disinfect, mix 1/2 tablespoon of bleach per 1 gallon of cold water. Put some of this solution in a spray bottle and spray the inside and outside of your mouse’s cage. You can either wipe the cage dry after 2 minutes or let it air dry. For the cage accessories, add the bleach solution to another bucket and let the accessories soak for about 30 seconds. Let them air dry before putting them in the cage.When cleaning and disinfecting your mouse’s cage, you should not be able to smell the cleaning agent."

Eliminate possible allergens.,
Take your pet to a veterinarian.,
Give your mouse antibiotics.,
Keep your mouse's cage clean.",How to Identify the Cause of Sneezing in Pet Mice," Additional symptoms can give you clue to the cause of your mouse's symptoms. For example, if your mouse has signs of congestion, such as a runny nose, then the sneezing could be related to a respiratory infection.Look for dampness under your mouse's nose. This may signal a runny nose.;
, Labored breathing can signal that your mouse is fighting off a respiratory infection. If you hold your mouse close to your ear, can you hear labored breathing? This is a sign that there may be an infection in your mouse's lungs.Depending on the mouse, you may not be able to get close enough to it to assess its breathing. If this is the case, look for other symptoms to help you assess your mouse's health.

, Loss of appetite or lethargy can signal that your is fighting off illness. While no appetite and inactivity can signal a variety of problems, combining it with sneezing signals that your mouse may have a respiratory illness.Loss of appetite and lethargy can also signal a variety of other illnesses. If your pet mouse is inactive and is not eating, you should get it checked out by a veterinarian.

, If your mouse doesn't have any other symptoms of a respiratory infection, then explore other possible causes for the sneezing. In order to narrow down the cause of your mouse's sneezing, you will want to remove any possible allergens from your mouse's cage. In most cases of an allergic reaction, the cause is the mouse's bedding.Clean out your mouse's entire cage and replace the bedding with a paper-based bedding that is dust free, which can simply be a layer of shredded paper.
If your mouse was indeed allergic to its bedding, its sneezing should stop in a week or two.
Wood bedding is usually the cause of an allergy. If you find that your mouse is allergic to wood bedding, don't use it any more and find a suitable replacement.

, If your mouse is sneezing a lot, and eliminating allergens did not eliminate its sneezing, then you should take it to a veterinarian to be assessed. A veterinarian that is experienced with mice will be able to assess your mouse's symptoms and can likely give you a diagnosis.


Find a veterinarian that specializes in small animals. It can be hard to find a veterinarian for a pet mouse. Call the veterinarians in your area and ask if they are comfortable treating a mouse. Even if they do not treat mice, they may have a suggestion about a veterinarian in your area that will., If your veterinarian suspects that your mouse has a respiratory infection, he or she will likely prescribe it antibiotics. This medication will help the animal fight off the infection.Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for dosing and for how long to continue giving the medication.
Some respiratory infections cannot be eliminated by antibiotics, such as some mycoplasma infections.However, giving a pet mouse antibiotics even with this type of infection will support its immune system in keeping the disease controlled.

, Cleaning your mouse's environment clean will help if fight off any infection it has. If the mouse does not have to fight off any other bacteria or virus, which fester in dirty cages, then it can more easily recover from its illness.Clean your mouse's cage on a regular basis, whether it is sick or not. This will help its overall health and happiness.

Look for symptoms of heavy infection.,
Check for signs of adult pinworms in feces.,
Determine if your mouse has had contact with contaminated materials.",How to Identify Pinworms in Mice1," If a mouse has a large infestation of pinworms in the intestines, the mouse may have diarrhea. This is caused from intestinal inflammation due to the pinworms.If the infection is really bad, the mouse may also have a rectal prolapse due to straining or anal irritation. They may also have sticky or hard to pass stools.
The mouse may also have poor growth, poor overall bodily health, or a poor coat.;
, You may be able to identify adult pinworms in the fecal pellets from your mouse. Pinworms are clear to white in color with a long, thin, hair like shape.The pinworms may be too small for you to see with the naked eye.

, Pinworms are spread through oral contact with contaminated feces. Pinworms are passed through feces, and anything that the feces touches may get infected with pinworms.Pinworms in feces may also float in the air; therefore, the pinworms may end up in the surrounding area around the mouse’s cage.If your mouse has been near any surfaces that were contaminated or has come in contact with feces from an infected animal, they may have pinworms.

"
"
Take your mouse to the vet.,
Treat the pinworms with fenbendazole.,
Clean the mouse’s living area.",How to Identify Pinworms in Mice2," The best way to positively identify pinworms in your mouse is to take them to the vet. Your doctor can perform different tests to determine if your mouse is infected. They may start by doing a tape test around the anus to check for egg deposits.One type of pinworm does not make egg deposits around the anus, so if that turns up negative, your doctor will perform a different test. They may do a fecal smear or flotation to identify the pinworms.

, Pinworms can be easily treated in mice. Your doctor will give the mouse a treatment of feed containing fendendazole. You can also find it in pet stores. You give the feed to the mouse for a week, then stop for a week, until the pinworms are gone or your vet tells you to stop treatment.The vet may also suggest a treatment using ivermectin, which can be given to the mouse topically or through their drinking water., If your mouse has pinworms, you should clean their cage and living areas. This includes the air in the room and surfaces beyond the cage since pinworms can float in the air from fecal pellets.Many disinfectants won’t kill pinworms. Ask your vet for the best cleaning supplies to disinfect your mouse’s living area.
Pinworms can be killed by high temperatures. Consider using hot water or other sources of heat to kill any lingering worms or eggs.

Prevent the spread of pinworms by removing contaminated mice.,
Buy mice from reputable sources.,
Know that pinworm infections may show no signs.",How to Identify Pinworms in Mice3," Pinworms are extremely contagious if the mouse comes into contact with infected feces. If any of your mice get pinworms, remove them from the other mice immediately.You may have to treat all of your mice for pinworms if one has pinworms and they were living in close quarters.

, Mice commonly carry pinworms with no symptoms. This means you may buy a mouse with pinworms and not know it. To prevent the spread of pinworms in a lab or your home, make sure any new mice are free from pinworms.Take them to the vet before introducing them to your other mice, or keep them separate until you have treated them.

, Most pinworm infections in mice present no symptoms. Since this is a common parasite for mice, your mouse may be infected though they are showing no signs.Because of this, it is important to keep your mouse away from possible contaminated feces or other mice that have pinworms.
Many mice carry a light infection of pinworms without any harm occurring to the mice.If you believe your mouse might have pinworms, take them to the vet.

Differentiate between infestations.,
Treat the mouse with a product recommended by your veterinarian.,
Treat secondary infections.,
Treat all other mice you have.,
Clean and disinfect all equipment.,
Pay attention to itching.,
Look for thinning hair.,
Inspect your mouse's coat.,
Get a veterinary diagnosis.",How to Get Rid of Mites on Pet Mice," Mice can get a variety of infestations that have similar symptoms to a mite infection. For example, mice can get a lice infestation that presents very similarly to a mite infestation. In order for your mouse's issue to be treated correctly, you need to figure out what type of infestation the mouse actually has.When your veterinarian inspects your mouse, they should be able to tell what kind of infestation your mouse has.;
, Treating a mite infestation requires you to apply a medication. The medications used for mite infestations may be applied on the skin, given orally, or injected by the veterinarian. They are usually applied twice, two weeks apart, to kill all adult mites. There are several medications that may be prescribed that are all macrocyclic lactone anti-parasitic drugs:Selamectin
MoxidectinIvermectin

, If the mite infestation has caused your mouse's skin to become infected, you may need to give it additional medication. Discuss this option with your veterinarian, as he or she may want to allow your mouse's immune system time to clear up the infection before relying on medication.


One reason for waiting on further medication is that infections are often treated with antibiotics. Veterinarians are in agreement that antibiotics are overprescribed and that over prescribing them leads to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.Once the mites are eliminated, it will be easier to get the infection under control.

, If one of your mice has a mite infestation, and it lives with other mice, then they may all be infested. Discuss the problem with your veterinarian but it is likely that the vet will have you treat all the mice you have.


Infestation is transferred via direct contact. If you have other mice that are housed separately, be sure to keep uninfested mice away from the infested mice until the infestation is totally cleared up., Eliminating a mite infestation will require you to thoroughly clean and disinfect all equipment the mouse comes in contact with. This includes its cage, any feeding containers, and all toys.It's important to completely clean and sanitize the cage. First use soap to clean all debris off the surface of the cage. Then use bleach to disinfect the cage completely.All bedding and food should be removed and then replaced once the cage is sanitized.
The cage should be both thoroughly cleaned at the beginning of treatment and weekly after that.

, If your mouse has a mite infestation, it is likely to scratch itself excessively.In fact, this is likely to be the only symptom many mice exhibit.


The mites disturb the skin because mice are often allergic to the mites or they are irritated by the mites eating their skin debris., A mouse with a mite infestation may have hairless patches on the back of its head and along its spine. This thinning hair is usually caused by excessive itching and scratching the mouse does in response to the mites.Patches of thinning hair may also have scabs or lesions in them, indicating that the hair loss is due to your mouse scratching the area.

, If you suspect that your mouse has a mite infestation, then you should inspect its coat for secondary symptoms. These include skin ulcers or lesions and a greasy or smelly coat.These symptoms signal a mite infestation. However, your mouse may still have a mite infestation even if these symptoms are not present.

, In many cases, there will be very few symptoms of a mite infestation. Even a serious infection may only cause you mouse to scratch occasionally.Because of this, you should get your pet mouse examined


In order to identify mites, your mouse may be examined with a magnifying lens. In addition, a piece of tape may be pressed on to the mouse's fur, which will remove mites for inspection and identification.
It can be hard to find a veterinarian who is experienced with treating rodents. Call around to veterinarians in your area or do an online search to find a veterinarian who has expertise with treating mice."

Look for signs of sudden onset mousepox.,
Pay attention to signs of sub-acute or chronic mousepox.,
Quarantine the potentially infected mouse.,
Contact your veterinarian.,
Take your mouse to a veterinarian.,
Give supportive care.,
Keep the mouse quarantined.",How to Diagnose Mousepox," Sudden onset mousepox is the acute form of the disease, meaning that it comes on suddenly and forcefully. A mouse with acute mousepox will usually be hunched over, have swelling of the face, and have digestive distress, such as diarrhea.These symptoms will appear and progress very quickly. In many cases the mouse will die quickly from the acute form of this disease.;
, This form of the disease usually begins as a rash all over the mouse's body. Then, eventually, the mouse's body begins to swell and irritation often leads the mouse to chew on its own body and limbs.The rash may lead the mouse to bite at its own skin. Thus, in addition to a rash, its body may be covered in small bite marks.

, If you suspect that your mouse has mousepox, you should separate it from any other mice that you have. Place the potentially non-infected mice in a cage that has fresh water, bedding, and food. Also wash your hands after handling the potentially infected mouse. This will help to limit their exposure to the illness.However, this illness is very contagious, so your other mice may be infected already. Keep an eye on them for signs that they are infected as well.

, If you suspect mousepox, you should contact your veterinarian immediately. This is an illness with a very high mortality rate, so the quicker you get treatment, the less pain and suffering your mouse is likely to go through.Tell the veterinarian why you think your mouse has mousepox. This disease is very, very rare in pet mice, so your veterinarian may suspect that you are dealing with a different disease unless you can describe exactly how your mouse would have contracted the disease.

, If your mouse has the debilitating symptoms associated with the acute and sub-acute types of mousepox, then it needs veterinary care quickly. Take your mouse to its veterinarian immediately or to an emergency pet hospital if your normal veterinary office is not open when you notice the symptoms.


Mousepox is diagnosed based on clinical signs, blood tests, and a history of being exposed to the disease.Tell your veterinarian that you are bringing in your mouse on an emergency basis, so that the veterinary office can be prepared to keep the mouse quarantined.

, If your mouse has come down with the symptoms of mousepox it will likely die. Discuss ways to ease the mouse's suffering while it is still alive with your veterinarian.Supportive care could include euthanasia if your mouse is very, very ill. Sometimes the best thing you can do for a pet is to end their suffering in a respectful way.

, Even if your mouse survives mousepox, it could be a carrier for the disease. This means that a mouse that recovers from the disease should be kept isolated from other mice to avoid the risk of spreading the disease.For example, in laboratory settings, there are strains of mice that are resistant to mousepox. However, these mice can be carriers of the disease and spread it to other non-resistant strains.

Ensure that the nest has been abandoned.,
Seek help from a vet, when necessary.,
Handle mice carefully.",How to Care for a Baby Wild Mouse1," If you come across a nest with no mother, you cannot immediately determine that she is gone for good. You may have simply frightened her or she may be out looking for food. Leave the nest (and mice) alone and check again later. If the mother is still absent, you may need to take action.Try not to disturb the nest. But don't worry, mother mice will not reject babies who have been touched.
Return again after 1-2 hours, and then again after another 1-2 hours.
Check the babies' bellies for white bands known as ""milk bellies."" If you don't see these over the course of 4-6 hours, the babies have not been fed and are likely orphans.;
, If the baby mouse has been attacked by a cat, you must seek the help of a veterinarian right away. Bacteria from the cat's mouth can cause a serious (often fatal) infection called ""septicemia."" A vet may be able to provide emergency treatment for the baby mouse.Perform an internet search for veterinarians in your area.
Call ahead to see if they can treat mice.

, Baby mice are small and docile, and must be handled with care. They should not squirm much, but you must still grasp them firmly when feeding to prevent falls. Additionally, it is important to note that wild mice have been shown to carry germs.You may choose to wear latex gloves when handling the mice.
Whether or not you wear gloves, you must thoroughly wash your hands after handling.

Provide liquid nourishment.,
Feed it every two hours.,
Include solid foods once eyes are open.",How to Care for a Baby Wild Mouse2," Baby mice would ordinarily drink milk from their mother. Instead, you are going to need to provide that “milk” to you baby mouse.Avoid cow's milk. Instead, you might choose:


Baby formula made with soy (diluted slightly).
Kitten formula (diluted slightly).
Goat’s milk.

, Your baby mouse is going to need to eat around the clock until it opens its eyes. For very young mice (0-2 weeks old), you must do this every two hours. After this, they only need to eat every 3-4 hours. Once their eyes are open, they should no longer need to eat during the night.Warm up the milk.
Fill an eyedropper, syringe, or pipette with milk.
Hold the mouse firmly with your non-dominant hand.
Holding the pipette in your other hand, try to shimmy the tip into the mouse's mouth.
Put drop of warm milk in then wait for him to swallow (this looks like stretching out and squirming).
Offer the mouse as much milk as it wants.

, When your mouse’s eyes are open, it can begin to eat some solid food. Continue giving it formula until the 4-6 weeks old, by which time it should be weaned.You may give your mouse:


Hamster food moistened with formula or goat’s milk.
Kitten food (moistened).
Human baby food (homemade or store-bought).
Soft cooked vegetables like squash, peas, or carrots.

Set up a cage.,
Keep your mouse warm.,
Include some toys.",How to Care for a Baby Wild Mouse3," You will need some kind of enclosure to house your baby mouse. That first night, you might begin with just a shoebox containing a kitchen towel. However, if you plan to make this mouse your pet, you will need something more permanent. As a general rule, you should provide one cubic foot (30.4 cubic cm) of space for your first mouse, and an additional 0.5 cubic feet (15.24 cubic cm) of space for each additional mouse in the same cage.You must also clean the cage once a week. You may purchase one of the following at your local pet store:


Glass aquarium.
Metal cage.
Plastic cage.

, If your mouse were in the wild, it would cuddle with its mother and siblings. In your home, you need to make sure that your baby mouse stays warm.Spread wood shavings on the bottom of its cage.
Keep the cage off the ground in your home.
Keep the temperature in your home around 70 degrees F (21 degrees C).

, Mice need to exercise quite a bit, they need things to chew on, and they crave mental stimulation.As your mouse begins exploring the cage, consider providing some of the following items:


Exercise toys, like a mouse wheel or little balls with bells inside (normally sold as cat toys).
Chew toys, like paper towel rolls or egg cartons.
Foraging toys or food-hiding toys (created for birds and/or rodents).

Understand the risks.,
Wash your hands.,
Keep the mouse away from your food.,
Remove ticks.",How to Care for a Baby Wild Mouse4," Although transmission rates are rather low, wild mice can carry diseases which could make you sick. Perform an internet search to determine the level of risk in your area. Take precautions to protect yourself.For example a wild mouse can transmit:


Hantavirus.
Salmonellosis (bacterial infection).
Lyme disease (from ticks)., The very best way to prevent the spread of germs from your mouse is to wash your hands after you touch it. Before washing your hands, avoid touching your mouth, eyes, or any part of your face. Washing with soap and water is best, but if you are not able to, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer is another option.


Wet your hands with water.
Lather with soap (any soap is fine).
Rub all surfaces of your hands.
Rinse and dry your hands.

, Salmonella bacteria—which results in the condition Salmonellosis--can be spread by mice. As such, it is important to keep your mouse away from the food that you eat.Never allow mice on countertops or in pantries.
Keep all of your food in secure, sealed containers.

, If you live in a region that is prone to ticks, be sure you check your mouse for ticks regularly (at least once a week). If you find a tick attached to your mouse, you will need to remove it.


Wear rubber gloves.
Clean the area with rubbing alcohol (try to smother the tick).
Use tweezers to carefully pull the tick off of your mouse.
Flush the tick down your toilet.

Give your mouse commercial pellets.,
Feed your mouse a healthy diet.,
Place gnawing materials in your mouse’s cage.,
Schedule regular teeth trimmings with your vet.,
Have your vet trim your mouse’s incisors.,
Do not cut your mouse’s incisors at home.,
Treat dental problems in your mouse.",How to Prevent Your Mouse from Developing Overgrown Incisors," In the wild, a mouse will gnaw on wood and forage to keep the incisors trimmed down. For your pet mouse, commercial pellets are a good chewing choice. They will help your mouse wear down its incisors and provide it with a complete and well-balanced diet. Overfeeding pellets can cause obesity, though, so follow the feeding instructions carefully.Commercial pellets are available at your local pet store. Talk with your vet if you’re not sure which brand to choose.;
, In addition to pellets, a healthy overall diet can help prevent overgrown incisors in mice.A healthy diet contains a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables that contain important nutrients. Examples of fresh produce are apples, broccoli, carrots, and berries.Wash the produce with water to get rid of the pesticides. Here are some other tips for feeding your mouse a healthy diet:Give your mouse a constant supply of fresh water each day.
Because mice forage for their food in the wild, scatter your mouse’s food throughout its cage to encourage foraging behavior.
Offer the fruits and vegetables in small amounts. They should not be the main the part of your mouse’s diet. Think of the fruits and vegetables as occasional treats.

, Your mouse should gnaw on more than just its food. Examples of good chew toys for mice are wooden sticks, wooden blocks, and even hard dog biscuits.Be mindful that certain types of wood (pine, cedar) are toxic to mice.Make sure the wooden chewing toys you purchase do not contain pine or cedar.


You don’t have to purchase a lot of chew toys. Your mice can also chew on empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls, empty cardboard egg cartons, and small cardboard boxes.Give your mouse a variety of chew toys so it doesn’t get bored with just a few things to chew on.
Replace the chew toys as they get worn down.

, In addition to a healthy diet and chew toys, regular teeth trimming will help prevent your mouse’s incisors from overgrowing. Teeth trimming every 2‒3 weeks is a good schedule.Your vet can help you determine how often your mouse’s incisors should be trimmed.


Mouse incisors grow a few millimeters each week., Teeth trimming requires anesthesia.While your mouse is anesthetized, your vet will use specialized dental tools, such as a high-speed drill, to trim the incisors. The drill will allow your vet to smoothly trim the incisors without leaving any sharp or jagged edges.Make sure your vet does not use nail trimmers or bone cutters to trim the incisors. These instruments can split the incisors lengthwise, causing pain and a possible tooth root infection.The tooth root is located above the gum line.

, Regular teeth trimmings by your vet could get expensive. Because of the expense, you may want to trim your mouse’s incisors on your own. Do not do this! Without having specialized dental tools, you could crack the incisors and end up causing more harm than good. Leave the teeth trimming to your vet.

, Other than overgrown incisors, mice can suffer from such dental problems as malocclusion (improper teeth alignment) and abscesses (pockets of infection). Symptoms of dental problems include decreased appetite, bad breath, lumps near the mouth, and extra drooling.If you notice dental problems in your mice, take it to your vet for treatment. Examples of treatment are:Teeth trimming for malocclusion
Tooth extraction and removal of affected tissue for abscesses

Before starting, ensure that your rat is comfortable being semi-submerged in water.,
Close the bathroom door and fill the sink about halfway with warm water.

,
Lay a towel down next to the sink, so they can jump out and shake off the water.,
Get your rat ready in one hand, and have the shampoo in the other(dog shampoo, preferably oatmeal shampoo because of it's soothing and hydrating properties.,
Gently put your rat in the sink, just enough to get them wet.,
Remove the rat from the water and sit it on the towel.,
Put your rat in the sink again to rinse off the shampoo, making sure you don't get their face wet.

Use a towel to dry your rat.",How to Bathe Your Pet Rat," Do not force your rat to go in the water.;
,, Also, have a towel ready to dry them off.

, DO NOT USE flea and tick shampoos on rats).

, Make sure you don't get water in their ears or eyes. They won't like this too much so it's important to talk to them to reassure them.

, Scrub the shampoo into the rat's fur, but don't use too much and don't get any on their face or head.

,,,,


Bathing rats isn't necessary, but is useful before shows or if they are just a bit smelly.
Find a small animal shampoo with natural oils, especially if you have to bathe them more than once a month. It's important to clean your rat more than once a month if your rat has been ill or is elderly. However, be careful not to bathe your rat too often. If you bathe your rat too often, the supply of natural oils on your rat's skin and fur may become depleted, causing your rat's skin to get too dry. Be sure that you use baby shampoo or animal shampoo. Regular shampoo used for humans can cause serious skin problems.

Take action to save your mouse.",How to Keep Mice Cool in Hot Weather," Some people house their smaller pets in outdoor hutches. While this may have its conveniences, it can be very dangerous in hot or humid weather.Mice are very susceptible to heat stress. It's partly because they're confined to a caged area (and can't retreat to cooler rooms) and partly because they have a hard time regulating their body temperatures.Any time the weather is predicted to get 85 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) or warmer, you should make sure your mice remain indoors.The same goes for high humidity levels. If the humidity is predicted to exceed 60% in your area, keep your mice indoors.;
, You may not feel too hot sitting next to a window on a summer day, but your mouse might. Direct sunlight can be very dangerous for mice, even on mildly warm or cool days, and heat can build up very quickly inside your mouse's cage.Make sure the cage is kept indoors, and keep it away from any windows.
If your mouse's cage must remain in a room with windows, make sure you close the curtains.
Try to use thick curtains that block out heat and sunlight to help regulate the room's temperature.

, In addition to moving your mouse into a shaded part of your home, keeping the room cool is one of the best things you can do.If you're warm in the room, there's a good chance that your mouse is even warmer.


If you have air conditioning, make sure it's turned on in the room your mouse cage is in.
If you don't have air conditioning, use as many fans as you have to help circulate air around the room.However, fans may not be too helpful since mice do not sweat.The ideal room temperature for mice should be between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 23 degrees Celsius)., One way to help keep your mouse cool is by leaving it on a cool floor. You can put your mouse's cage on a cool tile floor, or (if you can mouse-proof the room) try letting the mouse roam the tiled room outside of its cage. Just don't let a mouse roam freely in a large, open area like a basement or garage, or it might get away.Tile floors tend to maintain some coolness, even when it's hot outside. If you don't have tile floors in any rooms, you might try a cool concrete floor.
Laundry rooms, basements, and garages tend to have cool floors during hot weather, and may be good places to set your mouse's cage. However, you should never let mice run free outside the cage in these environments, as they may escape or hide.

, Your mouse should have access to clean, cool water at all times. You may want to put out an extra water bowl/bottle, or consider adding some ice cubes to your mouse's usual water container.Without access to clean water, your mouse can easily suffer a heat stroke. In extreme conditions, this could be fatal.

, One easy way to cool off the cage is by hanging cold, wet towels over it. This will help regulate the temperature inside the cage, especially if it's warm in your room.Fill your sink, bathtub, or a clean bucket full of cold water. Add ice cubes to really cool the water down.
Soak one or two clean towels in the ice water. Let the fabric adjust to the temperature for a few minutes before you remove them.
Wring out any excess water. You don't want the towels ""raining"" down on your mice, so make sure they're not dripping any water.
Drape the towels over the cage. Make sure there are still some gaps between the towels and the floor of the cage to ensure proper ventilation.
Check the towels periodically to make sure they're still cool. Repeat as necessary to keep the towels cold.

, Ice packs are a great way to help your mouse keep cool.If you have ice packs, put them in one or two corners of the cage. If you don't, fill a plastic water bottle part way with water and leave it in the freezer overnight. You can also do this with empty plastic containers from margarine or cottage cheese, or by filling a shallow cooking pan with ice water.Set the plastic water bottles on their sides on the floor of your cage. Make sure the bottles won't tip over onto your mouse.
Some mice will lie on the bottles/containers/pans, or at least lie against the sides. Others won't.
Even if your mouse doesn't lie on the container/bottle, it will still help lower the temperature inside the cage a little.

, If it's really warm, you may want to consider misting your mouse to help it cool down. You can do this periodically on a regular interval, or any time your mouse appears to be uncomfortable or acting weird (though the mouse may already have heat stroke by that point).Make sure the spray bottle can be set to mist instead of jet stream. You want to cool your mouse off gently, not blast it with a strong stream of water.

, A big factor in whether your mouse will be at risk of heat stress is how hot and humid it is outside. You can check this information in your local newspaper or online.Any time the temperature outside reaches 85 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius), your mouse is at risk of suffering from heat stress.
High humidity in warm climates can also cause heat stress for small animals. You should be able to check the humidity levels in your region wherever you check the weather.

, If you're worried about your mouse experiencing heat stress, it's a good idea to know what warning signs to look for. Some signs may appear early on when your mouse is merely stressed by the heat, while others will appear once your mouse is experiencing heat stroke.Common signs to watch for include:


panting
slobbery/thick saliva
bright red appearance to the tongue
signs of weakness and/or reluctance to move
convulsions (this is a sign that the heatstroke is pretty far advanced)

, If you believe your mouse is experiencing heat stroke, you'll need to act quickly. Start cooling your mouse off gradually at home and try to get your pet to the veterinarian or an after-hours clinic to make sure your mouse is healthy.Move your mouse to a comfortably cool area, preferably one with air conditioning.
If you don't have air conditioning inside your home, try taking your mouse's cage out to your car (if you have one) and turning on the AC inside.
Use cool water to wet your mouse's ears, feet, and fur.
Call your veterinarian. Ask for advice, and bring your mouse in right away if your vet recommends it.
Place your mouse on a wet towel that has been soaked in cold water.
Do not try to cool your mouse's body temperature down too rapidly, as this can result in serious medical complications.
Don't be afraid to turn on the air conditioning and use a wet towel, as these things will help, but avoid trying to blast your mouse with cold conditions.
Your vet will assess your mouse's condition and may recommend further care.

Look for the general signs of respiratory illness.,
Look for symptoms in your other mice.,
Take your mouse in for veterinary care.,
Approve veterinary testing.,
Treat the mouse with antibiotics.,
Keep the mouse's home clean.,
Prevent the spread of infection.,
Prevent future infection.",How to Diagnose Chronic Murine Pneumonia in Mice," A mouse with a respiratory infection, like chronic murine pneumonia, will usually sneeze, have difficulty breathing, and have discharge from the nose. Infected mice will also usually make a noise described as ""chattering.""Mouse ""chattering"" is usually a clicking noise. This is a good sign that the mouse has a respiratory illness, as they are usually silent otherwise.Not all mice with respiratory infections show outward symptoms. This can make spotting a pneumonia infection very hard to spot.;
, Chronic murine pneumonia is spread easily from mouse to mouse. It can be spread via casual contact, sexual contact, sneezing, and coughing.Keep a close eye on all your mice for symptoms if you think that one is infected.


If one of your mice has the infection, it is likely that other mice it has contact with will have the infection as well.

, If you suspect that your mouse is sick, you should get it veterinary care. Your veterinarian will give the mouse an exam, including taking its vital signs and assessing its physical health.


However, during the early stages of respiratory illness, mice rarely show overt symptoms. This can make it hard to spot chronic murine pneumonia in your pet.
Make sure you go to a veterinarian that has experience working with mice. This will assure that your pet gets good veterinary care.

, Chronic murine pneumonia is usually diagnosed by testing the mouse's blood.If you want a specific diagnosis, you will need to pay for laboratory tests on your mouse's blood.


Chronic murine pneumonia is treated similarly to other respiratory infections. This means that a specific diagnosis is not necessary, as long as your veterinarian identifies that your mouse has a respiratory infection.

, A respiratory infection, such as chronic pneumonia, can be hard to clear up completely. However, a treatment of antibiotics can keep symptoms suppressed and under control.Your veterinarian may be hesitant to prescribe antibiotics right away. Overuse of antibiotics can promote antibiotic-resistant strains of diseases. Because of this, your veterinarian may wait to see if the mouse's immune system can fight off the disease before prescribing antibiotics.

, If your mouse has a respiratory infection you should do all you can to keep that infection to a minimum. One of the best ways you can do this is to keep the mouse's home clean.Cleaning your mouse's home regularly will keep airway irritants to a minimum and will eliminate additional bacteria and viruses that could worsen the mouse's infection.The first step in cleaning your mouse's cage is to empty all bedding and supplies, such as containers for food and water. All used bedding should be thrown away and all supplies that will be put back in the cage should be cleaned and sanitized.
The second step is to clean and sanitize the cage. Clean the cage surfaces with soap and water to get all debris off. After you have gotten all the surfaces clean, rinse the cage with hot water to get the soap off.
Then wipe down or submerge the cage in a mixture of bleach and water. This mixture does not need to contain a lot of bleach. It should just be one half tablespoon of bleach to one gallon of water.

, Keep infected mice away from uninfected mice so that the infection does not spread. This infection is very contagious, so any contact can spread the disease.


Because in most cases it is impossible to completely eradicate this infection, it is a good idea to keep infected mice away from uninfected mice forever.

, Only bring mice into your home that are known to be of stock that are free of the disease. Even so, you should isolate mice that you bring into your home away from established colonies to be sure that the disease doesn't spread."

Feed the mice.,
Massage them to encourage elimination.,
Keep the mice warm.,
Treat diarrhea.,
Wean the babies.,
Provide healthy conditions.,
Handle the mice regularly.",How to Tame a Mouse1," If you find mice that have been orphaned, they’re probably in desperate need of food. Try to get them fed as quickly as possible. They’ll need to be fed liquid nutrients with droppers, since they’re still very young and would normally be nursing. By feeding them as babies, you're getting them to think of you as a mother, which is key to taming them from a young age.Feed baby mice every two hours. This can become tiresome, but it’s what’s necessary to keep them alive until they’re weaned.
If there’s another nursing mother nearby, they should be nursed by her. Mice are good mothers and will nurse babies that aren’t their own.
Assuming there’s not a nursing mother nearby, the best things you can give the babies are goat milk or kitten formula. Do not try to feed them cow milk, as it’s very hard to digest.;
, Baby mice will not automatically urinate or defecate. They need to be physically encouraged to do so. Rub gently on their abdomens and their genitals to induce urination after eating. This is another way to gain their trust and develop their dependence on you, making them tame.The best way to do this is with a warm, damp washcloth.
Do this each time the mice feed until you notice that they urinate on their own after eating.

, Normally, baby mice would be kept warm by their mother’s body heat. You need to simulate this as best you can. Create a nest for them that is between 75°F (24°C) and 90°F (32°C).The mice must be kept warm at all times.
A good option is a plastic critter carrier lined with a towel. Then, place either a hot water bottle or an electric heating pad (set on the lowest setting) under the towel.

, Diarrhea is a common problem for baby mice and can be serious. The baby mice can become dehydrated and die. Luckily, you can treat diarrhea in mice with over the counter treatments that are suitable for humans. When you care for your baby mice in this way, they continue to have positive associations with you as their keeper.Pedialyte is excellent for helping baby mice stay hydrated and recover from diarrhea. Feed it to the babies with a dropper.
If the baby is big enough (weighing at least 15 grams) you can give it a tiny dosage of pepto bismol up to three times per day.

, Once the babies are about four weeks old, you can begin to wean them. To do this, add some crushed solid food to the liquid feedings, as well as some simple fruit for them to chew on. Now the mice will be less dependent on you for feeding, but they should also be fairly tame from the bottle feeding up to this point.Rodent blocks are available at pet stores and can be crushed up and put inside a dropper.
Place a slice of apple or a peeled grape near the babies so that they can practice chewing and eating solid food.

, Dirty cages and coats can cause health problems. If your mice don't like their conditions, they will be less good as pets. Keep your mice healthy by making sure they have everything they need. This includes:Fresh water always available via a bottle
Removing leftover, uneaten food from the cage each time you feed the babies
Cleaning up any messes they make, as well as feces in the cage

, These mice will have essentially imprinted on you, since you’ve raised them since they were babies. They will have the impression that you’re their mother. Continue to handle them regularly and they will be wonderful pets.Some people even let their mice sit on their shoulders while they go for a walk or a bike ride!

Spend time with your mouse.,
Hand-feed the mouse.,
Pick up the mouse.,
Hold the mouse for increasing periods of time.",How to Tame a Mouse2," While your mouse is in the cage, spend time talking to it, feeding it, and giving it fresh water. These things will give the mouse positive associations with your presence. This is important because you’re so big that you can easily be seen as a threat.Get down to the same level as your mouse’s cage. That way, the mouse won’t always see you as a giant towering over it.

, Mice love treats. Feeding the mouse treats from your hand will give it more positive associations with you. However, you want to be careful not to get bitten, and not to encourage biting in the future.Put a treat in the palm of your hand and lower your hand into the cage slowly.
The treat can be a piece of fruit or a rodent treat from the pet store.
Wait for the mouse to approach you. Let it take the treat. This will teach the mouse to consistently approach you and that your hand is safe.

, Once the mouse is used to your hand coming into the cage, and it doesn’t see you as a threat, pick it up. You can just gently scoop the mouse into your hand. If this is difficult, you can grab the mouse gently from the base of his tail and then quickly put him into your other hand.If you’re going to use the tail to pick up your mouse, do so by the very base, and only do so for a moment. It can be quite painful for a mouse to be held or dangled by its tail.

, While you hold the mouse, speak to it gently, and try to make sure the experience is pleasant and not stressful. Do this everyday, spending more and more time with your mouse until it’s very comfortable with you.Always try to end the holding session on a positive note. For example, if the mouse urinates on you, or bites you, and you immediately put it back in its cage, it will learn that those behaviors will get it to go home.
Instead, aim to put the mouse back after a desired behavior, such as approaching food in your hand, or remaining still for a long moment.

"
"
Keep the mouse in a cage.,
Get the mouse’s attention with treats.,
Handle the mouse with gloves on.,
Remove the gloves.",How to Tame a Mouse3," In order to tame a wild mouse, you’ll need to catch it first. There are many ways to catch mice. You want to make sure that you catch the mouse in a way that won’t hurt it or scare it too much if possible.You can buy mouse traps that will simply catch the mouse without causing it any kind of injury.
Once you’ve caught the mouse, an aquarium or small rodent cage will do. Make sure the mouse has comfortable bedding, fun toys or furniture to play on, and a water bottle.

, Some people call this “bribing” the mouse. However, all you’re really doing is letting the mouse know that you’re not a threat, and in fact, have positive things to offer.Put your hand (with a treat on it) into the cage. Let the mouse approach and come onto your hand to get the treat.

, Cloth gardener’s gloves work well for this. Gently scoop up the mouse out of the cage. Handle it for a few minutes, and let the mouse crawl on you. Then, put the mouse gently back in its cage.Give the mouse treats while it crawls on you. This will give it positive associations with you.
Do this as often as you and the mouse have the patience for. The more you practice, the quicker you’ll tame your mouse.

, After a week or two, try taking the gloves off when you handle the mouse. Do this gently. If the mouse seems afraid or bites you, you can put the gloves back on and try again.Continue practicing and picking up the mouse without gloves until it’s easy and the mouse feels comfortable.

",How to Take the Stress out of Bathing Your Pet Rat," Make sure you have plenty of towels and rat treats on hand.;
, If you don't know how much that is, just guess. It doesn't have to be perfect, just enough that the rat can be standing (at least while on two legs) but still in the water.

, For perfect room temperature, just let it sit for awhile.

, A rolled up towel or a wooden block works nicely. This step is important because you need your ratty to feel like they can get out of the water without getting out of the tub.

,,,, Eventually, your rats should enjoy fishing and splashing about, and also bathe themselves!

Place cages 4-6 inches apart.,
The day before cage-cleaning, switch bedding, toys, hammocks, tunnels and beds between the cages.,
On cage-cleaning day, before cleaning cages, switch the rats between the two cages.,
Introduce the rats in a neutral territory with a clean towel on the bottom.,
Place the rats in the cage you intend to house them in.",How to Introduce Pet Rats1,"


This allows the rats to see, smell and interact with each other without the opportunity to grab the other.
Be prepared for initial aggression and fear, this includes puffing up, swinging tails, hissing, and squealing.  These interactions will become less over the hours or days.
When both rats are simply mildly curious about the other, or completely uninterested, move to the next step.;
,


Fabric bedding is the easiest to switch between cages, but if you use aspen bedding simply switch the toys, hammocks, tunnels, beds and hidey-boxes.
This allows the rats to get accustomed to the other's smell.

,


Do not place either rat in the cage with the other, as the resident rat may get territorial and attack the other.
Give the rats at least 30 minutes to explore the other's cage and get a good smell.

,


A bathtub, bed, sofa, table, counter or other contained area the rats cannot escape from is recommended.
Avoid introducing the rats in the playpen as the resident rat may become territorial.
Place the new rat down first before placing the resident rat down to avoid anyone becoming territorial.
The rats will have to establish a hierarchy.  Be prepared for small scuffles, squeaking, grabbing by the ears or nape of the neck, one rat rolling the other on its back, ""power-grooming"", and much sniffing.  Let this happen, they will work it out quickly.
Separate the rats if one draws blood, drags the other around, makes the other scream or instigates several scuffles.  Spray the aggressor with a water bottle when they attack and go back to step 1.

,


Make sure the cage is clean and the toys, bedding, hammocks, tunnels and hidey-holes and clean and rearranged.  This makes for a more neutral territory.
Be prepared for more hierarchical scuffling, this should resolve quickly, within a day or so.
If there are any actual fights and blood is drawn, separate the rats and wait a week before introducing them as per step 4.

Follow steps 1-3 in Introducing one rat to one rat.,
Choose a neutral territory for introductions


A bathtub, bed, counter, table or sofa makes a good area as long as the rats cannot escape.,
Introduce resident rats to the new rat one at a time.,
Place the new rat, followed by the resident rats (one at a time) in the cage you intend to house them in.",How to Introduce Pet Rats2,"


Place cages 4-6 inches apart for a week.
Switch bedding between cages.
Switch cages.

,
Choose somewhere your resident rats do not normally go. Otherwise they may get territorial.
Place a towel or blanket down for protection.

,


This allows the rats to become friends with the new rat one-to-one without the risk of the resident rats ganging up on the new rat.
Start with the least dominant resident rat.
Be prepared for small scuffles and dominance acts initially.  These include ""power-gooming"", grabbing the nape of the neck or ears, rolling the other rat onto its back.
Separate the rats if one makes the other scream (squeaking is fine), draws blood, or is excessively dominant for a long period of time.
When one rat is introduced, hierarchy has been established and both rats are playing or uninterested in each other, take the resident rat out and introduce another resident rat.

,


Make sue the cage, bedding, toys, tunnels, hammocks and hidey-holes are clean, this will prevent territorial acts.
Be prepared for more establishing of the hierarchy, but if any rats show true aggression, or more than one rat is ganging up on the new rat, separate them and go back to step 1
Be prepared for dominance acts the first couple days.  If it goes on for a week or one or more rats are picking on the newcomer, separate the rats and return to step 1.

Follow steps 1-3 for introducing one rat to one rat


Never attempt introductions with rats that are younger than 6 weeks, they should be with their mother still and cannot properly defend themselves.,
Choose a neutral area to make introductions.,
Place the baby in the cage you intend to house both rats in.",How to Introduce Pet Rats3,"
Place the cages 4-6 inches apart.
Day before cage-cleaning switch bedding between cages.
Switch cages.

,


A bathtub, bed, sofa, table or counter makes a good area, as long as neither rat can escape.
Place the baby down first followed by the adult rat.
You must supervise more carefully than when introducing adult rats as the adult rat can easily and quickly injure or kill the baby if not supervised.
Separate the rats if the adult makes the baby squeak repeatedly, drags the baby around by the ears or nape of the neck, or draws any blood.  Sometimes the adult rat thinks of the baby as a toy rather than another rat.  Go back to step 1 and stay there until the baby is large enough to  defend itself.
You may have to repeat this step several times.

,


Place the adult rat in there next and allow them to explore the cage together.
Make sure the cage, bedding, toys, hammocks, tunnels and hidey-holes are all clean so that there is no territorial acting out.
Be prepared for some more establishment of the hierarchy, however separate the rats and go back to step 2 if the older rat is dragging the baby around of being excessively dominant and making the baby squeak, as this can traumatize the baby.

Follow steps 1-3 for introducing one rat to one rat.,
Choose a neutral area to introduce the males, somewhere neither one is accustomed to being.,
Place the males in the cage you intend to house them in.",How to Introduce Pet Rats4," Proceed through these steps over a month versus a week or two due to the aggressive nature of intact males towards other intact males.


Place the cages 4-6 inches apart.  Be prepared for hissing, pissing, puffed fur, swinging tails and attempts to grab at each other through the cage bars.  This may last several days or weeks.
Day before cage-cleaning day switch bedding.  Do this several times over the month to allow them to get used to the other's smell.
Switch cages. Do this whenever you clean cages (before you clean them).

,


A bathtub, sofa, table, counter or bed are all good areas as long as no rat can escape from it.
Place the new male down first to prevent the resident male from becoming territorial.
Scuffles will ensue, it is important to let them establish their hierarchy, do not separate them unless blood is drawn.
If they do not work it out within 30 min, separate them and try introducing them again in a week.  You may have to do this multiple times.

,


Make sure the cage, the bedding, all the toys, hammocks, hidey-holes and tunnels are clean to prevent any territorial acts.
Expect some more hierarchical squabbling.  Do not separate them unless blood is drawn or the squabbling is continuous for 30 minutes
Do not worry about squabbling the first couple days as long as it is not continuous.  If fighting continues after a week, separate them & begin from step one.

, Once your rat is comfortable in the water, hold them firmly with one hand to keep them steady. Use your other hand to scoop up the water and run it over your rat’s back, neck and belly.Avoid getting any water directly in their ears or eyes.

, Once your rat is sufficiently wet, squirt a small amount of shampoo on your rat's back. Use your free hand to scrub the shampoo across your rat’s back and belly. Use your nails to gently scrub the shampoo into their fur and remove any stains.You will want to use very gentle and natural shampoo on your rat.
Shampoos designed for kittens and puppies will work as long as they do not contain any flea medications or other additional chemicals.
One great option for shampoo is a gentle and natural baby shampoo, as it will have very limited ingredients in it.
Another great option for shampoo is pure castile (vegetable-based) soap.

, In order to avoid getting water and soap in your rat’s eyes and ears, use the tips of your fingers to wipe water around their face gently. This will help clean their nose and mouth., Use your fingers to gently wipe your rat’s tail from base to tip. Go in the direction of the scales, not against them. Don’t scrub the tail, just wipe.Because your rat is always dragging its tail behind it, the tail can get dirty before the rest of your rat. If your rat doesn’t need a complete bath, you can just use a damp cloth to clean the tail., Once you’re finished shampooing your rat, empty the dirty water from the sink. Refill the sink with clean, warm water — the same temperature as before., Use the clean bath water to completely rinse all shampoo from your rat’s fur and skin. As an alternative, you can rinse off your rat using running water instead of refilling the sink — if your rat is comfortable with the loud noise., Wrap a clean towel completely around your rat. Gently massage your rat all over to remove any excess water and start the fur drying.You won’t need to get your rat completely dry before placing it back in its cage. Once your rat is fairly dry, it will finish the process on its own.
If your rat isn’t scared of the noise, you can also use a blow dryer on a low heat setting to dry your rat.You might also consider brushing your rat’s fur while it is drying, if they enjoy the extra attention.

, Put the stopper in your sink and fill it with comfortably warm water. You only need about an inch of water in the sink., Squirt a small amount of pure castile soap, of any fragrance, on a washcloth. Soak that washcloth in the warm water until it’s completely wet, then wring it out., Unfold the washcloth and place it on your rat like a blanket. Hold your rat steady with one hand and use your other hand to gently massage your rat all over. Your hand should be on top of the washcloth while you massage your rat.Adjust the location of the washcloth to ensure you get your rat’s belly and legs.

, Rinse all the pure castile soap off the washcloth under warm water. Wring out the washcloth once it’s rinsed. Use the same process to massage your rat a second time with the rinsed washcloth., One of the worst smells a rat can generate is from urine that’s been left sitting somewhere too long (e.g. a blanket, bottom of the cage, etc.). In order to ensure this smell doesn’t start, wipe the surfaces of your rat’s cage on a daily basis (e.g. bars, floors, ramps, etc.).This daily cleaning can easily be done with baby wipes or even a damp cloth. Nothing fancy or in-depth is required.

, Most rat cages will contain several fabric-based items, like blankets and hammocks, for your rat to rest and relax. Inspect and smell your rat’s fabric items on a daily basis (or every two days) to make sure they still smell fresh. If they smell bad, or are starting to smell bad, replace them with clean items., Depending on how you have your rat’s cage setup, you may have both bedding (for the bottom of the cage) and litter (for the actual litter box). Both of these items should be replaced on a weekly basis to reduce and eliminate bad odours.Depending on the type of litter and bedding you use, you can either sweep it out of the cage with a small broom and dust pan, or you can use a vacuum.
Once the old bedding and litter have been removed from the cage, you should wipe the cage floor and litter box before putting in new litter and bedding.
In general you do not need to scoop your rat’s litter on a daily basis (like you would a cat’s), but if you find your rat is using the litter box excessively, you may want to scoop in-between weekly litter replacements.

, Chances are your rat isn’t going to always keep their dirty litter and bedding and poop inside the cage. Therefore it is a good idea to wipe the areas around the outside of your rat’s cage regularly to remove stains and smells.One tip for cleaning the area around the outside of the cage is to use a mixture of water and vinegar and a clean cloth.
Don’t forget to clean the outside surfaces of the cage, the floor under the cage, and the walls around the cage.

, At least once a month, completely take apart your rat’s cage and clean every square inch of it carefully. You may find it easier to do this monthly cleaning in your bathtub or laundry sink.This type of cleaning requires slightly more heavy duty cleaner, like diluted bleach. But if you use bleach, make sure the cage pieces are completely rinsed before putting your rat back inside.

, While you have your rat’s cage in pieces to clean it, take any smaller plastic or metal pieces and soak them in a bucket of diluted bleach. This might include shelves or toys.Remember to completely rinse and dry these items off before putting them back in the cage.

, Chances are you will have more than one of each fabric item you use (e.g. hammock, blanket, etc.) so you can replace these items and put the dirty ones aside until you have enough for a laundry load. Once you have a load, you can wash the items with pure castile soap, or with a gentle/mild laundry detergent.It probably doesn’t matter if you use the dryer or hang the items to air dry, just don’t use fabric softener or dryer sheets.

Let it play in the dirt.",How to Bond With Your Pet Rat," You will need a cage that provides at least two cubic feet of space per rat. While this is a good rule of thumb for most rats, there are some situations where rats will require more space. For instance, if you have a larger rat or multiple rats that are sensitive about sharing elbow room, such as many intact male rats, you may want a larger cage.Keep in mind that your rat is going to spend the majority of their life in their cage so giving them a spacious environment will help keep them happier when you are not able to take them out for play.;
, You should be cleaning your rat’s cage at least once a day. For your daily routine, scoop out any visible excrement and wipe down plastic or metal parts of the cage with a baby wipe or wet paper towel.Use rat litter or woodchips to line the bottom of the cage. Completely empty out and replace the litter at least once a week.
You should do a thorough cleaning at least once a month that includes wiping down all metal and plastic parts of the cage, the water bottles, and replacing any cloth bedding.
Empty water bottles and refill with fresh water at least every other day. Remove any food that is not eaten. It will rot and attract bacteria.
Keep your rat in a travel carrier while you’re cleaning out the cage.

, Water should be readily available at all times as rats can easily dehydrate. The common staple foods for rats are milled pellets, seeds and ground nuts. You can find theses at any pet supply store.Start by feeding your rat one table spoon of these foods twice per day. Once it gets used to food being readily available, it will learn that it doesn’t need to overeat and you can leave a small bowl of food in there at all times.

, Rats can eat a wide variety of meats, fruits and vegetables. Try to mix in a few more wholesome foods along with the typical rat food you buy at the pet store. You can add in these foods as often as you’d like and should include roughage vegetables at least once a week.Strawberries, grapes, apples, blueberries, leafy greens, squash, cucumber, potatoes and sprouts are all excellent options for adding some variety to your rat’s diet.
Meats like chicken, beef, tuna and liver are also great for rats. Make sure you mash them up a bit before serving so they’re easier to digest.

, Despite the stereotype, rats should not eat cheese as most rats are lactose intolerant. You should also avoid dried corn, oranges, licorice, red cabbage, rhubarb and human junk foods like potato chips and candy. All of these can be toxic for your rat., Like dogs and cats, rats are much easier to socialize when they’re younger. If you have your choice, pick one that is under 6 months old. After this age, they begin to develop their social behavior and if they live in the wild or without much human contact, that is what they’ll be used to.Older rats can be socialized with the same methods but you’ll need to be more patient as it will take them longer to trust you., Rats will come to trust your hands if they associate them with food. Start by hold the food with your fingertips.


After you’ve fed it from your fingertips a few times, hold the food in the palm of your hand and let the rat sit in your hand as you eat. Eventually, it’ll instinctively walk onto your hand anytime you hold it out., Rats, much like dogs, have the ability to differentiate voice patterns. Try to repeatedly say its name softly over time. It may learn to remember its name and come to you when you say it.Because a rat’s eardrums are so small, it won’t be able to differentiate sounds that are too loud. Try whispering with your mouth close to its ear.

, Never squeeze your rat and avoid restraining it for more than a few seconds at a time. Keep your hands open and let the rat move around at will. By spending time in your hands, your rat will get used to your scent and bond with you.Pick up your rat by placing your hand under its belly. Try to use two hands when picking it up.
Once it’s used to being held, try to simply hold your hand out and let the rat come to you.

, Rats are known for their ability to take logical approaches to solving mazes. This is a great way to exercise your rat’s mental ability. You can make mazes and obstacle courses out of cardboard boxes or toilet paper tubes taped together.Rats are climbers so try to stack the boxes up. Make sure the climbing structures are sturdy enough to not to collapse under your rats' weight.
If you are feeling ambitious, try creating obstacle features like hoops, see-saws, ramps, weaving poles and tunnels.
Use treats or moving objects to lead it through the maze.
Rats will instinctively chase something that moves quickly pulling a string or rolling a small bouncy ball will also work.

, Try tearing some paper into strips and giving your rat one piece at a time. It will grab the paper, stash it away and return for more. This will build trust by teaching your rat that you have and want to share treasures it enjoys.

, If you hide behind something, your rat might come looking for you and get excited when it finds you. It’s best to do this after you’ve hand-tamed your rat so it knows your scent and can try to follow it.Make sure you’re not too far away or it might get lost.

, Get a shallow container and fill it with no more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water. Put some sweet peas in the water. You can use a lot of peas or just a few, as long as the peas have enough room to float around. Your rat will instinctively fish for the peas with its mouth as if bobbing for apples.If the peas are frozen, let them thaw before placing them in the water. If you’re going to microwave them, make sure they have time to cool down before placing them in the water.

, Rats like to play in the dirt and will dig in your house plants if they find them. Give them a digging box full of sterile soil that will allow them to dig and forage without ruining your plants or eating a poisonous fertilizer.Put a large towel or outdoor tablecloth on a flat surface underneath the box.
You can use a shoe box or anything of similar size. Add soil to the box and bury treats or toys into the dirt.

If you were lucky enough to find a good breeder, you will have rats that were well handled since birth.,
Give your rats one treat every time you come up to see them in their cage.,
Now start making your rats come to the door in order to get the treat.,
Play and bond.",How to Tame a Rat1," (You can also find well handled rats that have been abandoned at many of your local shelters.) Bonding with these rats is easy and can happen in the first couple days. They should take treats straight from your hand the first day and be very easy to handle (although keep in mind that young rats and female rats are usually somewhat wiggly even when they've been socialized). If your rat isn't well-socialized, go to one of the sections below first, and come back to these steps when appropriate.;
, Cheerios work well for this. However, never feed them through the bars of the cage as this encourages biting. Open their cage door, announce that you are there, and make sure they are aware of you so that you don't startle them, shake the treat container so that they associate that noise with getting a treat, then give them the treat. Doing this will teach them to look forward to your visits, because it means treats for them! Say each of your rats' names as you give each of them their treat, and it will teach them to know their names, (in fact tell your rats their names as often as you can.) Do this for a week. If a rat does nip you, let out a squeak or several squeaks. Keep your squeaks at the tone and pitch to what you imagine an irritated rat to sound like. Don't scream out a squeak, that will cross over the line of rat-rat communications, into human-traumatizing-rat-with-fright. You are not trying to seriously frighten your rat with yelling, just let the rat know s/he needs to be careful. Rats do not want to hurt their humans, so they want to learn, and will learn to be careful.

, This will teach your rats to come to the door when you want them to, so you don't have to chase them down in the cage. Shake the treat container to encourage them to come to the door. If they don't come to the door, hold the Cheerio in front of their nose and tempt them to the door with the Cheerio.

, When the rats come to the door, scoop one or more of them up and take them to a designated, rat-proof play area where they can run around and explore new things.


How to Build a Safe Playground for Your Pet Rats
To teach your rats to come to you and let you put them away when they are done playing, you want to do the following. Shake the treat container, which they should associate to getting treats, and when they come to you, pick them up, then give them a treat while your holding them, then quickly set them back down. Do this two or three times while they are out. Then the final time when you pick them up and give them a treat, put them back in their cage. If you were to put them away on the first try, the rats would quickly learn that coming for a treat means they get put away in the cage, and they would stop coming. By doing it randomly, multiple times throughout the playtime, they can't predict when they would be put away. And if you didn't pick the rat up before giving him the treat, he would zoom away with the treat before you could grab him.
If you wanted to, instead of shaking the treat can as a marker, you could say the rats name and the word ""come"" or ""come here"" as a marker to get your rats to come to you. Whatever you choose, be consistent.

Semi-socialized rats have been somewhat handled in their lives, but are skittish and wary of people.,
Teach the rat to take a treat from your hand.,
Follow the steps given above for well-socialized rats, but when it comes to play time, spend time with your rats in a way that forces them to be close to you.",How to Tame a Rat2," You can still handle and manage to hold these rats, but they are obviously scared of you and need some extra work to bond with. Many pet store rats fall into this category.

, A semi-socialized rat will usually not take a treat from your hand right away, so the first thing you need to teach them is this.


Pick a tasty treat like Cheerios and put some in the cage for several days, so your rats can become addicted to them. If it's been a couple days and they aren't eating the selected treats, try another type of dry cereal until you find treats they will like.
When they start eating them readily, stop putting the treats in their cage and start only offering them by hand. Never feed them through the cage bars as this encourages biting. From now on they can only have a treat if they will take it from your hand. (Be sure to use the same treats you first got them addicted to.) Eventually they will take the treat from your hand and that is a big step in the bonding process.

, It will take some time for a semi-socialized rat to bond with you. The more time you spend with them, the faster they will bond with you. A living room chair can be a good place to do this.


Throw an old blanket over the chair to protect it from poop/pee. Eventually your rats will learn to ""hold it"" when they are out with you and will stop pooping and peeing, as long as you take them back to their enclosure for bathroom breaks when needed.
Take the rats from their enclosure, and sit with them in the chair. At first the rats will wander around the chair exploring it, and they will probably do so for the first several days. (Don't worry about them jumping off the chair. Rats have poor vision. As long as you don't show them how to get down or let them climb up onto it from the floor, they should not know how to leave the chair.)
Show your rats that they can climb under your shirt. They will feel safer there. Rats are more comfortable in dark places. (To keep yourself from getting scratched up, wear two shirts and lead the rats in between the two shirts to protect your skin. If you don't want them in your shirt, try throwing a blanket over yourself and let them crawl under that.)
This close contact to you, being exposed to your smells, and forced to be directly on you will greatly help your rats get over their fear of you. Eventually when you take them out they will crawl straight in your shirt and go to sleep. After awhile you can start handling them more by putting your hand under the shirt with them and petting them.
The couch can also be a good location for bonding but doesn't have as much intimacy as the chair brings. The important part is that you choose a small space to bond with them so that your rats have no other choice but to interact with you. If you have no other place to use, you could lay in your bathtub with your rats. Lay a blanket down under you and maybe throw a blanket over you, or again, just let your rats get into your shirt. It's not the most comfortable place to be, but it forces that intimacy needed for them to get over their fear of you.

"
"
Unsocialized rats are absolutely terrified of people and are usually very difficult to hold or even touch.,
Get your rats hooked on a treat, and teach them to take it from your hand, as directed above for semi-socialized rats.,
Start making them come to the door of the cage in order to get a treat.,
Lure them out of the cage.,
Once your rats have reached a certain comfort level with you (skittish yet exploring you freely and willing to eat out of your lap), you should start interacting with them.",How to Tame a Rat3," They might scream in fear as you try to touch them. These rats are not for beginners and take a ton of patience and experience to socialize. Feeder bin rats are frequently unsocialized along with some pet store rats.

, Here are some additional considerations for unsocialized rats:


If you have tried for a long time and the rats still won't take the treat from your hand, you can try delaying a regular meal and waiting until the rat is somewhat hungry. . Don't withhold food for a long period as you can stress rats to an extreme. Rats may also become irritable which will work against you in your effort to encourage them to trust you. (Absolutely never withhold food from youngsters/babies, as their systems are too fragile.) With this, hopefully the rats will be guided to take the treat from your hand.
Also frequently offer up your empty hand for them to sniff and explore, so that they don't assume you have a treat every time you put your hand in the cage, as they might start biting at your hand assuming it's food.
Hopefully you will eventually get your rats to take a treat from your hand, and when that happens celebrate big time as it's a huge step forward in the bonding process. Visit their cage often and every time you visit, give them a treat or two, talking softly to them, letting them know that when you visit, it's a good thing.

, Again, this might take awhile. Only give them the treat if they come to the door. They get no other treats. Use a marker to signal them, such as saying ""come"" or shake the treat container. This will teach them to come to you when you call them. Say each of your rats' names as you give each of them their treat, and it will teach them to know their names.

, Unsocialized rats need to learn that the world outside their cage is not the dangerous, scary place they think it is.


When your rats start coming to the door for a treat readily, switch from treats to baby food. Use the lid of a milk cap or other container and fill it with yummy squash or something similar. Get them hooked on it like you did with the treats. First offer it to them where ever they are in the cage, then start making them come to the door for it. The baby food forces the rats to sit next to your hand in order to eat it, as they can't take it and run off and hide.
Rat proof your chosen bonding location, a safe place where you can start teaching your rats to come out of their cage. The bathroom is good because it is small and enclosed, leaving it safe for a rat if they panic because they can't go anywhere and hurt themselves or get lost. You will want to bring your rats, in their enclosure (or in a travel cage), to this location for at least a half hour to an hour everyday, if not more. There is no such thing as spending too much time with your rats.
Throw one or two old blankets on the floor. A blanket is an excellent tool when used in the bonding process. Rats feel more comfortable and are more confident when they are concealed. They will love to be able to burrow into the blanket when they start exploring the room. Your rats will also be more willing to crawl on you, hidden under the blanket, so drape the blanket over your legs and lap to help encourage your rats to explore you.
Bring your rats, still in their enclosure (or in a travel cage), into the bathroom and shut the door. Try to have only a night light illuminating the room. Rats are more comfortable in the dark. By putting your rats in a calm, quiet, dark small room with you, and being calm and non-intrusive to them, you are showing your rats that you are not a threat, and that being with you can be a happy experience. Your eventual goal is for the rats to come out and explore the room and eventually you, however let everything be on your rats terms at first. Let them feel that they have total control of the situation. Do not force them out of the cage. The following steps could all happen in one day, or it might take many, many months. Be patient. Only move your rats to the next step when they are ready.
Set your rats' cage on one side of the room, open the cage door, and place some treats on the floor of their cage, making sure your rats see you do this, and then go sit at the opposite side of the room. You've moved them to a new place so for the first several days they might be too scared to eat the treats. Give them time.
Once your rats will eat the treats with you in the room, try it again, only this time sit halfway between the cage and the other side of the room.
Once your rats are willing to eat the treats with you halfway away, try it again, only this time sit right next to the cage.
Once your rats will comfortably eat treats with you sitting right next to the cage, open the cage door, put your hand in the cage, and offer your rats some treats from your hand. Try to get them to eat the treats just outside their cage if you can. Hopefully by now they have grown comfortable with the new room.
Once your rats will steal treats from your hand and eat them, trade the treats for some squash baby food to force your rats to stay by your hand and eat the food there.
Once your rats will eat the squash from your hand freely, make it so that they have to come to the entrance of the cage to get the squash.
Once your rats will come to the entrance of the cage for squash, make it so that they have to take a step outside the cage for squash.
Keep doing this, moving the squash further and further away from the cage until you can sit on the opposite side of the room from the cage and get your rats to come from the cage onto your lap to eat the squash.
If at any time the rats just decide to come out and explore the room during this process, let them do so freely. Do not make movements towards them, or try to stop them. Just sit there calmly with the squash in hand and let them explore. If they come to you and eat the treat, let them. If they start crawling on you, let them do so freely without making any motions towards them. You want to make yourself completely non-threatening.
Let your rats return to their cage as often as they like. Remember that the cage is their safety zone. You want your rats to feel safe and in control. Eventually your rats will become brave enough to come and explore just what and who you are. Don't interfere, even if they crawl all over you. Just stay still and let them get use to your smell.
Remember to visit your rats in their home throughout the day as well. Talk to them and open the door and put your hand in the cage for them to sniff, maybe even giving them a quick pat on the head. You want them to be exposed to you as much as possible. Make sure they are awake and know you are there before touching them. Only offer your rats treats now when they are in the bonding area though.

,


Start with brief pets, then move to briefly picking them up and putting them down, then finally to holding them and petting them.
At first, your rats probably won't like being picked up or petted. This is natural as they are not use to it. You will need to gently force this ""love"" on them in short frequent intervals to show them that this can be a safe and wonderful experience. Offer them a treat every time you pick them up or pet them as a reward.
If your rats won't let you pick them up, you will have to pick your moment and corner them to do so. However corner them as calmly and as gently as you can. You don't want to show them that being picked up is a scary experience. Again, once you have them in your hand, offer them a quick treat and put them right back down again.
Start forcing them to endure being picked up and petted for longer and longer intervals as time goes by. They will not like it but you have to put them through it so they can get use to it. Some struggling is okay and expected, however if the rat is just freaking out and crying, move back a step to quicker interactions.

The methods above involve forcing the rats to be close to you, in hopes that they will eventually feel safe and curious.,
Set up your rat's cage so that you can easily grab him.,
Once your rat's cage is set up, pick a time each day and take your rat out.,
Do this 20 minute ritual everyday for a couple weeks.",How to Tame a Rat4," Another method is to force the rats to be on you until they are no longer scared. You can do this in addition to or instead of the bonding methods described previously.

, He should still have a sleeping den of some kind, just make sure that there is nowhere in the cage where you can't grab him. You want the rat to think that no matter what he does, he can't get away from you.

, The best time to take him out is during the middle of the day when he is most tired. Take your rat out and hold him for 20 minutes. Be sure to time it, because it's important that you do it for at least 20 minutes. You don't have to squeeze your rat, not letting him move. Feel free to let him run through your hands or even go up to your shoulder. The only rule is, is that the rat must stay on you, your body, and be touched and handled by you for 20 minutes. This could be on your shoulder, in your lap, in your shirt, as long as the rat remains on your body. In the beginning your rat will probably squeak and struggle to get away from you. Don't let him. If you're afraid that your rat might bite you, you could use a towel to pick him up.

, The theory is that a rat can only stay scared of you for so long and by dominating him like this, but not hurting him, he will come to accept you.

"
"
When you bring your new rat home, don't have it in the same room as your other rat until you're sure it won't pass on any diseases.,
When you're ready, place the new rat's cage in the same room as your other rat's cage, but about three feet away.,
For the next week, care for the rats separately.",How to Introduce a New Pet Rat to Another Rat1," Wash your hands between handling your rats. Some people choose to quarantine new rats from the others for several weeks.;
, This should get them curious about each other and used to seeing and smelling each other. It's normal for your rats to be a little agitated at first, but if they are constantly very upset and aggressive (hissing, puffing up fur, etc.), move the cage farther apart for a while before moving them closer again. DON'T ever place the cages within 6 inches of each other. The rats can reach through the bars and intentionally or accidentally harm each other.

, Don't have them out of their cages at the same time.They will smell each other on your hands and get used to each other. After they are comfortable with seeing each other through the bars, start switching things in their cages. Put a paper towel in each cage and the next day, switch the towels. Or switch their hammocks, chew sticks, or water bottles. Do this every day for a while. At least a week is ideal.

"
Don't rush things.,
Prepare the place in which your rats with meet.,
Prepare the rats.,
It's time to meet!,
You should have short meetings every day for a while, about a week.,
If they seem to be doing well after a week, you can start letting them play together in the place where your first rat usually plays, but if that doesn't go well, go back to neutral territory for a bit.",How to Introduce a New Pet Rat to Another Rat2," Don't introduce the rats if they are showing aggressive behavior. When you think they're ready, the first thing to do is find neutral territory to use. A place where neither of the rats have really been or played. They claim territory as their own and will not easily be willing to share with a new rat outside of their ""pack."" Places such as on your lap, in the bathtub (dry, of course,) or on a table may work. But neither rat should be familiar with the place you choose.

, Lay out lots of their favorite foods and treats. They will love fresh fruits and veggies, and unsalted nuts and seeds. Don't even think about feeding them chocolate. This can kill almost any animal. Make sure there are plenty of treats for both of them so they won't feel threatened. This should be fun for them and they should be starting to see each other as friends. They may not want to eat it at first. This is normal, they usually don't eat if they are in an uncomfortable situation. If they start to eat together, this is a sign that they are starting to trust each other! Before putting the rats together, make sure sure you have towels on hand to separate them with if they start to fight. You never want to stick your bare hand between two fighting animals.

, The first time they meet, use a q-tip to dab a little bit of vanilla on the tops of each rat's nose. Just a little. This will make the smell of the other rat less powerful. Or if you know for a fact that your rats like baths, and you have done it before, just bathe each one before putting them together (especially if they are males). If they haven't grown up taking baths, though, it will probably traumatize them and make them not look forward to their meetings.

, Bring both rats to the neutral area you've prepared. Let them first meet and touch noses on your lap or in your arms, but make sure you can easily separate them if you need to. If one of the rats is significantly smaller, then try rubbing it on the larger one's back before putting them down. Then put them down and let them explore/eat/groom/play for about five minutes. That should be all for the first time. Tumbling and wrestling a bit is okay. They may be playing or trying to figure out who's in charge. But if either one squeaks, or if you see blood, separate them and wait until tomorrow.

, You don't need to use vanilla unless you think they need it. But you should have treats around and a towel handy, each time. And stick to neutral territory. Keep the visits short and supervised. You can make them gradually longer, but watch out for how they're doing. If one is scared and trembling, take it in your lap or maybe shorten the time. Do this for a while and continue swapping things in their cages, too. You can move the cages closer to each other, but not close enough so that they could reach each other through the bars.

, You can let them play together longer and stop worrying about them fighting when they run out of reach. They should ideally be getting about an hour together a day. Of course, don't rush them if they're not ready. It should take one or two weeks to get to this point. But once they're like BFF's outside the cage, you're ready to put them together.

"
"
Pick the cage you are going to use.,
When the cage is ready, put it on the ground where your rats have been playing together.,
Have the cage on the ground during playtime for a while, but neither rat should be staying in it alone at any other time.,
If they're getting along well, you're ready to move them in together all the time.",How to Introduce a New Pet Rat to Another Rat3," If one of the rats was using it before, you need to make it like a completely new cage to him. Clean it out completely. Use disinfecting soap (a scent is helpful) and scorching hot water. Set it up with all new bedding and food. Everything should be either washed or new. If you had a wooden hiding hut, buy a new one. The cage should even look different. Put the litter box, shelves, and hammocks in different places. The cage should be totally new and clean, so that the rat you had in it before won't have his claim on it.

, Open the door of the cage and put them in at the same time, but leave the door open so that they can leave if they want to. One of them will probably have been showing the other rat that it's ""in charge"" by flipping the other on it's back and then letting it up. They are figuring out which one of them is the dominant rat. They might squeak little ""ah"" squeaks. But you don't need to separate them unless they are really fighting. They should be getting along well already at this point.

, It's a shared cage now. They are one pack now. In a few days you should start putting the rats together in their cage during the day, but at night have them in two separate cages. (or whenever you would best be able to monitor them and notice if there was a problem, have them together during that time.) This gets them used to living together, but they still have a break sometimes.

, Congratulations! Your rats are now best friends and living in the same cage! They should no longer feel threatened by the other rat. Make sure to give them both attention!

Make sure you have a quiet space to start.,
Place your rat in the training area.,
Move a few feet away from your rat.,
Repeat.,
Begin by not giving your rat a treat every time.,
Move to a new space.,
Call your rat's name often after the training.",How to Train a Rat to Respond to Its Name," If you decide your rat's cage is the best spot, that's fine. The best training areas are:


quiet, with no visual distractions;
already known by your rat (if you introduce a completely new space to your rat, it will be distracted by new smells, objects, and sounds);
enclosed and fairly clear (a kitchen table or (covered) pool table works well, as rats are instinctively afraid of heights, so your rat won't jump off a surface that is more than a few feet high).


Be sure that the space is large enough that you can move away from your rat, but small enough that the rat will still focus on you when you call it.





;
, Let it get adjusted to its surroundings. If you are using a cage, make sure your rat will not be able to smell nearby food or be distracted by its favorite toys.

, Holding a treat in front of you, and in a place where your rat can get to the treat, call your rat's name.


It may be necessary to move closer if your rat is not focused on you.

, Bit by bit, increase your distance until your rat has to come a fair distance to get to you and the treat.

, Start with a treat to no-treat ratio of about 5:1. Do your best not to create a pattern, such as every other time your rat comes you give it the treat. The rat will pick up on this and focus on the pattern, not learning the name sound.


Some rats adapt to not getting a treat easily. Others do not. If your rat becomes unwilling to respond to its name if it is not rewarded with food, try other rewards such as petting or scratching.

, Begin training in many different locations. This will help your rat learn that its new skill does not apply only to its training area. Another location can include its cage (if that is not its original training area).

, When your rat has learned to respond to its name, it will soon do it on command with no reward required at all."

Keep dangerous items away from your rat.",How to Shoulder Train a Pet Rat," When you first get a pet rat, give him at least a week to get used to his new surroundings (and to you). Your rat needs to feel comfortable and safe before he will respond to training; rushing into this will not produce the results you're hoping for.Sit near your rat's cage for 5 minutes at a time, several times a day and talk softly to him. This will help him get used to your presence and voice. Once he knows you are not a threat, he will be more receptive to training.
Avoid making loud sounds or sudden movements near your rat while he's adjusting to his new home.;
, Place a hand inside his cage while holding treat and let him come to you to get it. After doing this enough times, your rat will learn that he can trust you and will also associate you with positive feelings (from treats and affection). He will also become used to coming into contact with you, which is a prerequisite for shoulder training.Use a soft voice and handle/pet him gently when he approaches you.
It could take him a while to approach you at first (several minutes), but be patient. Don't give up on this because you think it's taking too long. This could teach your rat that if he waits long enough you will go away.
Once your rat is comfortable with this, hold the treat just outside his cage to get him to come out and get it.

, Ideally, you will have him take a treat from your hand every time you approach his cage for at least the first several days after beginning this process. This reinforces the association between your presence and treats and will quickly make him want to be around you.Healthy treats that rats usually love include banana chips, plain Cheerios, sunflower seeds, plain yogurt, and peas.
Be careful not to overdo it with the treats; over-feeding can lead to your rat becoming overweight, which is not good for his health.

, Clicker training is an effective way of teaching animals (including rats) to associate the sound from the clicker with a reward. The easily identifiable click signals to your rat that a treat is soon to come as a result of his behavior.The click sound must come immediately before the reward in order for your rat to learn this association; time this to occur just as he's about to take the treat.
Your rat will learn this association most quickly if you also wait for him to do something on his own, then click and reward him immediately. This teaches your rat that he is in control of this game.

, Rats can understand simple voice commands, so long as you consistently use them. This trick helps when it comes time to shoulder train because you will be able to keep him near you just by calling his name.Say your rat's name whenever you hand him a treat. After doing this for a while, hold the treat away from him a little and say his name. Eventually, he will know to come to you when he hears his name, even if you are out of sight when you call him.
Other simple verbal commands can be helpful too, such as ""no"" and ""come."" Work these in when appropriate.

, Do this an hour or so before each training session so your rat is not too full to care about treats. Place the food bowl out of sight of his cage so he is not bothered by its presence and inaccessibility.Do not deprive your rat of food otherwise! This is cruel and will not benefit training.
Do not forget to put the food bowl back in your rat's cage once you are done with the training session!

, Be gentle and speak to him as you do this, and make sure you are seated (ideally on a couch or cushioned chair) so your rat won't become injured if he jumps or falls off your shoulder. You should expect your rat to not want to sit still at first, as this will be a totally new experience for him.


Give your rat a treat as soon as you set him on your shoulder. Use your clicker as you do this (if you decide to use this training device).
Keep a hand up while your rat is on your shoulder in case he tries to jump off.

, As you do this, also use your hand to block him from being able to get away. Your verbal command should be delivered in a firm (not scary) tone. While blocking him from climbing down, maintain a gentle touch.This is only something you should do during the initial training phase. Once your rat is used to sitting on your shoulder for a while, his desire to come down could be the result of something other than nerves -- such as the need to relieve himself!
If your rat seems terrified during the first few attempts at this, don't make him put up with it for too long. A minute or two is sufficient for the first couple of tries.

, While your rat is on your shoulder, give him a treat or pets every so often to reinforce the positive association he has with being there. If you put your rat on your shoulder and simply ignore him after that, he will become bored and try to get down.


Remember to use the clicker just before giving him a treat (if you've been using it for his training already).
Depending on the kind of treat you give your rat, you should expect some mess associated with his snacking. Crumbly foods like Cheerios are likely to get on your clothes, so be prepared for this.
Don't move around too much when your rat is snacking on your shoulder. Rats often use their front paws to hold things as they eat them, so your rat will be more unstable while he's eating.

, Gradually build up the amount of time your rat spends on your shoulder and don't be surprised if he maxes out after a couple of minutes. Every rat is different; some will find your shoulder to be a comfy place to rest, while others won't like it no matter how much you try to train them to.Stay near his cage and remain quiet during your first few sessions. Eventually, you can venture further away for longer periods without your rat becoming overly distressed.
If your goal is to be able to have your rat on your shoulder even when you venture out of the house on longer trips, let him gradually become accustomed to being outdoors; this is a whole different element of training than simple shoulder-sitting.

, Physical or behavioral cues that your rat is getting ready to climb or jump off your shoulder should become recognizable after a few training sessions. Try to let him off your shoulder before he gets down by himself; this will teach him that he can trust you to let him down and will curb his urge to bail on his own.Trust is critical for any kind of training to be successful; if you keep your rat on your shoulder too long, he won't enjoy it and will feel like you are trapping him there. Don't let this happen!
Your rat should be housebroken before you begin training him to shoulder-sit. This being the case, he will likely become fidgety and nervous when he needs to relieve himself. Be sure to return him to his cage right away if you notice this behavior.

, Once he is comfortable sitting on your shoulder for a while, you can work on getting him to come up when you call him. Be sure you are sitting down and wearing clothes he can climb on before you do this so he doesn't take an accidental fall or get frustrated while trying unsuccessfully to get to your shoulder.


This is where teaching your rat to recognize his name comes in handy. If you choose, you can teach him to come to a different command, such as ""come.""
By the time your rat is this comfortable sitting on your shoulder, you should back off on the treats and mix in affectionate petting and snuggling. This will keep your rat from becoming overweight.

, Your rat will be easier to train and have ea happier life if he has easy access to his basic needs. You should always keep your rat well-fed (not over-fed) and make sure he has constant access to clean water.Give your rat high-quality foods that contain all his essential nutrients. Some companies make blended rat foods in block form, which prevent rats from picking out only the tastier (and usually less nutritious) bits in their food.
Ask your veterinarian how much/often to feed your rat based on his age and size. Remember that overfeeding can shorten your rat's life and make him lazy.

, Rats like to be clean, and they will become upset if their cage is too dirty. They also don't like their waste to be too close to their food and water, so keep these areas in separate corners of your rat's cage. Successful training depends in part on your rat's state of mind, so keep him happy about his environment in order to get the best results.Change cage bedding every 3 to 5 days (or more often if you have more than 2 rats in one cage).
Thoroughly sanitize your rat's cage once a week. This means removing all bedding, toys, and other objects and using a pet-safe cleaner to wipe down all the cage surfaces.
Don't forget to clean out and sanitize water and food dishes, too.

, Rats are very social creatures, and they can easily become lonely or bored if they do not receive enough attention. For a happy rat, it is best to get at least two so they can keep each other company.It is best to get both (or all) of your rats at the same time as juveniles so that territoriality and aggression are unlikely to become issues.
You should still pay attention to your rats frequently, even if you have several rats in one cage.
Keep your rats' cage in a place where you are frequently present and they can see what's going on around them. This will keep them from feeling isolated.

, Rats like to have things to climb on, hide in, and play with. This keeps them entertained and comfortable. Although you should expect your rat to chew on things in its cage, you shouldn't let cage accessories become so chewed up that they are falling apart. You don't want your rat to actually eat these things -- they aren't meant to be food!Your local pet store has lots of rat-specific items you can purchase for your pet's cage.
You can easily make things your rat will enjoy, such as hammocks and cardboard tunnels.
Rats like to be cozy, so be sure to include plenty of bedding material. Avoid using cedar and pine, as these materials can be toxic to rats if eaten.

, Because rats like to gnaw on things, don't let yours near anything that could harm or kill him if he does take a nibble or two. This means no plastic, wires, string, or anything else your rat could choke on or that is made of a hazardous materials.Don't forget to ""rat-proof"" the area if you have your rat roaming free outside of his cage. Mostly, this means blocking off or removing anything in the area that you don't want your rat to chew on.
Keep your rat away from fabrics that can unravel into long bits of string. If your rat swallows string, he could choke.

Always see a vet.,
If they have suffered an injury, you should probably restrict their movement for awhile.,
Give them newspaper or cloth bedding instead of the usual chips.,
Avoid wire flooring.,
Make sure food and water are easy to reach.,
Keep them clean.,
They may recover, depending on the condition.,
House them in a one-level cage.,
If housing them with other rats, watch how they get along.,
Watch for injuries or infection on their lower body or legs.,
At the first sign of any illness (weight loss, lack of appetite, sores, sneezing, runny nose, etc), bring them to a vet.",How to Take Care of a Paralyzed Rat," They can assess the rat to try to diagnose the problem. If there is a serious medical condition, it might cause other problems beside paralysis.;
, Do this by housing them in a very small enclosure, such as keeping them in their carrier instead of their regular cage. Since it's recommended you house multiple rats together, this will usually mean separating the rat from his or her cagemate temporarily. Give your paralyzed rat extra attention, and their cagemate if there's only one, so they don't get too lonely.

, The bedding needs to be soft because the rat will be dragging his or her belly on it.

, This is important for all rats, due to the risk of injury, but a paralyzed rat is at even greater risk of getting injuries to hind legs or tail. In addition, the flooring irritates the skin of their lower belly as they drag themselves around.

, You may need a bowl with lower sides for the food. Position the water bottle lower, because they can't sit on their haunches to drink.

, Change the bedding as often as needed, even if this means multiple times a day. If this is not enough, you may need to give them baths. Check if they are clean by sniffing their hindquarters - if they smell like urine, wet a washcloth and rub them gently. Be sure to dry them off completely.

, If it is an injury, healing can occur over the first few weeks. However, some other conditions cause progressive paralysis. Be prepared for complete paralysis, but keep your hopes up.

, Even if they do recover quite a bit, they will have lost agility in their hind legs. They are at greater risk of falling, and cannot jump.

, If other rats bully or trample over your paralyzed rat, they will not be able to defend themselves as easily. They should be housed separately if this occurs. Be sure to always give a single-housed rat lots of attention! If they other rats are behaving themselves, group housing is preferred - not only are rats social creatures, but friendly cage mates can help a paralyzed rat keep clean by grooming them.

, The rat may not feel any injuries, or may even start self-injuring due to lack of sensation. Sores are especially likely if the rat spends most of the time lying still in one position. Take them back to the vet if any sores develop.

, They are more prone to bladder infections and pneumonia than most rats. Early treatment is very important.

Read medication directions carefully.,
Prepare the syringe.,
Try to get the rat to take the medicine willingly.",How to Syringe Feed a Sick Rat1," If you're syringe feeding a rat medication, make sure you read the directions on the medications carefully. You want to make sure you get the dosage correct. Medications may also come with other special instructions. For example, some medication may need to be administered at room temperature.


Call your vet if you're unsure about any directions. You do not want to accidentally hurt your rat when attempting to medicate him.;
, You should prepare the syringe before disturbing your rat. If you have your rat out, it may be hard to get the syringe ready. Rats may feel nervous when being syringe fed or medicated and you will not be able to tamper with your syringe while keeping your rat calm.


If you don't have a syringe, you can purchase one at your vet's office. You may also be able to get a syringe at a drugstore or supermarket if your vet's office is closed.
If your rat is dehydrated, you can syringe feed him water, soy milk, or a rehydration product supplied by your vet. If you're using anything medical, use the instructions on the bottle. If you're using water or soy milk, use a small amount at first. See how much your rat drinks. If he seems to want more, you can refill the syringe.When using medicine, always feed your rat the amount instructed on the bottle or follow your vet's instructions.
Rinse out the syringe with warm water a few times to make sure it's clean. Then, place the tip of the syringe in the liquid you're using. Pull the plunger upward until the syringe is at the proper level. Syringes have labels on the side that allow you to measure how much is in the syringe, usually in milliliters.

, Rats may take medication, foods, or liquids administered by syringe willingly. Medications are often flavored and rats may actually enjoy the taste. You can simply allow your rat to lick the tip while slowly pressing down on the plunger. If your rat is willing to take the medication without being forced, this is the least stressful and most effective means to syringe feed him."
"
Prepare the rat for syringe feeding.,
Turn your rat towards you.,
Place the syringe in your rat's mouth.,
Feed your rat.",How to Syringe Feed a Sick Rat2," Not all rats will willingly be fed by syringe. If your rat does not take his medication on his own, you will have to force feed him. First, get your rat ready.


If your rat is very big or rambunctious, you may need to gently wrap him in a cloth or towel. You wrap your rat sort of like a burrito, pulling the cloth or rag around him firmly enough that he cannot move easily.However, as rats are small this may not be necessary. You can simply hold your rat with one hand. Pick him up with your non-dominant hand and place your thumb and forefinger around his chest, keeping these fingers under his front legs. Some people find placing their rat on their lap or chest works well. If your rat is social and enjoys climbing on you, this may help keep him calm., Once you've restrained your rat, move his right leg between your ring and pinky finger. This will prevent him from pushing the syringe away. Then, gently turn his head towards you. Position his mouth at an angle from which you can easily administer the syringe., Once your rat is restrained and turned towards you, place the syringe in his mouth. Bend it at a roughly 45 degree angle. Bending the syringe too sharp could cause your rat to gag., Slowly release the food, medication, or liquid into the rat's mouth. Go in increments, pausing on occasion to allow your rat to swallow. Go slowly, giving him enough time to swallow all the liquid. If your rat tries to spit up the liquid, you may have to gently close his mouth to prevent this.If your rat becomes very distressed, take a break. Allow him to calm down before administering more medication, food, or water. You do not want to create too much stress as this can make your rat sicker.

"
"
Follow up with water when giving medication.,
Make sure the rat is upright.,
Try mixing medication with tastier liquids.",How to Syringe Feed a Sick Rat3," If you're administering medication via syringe, follow up with 5 to 10 milliliters (0.17 to 0.34  fl oz) of water. This will help your rat's body digest his medication quicker. Your rat may also be slightly dehydrated if he was struggling or upset when being syringe fed., Never syringe feed a rat while he's lying on his back. This could lead to choking. Always make sure your rat is upright before administering medication, food, or water via a syringe., If your rat is particularly resistant to being syringe fed, consider mixing his medication with pleasant tasting liquids. Soy formula, Kool-Aid, or Sprite may taste better to a rat than his meds. However, make sure you check with your vet before mixing anything into your rat's medication. You want to make sure additives won't affect the medication."

It should also be wide enough that your rat can fit inside easily.It's best to purchase a litter box that can attach to the side of the cage. This way, the rat can't move the box around. You can buy one online or at a local pet store.If you don't want to purchase a box, you can use something like a small Tupperware container instead.;
, Observe where your rat typically goes to the bathroom. Rats usually urinate and defecate in a particular corner. Place the box near this space, as this encourages the rat to use the box.If you have multiple rats, you may find urine and droppings in multiple places in the cage. Use more than one litter box, setting each box near the places you typically find urine and droppings.

, You want a material different from the rat's regular bedding. This will signify the box is to be used for something different than day-to-day activity. At a local pet store, browse the variety of rat bedding. Choose a type of bedding you do not use in your rat's main cage. Fill the litter box with this bedding., Rats may be initially confused and standoffish about the litter box. To make sure they know what it's for, collect droppings from the cage. Put them in the litter box. The rats will smell the droppings and go towards the litter box when they need to eliminate.Make sure to wear gloves when handling rat droppings. Wash your hands afterwards.

, While you can't watch your rat all the time, observe it when you can. When you see your rat using the litter box, offer praise. You can also offer a small treat as a reward.Be as consistent as you can. Reward the rat each time you see it using the litter box.
With time, you should find less and less droppings outside the box.

, You do not want to yell at or punish a rat for eliminating outside the litter box. The rat will not understand why it's being scolded and this will only create tension. However, correct the rat gently when you see it going outside the box.Do something to distract the rat. Simply try something like clapping your hands and saying ""No"" in a firm voice.
Make sure not to raise your voice when saying ""No.""

, Your rat needs to understand there is a clear difference between its living space and its bathroom space. This way, it is less likely to eliminate outside the litter box. Make sure to clean up droppings and wet spots as soon as you see them.When first litter training your rat, spot clean the cage a few times a day. As your rat gets more used to using the litter box, you can go back to a regular cleaning schedule.

, If your rat is really struggling to learn, remind it what the litter box is for. When spot cleaning, dump some of the waste you collect into the litter. This will help your rat understand he should eliminate inside of the box., Once your rat is eliminating in the box consistently, keep it clean. Like cats, rats may stop using a dirty litter box. Once a day, dump out the litter box and put down a fresh layer of bedding., Some rat cages are very large and have multiple levels. If your rat has this kind of cage, it's unlikely to go up or down stairs when it needs to use the bathroom. Therefore, keep a litter box on each level of the cage., If you started litter training your rat when it was a baby, it will eventually grow out of its box. A litter box needs to be big enough that your rat can comfortably fit inside. As your rat grows, swap out the litter box as needed."

Use a smaller feeding dish.,
Provide fortified food.,
Limit your rat’s treats.,
Feed your rat at night.,
Wash your rat’s food bowl weekly.,
Check for specific conditions.,
Steer clear of hazardous foods.",How to Help Your Fat Rat Lose Weight1," A small ceramic (not plastic) food dish that’s only large enough to hold one feeding block will suffice. The larger the bowl, the more your rat will eat. Small bowls serve as natural portion control.Make sure your feeding bowl is sturdy so that it doesn’t tip over as your rat eats.
Your rat may chew a plastic bowl.;
, There are good quality commercial rat foods available through pet stores and veterinary offices. These foods can be found in either “block” or “seed” type forms, and a mixture of both is recommended. If you’re trying to help your rat lose weight, feed it no more than 3 tablespoons per day.Rat blocks contain a complete supply of vitamins and minerals.
Avoid the generic “rodent formula” foods available at pet stores, as these often don’t provide an adequate amount of protein for your rat.

, One tablespoon of chopped fruit or vegetable is the best treat for your rat. Including apples, strawberries, bananas, and squash as treats rather than regular part of your rat’s diet will help support its weight loss. Feed treats in a separate dish from your rats regular food and make sure to clean the treat bowl daily.Frozen peas in a dish of water is a wonderful summertime treat that your rat can enjoy year-round.
Avoid sticky foods like peanut butter as they can create a choking hazard.
Feed your rat a hard treat, like a dog biscuit, once per week to keep its teeth sharp.

, Rats are nocturnal creatures by nature, which means they’ll tend to be most active during the nighttime hours. It’s good to feed them early in the evening, when they’re most likely to be alert and awake.If you notice small stashes of food around its cage, it’s likely you’re overfeeding it and should cut back on the amount of food you’re providing.
Don’t skip your rat’s meals, or your rat may become hungry, anxious and unhappy.

, Make sure that it doesn’t get caked with old food, which can lead to diseases. Scrub old food off with a wire brush or sponge, and use plenty of soap and water. Allow the food bowl to air dry.It’s a good idea to wash out the food bowl at the same time as you clean out the rest of your rat’s cage.
Place your rat’s food bowl at an opposite end of the cage from the rat’s bathroom area.

, If your rat looks like it’s gained weight, it’s possible that it’s pregnant, particularly if you have more than one rat. The most common reason for bloated-looking abdomen in rats is pregnancy. For any medical conditions in rats, you’ll want to consult with your veterinarian.Other possible conditions that may result in increased size include:


A tumor in the abdomen. Not only can the tumor cause a bulge in the abdomen, but it can also cause fluid to accumulate in the abdomen.
Liver and kidney disease, which can cause fluid build up in the abdomen.
Megacolon is a condition of the nervous system, where the nerves to the large intestine don’t effectively allow for the colon to push out feces. As a result, the colon becomes backed up. Both the colon and the stools become larger than usual.
Urinary blockage also can result in a rat’s appearing swollen and overweight. If the bladder is blocked, then the urine can become backed up, feeling like a balloon in the center lower abdomen.

, While rats may enjoy a wide and varied diet similar to your own, there are certain foods that are hazardous to your rat. Dried corn, for example, has high levels of fungal contaminants which have been linked to liver cancer in rats.You’ll also want to limit the amount of nitrates in your rat’s diet. Nitrates are found in beets, celery, eggplant, lettuce, cucumber, radishes, spinach, collards and turnip greens.
Never give your rat any food that’s moldy or spoiled.

Provide plenty of exercise for your rat.,
Try an exercise wheel.,
Play every day with your rat.,
Make your own toys.",How to Help Your Fat Rat Lose Weight2," Rats are intelligent animals who need a great deal of mental stimulation and activity. If you’re trying to help your rat lose weight, making sure it has plenty of activities will help it stay healthy and happy.Provide tunnels, igloos, ropes, ladders, blocks, and child or baby safe toys for your rat to play with.
Wooden gnawing blocks make great chew toys. You can also offer rawhide chew sticks or hard dog biscuits.
Old soup bones or chicken bones are fine for a rat to chew on.

, Your rat might enjoy running on an exercise wheel, which is the rodent-version of a treadmill. Make sure the wheel you find is large enough for your rat, and solid (or with very small mesh) to protect the rats’ feet and to avoid a rat tail being caught and damaged.Never get a metal wheel with rungs or a crossbar which could get your rat’s tail tangled in it.
Not all rats will enjoy running on an exercise wheel, and some may use it only for napping. However, for those rats who do enjoy it, an exercise wheel can be a great way to run off excess energy.

, The best thing you can do for your rat is to make sure it has plenty of social interaction with you and your family. Rats are very social, and will get bored and unhappy if left too often alone.Take your rat out of his cage for at least an hour every day, snuggling and petting him.
It’s a good idea to keep him within one room at a time, with the door closed, so that he can safely explore the whole room.

, Your rat will be happy to play with any number of homemade toys. Give him paper towel tubes or PVC pipes to run through. He’ll likely enjoy toys designed for birds, such as ladders, swings or anything he can gnaw on.Find a branch from a fruit tree, and place it inside his cage. This will give him something he can climb on and something he can chew on.
Keeping plenty of toys and activities around for your rat will keep him engaged and interested, and ultimately more healthy and happy.

If there is no immediate urgency for you to determine the sex, wait for a few weeks before handling them.At two weeks of age, the kittens will open their eyes and can start eating solid food.;
, When the kittens are about two weeks old, gently lift them out of the cage and place them on their backs in the palm of one of your hands. Identify the anus (under the tail) and urethra (small opening a little further up towards the belly).The distance between these two body parts (‘anogenital distance’) will be 1.5 to 2 times longer in male rats than female rats.The male kittens’ testicles will eventually descend between the anus and urethra.Be mindful that kittens typically do not like to stay still for long.It may take a few tries before any of them stay still long enough for you to determine what sex they are.
In addition, the mother rat may not be comfortable with you handling her babies.If the mother looks upset when you try to handle the kittens, try again later.
Hold two kittens in your hand at one time so you can compare the anogenital distances.

, As male rats reach sexual maturity, they will develop a large, visible scrotum that contains the testicles.However, the testicles can sometimes retract upward into a male rat’s abdomen, so you may not be able to see them.The scrotum and testicles should be visible on male kittens between three to four weeks of age.Since the testicles can retract, they are not always a surefire way to differentiate between a male and female kitten.If you do not see testicles, use the anogenital distance and presence/absence of nipples to make the sex determination.

, When rats reach sexual maturity, they can become prolific breeders. One female rat can produce 6 to 12 litters per year, with each litter containing an average of 12 kittens—that’s a lot of rats! To prevent unwanted pregnancies, remove the male kittens from the cage when they are around three weeks old.The female kittens can stay with their mother until you adopt them out.The male kittens must be moved to a new cage because they will try to mate with their female littermates and mother., Even after separating the sexes, you should house same-sex littermates in the same cage until they are six weeks old. This will help them continue their emotional development and help them get ready for being adopted.After determining the sex of each kitten, handle them on a daily basis to get them more comfortable with humans.As the kittens get larger, pick them up by gently placing one hand behind their front legs. When you lift the kitten in the air, place your other hand around its back end for additional support., When the kittens are old enough to be adopted out, you should start looking for someone to take them. It is not advisable to take them to a pet store, since they will likely become food for the snakes. Even taking the kittens to an animal shelter may not be the best idea, since the shelter may not have the facilities to care properly for the kittens and subsequently euthanize them.Your best bet may be to put the word out in your local community that you have baby rats that are ready for adoption.
When potential new owners contact you, ask them questions to make sure they are ready to make the commitment to give your baby rats the care and love they deserve. For example, ask them if they have ever owned rats before. If they have not, ask them if they have read up on how to care for rats.Trust your gut when selecting someone to adopt your baby rats. You want them to go to a good home, so you should have a good feeling about the person who wants to adopt them.Make sure you charge an adoption fee. It does not have to be a lot, but chances are the new ‘rat’ parent will care about the baby rats more if you do not give them to him or her for free., Spaying a female rat involves taking out her ovaries and uterus. For males, neutering involves removing the testicles. If you are wondering whether you should spay or neuter your rat, realize that the answer is not always a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ However, if you plan to house your male and female rats together, you must have them spayed or neutered to prevent unwanted pregnancies.A rat should be spayed or neutered at around three months of age.If you intend to keep your rats in same-sex housing, spaying or neutering is not essential.Spaying a female rat comes with several benefits, including a decreased chance of developing several types of tumors (breast, uterine, pituitary), and the prevention of pyometra (bacterial infection of the uterus).An intact female will go into heat every few days and become quite grumpy and agitated. Spaying her can make her a little more pleasant to be around. For male rats, neutering decreases aggressive behavior and can make their coats less coarse.Deciding to spay or neuter should be done on an individual basis, since all rats are different. If you are unsure what would be best for your male and female rats, discussing spaying and neutering with your veterinarian.

, Not all veterinarians have extensive experience with rats, particularly when it comes to performing surgery. If your own veterinarian is not an exotic expert, ask him or her to recommend other local exotic veterinarians. Having an exotic veterinarian who is experienced with performing rat surgeries increases the likelihood of your rat having a successful surgery.Once you have identified an exotic veterinarian, schedule an appointment with him or her. The veterinarian will examine your rat and make sure he or she is healthy enough for surgery.
If your rat has a treatable illness, the veterinarian will make sure the illness is fully treated before performing surgery.
Discuss the cost of a spay or neuter with the veterinarian. The exact cost will vary from one veterinary clinic to another.

, If you have made the decision to spay or neuter your rat, and he or she is healthy enough for surgery, schedule the procedure with the exotic veterinarian. Fortunately, since rats cannot vomit, you do not have to fast your rat before surgery.Whether your rat is getting spayed or neutered, the veterinarian will give your rat an antibiotic injection to prevent infection at the surgical site.To control pain, the veterinarian may also give your rat some pre-surgical pain medication.Your rat will be anesthetized for the surgery.The veterinarian will keep your rat warm during and after surgery to prevent your rat from developing hypothermia.Since rats are small, they could lose body heat quickly during surgery.
At the end of surgery, the veterinarian will use suture that will dissolve on its own in a few weeks, meaning that you will not need to take your rat back to the veterinarian to have suture or staples taken out., A rat spay or neuter is an outpatient surgery, so you will be able to take your rat home the day of surgery. When you bring your rat home, you will need to keep a close eye on him or her to ensure a smooth recovery. For example, watch for signs of pain in your rat, including hunching over, not eating or drinking, and looking withdrawn.Despite being a little woozy and lethargic after surgery, your rat should be able to resume normal activities.However, pain could prevent your rat from doing so.
If the veterinarian did not already prescribe pain medication for your rat, contact him or her for a prescription. Administer the medication as prescribed.
In the first day or two after surgery, it may help to keep your rat separated from the other rats until he or she is up and moving around a little better., It is important for you to check for bleeding at your rat’s incision site. An easy way to do this is to put some white paper towel in his cage and check it periodically for spots of blood. If your rat has cage mates, you will need to keep a close watch on them to make sure they are not bothering the incision site and causing it to bleed.The cage bedding may also show spots of blood. Change the bedding frequently to reduce the chance of the incision site becoming infected from dirty bedding.
Your rat may start to bother his incision site, which could cause it to bleed more and become susceptible to infection.If the incision site is starting to look infected (e.g., swelling, yellow discharge), take your rat to your veterinarian for treatment.

Learn about your rat's dental needs.,
Restrain your rat.,
Check for dental problems.,
Trim excessively long teeth.,
Feed your rat a proper diet.,
Give your rat something to chew on.,
Avoid introducing bacteria.,
Bring your rat to the vet.",How to Clean Your Rat's Teeth," Rats do not usually need any dental care, including brushing. Rat molars are located inside of a pouch in the back of their mouths behind a section of gums called the diastema. A veterinarian has to use a speculum to dilate the pouch that contains the molars, so they are not accessible for brushing. The only visible teeth in your rat’s mouth are the yellow or orange colored incisors in the front of his mouth.


Keep in mind that your rat’s incisors are yellow or orange because this is their natural color, not because they are dirty.You can monitor your rat’s dental health by checking his teeth regularly and trimming them if necessary.;
, Before you attempt to check or trim your rat’s incisors, make sure that your rat is properly restrained so he will not escape or injure you. It is a good idea to have one person restrain your rat while another person cares for his teeth.One way to effectively restrain your rat is by cutting the toe off of a sock and slipping it over the rat's head to create a straight jacket. You can then use masking tape to secure the sock around the rat's neck, being careful that it is not too tight. You can twist the bottom end of the sock or secure it with safety pins.
If you don't want to try the straight jacket, you can also try wrapping the rat up in a towel or simply holding him firmly with two hands.

, It's a good idea to periodically check your rat's teeth for some of the most common dental problems. If you notice any abnormalities, you should take the rat to the vet for a diagnosis. Signs of dental problems may include smelly breath and a buildup of food or excessive saliva.There are many symptoms your rat may exhibit that do not require you to look in his mouth. If you notice a change in eating or drinking habits, increased tears, discharge from the mouth, lumps in the cheeks, or chewing movements when your rat is not eating, he may be suffering from a dental problem., One of the most common dental problems in rats is overgrown front teeth, so it's important to pay attention to their length and alignment while you check for other dental problems. The bottom and top teeth should line up with each other, which allows them to grind. If they are crooked, unevenly worn, or overlapping, they may require trimming in order to prevent painful sores and difficulty eating.Check your rat's teeth to see if the incisors are aligned. If you notice that one tooth is longer than the others or sharpened to a point, then your rat's teeth will need to be trimmed.
Do not try to trim your rat's teeth on your own. If you think that your rat's teeth need to be trimmed, then take your rat to see a veterinarian. Rat teeth can crack down into the root when clipped, which can cause intense pain for your rat. Your rat's veterinarian will use a special dental burr to make a clean cut.
You can maintain your rat's teeth by feeding him a proper diet and taking him to the veterinarian for checkups and additional trims as needed.

, The best thing you can do to help keep your rat's teeth clean and healthy is to feed him the right foods. Give your rat a well-balanced diet, such as store-bought rat food pellets supplemented with raw fruits and vegetables. These foods have the right nutrient content and consistency for optimal dental health.Avoid giving your rat anything that is high in sugar, as these foods allow bacteria to thrive in the mouth.Hard treats, like dog biscuits, are very good for your rat's dental health, so offer these once a week.Tree branches, which rats love to chew on, are also great for helping to keep your rat's teeth clean. Not all types are safe for rats, but elm, ash, maple, birch, apple, orange, peach, and pear tree branches are all good choices.Wild grasses and weeds are good for your rat's teeth, as long as they are not treated in any way., Rats love to chew, and this behavior helps keep their teeth clean and healthy by removing food particles and grinding down the constantly growing incisors. You can buy chew toys for your rat at your local pet store.Some rats enjoy chewing on dog treats, like beef bones and pig's ears.

, Rats can acquire periodontal disease-causing bacteria from humans if you kiss them or share food with them. Avoid doing these things in order to keep your rat's teeth strong and healthy., Regular veterinary checkups are important to maintain your rat's dental and overall health. Your vet will likely be able to spot any dental problems before you do.Your vet can also give you recommendations for how to best care for your individual rat's teeth. Remember that healthy rats typically do not need any dental care at all. If your rat has some kind of dental problem, your vet might recommend that your clean and/or trim its teeth.

Spot the symptoms.,
Get treatment from your vet.,
Clean anything that can harbor the mites.Do this 24 hours after the treatment is administered.,
Isolate the rats.,
Repeat the cleaning process again any time treatment is administered.",How to Get Rid of Tropical Rat Mites on Pet Rats," Given that mites are not blood sucking, there may be no obvious physical signs.When signs do appear, they may include:Inflammation of the skin






White specks of dust on the rat's hair follicles (these are the mites and they may resemble ticks at first check)





Intense itching






Scabs around the shoulders, neck, and face.





;
, Nothing over-the-counter will work. The vet will most likely give you Ivermectin or Revolution, to be administered orally or by injection, several times over the next month. Your vet will advise you of the appropriate method of administering the treatment, dosage levels, and frequency of application.

, The treatment will kill all the mites on the rats but will not kill mites or unhatched mite eggs in the rat's environment.


Get rid of anything wooden. Such items are almost impossible to disinfect, and the mites can hide in the wood.






Clean everything else with a bleach solution. This includes the rat's cage.






Wash any fabrics in or around the cage, and put them in high heat in the dryer. Ideally, don't put any fabric in or near the cage while the rats are being treated.






If you need to disinfect human areas such as beds and furniture, use rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) in a spray bottle. The benefit of using this is that it kills mites on contact but volatizes quickly.Other means for catching mites include sticky glue traps or clear sticky tape. Vacuuming is effective provided you dispose of the bag outside (or thoroughly clean a bagless version), or you can try vacuuming with a filter such as a handkerchief inserted into the vacuum tube and then transferred to a sealed tube or alcohol to kill the mites., Put them in a part of your home where they are least likely to come in contact with any mites in any stage of their life cycle.


Keep them away from any other pets. These mites can live on other pets for about two weeks, but will die when they can't get to the rats. If there are any mites on your other pets and they come in contact with the rats, they'll just jump right back onto your rats and continue their life cycle. Ensure that other pets cannot get into the space where you're keeping the rats.






It might be a good idea to keep your rats somewhere different than their usual spot (which might have mites hanging around) and somewhere without carpeting.






Keep the rats isolated like this throughout their treatment period, until the mites are gone.







, Again, sanitize everything in and around the rat cage 24 hours after treatment is administered. This is to kill any remaining mites and eggs.

Check for alignment problems.,
Watch for discharge.,
Pay attention to how your rat eats.,
Look for lumps.,
Bring your rat to the vet.,
Clip your rat's teeth.,
Provide hard treats.",How to Know if Your Rat's Teeth Are Too Long," Your rat will not want to hold still while you look at his teeth, so it's important to make sure he is properly restrained. Ideally, you should have a second person hold the rat while you examine his teeth.When the rat is restrained, you should be able to gently lift his upper lip with your finger to observe his incisors.The simplest way to restrain a rat is by holding him firmly around the torso with two hands.
You can also try wrapping the rat in a towel.
If your rat is particularly squirmy, you can use an old sock to create a straight jacket for him. Simply cut off the toe of the sock and place the tube around your rat's body. Then use some masking tape to tape the sock loosely around your rat's neck. Be sure to secure the bottom of the sock as well.
If your rat is especially cooperative, you can try letting him stand on his hind legs on a table, holding him upright with one hand right under his front legs. Use your free hand hand to open his mouth.;
, Once you have your rat properly restrained and you can see her teeth, pay attention to the length of the incisors. The top incisors should be approximately 4 mm long, and the bottom incisors should be approximately 7 mm long. The teeth should be long enough that they rub against each other, but they should not overlap., While you are observing the length of your rat's incisors, pay attention to their alignment as well. If the top and bottom teeth do not line up with each other, they will not be able to grind against each other properly. Even if your rat's teeth are not too long now, misalignment is a sign that they might grow out of control without intervention, so be sure to check them frequently, If your rat has any discharge coming from his mouth or if he seems to be drooling excessively, he may be suffering from a dental problem associated with overgrown teeth.This may also cause your rat's breath to smell very bad.

, If your rat has lost weight or does not seem to be eating normally, this may be a sign that her teeth are too long. Overgrown teeth can make it difficult or even impossible for your rat to eat, so make sure to act quickly!If your rat appears to be chewing constantly, even when she is not eating, this may also be a sign that her teeth need attention.

, If you notice any lumps on your rat's face, these may be abscesses caused by overgrown teeth. This is probably causing your rat a lot of pain, so don't delay treatment.If your rat has abscesses, you will probably notice that he seems reluctant to eat hard foods due to pain.

, If your rat's teeth are too long, the easiest and safest way to take care of the problem is to bring her to the vet to have her teeth professionally trimmed.Keep in mind that if your rat's teeth need to be trimmed, it will probably have to be done every few weeks.
Be sure to take your rat to the vet right away if you think she has abscesses from her overgrown teeth.

, If you don't want to take your rat to the vet every time he needs to have his teeth clipped, you can try doing it yourself. Make sure you have your rat properly restrained and then use a pair of nail clippers designed for cats or birds to clip the incisors to the correct length, which is approximately 4 mm long on top and 7 mm long on bottom.Be aware there is a risk of splitting the tooth along it's length with clippers. This can be extremely painful if the tooth splinters all the way down to the nerve. To avoid this, have your vet burr the teeth with a dental instrument.
It is possible to crack your rat's teeth while attempting to clip them. If you are uncomfortable with this risk, it's best to have your vet do it., If you want to help your rat maintain her own teeth, the best thing you can do is give her hard treats to chew on. Dog biscuits and branches from fruit-bearing trees are excellent treats that rats enjoy and that will help file their teeth down.This strategy may or may not solve the problem that is causing your rat's teeth to grow too long, so be sure to continue checking them weekly and clipping them whenever necessary.

Have the medicine ready.,
See if your pet likes the medicine.,
Try to squeeze the medicine out in small increments, so it doesn't ooze everywhere before Squeaky eats it.,
If your rodent doesn't want to take the medication as is, try hiding it in a treat.,
If he's still not volunteering, make things easy on yourself and capitalize on the rodent's natural fastidiousness.,
Use a clean washcloth.,
If the medicine is particularly unappetizing and your pal's not falling for tricks, you'll need to get more insistent.,
Scruff your rodent.,
To scruff:


With your thumb and forefinger, aim for behind the neck and just before the shoulders, and not quite halfway around his middle.,
If none of the aforementioned methods work, stop.",How to Give a Mouse or Other Small Rodent Oral Medication," The medicine should be given according to the instructions. If the medicine is supposed to be refrigerated, is it cold? Did you shake it? Is your syringe clean, and does the pump move freely?


Syringes can be cleaned with hot tap water: with the tip of the syringe underwater, work the pump until it glides freely. Once clean, make sure to get as much water out as possible before using it with the medicine. Excess water can lead you to measure incorrectly.
Make sure you can read the syringe properly. One cc (cubic centimeter) is equal to one ml (millilitre).
If the pump has a thick rubber or plastic base, make sure the medicine goes to the measurement line - the pump base goes past it.;
, With the right amount of medicine in the syringe, poke it through the cage bars, or any convenient opening. Act like it's a treat, and see if Little Squeaky will eat it on his own.


It is important to have a steady hand for this, for if you start jerking the syringe around, Squeaky will probably leave.

, If some medicine is lost, or Squeaky chews on the syringe, don't panic. Just don't go dumping the medicine everywhere, and don't him them destroy the syringe (chewing, etc.).

, Some have suggested soy ""ice cream"" or cheese.

, Squirt it on a part of his body he can reach easily and he'll instinctively ""groom"" it off with his tongue, ingesting it in the process.

, Sometimes the soft cloth will calm your pet, and make it harder for him to squirm away. Wrap little squeaky gently in the washcloth, and give them the dose quickly.

,


Keep your pet calm, and pick him up gently. Little Squeaky probably isn't thrilled about the idea of having a giant plastic tube stuffed in his face, so don't be grabby.
Hold Squeaky in one hand, and the syringe in the other.
With a steady hand, gently poke the syringe at Squeaky's mouth.

If he holds still, great. Give him the medicine in small increments, and he will probably lick it just to get it off his face.
If he squirms, you can try to get the syringe directly in his mouth. You will have to be quick, firm, and gentle. It is easiest to approach from the side of the mouth, then angle towards the throat. Squeeze all the medicine out in one quick motion.


Don't worry if Squeaky spits some out, he probably got enough.
Do not shove the syringe down Squeaky's throat; you could inject medicine into his lungs, or cause other serious internal damage.

, If Squeaky is really determined not to take his meds, you can try scruffing him. This involves holding him by the loose skin around his neck. If done incorrectly, scruffing can cause bruising, damage to the ear canal, hair loss, and suffocation. Do not try it if you are unsure. Rather than hurt your beloved pet, call the vet and ask for a different kind of medication. Your vet would rather hear ""I can't do this"" than ""Squeaky's bleeding out the ears.""


This kind of scruffing only works on animals small enough that they can't just turn around and bite you, which usually means an animal no larger than your palm. The rodent will try to bite you, and gloves will not help your dexterity. If you see him getting close to biting you, just let go. It isn't worth the stress to your pet, or having sharp little teeth in your fingers.
Don't be holding him five feet above the ground. If you should drop him, it would just be that much more traumatic, and he'd probably run and get lost. Hold him a few inches over a table, preferably with some kind of block to keep him from running off the edge.

,
Pinch, allowing the skin to pull back. His forelegs will splay sideways and his lips will pull back.
If it feels too tight, let go and try again. He should be able to wiggle, but not enough to reach back to bite you.
Put the syringe in his mouth, and squeeze the whole dose in at once. It is important to do this as quickly and deftly as possible, to minimize stress.
Put him down, and let him run away and sulk in his home. He might hate you for a while.

, Call your vet, and work something else out. It is better to have a less convenient form of medication than to traumatize and possibly injure your pet.

Provide a nutritious diet for several weeks.",How to Care for a Pregnant Pet Rat," Pregnant rats, like any other animals, have higher nutritional requirements. Once the doe's pregnancy is confirmed, you need to give it a richer diet that is formulated for the requirements of pregnancy.


Provide a higher protein diet. Include a little bit of milk in her diet on a regular basis along with soya chunks. Whole grain cereals and cornflakes soaked in milk are a great meal for pregnant and lactating rats. A little bit of dog food at this time is also a good idea since it is higher in protein than ordinary dry rat food.
Vitamins and minerals are also extremely important so include a good dose of fresh fruits and veggies. Make sure your rat has plenty to eat as their appetites increase quite a bit during pregnancy.
Unless the female rat has any medical complications, medicines and other supplements are not usually needed for a successful pregnancy.;
, Your doe should continue to have access to plenty of fresh and clean water during her pregnancy. In fact, providing water and making sure your doe is properly hydrated is even more important during this stage of her life. Make sure to:


Check her water often.
Provide multiple sources of water in the cage.
If you are afraid your rat is dehydrated, contact your veterinarian. Commons signs of dehydration include: loss of elasticity in the skin, weight loss, and diarrhea.

, Proper housing during pregnancy is extremely important to make sure your doe does not have any complications. Proper housing will help ensure that your doe is happy and comfortable.


A cage the same size as your normal cage will work well. Most vets and other experts recommend at least two cubic feet (.057 cubic meters) of space per rat.
Try to use a cage that has glass or plastic sides, to prevent your rat from escaping.
Avoid wire floor cages for the pregnancy cage, as pups often get stuck if the wires are too small or too wide., During the doe’s pregnancy, you should remove all and any potential dangers from her enclosure. Removing potential dangers will help make sure that your doe does not get hurt and jeopardize the pregnancy. Make sure to:


Remove exercise wheels from the cage.
Remove any structures that enable your rat to climb high in the cage.
If you have any doubt about the safety of a specific item in the cage, take it out., A sanitary environment is extremely important when caring for a pregnant rat. Without a sanitary environment, bacteria and waste can build up in your rat’s enclosure and potentially cause complications for your pregnant rat.


Be sure to provide plenty of clean, fresh bedding material. Shredded tissue paper/ newspaper is a good substrate. Do not use cloth as it is a hazard to the pups once they are born.
Female rats produce a more pungent odor while pregnant, so it is important to change the substrate at least every other day.
Keep the cage in a secure place away from commotion and drafts while at the same time ensuring healthy ventilation and lighting.

, Pregnant rats will typically construct a nest prior to giving birth. Nests are often made of substrate and other materials common in the enclosure. The nests will be the place the doe gives birth and cares for her pups. Make sure not to interfere with the nest, change it, or mess with it in any way.


When cleaning the doe's cage, stay away from the section of the cage (roughly a quarter, depending on size) where her nest is located., Knowing about rat pregnancy is the most important thing to do if you are preparing to care for a pregnant rat. As a result, you need to acquaint yourself with a number of basic facts. Consider:


Rat pregnancy lasts an average of 21 to 23 days.
Birth often takes place at night time.
The typical rat pregnancy produces 10 to 12 pups.
Delivery often lasts about 1 to 4 hours., After two weeks from the day of successful mating, it is a good idea to isolate the doe in a separate smaller cage. This is to protect both the doe and other rats from each other. Does tend to get very temperamental when pregnant and may lash out at other rats.


Remove all male rats from the enclosure.
Remove all other female rats from the enclosure.
Avoid housing multiple pregnant rats together., Do not handle the doe more often than necessary while she is pregnant and avoid picking her up or startling her in any way. This is for a couple of reasons. First, you don’t want to take the chance of dropping or injuring the doe – this could hurt her pups. Second, your doe might experience mood changes and could be somewhat more temperamental (and might not like being handled).


Avoid handling your doe, unless it is absolutely necessary.
If your doe is accepting, you can pet her.
If the doe does not want to have physical contact, simply sit by her cage and offer companionship., Your rat’s enclosure or cage should always be in a quiet and safe location, however, during pregnancy this is even more important. This is because you want to avoid causing the doe any extra stress or tension. Consider:


Placing the enclosure in a quiet room in the house away from the family room, kitchen, or other high traffic areas.
Moving the enclosure outside of a child’s room or playroom.
Putting the enclosure in a room where no other animals are present., The most important part of managing your rat's birthing process is to know when the birth is going to occur. If you know what to look for, you'll be much better prepared to help:


Your doe will be relatively large compared to her normal size.
Your doe will begin constructing a nest.
Your rat will act strange or seem slightly agitated.
Nearly three weeks will have passed since conception., Care during birth is extremely important. If possible, you should be present and available during the birthing process. This will ensure that if there are any life threatening complications, you can be there to assist your doe. If no babies are delivered within 2 hours after labor begins, it is possible that one is stuck in her uterus. If you are present, there are a number of things you can do.


By gently messaging the doe’s stomach, you may be able to help reposition the stuck pup.
If a pup is stuck in the birth canal, try to lubricate it with a very small amount of baby oil.
If a pup is stuck and may die, you might need to remove it with blunt forceps. This will most likely injure (and kill) the baby, but it will enable the other pups to come out., Care after birth is also extremely important as complications (and other issues) that occur during pregnancy can have important health impacts afterward. As a result, you need to be prepared to provide care immediately after birth.


In the event that any of the pups are born dead or die within a few hours, make sure you dispose the body.
If the mother dies during birth, quickly locate another nursing mother as a potential surrogate.
Be vigilant of the pups and the doe for 24 hours after they are born, but do not disturb them much. Make sure the doe has plenty of clean food, water and bedding.
Make sure none of the pups are suffocating in the substrate or under the doe. , Providing care during the first few days after birth is also extremely important. Make sure to be cognizant of the doe and her pups' vulnerability during this period. Remember:


Don’t handle the doe or pups until at least 24 hours after birth.
Be careful while removing the pups from the doe as she may bite and show aggression even if she is usually tame.
It is a good idea to distract her with a treat while handling the pups.
If the doe shows signs of aggression or tries to eat her pups, remove them. This is quite rare but still happens. After removing the pups, try to locate a surrogate with pups the same age to nurse them. Otherwise, contact your vet for advice.

, After your doe gives birth, you need to make sure that you continue her pregnancy diet. This is because the doe will be nursing her pups for several weeks. Without proper nutrition, your doe and her pups could become ill or die.


Continue the pregnancy diet for the doe for 3 weeks after the pups are born.
Once the pups are completely weaned, the doe can be returned to her regular diet and be separated from the pups. The doe and pups will take care of weaning on their own, and pups will begin eating food you put in the cage for them. If the pups are not weaning properly, contact your vet.
Make sure to provide an extra nutritious diet to the pups for several weeks after they’ve been weaned."

Maintain eye contact.,
Warm up your hands.,
Move your hand slowly, about one inch per second.,
Ask your partner how the caress feels and adjust your caresses accordingly.,
Note how your partner is responding to your touch.",How to Caress1," Start by making eye contact with your partner as this will signal that you are engaged in her and trying to set a romantic mood. Ensure your partner meets your eye contact and maintains eye contact with you, as this will show she is also interested in some romantic caressing.;
, Studies have shown that romantic partners respond better to caresses with hands that are at slightly above room temperature.

Rub your hands together before touching your partner and avoid holding cold beverages or cold objects, as your partner may not respond positively to a caress by ice cold hands.

You can also warm your hands by putting on gloves if you are in a cold outdoor environment or holding them over a warm fire if you are sitting in front of a romantic fire with your partner. The idea is to warm up your hands to a temperature that will be pleasing when you touch your partner’s body.

, Most people enjoy slow, gentle caresses so take it nice and easy when you touch your partner. Try to exert slight pressure with your fingertips and your hands on your partner’s face, neck, shoulders, arms, and back, moving about one inch per second. You may want to make light circles over your partner’s skin, figure eights, or trace any beauty marks with your fingertips.

Watch out for any ticklish areas and avoid running your fingertips over these areas, as this can cause discomfort. Instead, use a warm palm or your knuckles to softly caress any ticklish areas.

, As you caress your partner, you should communicate with her to determine how and where she enjoys being caressed. Ask her, “How does that feel?” as you run your fingertips and hands over certain spots on her body, and if she is clearly enjoying how you are touching a certain area, continue to do this. Read her verbal cues and her physical cues to ensure your caresses feel good to her.

You can also tell her to “coach you” or show you where she would like to be caressed and how she would like to be caressed. This could create some fun foreplay between you and your partner and allow you to please your partner with your caresses.

, Your partner may not be able to verbalize her desires when it comes to touch, so take note of how she is responding to your caresses. If her body language is open, excited, and stimulated, with visible sweating, looks of pleasure, and head nodding, these are all signs she is likely enjoying your caresses. If she displays looks of discomfort, annoyance, or boredom, making no eye contact with you or head nodding, these may be signs she is not into your caresses. You may then need to change up your approach.


If you are caressing a man, most men enjoy when their partners stroke their chests, back, and buttocks with a light touch. You can also tease his groin area with your fingertips and apply pressure with your hands on his groin area.If you are caressing a woman, most women enjoy when their partners stroke their chest area, their buttocks, and their inner legs. You can also tease her groin area with your fingertips, using light touches."
"
Make eye contact.,
Ensure your friend wants to be touched.,
Ask a new friend if you can give her a friendly caress.,
Give your friend a hug or a friendly pat on the arm.",How to Caress2," Before you caress a friend, you should make eye contact and greet her to connect with her in a verbal way. This could be a simple greeting like “hello, how are you” or this could be a form of farewell at the end of a conversation or hang out, like “nice to see you, have a good day.” Look the friend in the eye as you speak to her and move your body closer to her so she is aware you may be going in for a friendly caress like a hug.

, Not everyone enjoys physical contact or being touched, even by close friends or acquaintances. To avoid invading your friend’s personal space, you should gauge if your friend would not mind friendly touching before you move in for a caress.


Notice your friend’s body language as you say good bye or hello to her, especially if you usually do not hug or touch this friend. If your friend displays closed body language, with her hands crossed over her chest and a good amount of space between you, she may not be amenable to a hug or a friendly pat. If she displays open body language, with her body facing towards you, her hands relaxed at her sides, and her body close to yours, she may be open to a friendly hug hello or goodbye.

, If you are talking to someone you just met or do not know very well, you may not want to freak her out or invade her personal space be diving right for a hug, a handshake, or a friendly caress. To prevent making things awkward, you may want to ask the new friend directly if it would be okay to hug her, shake her hand, or give her a friendly pat on the arm.


Asking permission can also be important for individuals who are uncomfortable with touch due to psychological discomfort with touching from strangers that may be tied to trauma or past negative experiences with touch. Some people do not like friendly touching from strangers, so if the new friend says no to a hug or friendly caress, respect her decision and do not force the hug or caress.

, If your friend is projecting open body language and maintaining eye contact with you, you may have the all clear to give your friend a hug or a friendly pat on the arm. If a new friend gives you the okay to touch her, you may want to give them a brief hug or a handshake.


Keep the hug friendly by ensuring the hug does not last too long or evolve into more romantic touching. Hug a good friend with joy and enthusiasm, with your hands wrapped around their lower back, but do not place your hands on your friend’s bum or chest, as this could be taken as romantic caressing instead of friendly caressing.

Make the water warm; not hot or it will put them in shock.,

Use a soft bristled toothbrush.,

Also, make sure that you gently rub their feet because when they run on their wheel they like to go to the bathroom.,

Next, make sure that you get the underside of them wet.,

Try to figure out what’s wrong first.,
Ask her what’s wrong.,
Ask her what you can do to help.",How to Cheer up a Woman1," If you can, try to figure out why she’s upset before you say anything. Quickly evaluate the situation. What has happened recently that might make her upset? Put yourself in her shoes: if something would make you unhappy, it’s very likely that it would make her unhappy too. If you can understand why she’s unhappy, you will have a much better idea of what to say and not say to make her feel better.;
, Even if you know for a fact what is wrong, you should still ask her. Asking her will help avoid problems if you have understood the situation incorrectly but it will also give her the opportunity to talk about her problems.


Be aware that she may say that nothing is wrong or she may play it off as being tired or a smaller problem than it is. If she does so, remind her that it’s okay to be upset and that you’re there to talk if she wants to.

, If she tells you what’s wrong or you would rather be more upfront with her about what you know, ask her what you can do to help her. It is important that you actually be willing to help her, though. She will not like empty offers.

Let her talk.,
Give her a hug.,
Tell her how much you care.,
Make her laugh.,
Make her smile.,
Get her mind off of her problems.",How to Cheer up a Woman2," Letting her talk might be the best way to make her feel better. Just like anyone else, women often get upset because they feel like no one listens to them. They feel ignored, unappreciated, and without a voice. Listen to what she has to say and this may be enough to make her feel better.

, The type of hug will depend on the situation and the type of relationship you have. If you are not very close or she is not very upset, a side hug should be enough and will show that you support her. If you have a closer relationship or she is having a very hard time, you should consider a big hug (the kind where she can cry into your shoulder, as she might very well need that).

, Telling her that you care about her, how much she means to you, and how hard it is to see her hurting can make her feel much better. It's easy to feel very alone when we're having problems, and showing her that she's not alone and that there are people who care about her will cheer her up.

, Laughter is, as they say, the best medicine. In laughing, we forget about our problems and are able to feel happy again (if only for a little while). Make her laugh to cheer her up but be careful to avoid jokes or anything that might be offensive, as these might make things worse.


Sing her a song. Try being silly. Singing a song is a great way to do this. Don’t worry about singing badly, since the point is to make her laugh (and singing badly will help!). Start singing Wind Beneath My Wings in the most dramatic manner you can manage or try enacting a scene from RENT.






Tell a funny story. Tell her that really embarrassing story you have from middle school. You know which one I mean: that one that just makes you want to die but makes everyone else laugh. Or tell her about the time you found your college roommate drunk and asleep, sitting up on the toilet.






Collect a Youtube playlist of funny videos. Whether it’s kittens riding on turtles while Low Rider plays in the background, parents telling their kids that their Halloween candy got eaten, or clips from Eddie Izzard stand up, a Youtube screening can get her mind off her problems and cheer her up.

, You’ll want to do things that make her feel good too, not just that make her laugh. Do something nice for her that shows you care and brings a smile to her face. Try to hit that perfect mix of sweet and silly.


Leave little notes everywhere. Tell her how pretty she is. Remind her of funny stories. Leave humorous critiques of random objects. You can even just leave notes with random facts.






Draw a silly picture. The worse your drawing skills are, the better. Use humorous labels if it is too difficult to tell what the picture is of. You can be sweet and draw a picture of the two of you or you can be silly and draw a picture of a cat in a top hat having tea with a fish.






Make her a cd. You can compile songs which remind you of her, songs which make you happy when you’re down, or just songs that you think she’d like.

, You can also find lots of other ways to get her mind off her problems. Getting out and doing things are really the best ways to get over challenges and stressful situations in our lives.

Go out. You can go out to eat or you can go out on a hike. Getting her out of her usual environment will be the main key to taking her mind off the issues. The more concentration that’s required for the activity, the better.






Talk about things you’ve done together. You can reminisce about that time you carried that drunk friend halfway across town after that party in college, that time in middle school where she had to help you hide a wayward boner, or that time at work when the dishwasher exploded. Talking about memories like this can get her out mentally, bringing her thoughts elsewhere.
Play games or watch movies. Board and card games are really making a comeback (try Cards Against Humanity!) and movies are a time-honored way of dealing with bad emotions (who doesn't feel better after watching Independence Day?).

Don’t turn it into a contest.,
Don’t change the topic too quickly.,
Don’t ignore her completely.,
Don’t hit on her.,
Don’t tell her to smile.",How to Cheer up a Woman3," This never makes anyone feel better. It’s just a way for you to make everything about you.

, Give her time to get all of her feelings out. If you aren’t willing to spend the time with her necessary to make her feel better, don’t get involved to begin with.

, You don’t want her to feel like you’re ignoring or minimizing her problems. If she really doesn't want to talk about it, that’s one thing, but don’t just pretend like nothing is wrong.

, This is not an opportunity for you to get in her pants. If you want her to like you more, just be supportive and a good friend. She’ll remember that later.

, Telling someone to smile really isn’t helpful and is a common creeper line. You can mean it earnestly, but it’s going to remind her of all those old guys on the bus that stare at her boobs.

Observe if your rat is scratching more than normal.,
Look for fleas in your rat's skin and fur.,
Look for fleas in your rat's bedding.,
Take your rat to your veterinarian.,
Bathe your rat using flea medicated shampoo.,
Use a flea comb to remove fleas.,
Give topical flea treatments to your rat.,
Do a deep clean of your rat's cage.,
Clean the area around your rat's cage.,
Vacuum your home.",How to Get Rid of Fleas on Rats," Often a rat will scratch a flea infested part of its body more frequently and often quite vigorously. This area can become irritated, red, or inflamed from scratching and from fleas feeding on your rat's skin.Missing patches of fur or red scabs is a good indication that something is irritating your rat's skin even if you don't see them scratching.
Fleas like to hide in densely covered areas of animals. If your rat is scratching its armpits and belly a lot more than normal or has irritation in these areas, it might be a sign of fleas or some other skin irritant.
Your rat might jump or react violently out of the blue. This is a sign of hypersensitivity to flea bites.;
, If the infestation is heavy, you will be able to spot fleas or its feces. Flea feces or flea dirt will look like coffee grounds on your rat's fur.Use a flea comb or a comb with closely set teeth and run it through your rat's fur. Make sure to run it close to your rat's skin in order to catch and pull any fleas that are hiding under the fur coat. If your comb comes up with any black spots that are dirt-like, it may be fleas or its feces.


Have a bowl of soapy water on hand to wash your comb of any fleas you might pull out.
Flea feces and dirt can look quite similar, especially if you bring your rat outside to play. One way to tell the difference between the two is to wet any dirt-like specks with water and watch if the spots turn a reddish-brown colour. The red colour is the digested blood that the fleas have ingested which has been broken down by the water.
Adult fleas account for about 5% of a flea colony or infestation. The other 95% consist of flea eggs, larvae, and pupae which are harder to see with the naked eye.

, Check any areas your rat frequents or sleeps, or even areas near or under its cage. You might be able to see flea dirt or fleas in your rat's cage or bedding, especially if the flea infestation is quite heavy.

, Before starting flea treatment, take your rat to the vet. Your vet will be able to identify if your rat has fleas or if they have another type of skin parasite or irritant. They can also recommend treatment options and products to use and provide helpful advice on how to safely and effectively remove fleas from your rat and its environment.


Be sure to tell your vet you think your rat has fleas. Some vets may want you to take precautionary actions before bringing in a possibly flea-infested animal.

, Using your vet's recommended flea shampoo, bathe your rat. It is very important to leave the flea shampoo on your rat for about 10 minutes in order for the medication to take effect.Lather your rat with flea shampoo out of the water so the shampoo isn't washed away. Try putting your rat on a towel as you lather them so they don't slip away or make a mess. Or simply hold your rat in your hand while you wait the allotted 10 mins as the shampoo treats your rat's fleas.
Don't get shampoo in your rat's eyes, ears, and mouth. The shampoo is strongly medicated and can be toxic when ingested by your rat. So keep a constant eye on them as you wait the allotted time for the shampoo to work.
Be sure to clean your rat's tail as well. Use a toothbrush and lightly lather the shampoo onto their tail. Be careful not to scrub too hard as a rat's tail skin is easily damaged.
Let your rat swim around in their bath to drown out the fleas.

, This can be done at any time to remove dead or live fleas from your rat. This is a great tool to use especially if your rat can't handle strong medication due to illness. Comb your rat with a flea comb and then place your comb in hot, soapy water to kill the fleas.


This method may take a considerable amount of time before you are able to rid your rat of all fleas.
This does not help with flea bite sensitivity and does not treat your rat for skin irritation problems. Flea shampoos not only kill fleas but also helps to sooth your rat's skin.
This method requires you to be able to handle your rat, especially if you don't have a trained rat. You may need to restrain or keep you rat still while combing by making a claw-like gesture with your hand to keep your rat in place. Hold your rat by placing your thumb and ring finger around its body right under its front legs, while having your rat's neck rest between your index finger and middle finger. Don't squeeze too hard or you'll restrict its airway. You can attempt the same holding method with your rat on its back., Your vet can recommend topical flea treatments like sprays or once-a-month topical insecticides to be applied to your rat. These are often applied to a spot on your rat's body where they can't lick or ingest the medication. The medication seeps into your rat's bloodstream to protect it from future parasites. This is done as a preventative measure rather than a cure for fleas.


Never use flea treatment products without consulting your veterinarian first.
Never let your rat ingest flea treatments.

, Depending on how bad the flea infestation is, you will need to do a deep clean on your rat's cage every week. Flea infestations can take weeks and even months to cure. This is because most measures we take to get rid of fleas may only work on adult fleas, leaving the eggs to hatch and grow into adult fleas at a later date.


Use a diluted bleach or a detergent to clean the cage. Wipe the bars, any wheels or platforms, and the outside and inside of the cage's pan. Rise thoroughly after.
Soak toys in diluted bleach or detergent while you clean the cage. Rinse thoroughly after.
Throw out and change the bedding and litter pan completely.

, Wipe all surfaces with diluted bleach and treat the area with pet-safe and indoor-safe pesticides. Clean the area as much as your can, even daily, and treat the area according to the pesticide's instructions.


Purchase and use an adulticide which kills all adult insects and an insect growth regulator that disrupts the hormonal balance of insects and prevents them from reproducing and laying eggs., Vacuuming can remove up to 50% of flea eggs, stopping the the flea cycle drastically. After vacuuming, bag up the vacuum bag in a plastic bag and throw it away immediately. If you have a vacuum cleaner that doesn't use vacuum bags, consider finding one that does. If you don't discard the bag, the flea eggs can hatch inside your vacuum cleaner and start the flea cycle all over again.


Vacuum daily in high traffic areas and weekly in other areas.
Vacuum carpets, furniture, drapes, and wherever your rat sleeps or hangs out.
You will have to keep this up for a few weeks and may months, until you're sure there are no longer fleas on your rat and in your home.

Be aware that sending flowers cannot save a relationship.,
Avoid sending flowers simply to impress someone.",How to Buy Flowers for Women," Of course you can simply give a card or splurge on a more substantial gift, but flowers are always appropriate.


Don't wait until the last minute to buy flowers on high volume days when everyone else is buying them. You will find a very limited selection and the quality of flowers may be diminished.;
,,


Say thank-you to a colleague for help on a project. Be sure that the flowers you send to friends and co-workers don't convey a romantic message. Keep them cheerful and friendly. Send a bouquet of daisies rather than red roses, for instance.
Express your continued interest in a woman after a successful first date. Sending flowers will help make a second date possible.
Say that you are sorry or that you understand and forgive her. Flowers can smooth things over and say things that you might find awkward to put into words. They can make reconciliations easier. But don't think only flowers mean that she forgives you!

, Roses, especially red roses, represent passion and romance.


If giving red roses has become an expected tradition in your relationship, you might change things occasionally by giving them in a different color, such as orange or coral, or mix another flower into the bouquet. Think about mixing roses with tulips or with asters, which are known as the love flower. Consult a florist for ideas.

,


Purple symbolizes love at first sight. Orange represents desire while yellow conveys a feeling of friendship.
Pink blooms show gratitude and admiration and are a good choice to send your mother or favorite aunt.
Give a mixed color bouquet if you aren't completely sure of what you want to say. The expression of feeling remains subtle and the mixed colors are bright and cheerful.







, Some women prefer plants because they will last much longer and provide a constant reminder of the relationship or the occasion. Blooming varieties, such as orchids, last a long time and remind her she is special every time she looks at the plant you gave her.

, A trained professional will be available to help you make an informed selection.


Florists also deliver flowers. It's more of an occasion to receive a delivery of flowers, especially in a public setting such as her office. She will enjoy the excitement the flower delivery gives her co-workers as well as seeing and smelling the flowers themselves.

, Hospital or hotel gift shops also provide flowers. These places are convenient, but the quality of the flowers may be compromised. Many times the flowers are past their prime and will not last as long.


Some supermarkets have an excellent quality of flowers due to the fact that they have an ongoing deal with a supplier. The flowers you buy will be less expensive than those from a florist's shop. You will have to deliver them yourself, of course.

, Many florists have websites where you can order your flowers from the convenience of home. Most have a wide variety of choices for any occasion. Be aware, however, that substitutions are sometimes made while filling the order and the end result may not match the picture. Be sure the business is reputable before you place an order.

, Getting a gift of flowers to mark a special moment in your relationship or for no reason at all is especially appreciated. It shows that you are generous and thoughtful and that she is indeed special.

, Choose flowers in her favorite color. Send the type of flowers she likes best; perhaps she prefers daisies over roses. Or evoke a favorite memory with your gift: a vase of baby rosebuds to remind her of time spent as a child, tending to a rose garden with her mother.


Consult with a florist about her personality. The flowers you choose for a sophisticated city woman, for instance, might differ from those you pick for a woman who loves to camp and hike.

, The card will last far longer than the flowers, but will always remind her of the gift from your heart.

, You could come off as seeming desperate.

, The gesture may be seen as meaningless.

Prepare your thoughts.,
Educate yourself.,
Consider who will be your support system.,
Set the mood.,
Explain yourself as clearly and as honestly as possible.,
Be prepared for anything.,
Be sensitive to your spouse's needs and be a good listener.,
Keep the conversation going (metaphorically).,
Above all, give it time.",How to Tell Your Spouse About Your Bisexuality," Before coming out to your spouse, take some time with your thoughts to figure out what you'd like to say.


Consider: Why are you feeling driven to come out to your partner at this time? Has something changed recently, such as you've only lately come to realize this about yourself, or been able to accept it?
What does being bisexual mean to you? How has it played out in your life, and how do you see it informing your future?
Writing out your feelings and ideas may help to compose them.;
, Chances are, in the course of coming to terms with your sexuality, you'll have done a fair amount of research online. Still, it can be a good idea to round out your knowledge of bisexuality and relevant issues so that you will hopefully have some of the answers to the questions your spouse may have.


Also make note of helpful websites that may be able to serve as resources for your spouse. Everyone processes differently, and it may be easier for your spouse to read information on a website later, at their own pace.
Research whether there are any local bi organizations or community meet-ups you might be able to join. Bringing your partner with you into the bi community, and allowing them to meet other bi people, may help them accept bisexuality and understand how it fits into your life better.

, If your partner is the first person you are coming out to, it may be a lot for your spouse to both work through your revelation themselves and also be your sole confidant in your identity journey. Think about who else, after your spouse, you may want to come out to and have as a supportive resource.


Although you may want to seek support from others before coming out to your spouse, be careful who and how many people you tell. Word can spread very quickly, and you want to be able to come out to your spouse on your own terms. You can always join an anonymous online forum to get some motivation or a sympathetic ear from people whom you know can't out you.

, As with any coming out, timing is very important. Choose a time to tell your partner when you will both have ample time to talk and take things in, when you both won't be too stressed or busy.


It's a good idea to set aside a specific time in which to have the talk--maybe within the context of a special dinner date at home.
It's best to choose a place where you have privacy and you both feel comfortable.
Never come out to your spouse during a fight. No matter how heated things may be in the moment, you will regret your slip of the tongue later. Receiving big news in a tense context will make it harder for your spouse to process it positively.
While some find it easier to come out in writing rather than face-to-face, coming out in person can have its advantages, as you and your spouse can have a natural, in-the-moment dialogue.

,


Tell your spouse what being bisexual means to you and why you are coming out to them now.
Be clear about what this means for your relationship. Has anything changed? Do you anticipate making changes in your life, now that you have come to accept this? Are you seeking to open the relationship? Make your perspective understood.
Try not to be apologetic. You are being honest about who you are, and have nothing to apologize for.

, It is really nearly impossible to predict how someone will react to a coming out. Consider how you will take care of yourself and see to your own emotional needs if your spouse is initially upset.


It is also nearly impossible to predict how different someone's initial reaction might be from where they may arrive at on the issue later on. Don't be discouraged if their initial reaction is less than enthusiastic. Many people can be initially shocked or overwhelmed, but with time can become the strongest of allies.
It bears repeating: always remember that people really do come around.
You may be prepared for disbelief, but it's always possible that you may wind up the surprised one--perhaps they will tell you they suspected it all along!

, Although this is a time when you are explaining yourself, this is also a time when you need to be giving your partner space and time to process. You are seeking their support, but it's important to also be supportive and understanding of their position.


Listen carefully to what they have to say and try not to be defensive. Your partner may be very surprised and may not be considering their words carefully.
Answer any questions they may have. Try to be non-judgmental about what they may ask. Remember, although you've probably had quite some time to educate yourself about bisexuality and think things through, they are probably only considering this for the first time.
At a certain point, dependent on your spouse's personality, it may be best to leave them alone--give them space to process on their own for awhile.

, Sometimes people slip into a state of denial and prefer not to talk about your coming out or your sexuality. Sometimes people need space in which to process. And sometimes it can be difficult to tell which of these is at play.


If your spouse doesn't want to talk about it again for a little while, be considerate of that, but don't let them completely drop the subject, either.
Find ways to slip in little reminders of the conversation now and then, and practice trying to be open about your sexuality. You need to be sensitive to your spouse's feelings, but also respect your own need to be true to yourself.

, Some spouses will be immediately accepting, but others will need time to adjust their way of thinking and their perspective of you.


Either way, fusing your newfound bisexual identity into your preexisting relationship is going to take time. Be patient, and enjoy the journey. It is always worth it: you are being true to you and allowing your partner to know you on a more honest level. That is the recipe for a much stronger, deeper relationship.

Have fun!",How to Coax Your Family Member or Friend to Start Blogging," It could anyone. A friend or a family member. Your brother, cousin, sister, etc. Choose someone you know well.;
, If he/she is rushing out the door to work, that's not a good time. Pick a time when they're not occupied. If they don't live with you, and you have to phone them, it's time for you to do a little work. If this person is not in your time zone, find an appropriate time to contact them.

, Is there a game you and they both play? What about sharing stories? Think of creative ideas to do. If you're planning for you and your partner to blog about daily life, tell them that blogging could be a lifelong experience. Blogging is a chance to let your feelings let your feelings out on the internet with your own blog.

, This person might not be a blogging person. Don't phone them every day/week trying to get them into blogging. If you do this, they might get annoyed and just say yes, but they won't be thrilled about it, and there's a big chance they won't even post on their blog.

, Let them set up their own blog; it will make them feel happy and independent that they can make their own. If you make one for them, they won't feel as independent. They might feel babied.

, Since you're showing a new blogger what to do and where this and that is, be patient and helpful. Do they want to write a post? Show them kindly. If they don't understand where you guided them, don't get aggravated. Direct them with kindness. If they don't need help, then don't keep on guiding them where they want to go, or they might get a bit annoyed

, Don't peek over his/her shoulder everyone time they're on the blog. If you act like blogging mommy to your partner, they won't feel like it's their blog. Once they get the hang of things on the blog, and memorize where things are, let them have their blogging freedom. If you're watching them over their shoulder when they blog, they won't feel the freedom of blogging.

, Don't post anything rude about your partner, then he/she will end up getting off the blogging buddies rock where you and he/she are standing, and wander alone. If they post something rude or cruel about you, talk to them. Tell them that blogging is supposed to be about happiness, not a place where you post about hate.

, If your partner is struggling or having trouble with something, offer help and be kind. If you're confident about you and your partner, then you will be better blogging friends.

Acknowledge your emotions, even if they’re uncomfortable or difficult to face.Avoid repressing your negative feelings or hoping they’ll go away on their own. Like physical clutter, emotional baggage doesn’t go away unless you take action to get rid of it.
For instance, you might realize you’re holding onto feelings of resentment towards your significant other because they don’t make an effort to spend time with you or help enough with the bills.;
, Think about how often you and the other person fight or get angry at each other. Do you rehash the same argument over and over? Recurring problems are a telltale sign that your relationship is burdened with emotional clutter.Think about what could be causing any recurring problems in the relationship. Take a critical look at your own behavior, as well as the other person’s. It is important to reflect on your behavior first before approaching or criticizing your spouse or partner.
For instance, if you and your spouse always argue about whose family to visit for the holidays, the real problem might be that you both put off making plans until the last minute.

, After identifying the emotional clutter in your relationship, decide how you will address it. Think about how you can change your own habits for the better, what you want to say to the other person, and whether family therapy or couples counseling might be necessary for resolving your problems.Avoid expecting the other person to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to fixing long-standing relationship problems. It’s important to recognize your own flaws, too.
Before trying to change your partner's behavior, reflect on what you can do to benefit the relationship, and make a change yourself. See if this helps communication. If you still have a problem with your significant other, bring it up with them.

, Discuss the relationship when you and the other person are both feeling positive and relaxed. Avoid having the talk when one or both of you are tired, in a hurry, or upset about something.If it’s difficult to find a good time for a conversation, plan for it ahead of time. Say something like, “I’d like to talk with you about something. Can we get together on Thursday night?”

, Tell the other person about your concerns. Avoid accusing or criticizing them. Instead, use the phrases “I think…” and “I feel…” to talk about what is bothering you. For example, say something like, “I feel like you don’t care about my opinion when you make big decisions without talking to me first.”
“I” statements let you express yourself without making the other person feel defensive.
On the other hand, saying things like “You always…” will make the other person want to argue with you or stop talking to you.

, Listen to what the other person has to say, and put yourself in their shoes as much as you can. Let them know that you understand their point of view. For example, if your girlfriend tells you she’s been irritable lately because she’s under pressure at work, you could say, “That sounds really stressful. It must be hard to handle problems at home on top of that.”
Making the other person feel understood and validated will reinforce the idea that you’re working together, not against each other, to improve the relationship.

, The words “but,” “not,” and “should” can all stir up negative feelings and get in the way of productive conversation. Similarly, using the phrase “makes me feel” sends the message that you’re not willing to take responsibility for your own feelings.Replace the word “but” with “and” wherever you can. For instance, say, “I agree with you, and…” instead of “I agree with you, but…”
Instead of using the word “not,” which is unnecessarily negative, phrase things in a positive way. For instance, say, “I’d rather do it this way,” instead of, “I do not want to do that.”
Use “could” instead of “should.” For instance, the sentence “We could do this” is much more neutral than “We should do this.”
Instead of saying something makes you feel a certain way, just say, “I feel…”

, Keep your relationship well-maintained by checking in with the other person frequently. Talking to each other on a regular basis will help you catch emotional clutter and clear it out before it builds up., Even healthy relationships aren’t perfect, and unrealistic expectations are often responsible for long-lasting emotional clutter. After you’ve prioritized a few important issues to work on, make peace with the smaller flaws in the relationship.For instance, you might make it a priority to communicate better with your boyfriend, but decide you can live with tidying up after him around the house.
If you and the other person frequently clash over a certain issue, such as an ideological difference, avoiding the topic may be a more practical solution than trying to reach an agreement.
Make a list of your expectations, and rank these topics by importance. Try letting go of the lower items on your list first before tackling the larger issues.

, If the other person hurt you in the past, talk about the issue and forgive them. Then move on. Commit to leaving your old pain behind you, so it won’t continue to damage the relationship in the future.It can be tempting to bring up old grievances when you get into an argument, but don’t do this. It doesn’t help fix the current issue, and it can easily turn into an argument about who acted more hurtful in the past.

, Instead of worrying about whether you’re good enough or whether the other person really cares about you, focus on improving your own life and your relationship skills.


If you have a concern about the relationship, bring it up with the other person so that you can discuss it and find a solution together., Spend time with the other person regularly, and remember what you appreciate about them. Make an effort to create new, positive memories together. Keeping your relationship strong will help prevent more emotional clutter from building up in the future."

Surprise him/her.,
Use technology.,
Play with your lover.,
Do something different.,
Try different things in bed.",How to Break the Love Routine," Surprises and unexpected events make life more fun! Do things that you know your lover will appreciate but without telling him/her. Here are some ideas:


Make sure he/she has no plans for the evening and pick him/her up after work. Then spend the evening together. He/she will probably have had a hard day and be tired so seeing you waiting for him/her and taking care of him/her will make him/her very happy and grateful.
Invite him/her to a party and make a point of telling him/her that a lot of guests will be there. Actually, invite only him/her and surprise him/her by revealing that you too will be all alone together all evening. Your lover will love this since he/she will have expected to be a bit neglected at the party, since you would have been taking care of other people.
Surprise him/her by changing your style. If you're used to wearing black or grey, wear a red shirt for your next date. Try on a wig or dye your hair without warning. Alternate wearing contact lenses and glasses if you have bad eyesight. Make your lover feel like he/she's dating five different persons at the same time.;
,


Send texts messages with cute love poems or quotes or just your own sentences (like ""I'm thinking of you"", ""I miss you""...).
Leave sexy vocal messages in the middle of the night emphasizing how you keep thinking about him/her and can't manage to fall asleep (this works especially well if you're a girl).

,


Use post-its to lead him/her to you. For example, after having spent the night together, leave a post-it on your pillow with a personal question implying an object on it (example: ""what are my favorite flowers?""). The answer will lead your lover to the next clue (if the answer if ""Roses"", put the next clue in a bouquet of roses you will leave in the next room). Prepare the props in advance though.
Leave post-its with hearts or ""I love you"" on them in his stuff. Finding it will brighten up his/her day without you having to be there. You can also leave other things like dried flower petals, pictures of you two together etc...

,


Plan a date in the morning before going to work to have coffee and breakfast together.
Go to a restaurant you've never been to before or in a new place. Try to check it out on the net or with your friends first, to make sure you won't regret it though and that it won't make your partner feel out of place.

, Remember that sex is a very important part of a relationship.


Role play: teacher/student, patient/doctor (or nurse), servant/master(mistress), princess/pirate, secretary/boss, police officer/criminal, stripper/client... Use your imagination on this one, the possibilities are endless.
Try different postures, different places.

Talk quietly around your hedgehog, especially when you first bring it home. Speak to it when you come near it, so that it will get used to the sound of your voice., You want to show your hedgehog that you are friendly and not a threat, so move slowly and carefully when you are near it. Give it a few moments to notice you before you attempt to pick it up. Do not be alarmed if your hedgehog hisses, clicks, or puffs up its spines when it sees you. These are instinctual responses, and should go away in time, as your hedgehog becomes more used to you., Using two cupped hands, reach for your pet. Start from underneath, feeling for the animal’s soft fur belly and avoiding its quills. Reach smoothly. If you jerk your hands, it may sense danger and not want to be picked up.You do not need to wear gloves when handling your hedgehog, just try to avoid its spines. If you are pricked, it may sting a little but should not cause serious injury.

, Once you are able to cup your hands around your pet, lift it upwards. Many hedgehog owners find it easiest to hold the hedgehog in one hand and support its back with their other. Your hedgehog may not want to be petted, so just let it sniff your hands for now. If the hedgehog acts like it wants to get away, let it go and try picking it up again later. Do not squeeze or hold the hedgehog forcefully, as it may then associate you with danger.

, If your hedgehog takes well to being held, sit down with it. Hold it in your lap, perhaps on top of a cloth. The hedgehog may still not want to be petted, but you can let it sniff some more and get used to you., Hedgehogs are known for rolling themselves into a ball when alarmed. This is a natural defense mechanism, so there is no need to take it personally. If yours rolls into a ball while you are holding it, be patient. It will probably unroll itself after a while and sniff some more., Giving your hedgehog something tasty while you are handling it will make it form positive associations with you. Mealworms, for instance, are a favorite treat of hedgehogs, and can be obtained from many pet supply stores., Picking your hedgehog up will give it a chance to get more used to you. You may be able to speed things up by taking a t-shirt you have worn for a day and placing inside your hedgehog’s cage. You can also offer a cloth or towel that you have used. The fabric will carry your smell, which the hedgehog can sniff and get accustomed to.You should wash your hands before and after handling your hedgehog, but use unscented soap., The more you try to pick up and talk to your hedgehog, the sooner it will feel safe around you. Try spending at least 30 minutes a day with it. Even if your hedgehog rolls up or hisses, be persistent and calm, and continue to offer it treats. In time, the two of you should get along well., Hedgehogs are basically nocturnal creatures. This means that they will typically sleep during the day and will likely be more active around dusk and at night. If you want your hedgehog to get used to being handled, make an attempt when it is most active and playful., When your hedgehog feels like it has a good food source, it will be more likely to bond with you. Hedgehogs naturally eat mostly insects, so you can offer yours crickets, mealworms, and other treats that are available at pet supply stores. Earthworms are another favorite food (look for some at a bait store). Hedgehogs can also eat cooked protein, such as small cubes of chicken.Plant material is hard for hedgehogs to digest, so give yours vegetables and fruits only sparingly.
Hedgehogs should always have fresh water available. A plastic bottle like one used for pet rabbits will work just fine.

, Your hedgehog will enjoy having some room to run around and have fun. A plastic wheel, such as one used for hamsters, is a good item to place in its cage. Your hedgehog will also enjoy having a place to hide, such as a sleep sac or plastic box. If your pet feels safe and happy, it will bond with you more quickly.You can also offer your hedgehog cat or dog toys to play with. Do make sure, however, that they have no parts that the hedgehog’s claws could become stuck it., Hedgehogs need warm environments, typically between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If your hedgehog is too hot or cold, it may become lethargic or irritable, and may not like being handled.If your hedgehog’s room is not quite warm enough, you can offer a supplemental heat source, such as a heat lamp, in addition to the warm dry bedding in its cage.

, Hedgehogs will normally want to live alone. Males in particular should not be caged together, since they may fight to the death. As long as your hedgehog feels safe and not threatened, it will likely bond with you., Especially when you first bring it home, your hedgehog may not want to be bothered or handled. This is completely normal. Once your hedgehog has had some time to learn about its new home and owner, it will start to bond with you. In the meantime, continue to talk softly to it, offer it treats, and try to pick it up when it seems willing."

Use snail mail.,
Stay in touch by phone.,

Consider a combination of the above methods for keeping in touch regularly.,
Consider what sorts of things to tell and share with your grandparents.,
Decide what sorts of things you'd like to send to your grandparents.,
Make plans with your parents and grandparents to visit sometimes.,
Spend quality time with your grandparents when you do visit one another.",How to Build a Bond with Grandparents Far Away," Although snail mail gets a bad rap these days, it's still the most personalized and delightful way to receive information from people. You can send cards, notes, drawings, printed photos, stories and more by mail, and your grandparents will be able to read it or pin up things without having to print out anything or read it online. In turn, your grandparents will send you things and you can have a reason to be excited about running to the mailbox now and then to check what's waiting for you.;
, Use a phone to keep in touch. Ask your parents which phone is best, perhaps the land-line, a mobile or cell phone or a computer phone service. The choice will depend on cost and how your grandparents feel about using the different types of technology. Organize a regular call time, such as once or twice a week or bi-weekly or monthly.

, Video chatting is a great way to be able to see each other and talk at the same time. A program such as Skype will enable you to do this. As with the phone, it may depend on how comfortable your grandparents feel about using this kind of technology. It can help to have someone set everything up for them and show them how to use it the first few times. Perhaps you could do that one visit, or ask a close family member or their neighbor to help set it up. Once again, decide how often you'll catch up for a video chat.

, This can be especially useful if you and your grandparents have different preferences and if it can save money.

, It's no good getting on the phone and going completely silent, making them do all of the talking. It will feel like a chore for everyone if that happens. Instead, make a list on paper prior to each talk so that you have plenty of topics to talk about. Things that you might like to talk about include: Your school happenings, sports results, things you've done with friends, places you've visited, favorite recipes, new discoveries you've made when learning, etc.


Ask your grandparents questions. Ask them about their week, the things that they've been doing lately and what their interests are. Ask them how their hobbies are going.

, It's a good idea to find things that they can hang up or place in their house somewhere to remind them of you. Some examples include: Artwork, photographs of you (including school photos), pictures you've drawn, things you've made, etc. It is also a nice idea to make gifts for your grandparents from time to time and send these over as parcels.

, You might go to see your grandparents with your family or by yourself, depending how old you are. Ask your grandparents to come and visit you and your family sometimes too.

, When you do get to see one another, try to spend some time alone with them, without other family members hogging the time too. This will give you a chance to have special time together.


Help out when visiting your grandparents. All grandparents love to see their grandchildren being helpful and making life easier for them.

If you’re with someone who is verbally, physically, or sexually abusive, ask yourself if this person is helping you grow. If you’re with someone who hurts you or someone who engages in unhealthy habits, it’s likely that you may get pulled down into bad habits or negative emotions. Focus on being in a healthy relationship and with a partner who encourages you to grow and better yourself.Find ways that your partner wants to grow and determine to help each other grow. For instance, you may want to get into a meditation habit while your partner wants to start a Qi Gong practice. Encourage each other to pursue these interests and recommend going to classes or engaging in individual practice. This way you can improve your own personal development while also encouraging your partner’s development.;
, Ask yourself what went wrong in past relationships or what has led to fights in this relationship. Do you notice any patterns that carried over from relationship to relationship? These are good areas to work on.Perhaps you had a bad habit of not alerting your partner to changes in plans, being chronically late, or not following through on desired tasks (like taking out the garbage or buying groceries). Examine the old patterns and determine to improve them.


Reflect on what did not work well in past relationships (or previously in this relationship) and think of ways to approach situations differently. What can you do differently this time around? Take responsibility for creating change in yourself. Become a better communicator, be more romantic, or determine to spend more time with your partner. By showing you care and by being supportive, you can use these opportunities to become a better person.
For more information on changing bad habits, check out How to Change Bad Habits and How to Get Rid of Bad Habits.

, In long-term relationships, many changes can occur. You may change, your partner may change, and ultimately, these changes affect the relationship. Events can also change the relationship: moving, starting university, getting a new job, or having a baby can all greatly affect a relationship. Check in regularly with your partner and ask what changes are occurring and how they are positively or negatively affecting the relationship. How are your actions helping or hurting the relationship, and how are they affecting the overall quality of the relationship?Avoid growing apart as a result of change; instead, grow together. For instance, if your partner starts a new job, don’t let the long hours get in the way of spending time together. Find new ways to spend quality time together, such as cooking together or reading a book together.
Do your part to adapt well to change. It’s not your responsibility how your partner adapts, so keep the focus on what action you can take to adapt with change and be supportive to your partner.
When you notice yourself not adapting well or not checking in with your partner, set aside some time to talk. Talk about how to support each other and contribute to the quality of the relationship.

, When your partner speaks, listen intently. Don’t plan out what you want to say, but give your partner your full attention. When listening to your partner, pay attention to all your partner is saying, both in words and in non-verbal communication. Make eye contact and turn toward your partner. Turn off the tv and don’t allow yourself to become distracted.Active listening includes reflecting what your partner says for accurate understanding. For instance, you can say, “I hear you saying that you’ve had a hard day and are wanting to relax tonight.”

, Be willing to be open with your partner, share your feelings, and share your insecurities. When you are happy, upset, angry, hurt, or disappointed, let your partner know what’s going on. The more you hide from your partner, the less you involve your partner in your own life. Remember that your partner is not a mind-reader and cannot assume what you want or need. Share your feelings and allow your partner to do the same.If you feel hurt by something your partner did, gently bring it up in a way that does not include blame. Say, “It hurt my feelings when you chose to spend time with your friend when we had already made plans together. It made me feel like I was less important to you than your friend.”

, Empathy helps you relate to others better and understand others. Increasing empathy means being a better listener, understanding others better, and “getting” your partner’s emotional experience more and more. Empathy helps to resolve conflicts and heal emotional wounds.Be empathetic toward your partner and his or her experiences. If your partner has a hard day, ask what things can help. If your partner is complaining about difficulties with parents, listen and be supportive. Show your partner that you care about the emotional experience and want to support it.

, Forgiveness is the cornerstone of a relationship. It can be difficult to accept that other people do not see the world as you see it and that perceptions vary considerably, even within the same situation. Forgiveness means decreasing negative feelings toward the offending person and increasing compassion. It means walking away from the urge to punish the person or demand any sort of restitution.Remember that no one is perfect and that you will undoubtedly feel let down at some point in your relationship. Determine to be forgiving to your partner and practice letting go of the negative feelings.

, Perhaps you notice your critical nature when you take your partner out to eat, feeling the need to criticize the food, wait service, or restaurant. Or you may be critical of movies you watch together. Abate your criticism and focus on expressing pleasure and happiness when together.Focusing on positive aspects can help you show your partner that you enjoy spending time together.


Express how happy you are when you’re with your partner. Let your partner know you enjoy his or her company and that you enjoy sharing experiences together.

, Be kind to your partner at all times, even when it’s difficult to do so. If you feel lovingly toward your partner or if you feel angry or upset toward your partner, you can always respond and act in kindness. Being kind to others can help your own happiness, too.For the next 10 days, do one kind thing for your partner each day. This can include packing lunch, folding the laundry, buying a gift, or make your partner dinner. Then, see how you feel and how your relationship changes.
For more information, check out How to Be Kind.

, Living in a grateful manner can have huge health implications, including decreasing depression, improving relationships, strengthen your immune system, and increase overall happiness.Express gratitude in your relationship. Express gratitude for your partner being in your life, for the experiences you share, and for the things your partner does to make the relationship better for each of you.


Write a letter of gratitude to your partner. Say all of the things you appreciate about your partner. Your partner will feel appreciated and you will also get a boost of happiness.

, Having compassion for yourself is an excellent foundation for a relationship. Practice being gentle toward yourself in times of failure and disappointment. Practicing compassion toward yourself helps you be more compassionate toward other people, including your romantic partner.Compassion is an important part of a healthy relationship.


Take care of your body, and take care of your mental and emotional health. Monitor your negative thoughts about yourself, and engage in healthy thoughts about your body, abilities, and self.
For more information, check out How to Love Yourself.

, Sleep deprivation can greatly impact your daily functioning, but it can also have great influence in your relationship. Do you notice you become snappier, more irritable or less pleasant with your partner when you haven’t rested well? Sleep can affect your mental alertness, energy levels, and mood.You may have difficulty controlling your emotions, feel irritable, require naps, or have difficulty concentrating when not getting enough sleep. Most adults need 7 and a half hours to 9 hours of sleep per night, and children need more sleep.Also, encourage your partner to sleep well.


Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. Following a schedule can help your body settle into a routine. Also, resist the urge to nap or go to bed early, even if you’re sleepy. Instead, do a light activity like making a phone call or cleaning up dinner.If you have a hard time settling down before bed, do some relaxation techniques to help calm your mind and body. Practice breathing exercises or engage in some mindful meditation, deep breathing, or relaxation before falling asleep.
For more information, check out How to Sleep Better.

, Exercise can benefit both your body and your mind. People who exercise tend to be happier, less stressed, and less depressed. Exercising helps you deal with stress and can help you in your relationship. The many benefits of exercise include mental and emotional well-being, reducing physical health risks, boosting mood, improving sex life, promoting sleep, and boosting energy.Exercising as a couple can help you commit to regularly exercising and improving your health. Find time to exercise with your partner, go to the gym together, or take a yoga or cycling class together.

, Smelling good is a huge turn-on for girls. If you smell good, it increases your level of attractiveness. This does not mean you need to spray a whole can of Axe on yourself before a date! If you shower daily (again, girls love clean men) and apply a tiny bit of cologne or body spray, you are good to go. Stick with one scent, that way when she smells that specific scent she will think of you!

, Chivalry is very much alive today! Open doors for her, pull out her chair, don't burp or fart in front of her, say ""please"" and ""thank you"".

, Take her on spontaneous day trips, kiss her when she doesn't expect it, take her to fun places like Disneyland, laugh with her, make jokes with her, or dance with her in the grocery store.

, Being romantic doesn't mean you have to spend your life savings on a romantic dinner for two and Luciano's Italian restaurant. Yes, that would be romantic, but it's really the little things that make girls go crazy! Leave her little notes, call/email/text her just to see how her day is going, send her love letters (in the real mail, not email), tell her she's beautiful, leave a single rose on her doorstep.

, If she is grumpy, you'd better come to her every need. Don't say, ""You're grumpy, you must be on your period!"" because if she is, boy, you're dead. Be considerate of her feelings, ask her what's wrong, then insist she tell you (because she will lie and say that nothing's wrong). Be there for her when she needs you most. Let her cry mascara all over your favorite tee shirt; she will remember that you let her do this and it will make her love you even more.

, Volunteer at a soup kitchen/animal shelter, go on a missions trip, donate to a charity, or visit the elderly. All of these make a man smokin' hot.

, Never act cocky or stuck-up; always treat her with politeness and kindness.

, Ask her questions and learn about her interests. Tell her the little things about her that you love. Maybe it's her smile, perhaps it's her caring nature, or possibly her incredible sense of humor. Don't tell her she's ""hot"" or ""sexy""; tell her she's ""beautiful"", ""irreplaceable"". Let her know that you value her thoughts and respect her as a person.

, Show to girls what kind of ability you have. And always improve, enrich and work on your skills. Because girls don't like similarity. Show her you are the best in her life."

By focusing your eyes and thoughts on your special someone, you are communicating to them that you value them over everything else.;
, Smiling at your partner, daily (even for no reason at all) communicates to them that you are sharing a moment with them and that your thoughts about them are positive. Many a relationship falls apart because partners forget to show pleasure. A blank expression, or perpetual frown, communicates to your significant other that you are unhappy; naturally, they will assume that they are displeasing you.

, Exploring your significant other physically is vital to intimacy building. Touching your partner's face with your fingertips as you look at them, or kiss them, demonstrates focus and adoration. Experiment with light and firm touches and enjoy the sensations touches add to your relationship.

, Energy is passed between people when their hands touch. Thoughts are communicated by this simple gesture, as well, so when you take your partner's hand, make sure your thoughts reflect good feelings about them.

, You've no doubt heard people say that they are ""keeping you in their thoughts and prayers"" and you know how meaningful that statement is. If you suspected, however, that their thoughts and prayers went along the lines of thinking you're stupid and praying you drop dead, you wouldn't get any warm fuzzy out of the statement. Bearing this in mind, when you think of your partner, keep your thoughts positive. If you've noticed something about them that irritates you, put it out of your mind and focus on the wonderful contributions they've made to your life. Consider your mate a gift given especially to you and don't waste any time feeling unappreciative of that gift.

, As you go about your daily routine, interacting with others at work, at school, or with your family, take care to uphold your mate to others. Speaking well of your mate communicates to others that you place a great deal of value on your ability to judge the character of others and that you hold your mate in the highest esteem. You might be surprised to know how often a friend or family member repeats what you say to your significant other; make sure your mate only hears good things about themselves when this happens.

, You take care to present yourself well, publicly, now extend the same courtesy to your mate. When you interact with your mate in public places (including your home, if you have guests or family visiting), speak respectfully to them. If they make a mistake, minimize the impact of that mistake and preserve their dignity, rather than pointing out the mistake to others who may or may not have noticed. Conduct yourself as if you are proud of your mate and the relationship you are in by not inviting others to interfere or interlope.

, No one is immune to self-doubt, so take care to point out the wonderful things your significant other does and says, regularly. Be genuine with your mate and never minimize their accomplishments and achievements. When they're feeling low, remind them of their real value to the world, your community and your home.

, There is a lot to be said for taking care of the little things your mate needs and enjoys. Putting your own needs before those of your mate has a 100% relationship failure rate because being in a relationship means taking a risk that your own needs might not always be met, fully. If you choose to self-serve and self-protect, you aren't taking advantage of all the wonderful things your relationship has to offer; you are sabotaging and short-changing yourself and your intimacy with your mate will suffer.

, Take care when you are angry (even with your mate) that you keep your voice and your body under strict control. You would never scream and rant at your boss for a slight in the workplace, and you certainly wouldn't hit him or her, so do not subject your mate to such extremes. Screaming and crying, raising your voice and yelling, cursing and degrading, and striking objects or people, is expected behavior within the confines of mental institutions, rehabilitation centers, and possibly prisons, but nowhere else. Your mate must trust you, or any intimacy you wish to preserve or build is lost.

, Life can become very hectic; protect your time with your mate from outside interests and activities. Being together, even for a few minutes each day, helps build intimacy and sustain it. How much time you choose to spend with your mate determines the quality of your relationship. You've made another person a significant part of your life, make sure that you are giving more than lip-service to the concept.

, Building intimacy requires trust, so be loyal to your mate or move on to someone whose standards match your own. Resist the urge, and any and all invitations, to get involved romantically with others. Loyalty is not tricky if you adopt the attitude that by being loyal you are devoted to your mate's best interest.

Talk frequently.,
Talk face to face.,
Try to be as good of a listener as you are a speaker.",How to Build and Maintain Strong Relationships1," This may seem obvious, but taking the time to talk with someone shows them you like them. The people we talk with most frequently are generally the people we consider ourselves to have the best relationships with.;
, According to Forbes Magazine, “being able to see a person’s body language, facial expressions, and gestures makes a world of difference in building a relationship.” This is because talking face-to-face communicates more information to us faster than words ever could.


By utilizing body language, tone-of-voice, and social context, the speaker’s true message can be sent more efficiently. In this way, communication is enhanced, misunderstandings are less frequent, and relationships become built on strong foundations.

, Some people consider it more important to be heard and contribute to a conversation. Others believe it is more important to listen than to speak. Simply put, they are both wrong.


Speaking and listening is equally important in any conversation. If you spend too much time talking, you won't ever hear what the other person in the relationship has to say. Similarly, by spending too much time listening, you won't have any of your opinions heard. Conversations are meant to be a two-sided discussion.

Accept change.,
Treat people with respect.,
Treat yourself with respect.",How to Build and Maintain Strong Relationships2," How often have you lost a close friend because you “just grew apart”? It's common to lose contact with people as we get older and our interests change, but some relationships are strong enough to survive this test of time. This is because these relationships are not based primarily on common interests.


Shifting the base of the relationship to something a bit deeper, such as an admiration, or an appreciation for that particular individual allows one to accept small differences in interests, likes and dislikes. By focusing the relationship on the other person and not the things associated with them, we gain the ability to respect them and their individuality.

, “Relationships function like a mirror--eventually that change will reflect back onto how you are treated.” -Lolly Daskal, President, and CEO, Lead From Within. This quote is pretty self-explanatory. There is no quicker way to weaken a relationship than by not being able to respect those around you.


Conversely, respect can be gained by being considerate of others. This does not mean you have to agree with everything your boss says or see eye-to-eye with your siblings, but being able to calmly acknowledge and set aside differences helps people overcome otherwise troublesome differences.

, If the other person in the relation doesn't respect you, it can hardly be considered healthy. However, many people find if difficult to respect those who cannot respect themselves. If you are able to stand up for yourself in difficult situations and express when aspects of a relationship are negatively impacting you, then you greatly improve communication in a relationship and set up a sturdier, healthier relationship dynamic. In this situation, both people are able to function independently but choose to work together, as opposed to one relying on the other to stand up for them.

Don’t be afraid to make the first move.,
Try new things.,
Rebuild enthusiasm by remembering why you started a relationship in the first place.",How to Build and Maintain Strong Relationships3," This is key, especially when it comes to building new relationships. This was already mentioned previously in this article, but the rise of technology has made face to face communication difficult, especially for younger people. According to a recent Gallup poll, texting is the most common form of communication for Americans under the age of 50.


Because of this, people are less skilled at asking others out on dates or scheduling hangouts with potential friends. However, if the relationship is truly something you want to pursue, start small, but go for it! Every relationship has to start somewhere.

, While common interests shouldn't be the only thing sustaining a long term, deep relationship, it's a great place to start. Broadening the range of activities you choose to take part in increases the chance of meeting someone you connect well with. It also gives you more conversation starters and can cause people to perceive you as a more interesting, well-rounded person.

, Are your relationships missing that “spark” they once had? Lack of enthusiasm is a sign your relationship is in need of a jumpstart. Often times, boredom occurs in relationships because you have grown used to being around the same person all the time. Remembering the reasons you initially chose to pursue a relationship can sometimes put things back into perspective.

Understand that a network of good relationships makes for a quality support system.,
Be aware that collaborative work happens in life, regardless of anyone's background.,
Focus on the big picture.",How to Build and Maintain Strong Relationships4," Life isn't perfect. Sometimes we are let down, put in compromising situations, or quickly expected to deal with unforeseen mishaps. During the difficult times in life, family, friends, and loved ones can all be counted on to lend a helping hand. They can provide advice, boost morale, and emotional or even financial support.

, How many times have you been in a class where the teacher asked you to split into groups? How many times have you had to find a group in a class you didn't have any friends in?

, Establishing strong relationships with people helps develop social skills and makes it easier to make friends. In fact, relationship-making has a huge impact on the development of children and adults. Developing friendships in a child’s formative years can affect their ability to share, problem-solve, and work as a team. Adults are also heavily influenced by the behavior of their friends and peers. Healthy relationships will facilitate healthy lives in the future.


There are countless other advantages to having friends and strong relationships. Here are just a few:

Gives a sense of belonging
Boosts self-esteem
Increases life expectancy
Reduces stress
Reduces Loneliness
Can reduce chances of developing stress-related illnesses

Realize that not telling the truth and lying is the same thing.,
Be considerate about what you're telling the person.,
JUST DO IT, as Nike says.,
Put yourself in your partners shoes and feel how they would feel about it.,
Find out why you lie.,
Be yourself and be confident.,
Know that there are many reactions to your change.",How to Be Truthful to Your Partner," You can't get past this point if you don't realize you are straight-up lying to the person and its wrong.;
, If it's going to hurt them, it was worth telling them because it will be better for the both of you. If you don't feel good, tell them. Then, if they don't feel good either, work to a solution. Telling them how you feel is a benefit. They can let you know if you are going over the top, or maybe when you tell them they will realize they are going over the top. Tell them your feelings whether they be good or bad and work for a solution.

, Don't lie about anything! Just come right out and tell the truth to every last detail. S/He'll have more respect for you this way. Maybe if you just obligate yourself to breaking the habit, break through the moment and let your fears come at you every time you tell the truth when you want to lie, it will happen for you. Keep in mind that this works after you understand why you want to stop lying. Don't just obligate yourself because you know its what everyone else does. Realize its better for the both of you (think about you and him/her).

, Take a minute to realize that what you've told them isn't easy to cope with. Don't get angry if they can't trust you after you told them you lied. How can they believe you? What if its another lie? Even if they get picky about the smallest things you do after the big change, deal with it unless your partner is not worth it to you. You did the wrong, after all, by lying...

, Realize that lying is not the solution. Try not to make excuses for why you lie to them. If you lying to them because you are afraid is really that big of an issue, then it may be abuse. If you can find yourself and you know your fear or reason to lie, its not as good as telling the truth. If you are lying to protect yourself, telling the truth will open your and his/her eyes and get you used to things.

, Lying to him/her is as good as you not being around and anyone taking your place. Be yourself. You lying to your partner is a fake relationship and it, while they don't know it, is painful to hang out with someone who lied to you the whole time.

, Its painful for them because you lied to them before. It was definitely nice of you to tell them you were a liar, but just because you told them doesn't mean you are suddenly changed. They have to see it and feel it with you. That takes time. If you lied before, they might not be able to trust you now. Some may accept you right away, but that never means to take it lightly.

Tell her that you love her.,
Share moments of intimacy.,
Listen to her.,
Be confident when you are around her.,
Look good for her.,
Make her feel special.,
Take your girlfriend on dates.,
Be chivalrous.,
Celebrate birthdays and/or special events.,
Keep in touch with her.,
Visit your girlfriend's parents.,
Join an activity she is in.,
Surprise her.",How to Be Sweet to Your Girlfriend," This is a fairly simple step, but it goes a long way. People that are in long-term relationships tend to forget, after the first month of dating, that they should say the simple words ""I love you."" Simple works best, rather than long drawn out speeches about your overwhelming love for her.Casually mention it to her when she is particularly stressed. This will lift her spirits, and show that you are there for her in her time of need.
Try to say it when you leave her for the day, and when you first see her again. Saying ""I love you"" never gets old.
Use variations of ""I love you."" You could say things like ""You mean so much to me,"" or I don't know what I would do without you."" Change it up every so often so that it doesn't become formulaic.;
, Hug her when she is feeling sad, or when she is elated over excited news. Before you leave her, and when you see her, always give her a kiss. Being there when she needs physical intimacy is also crucial. When you date someone, part of a healthy relationship is to have physical contact. This could mean a deep kiss, or sex, depending on the moment/situation.It is also key to let her have space when she needs it. There is nothing sweet about a constantly horny guy always seeking sex. Make sure that she wants physical contact before you engage.
Sometimes even simple things like a pat on the back, or a rub on the shoulder can comfort her in both good and bad times. Analyze the situation to pick the best means of physical contact.

, Find out what kind of person she is. Ask her questions about her childhood, likes, dislikes, hobbies, jobs, family, friends, and anything else that you can think of. Listen to her when she tells you these stories. If you both begin to talk at the same time, let her speak first. This shows that you respect what she has to say, and are there for her.The key is to be interested in what she has to say, even if you aren't so interested in the topic. This means that you care about a particular topic, because she cares about it.
Stay engaged when you are listening to her talk. Nod your head, and occasionally give input, or ask a follow up question. If she becomes teary eyed over a sad story, rub her shoulder, hug her, or wipe away her tears.
Take note of what she has to say. By listening to her, you can pick up hints about certain things. She might talk about a diamond ring she saw, that you can later pick up as a birthday present. She might talk about how much she hates a certain music artist, so you can make sure to never have their songs playing in the house.

, This doesn't mean that you have to be a tough guy. Rather, sit up straight when you are around her. Put your arm around her shoulder. Speak calmly and clearly when you want to say something. It is sweet when you can just talk to her without feeling worried about what she might think.In particular, being confident is about being open. This could mean that you tell her something that has been bothering you. It could be that your parents aren't doing well health wise, or you think that something needs to change in the relationship in order for it to work.
Being confident also includes talking about your fantasies. This could mean sexual fantasies, or just your hopes for the future. Be imaginative in what you have to say. You and your girlfriend might also end up having a lot in common if you explore what is deep inside.

, If you always look like you have just gotten out of bed, try cleaning yourself up a bit. You don't have to go overboard, but you can go out and get a fresh haircut. Shave off that stubble that always scratches her face. Wear a dress shirt and khakis rather than sweatpants and a t-shirt.Take a nice long bath, followed by deodorant and body spray.
Make sure to brush your teeth at least twice a day. Your girlfriend will appreciate it when you go to kiss her.
Not only is this about you taking care of your own personal hygiene and well-being, but also showing that you care about your girlfriend. She wants to be around someone who smells good, and takes care of himself.

, Don't just treat her as a friend. You want to show her you put her above everyone else in your life. This could mean that you don't hang out with your buddies one night watching football. Instead, you spend the evening cuddling with your girlfriend in bed. Don't always spend time complaining about what is happening in your life. Spend more time talking about her problems/successes and your goals as a couple., Even if you are a committed couple, it is always nice to go out on dates. This shows your girlfriend that you care about her and want to always win her over. You can go out to a nice restaurant. Maybe go somewhere she has always wanted to go to, like New York, or a local play. Take her somewhere surprising, like an amusement park or a hiking trip. The possibilities are nearly endless.When you go on a date, it is always polite to volunteer to pay. If you already have decided to mutually share the cost, then go with your normal routine.
This can be a great time to get to know your partner better as well as to become more intimate.

, Open doors for her, pull out a seat for her, and pick up her things if she drops them. If you are on the train/bus, give her your seat if there are no others. Offer to carry her bag. When you walk on the sidewalk, you should walk on the side closest to the street to protect her from cars, and splashes in the rain.While some of these things are old-fashioned, they show her that you care about her.
Never think you are less of a man because you are treating your girlfriend with respect. Not only will your girlfriend appreciate your chivalrous actions, but you will also feel great seeing that smile on her face.

, Do something special for Valentine's Day, and always remember her birthday. Buy a card from the nearest drug store, or you can even make your own. Buy her gifts, such as stuffed animals, chocolate, flowers, etc.For her's and your's anniversary, you should go all out. This means you should make reservations at a nice restaurant, or cook a nice meal at home for her. Dress up nicely when you go out, shave, and appear presentable. Decorate the house with rose pedals and/or anniversary streamers.
You might want to run a warm bath for her on her birthday. Pour in a lot of bubble bath mix as the warm water pours out of the faucet. Lay down rose pedals into the bath so that she will follow them and be happily surprised.

, You can send your girlfriend a sweet text message, simply saying ""I love you,"" or asking her how her day is going. Call her to ask if she wants anything from the grocery store, or if she is having an emergency. If you are far away from her for a while, you can always send an email. This way you can lay out a larger amount of information, rather than a single, short text message.Another great option is a letter. It is an antiquated, yet timeless way to show your partner you care. Because it takes more time to write a letter out and send it, your girlfriend will be even more impressed and thankful.

, This can be a sweet gesture, and allow you to familiarize yourself with your girlfriend's family. You can do this on any day, but particularly around holidays. Bring a gift for them, such as chocolate or flowers. This will make a good impression with your girlfriend, as well as keep you in good standing with her parents.Make sure to compliment them on their house when you visit. Check with your girlfriend ahead of time to find out what they are interested in. This way you will always have something to talk about (don't want to argue politics, especially during the first meeting).
Tell them how much you like being with their daughter, and what an amazing person she is. However, this can quickly go into the creepy realm. Try and stay away from overdoing it, kissing your girlfriend intensely in front of them, etc.

, This can be an sweet thing to do, especially if you are not good or fond of the activity. You might join a book club she is in, or you might join her tennis team. She might like hiking, biking, or simply taking a run every morning. As long as you put forth effort, she will take notice. The objective is to try your best, and show that you care about what she cares about.


Make sure to not intrude on her space. While most activities couples can do together, there is some healthy separation time needed in every relationship. If she would rather do an activity on her own, respect her wishes.
This is also a great time to get to know your partner better. When you are running, or climbing a mountain, you have time alone with her that you can ask her questions. Get more intimately engaged as time goes on.

, Bring her roses simply because you want to do so. Maybe bake her a special treat for lunch. Go out a buy her some chocolate when she is having a bad day. The key thing is to always be ""seeking"" your girlfriend, trying to win her over. You never want to become too complacent when you date someone, so doing little surprises will let her know she is constantly on your mind.Go to her job and bring her something special. This not only shows that you care, but will also impress her coworkers, and show them that she has picked a great guy to be with.
Leave little notes on her pillow, the kitchen counter, or on the fridge. These notes could read something sweet like ""I love you"" or ""I hope you have a great day at work."" Something simple and sweet goes a long way to showing how much you think about her.

Ask yourself what you fear most from being open with someone. You may be trying to avoid getting hurt or trying to avoid hurting the other person in the relationship. Your ego may be preventing you from revealing what you see as weaknesses. Be as honest as possible with yourself as you analyze your fears.


It may help to write it down on a piece of paper so that you can more clearly visualize your reasoning.;
, There's a lot to gain from being vulnerable with someone, like a deeper sense of connection, more trust, and greater contentment. Focusing on these outcomes will help you get past whatever fears you may have. Find activities that help you stay positive, whether it be exercise, meditation, or journaling., Seek out a friend or family member who you feel most comfortable opening up to. Share with them the concerns you have about being vulnerable with others. They may be able to provide a perspective you haven't seen before. This can also serve as a rehearsal for being more open with someone else., If you’re struggling to deal with opening up on your own, don’t be afraid to talk to a licensed therapist. They can help you work through your issues, either by simply listening or by giving you advice. Share the list you made about why you're afraid to be vulnerable or any past experiences that led you to feel this way., Pick one thing you want to share with the other person in the relationship and start there. Don't try to share every worry and fear you have at once. This will overwhelm both you and the other person.


Try starting with something small, like sharing a worry you have about your career or a concern you have for a family member. Or show the person a hobby you've been working on that not many people know about.

, Start difficult conversations by stating what you want from the other person. Ask them to simply listen if you just want to vent frustrations. Be clear about whether you want advice. This can help you feel more in control if you’re anxious about what you’re going to share.Try starting with, ""I'd really like to get all this out before you say anything."" Or ask, ""Can I just vent right now?""

, Be honest with the other person in the relationship about your concerns. Talk about any past experiences that have led you to want to hide your feelings. This will allow them to understand why you may hesitate to share your feelings. And they will know that you're trying to improve your communication.


After admitting your difficulties, try using a phrase like, ""I'm working on it."" Request that they point out instances in the future where you could open up more.

, Tell the other person something you did wrong or are ashamed of. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's likely the other person will be able to relate to it. People are drawn to others who are authentic and down-to-earth, so don't try to hide your imperfections.If you're ready for it, you can reveal something big, like a mistake that ended a past relationship. But even something small can help. Keep a mental log of interactions during the day that could have gone better. Maybe you were rude to a stranger and regret not being more kind. Revealing this shows the other person that you're reflective and conscientious.

, Everyone wants to appear knowledgeable, but pretending like you know everything comes across as arrogant. Ask the other person to explain something to you if you don't get it. This will earn their respect and boost their confidence while also showing that you trust them.You could ask them to explain a complex political issue or something they do at work that you don't understand. Or request that they teach you a new skill, like cooking or playing a sport.

, Bottling your emotions can lead to anger and frustration. But admitting that something is bothering you can help you address the problem immediately, and the other person will see your attempt at honesty.


You don't always have to speak your emotions. You can write them down or express them through music as a way of communicating them to the other person., It is likely that the other person will be receptive to you, and you will feel comfortable opening up more. But even if you don’t get the reaction you wanted, you still overcame your fear and found the courage to be vulnerable.


If you appreciated their response the first time, thank them for being receptive to you. If their response was hurtful, share those feelings with them so they're aware of how their reaction affected you.
Verbally expressing emotions helps you overcome them more quickly, so whatever the outcome, you've still done something good for yourself.Be proud of the steps you’ve taken to be more authentic, and repeat the behavior in this and other relationships.

Be honest.,
Don’t divulge everything.,
Admit your mistakes.,
Don’t take it personally.",How to Bond With Small Children1," t’s okay to admit when you don’t know the answer or even that something had you a little scared. Children, especially older ones, can sense insincerity. Being honest with children lets them know that you are authentic and that they can trust you, which is one of the biggest part of forming a bond.It also sets an example for how you would like them to be with you.


For example, tell them that you’re honestly a little nervous about getting to know them.
If a child asks you about something difficult, traumatic, or scary that they see or hear about, then be honest and age-appropriate about the situation.;
, Although you should be honest with young children as much as possible, sometimes children will ask you things that are a little too personal, or about a topic that is too mature for their age. Sometimes they do this out of genuine curiosity, sometimes just as a “test” to see how much you will tell them.


If a child asks you something that you aren’t comfortable answering, then try saying, “that’s a conversation for another day” or, “Wow! That’s a really big question. I need some time to think about that”.
You can also say, “I'm honestly not comfortable talking about that right now.”

, Doing so sets a good example for children and strengthens your bond with them in several ways. It lets them know that you are human and relatable. It also demonstrates to them that it is okay to mess up, as well as how to handle it.


Don’t let a fear of making a mistake with or around the child stop you from bonding with them. If you make mistake, it just shows them that you are human.
For example, you might try saying, “I made a mistake. I thought I was supposed to do it this way, but I wasn’t”.

, Children are known for saying things that can be insensitive, rude, and just plain mean. Taking it personally can cause you to develop resentment toward the child which would definitely prevent you from bonding. Let the child know that it is not okay, but don’t let it hurt your feelings or make you angry.


Often, especially with younger children, they don’t realize that what they are saying is hurting. Gently let them know that what they said was not okay. If needed give them another way to say it.
Older children may do it intentionally as part of acting out, or even just because they are experiencing natural hormone changes that are making them moody.

Explain that you are not interested.,
Block contact.If you have clearly and firmly asked the person to stop contacting you, and he continues anyway, the next step is to block this person from your social media profiles or chat-rooms.,

Involve the police.",How to Deal With a Man That Will Not Take No for Answer1," With everyone everywhere on a smart phone, tablet, or laptop, technology is fast becoming one of the primary ways humans communicate. Social media networks, online forums, and dating websites and chat-rooms are common stomping grounds for creeps who won't take no for an answer. Perhaps you were previously friendly with another user and he said or did something that made you uncomfortable. You have a right to tell him to back off.


In the clearest way possible, tell him that you are no longer interested in chatting or maintaining contact. Request that the person stop contacting you. Your request might be as straightforward as ""Can you please stop contacting me?"";
, Removing this guy as a friend or follower should prevent him from being able to contact you any further.

Typically, these customer service agents will make haste of blocking this person and the person will not be able to contact you again.

, If you gave out your email address, or if it was listed on your user accounts, it might be a good idea to change it. If the person has not been contacting you via email, you may be okay to keep using your current one.

, If a person online is stalking you, it's important to gather any inappropriate messages, emails, photos, or other means of contact to show to someone in authority. If you are not sure if your case counts as cyberstalking, consider the following. Cyberstalking occurs when someone:Monitors your computer or internet use or social media posts
Posts inappropriate pictures or spreads rumors about you online
Threatens to hurt you or someone you care about
Messages, texts, or contacts you when you do not want him to
Sends you viruses or content that potentially damaging to you computer or phone

, If blocking this person or getting help from a chat-room or social media website administrator doesn't solve the problem, you need to get legal assistance. Contact the cops and bring them up to date on the situation, being sure to provide them with evidence to help your case.

You will need to actively change the way you think about your friend to stop seeing them as a potential romantic partner.
Try to catch yourself whenever you have romantic or sexual thoughts about your friend. Wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap the band against your skin to stop unwanted thoughts as soon as they arise.It may help reduce your attraction to your friend if you think of them as more of a sibling or close family member. Thinking about the person in this way may reduce your feelings of attraction over time.

, A lack of personal boundaries can quickly make a crush on your friend get intense or even uncomfortable. Remember that your friendship is valuable to you and that engaging in a romantic or sexual relationship with your friend could ruin things.Remain friends, but restrain yourself from doing boyfriend/girlfriend things. For example, avoid holding hands, snuggling intimately, or kissing.
Consider limiting your interactions or outings. Try limiting yourself to hanging out once a week.

, If seeing your friend one-on-one is not a good idea, you may need to spend time together with a group of friends. Being around other people can create more of a social setting while removing some of the temptation and romantic tension that might exist if you and your friend were alone.Make up excuses if your friend wants to get together one-on-one, or stick to spending time alone together in public places. For example, get coffee or go to the park instead of spending time at one another's homes.
It's up to you to decide whether you will tell your other friends about your feelings. If there's any chance your other friends would reveal your feelings or make fun of you, you may want to avoid telling them.

, Revealing your feelings to a friend who doesn't reciprocate could make that friend feel uncomfortable, confused, or even frustrated. Even if you think you could talk to your friend about anything, talking about having romantic feelings for that friend could permanently change the dynamic of your friendship.


See if setting some boundaries and spending less time with your friend causes your feelings to start to subside. Your feelings may resolve on your own and you won't need to bring it up with your friend.
If your friend is already in a relationship (or you are in a relationship) or has already expressed that they are not interested in you romantically, then you should not reveal your feelings and instead work on moving on to someone else.
It may, however, become necessary for you to have an honest discussion with your friend about how you feel. If the feelings won't go away, or your friend has told you they are hurt and confused because you are pulling away, it might be a good idea to tell them what's going on.

, Finding distractions will help you get over the feelings you had for your friend. This may include doing things you already enjoy doing, or it may entail going out and trying new things or meeting new people.Make plans with friends or family at least a few times each week. Keep interacting with others to take your mind off of your feelings for your friend.
You can still stay busy if your friends/family aren't available. Go for long walks or bike rides, explore your city, pick up a hobby, or take a class to learn something new.

, Getting over romantic feelings for a friend is very similar to going through a breakup. You may feel sad, angry, and a range of other emotions, and those emotions may take away your motivation to get through the day; however, maintaining normalcy in your life and taking care of yourself are required more than ever at times like this.Get a lot of exercise. You'll burn off some of your frustration and experience the endorphin release that accompanies physical activity.
Try to get an average of 30 minutes of physical activity each day. Most experts recommend getting a total of 150 minutes each week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of intense aerobic activity each week.Do things that you enjoy, like going shopping or seeing friends. These distractions can make you feel good and take your mind off of your friend.
Make sure you maintain a nutritious diet and keep up your daily bathing and grooming habits. Some people recovering from heartbreak neglect these daily routines, but ultimately such behavior makes it harder to bounce back and feel better.

, If you've had to distance yourself from a friend you developed feelings for, you may be experiencing a lot of difficult emotions. Keeping those thoughts and feelings bottled up will only cause you to continue dwelling on them. Instead, talk them out with friends whom you can trust or with a qualified therapist.If talking with friends about your experience, make sure you choose friends you can trust. The last thing you want is to be made fun of or for your crush to find out about your feelings.
If you decide to work with a therapist, ask your primary care physician for a recommendation in your area.
A therapist has the added advantage of helping you beyond this immediate problem. You'll be able to discover patterns of behavior and find ways to work through other problems in your life.

, You may be afraid of telling your friend how you feel — it can be scary to make yourself vulnerable to rejection, and you risk changing or ending your relationship. If you choose to talk to your friend, you may need to build up your courage before having that conversation. Being brave means facing your fears and do something that is uncomfortable. Remember that change and growth requires you to push yourself and do something challenging. Practice what you'll say to your friend so that you become more comfortable expressing yourself.


Do things that build your confidence. This may mean saying affirmations out loud, doing an activity you know you're good at, or reminding yourself of your accomplishments.
Remind yourself that if your friend is not interested, it doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. Romantic feelings can't be forced, and sometimes people just don't feel it. In the majority of cases it has more to do with the other person than with you.

, Ask your friend if they can meet you at a time when you are both free to talk at length. Meet somewhere you can speak in private and where you feel comfortable. Doing this in front of other people or making a big gesture might put even more pressure on your friend or make them panic.

, If you have tried to avoid falling in love with your friend but it happened anyway, you may need to express those feelings. If you've thought through the risks of telling them and feel it's worth the risk, you may want to tell your friend. It's not healthy to bottle up your feelings, and if it's torturing you or causing issues with your friendship, it's probably your best option to tell them how you are feeling. It's not necessary to make a huge declaration — just be honest, clear, and not too over the top (it may be a shock to your friend to find out about your feelings, so keep it low-key if possible).Try saying something like, ""My feelings toward you have changed, and I like you as more than a friend. I would like to try having a romantic relationship with you. How does that make you feel?""

, Once you have expressed yourself, it's time to let your friend respond. Try to put aside your fears about being rejected or plan what you'll say when your friend stops talking and truly listen. Make eye contact, ask questions if you need to, and try repeating back what is said to confirm you understand.Respect whatever your friend says they feel. They may feel surprised, confused, angry, or any number of emotions. If your friend says they are not interested in a romantic relationship with you, don't try to talk them into it or argue. If they say they are confused and need some time to think, tell them you can give them space and that you will be available to talk more when they are ready.

, If you have feelings for your friend, you'll need time to sort through those feelings and figure out what your friendship means to you. Your friend may need time and space to figure things out as well, or simply to reduce any lingering tension between the two of you.While giving your friend space, it's best to limit the time you spend together, including time spent on the phone, texting, or chatting online.
Try to put your friend out of your mind as much as possible. You can do this by distracting yourself with hobbies or work, or by spending more time with a different friend.

, While you may not need to avoid your friend altogether, you should certainly avoid romantic scenarios together. Putting yourself into a situation in which you might develop even stronger feelings or be tempted to act on those feelings will only lead to frustration and may adversely affect your friendship.Resist the urge to enter date-like scenarios, such as going to the movies as a couple or dining at a romantic restaurant.
If you're above the legal drinking age, it may be best to avoid drinking with or around your friend. People often have lowered inhibitions when they're intoxicated, and you could end up making bad decisions., If you and your friend need some distance, you may want to decide in advance what that time frame might look like. You'll most likely want to return to having a normal friendship at some point, though this may take longer for some people than for others. Setting a rough time frame can help you track any changes (or lack thereof) in your feelings and determine when it's safe to spend time alone together again.


The time period you need apart is entirely subjective. Some people may need a few weeks, while others may need months or years.

, It's an extreme reaction, but for some people moving away is the best option. If you don't think your feelings for your friend will ever diminish and you're worried about how it may affect your relationship, you may want to consider a geographical change to fix the situation.You don't have to move far. Even moving to the other side of town or the next town over could make it sufficiently less-convenient to see one another.
Remember that moving away is a drastic change. A decision like this should not be made lightly over a low-key crush.

Make it clear how the narcissist is hurting themselves.",How to Deal with a Narcissist," Before you start tossing the word around, you need to remember that a lot of people have some narcissistic tendencies but aren't necessarily narcissists. By learning what makes a narcissist you'll be able to better avoid them and deal with the ones already in your life.









A narcissist lacks empathy. This is the big indicator that someone is more than simply self-obsessed. A narcissist simply cannot understand another person's point of view and cannot feel what other people feel, which means that they act only to help themselves. For example: someone at work gets a big promotion; instead of congratulating that person, the narcissist has to turn the spotlight back onto themselves, by talking about why they should have gotten the promotion instead, or simply about something really good that happened to them.A narcissist also has little or no insight into their own actions. They need to be constantly admired and feel entitled to the best treatment and to unquestioning compliance from everyone in their life.
To know whether or not you are dealing with a narcissist, ask yourself a series of questions. Does the suspected narcissist behave as though the world revolves around them? Do they need to be complimented before giving you their attention? If you disagree with them, do they attempt to shut you down? Are your own feelings minimized? Are your conversations always redirected so they become about the narcissist? If the answer to any of these questions is ""yes,"" you might be dealing with a narcissist.;
, On the other hand, if the narcissist in your life is interesting or vibrant in other ways, and you do not need additional support, the friendship or relationship can work for the time being.









You need to make sure that you're not harming yourself by staying in contact with the narcissist. This is especially true if you have a close relationship with them (such as that of spouse, or parent), because your time will be more taken up by them.
If you find yourself exhausted by their neediness (they need constant validation, praise, attention, and unwavering patience), then you need to rethink your relationship with them. If you are being abused by them (manipulated, constantly talked down to, treated like you have no value) you need to get out immediately, because they are dangerous for your health.

, If this person is truly important to you you will need to accept his or her narcissism. Stop asking or demanding support or attention from the narcissist that he or she is unable to provide. Doing so will accomplish nothing but making you feel more frustrated and disappointed, which will only damage the relationship more.









For example, if you know that your friend Bob is a narcissist, don't keep trying to bring up your own troubles with him, because he simply will not be able to empathize and will quickly turn the conversation back to himself.

, Do not go to a narcissist when looking for this type of support, though, since a narcissist will not be able to provide it.









Understand that even if you confide in that person, he or she will be unable to truly value the weight of what you've shared. They may, in fact, use this knowledge as means to manipulate you, so be careful what you tell a narcissist.
Remember that the narcissist's motto is ""Me first."" When dealing with them you will have to operate under their motto.

, This might be easier said than done, but remember: in spite of all the supposed self-confidence the narcissist displays, deep down, there is a severe lack of true confidence that requires the constant approval of others to subdue. Moreover, the narcissist does not have a full life because he or she shuts down a wide range of emotion.









This doesn't mean letting them do whatever they want with you. It means that you remember that the narcissist is a human being who has been turned into somebody who can't connect with other people. This often happens as a result of narcissistic parents.
Also remember that narcissists have no understanding of unconditional love. Everything they do comes under the purpose of how it best serves them, which is a terribly lonely way to live.
It may help you to have compassion if you can remember these negative behaviors are projections of their own self-hatred and feelings of inadequacy.

, A lot of narcissists play mind games that force you to constantly be on the defensive and which shore them up. The best way to deal with these games is to recognize the game and to stop playing. To deal with a narcissist you have to keep your ego out of the running.








Get out of playing the ""blame game."" A narcissist, obviously, cannot do any wrong in their own mind, which means they need someone to blame for any failures. At some point, it's going to be you. Instead of trying to argue, or explain how it's their fault, or get emotionally invested, you have to set boundaries. You have to keep track of what they've been doing, so you can say (in a non-accusatory tone) ""Hey Dan, here's the inventory count which shows we do need more paper.""
Narcissists tend to be really good liars. If you remember something very differently from them (especially if it puts them in a bad light) don't start doubting yourself. Don't try to argue it, however, unless you have absolute empirical evidence that you're right. Even then, a narcissist will manage to turn the whole thing around to reflect well on them.
The most important thing to remember is to cultivate a non-responsive attitude towards them. If you have a narcissist in your life, there will be jabs, put-downs, and lies. Don't respond. It's like a game of catch, only you don't need to catch the ball and throw it back. In fact, let the ball (the insults, mind games, etc.) sail right on past.

, Since the narcissist has a large ego and thinks overly well of himself or herself, they will likely see you as someone who is, in some ways, inferior. You might be able to win the narcissist's favor on a short-term basis, but you should never expect to be able to satisfy or impress a narcissist in the long-term.









Be prepared to fall short in their estimation, often. You will never be able to live up to what they expect you to be, which is someone who dances complete attention on them.
Try not to take their criticism to heart, by reminding yourself that it comes from a very off-balanced world view. Likewise, don't try to argue your merits with the narcissist, because they will be unable to hear you.
If they're constantly belittling you (whether a spouse, a parent, a boss) find someone you trust to talk over what they say (a trusted friend, a counselor, etc). If you can, get some space from the narcissist for recovery purposes.

, If you have to engage with the narcissist, the best way to deal is to simply listen. The narcissist will demand your attention and your ear, and will likely get angry or cold with you if you neglect to provide it. Everything has limits, of course, and if the narcissist in your life is demanding your attention at a time you cannot provide it, you should not cave in. If you plan on being in a friendship or other relationship with a narcissist, however, you should be prepared to do a great deal of genuine listening in regards to that person.









If you find your mind straying, ask them for clarification on an earlier point that you remember, so that you find your way back into the conversation. For example you might say ""I was thinking about what you said about X and didn't hear what you just said. Could you repeat that?""

, In all likelihood, there is some quality about the narcissist in your life that you admire. Build the majority of your praise around that quality. It will seem more sincere, which will keep you in the narcissist's good graces, and it will also be a constant reminder to yourself about why you keep this person in your life.









For example, if your narcissist is a really good writer, make sure that you tell them that. Say things like ""You're really articulate. I love the way you manage to get your ideas across so clearly."" They'll recognize your honesty and they'll be less likely to try to attack you.
If you really want to get into their good books you can say something like ""You are so much better at writing than me. I never quite got the hang of expressing myself clearly."" You build them up in opposition to you (and the world) which makes them feel better about themselves. Do not do this to the point that you start believing they do everything better than you.
Compliment them often on the personal attributes they are most proud of. Narcissists need much more affirmation and attention than most. They will bask in the compliments, and value the relationship. However, they are still likely to try to find ways to undercut and control you, due to their deep insecurities. Their methods can be very subtle and sophisticated, so be on-guard.

, If the narcissist in your life is someone you cannot choose to avoid contact with, and you find yourself unable to tolerate flattering that person as often as is necessary, the next best option is to keep quiet. You will not gain any favor with the narcissist by keeping your mouth shut, but by not disagreeing with that person, you passively give the impression of agreement.









Since a narcissist demands constant attention, smiling and nodding is a good way to give that to them without having to commit yourself to further interaction. This method works particularly well for those narcissists who aren't inextricably intertwined in your life (like a coworker or a friend you aren't super close to).

, If you need something from a narcissist, the best way to get it is to frame the request in a way that suggests to the narcissist that there will be some benefit to him or her in providing it.








For example, if you want to persuade your best female friend to go to a new restaurant with you, and her narcissism revolves around her social standing, say something along the lines of, ""I hear it's the best place to go if you want to rub elbows with all the influential people in the community.""
As another example, if you want to see an exhibit with your best male friend, and his narcissism revolves around his intelligence, you could say something like, ""They say it's especially intriguing for clever people with quick minds.""

, He or she will probably assume that you are either jealous or simply ornery, and will devalue your opinion even more as a result. Avoid inflicting humiliation, even though it might be tempting to do so. Frame things in a way that invites the narcissist to believe that he or she still has the upper-hand.









For instance, if you need to remind a narcissistic client to pay you, gently remind that individual by asking them for a reminder of the agreed upon pay period rather than directly stating that the payment is late.

, Sometimes, especially when the narcissist is someone you love (a significant other, a parent, a child), you may want to consider staging an intervention. This can be very difficult, as a narcissistic person can be very difficult to convince that there is something wrong.









The best time to stage an intervention is after something very life-changing has happened to the narcissist (like an illness, a job loss, etc.) where the things that are feeding their ego are damaged or removed.

, You'll need a neutral and experienced party, as things can get emotional and stormy during the intervention. They can also help you plan the intervention and give you some idea how the intervention might go.









A professional can discuss with you the different options for therapy that you might try to convince your narcissist to undertake. Individual psychotherapy and group therapy both have their benefits and have been shown to help narcissistic individuals regulate their individuality and build their ability to see people as individuals who are as important as they are.Look around in your area and ask some people whose opinions you trust who they might recommend. You want to make sure that you have the right person for the task.

, These people need to be people who are close to the narcissist in some way or who have been hurt by the narcissist but are willing to see them get the help they need.









Make sure that these people aren't going to warn the narcissist ahead of time and aren't going to spread gossip around about what is going on.

, You do not want to do this as a spur of the moment thing. You'll need to plan out where and when and what you all are going to say and do. The professional can help you here with some of what you might expect from the intervention.









You'll need to develop a couple talking points. These are the main points that you want to stick to during the intervention. They can be things like how the narcissist's issues are hurting the family (give specific examples) and why you're having the intervention (they've become abusive, or they have stopped contributing to the family; again you want to be specific).
You need to have some sort of consequence for their actions is they refuse the intervention. This could be anything from ending the relationship, or not participating in activities that are important to the narcissist. This gives you a sort of leverage for them to change.

, It's important that you use your compassion during the intervention since the reason you're doing it is so that they have a chance to get better.









Use ""I"" statements. ""I feel ignored when you constantly turn the conversation to yourself,"" or ""I feel that you expect me to constantly be emotionally available without providing me with emotional support in return."" Again, use specific examples of the times that they hurt you.

Be honest.,
Maintain good communication.,
Spend time together often.,
Don't be judgmental.",How to Avoid Fights with Your Girlfriends1," If your bestie is obsessed with beaded purses and you yawn at the sight of them, share your feelings. You don’t always have to love the same things. Being genuine about your likes and dislikes, though, could prevent resentments from building over time. Just make sure that you share your preferences in a polite way.


For example, you might say something like, “Beaded purses are so you and you make them look great! I prefer non-beaded purses.”;
, It's important to stay in touch with your girlfriends often, but in an appropriate way. Periodically texting, tweeting and talking on the phone are great for everyday communication in addition to face to face conversations. Judge your means of communication on the type of communication, however. Twitter is fun, but not the best tool for carrying on a serious conversation. Some ways to keep the lines of contact open include:


Sending a “Good morning” text to brighten a friend's day
Checking in after stressful experiences such as tests or doctors' appointments
Returning messages promptly, even if it's just to say ""I can't talk right now; call you later!""
Reaching out to make meeting plans

, If the only time you hang out is during class or on lunch break, you need to schedule some ‘we’ time, stat! Relationships are built on shared experiences. If you’re never even in the same zip code, however, disagreements will grow while your friendship withers. A few fun hangout ideas include:


Arranging to get a pedicure together
Going to see a movie
Working out at the gym or going for a jog

, Is your friend's new haircut horrible? If she loves it then you'd be better off withholding your two cents. Supporting your pals even when they've made questionable choices is part of being a true friend. Offering your opinion, especially when your friend hasn't asked for it, creates a situation where the other person can feel unduly criticized and judged.

Ask them questions.,
Play icebreakers.,
Pay attention.",How to Bond With Small Children2," Young children usually like talking in general, and especially like talking about themselves. Get to know them by asking them questions about their likes, dislikes, interests, etc.You don't have to grill them, but you can ask them a few questions to learn more about them.


Ask open-ended questions that have multiple parts.
For example, “What's your favorite cartoon and why?”
Try asking, “What was the most interesting part of your day? What made it interesting?”

, Games designed to help people get to know one another better are great to use with young children. They allow you to get to know more about each other and they are fun, which can relieve some of the tension. Try ‘Would You Rather’. Take turns choosing between two outrageous options. For example, would you rather be able to turn invisible or be super fast.

, One easy way to bond with young children is to notice what they play with, what decorates their room, etc. and talk about those things. Pay attention to the things that are important to them to learn more about them or get ideas for things to talk about.What books are they reading? TV shows do they watch?
What colors do they like to wear? What snack do they really enjoy?
What time of day (or night) ate they most energetic?

"
"
Set boundaries.,
Show respect.,
Encourage them.,
Be patient.,
Be flexible.",How to Bond With Small Children3," As the adult, you should warn or stop a child that is doing something inappropriate or unsafe. Children naturally look to adults to set boundaries and feel as though adults care about them when they do set boundaries.


Set boundaries in terms of their behavior and actions, as well as for yourself.
Remember that part of being a child is testing those boundaries.

, Children of all ages like being treated respectfully. Avoid talking to the child in a patronizing manner, ignoring them, etc.Talk to them with respect and show them respect through your actions to foster a good bond with them.


Knock on the door of older children before entering their room. You don’t have to wait too long to enter, but do give them respect of knocking before you open the door.
Discipline them with compassion and with consideration for their dignity.
Ask for their input on things so that they will know you respect their opinion.

, This is one of the best ways to develop a bond with children. Encouraging them shows them that you are interested in them and care about them, and it also builds their self-esteem.Don’t just tell them encouraging words, but encourage them with your actions as well.


Be specific when giving them praise. For example, “You did a really good job with the expressions on the faces in this picture”.
Attend their events, programs, etc. to let them know that you support them.
Make sure you encourage them when things are difficult for them, as well. Remind them that they can do it.

, A true, lasting bond will take some time to build, don’t expect it to happen overnight. In fact, rushing or forcing the bond will more than likely make the child nervous and uncomfortable with you. Give the bond time to form naturally., While you do have to set boundaries, be willing to change plans, try a new way, or make a special exception when appropriate. Flexibility is actually a necessity when interacting with children. For example, you may have planned a day for the two of at the museum, but the child may have too much energy for that and a day at the park might be a better idea.

"
"
Be present.,
Talk and listen.,
Start new traditions.,
Let them choose what you do.",How to Bond With Small Children4," This doesn’t just mean physically present, but mentally present, as well. Dedicate some time to spend with the child with no distractions. Being present in the moment when you spend time with children lets them know that you care and allows you to really get to know them., Communicating with a child is one of the easiest ways to bond while you are spending time with a child. Allow the child to lead the conversation, answer their questions, ask questions of your own, and listen attentively to their responses.


Try to talk frequently, even if only for a short time. In this case, quantity can help improve quality.
Really listen to what they are saying instead of thinking about what you will say next (or anything else).

, Create a new ritual, tradition, or routine together. This shared and repeated activity creates a sense of continuity and unity between you and the child.For example, make up a greeting; develop a bedtime routine; or take a weekly walk together.

, Allowing the child to select the activity allows you to experience life from their perspective. This may mean you will have to try things you haven’t done before (or maybe not quite in this way), but it lets the child know you are interested in them and willing to step out of your comfort zone for them.


Don’t try it just to impress them. Children of all ages will see through that. Try it because you are genuinely interested in experiencing something the child likes.
Doing something that they enjoy allows them to feel a little more relaxed and comfortable as they get to know you better.

"
Assess whether he is a threat.Not listening to what you say is a red flag—but how much of a red flag it is depends on the circumstances.,
Listen to your instincts.,
Be cautious if you are getting bad vibes or feel afraid of him.,
Go to safer ground if a guy is getting pushy.,
Look for an authority figure.,
Try avoiding him.,
Enlist the support of friends, coworkers, or even random bystanders.,
Get help from law enforcement if needed.",How to Deal With a Man That Will Not Take No for Answer2," At best, he is seriously misguided, and at worst, he is potentially violent and very unsafe. You always have a right to say no; this is important in considering whether and how to protect your safety.


Learn how to read emotions. A tense or harsh tone of voice may indicate someone is angry or upset. Facial cues might indicate the same, such as drawn in eyebrows, dilated nostrils, and a hard, piercing stare. If you notice these signs, try to end the interaction as soon as possible, or get in sight of others., If you feel that this guy is likely to hurt you or make you extremely uncomfortable, you're probably right. If you think that he isn't horrible but just misguided, then you're probably right. Err on the side of playing it safe. You don't want to get hurt.


Learn to trust your gut. How do you feel in your body when you are around this person? Does your heart beat fast in alarm? Do your fists clench? Do you find yourself holding your breath? All of these could be bodily signs that this person is making you uncomfortable, even if he has a smile on his face., Direct confrontation may lead to escalation, so avoid telling him off; he might start threatening you or turn violent. Trust your instincts and find ways to either end the interaction or get around others.


For example, you might look at your watch and suddenly exclaim that you are late for a meeting or appointment. This can be a good way to get away from the person. It also demonstrates that someone somewhere is waiting on your arrival, and will be wary if you are late.

, Some men become loud, threatening, or violent if a woman keeps saying no. He is less likely to do this if you are somewhere with more witnesses, and you are more likely to run into a kind bystander who can help you out.


Crowded areas are far safer than isolated places.
Look for other women. Many women can recognize the signs that a woman is being harassed by a guy, and can swoop in to the rescue or get outside help.

, If he won't listen to you, maybe he'll listen to someone in a position of power, whether it's a boss, bartender, or teacher. This person may also be able to threaten consequences if he doesn't knock it off.


At work and school, you have a right to focus on your work in a nonthreatening environment free of harassment.

, See if you can politely excuse yourself when he comes by. Say something like ""I need to finish a project,"" ""It's getting late,"" or ""I'll see you around."" Most people understand that if they follow you out, they would look like a creepy jerk, so he is likely to not do that.


If he starts following you, go straight for a crowd, authority figure, or police.

, If he won't listen to you being straightforward, then it's time to get outside help. Explain the situation and ask for help in extricating yourself from this situation.


If he's pressing you in public, start crying or saying no. Loudly. If he tries to cover it up by acting like he wants to comfort you, push him away. People will recognize he's bothering you, and they'll come help.
If he lays his hands on you after refusing to leave, then scream. Scream loudly and persistently until he leaves or someone comes running.

, An extremely persistent or violent guy may leave you with no other option than a restraining order or harassment charges. You deserve to be able to go about your day without worrying about what he'll do next, and you certainly deserve to be at peace.

Learn basic self-defense practices.Self-defense is much more than just fighting back.,
Maintain control.,
Be aware of what's out there about you on the internet.,
Avoid going to secluded places with people you don't know.If you are meeting a new guy for a blind date, choose to go somewhere public - and meet him at the location; don't give him your home address.,
Remember that any acts of violence are his fault, not yours.",How to Deal With a Man That Will Not Take No for Answer3," It encompasses skills relating to becoming more aware of your surroundings, considering your options when in danger, practicing assertiveness, and attempting to de-escalate a potentially threatening situation. In reality, fighting back may actually make this guy more angry and result in you getting hurt. Sign up for a local self-defense class in which you can learn how to deflect violence and protect yourself in such situations.


In a tight situation, your ultimate goal is to get to safety. If you have no choice but to use physical violence, aim for the body parts in which you can inflict the most damage - and, therefore, have time to run away. Try to jab, punch, or kick the attacker in the eyes, nose, throat, crotch or knees., Using alcohol or drugs in situations with people who you are not totally comfortable can leave you in a compromising position. Your defenses are down at these times, and you are less likely to be able to read your environment and anticipate threats. If you are just hanging out or beginning to date a new person, keep alcohol and drugs off the table.


A guy who does not want to take no for an answer wants to be in control. If alcohol and drugs are in the picture, you may mistakenly be giving this person more control to potentially drug you or coerce you into sex or other activities., Many social media profiles display phone numbers and emails, which may be an opening for a creep to contact you. In the future, change your privacy settings so that your personal information is displayed only to those you trust (or no one at all). Also, be mindful of what you are posting online. Someone who means you harm has an easier time of locating you if you regularly tag yourself at different locations.

, Make sure someone else knows where you are at all times. If you can, try to set up a group or double date so that other friends are with you.

, It is his responsibility to act like a decent human being, not yours to be perfectly wary and watchful at every moment. If things go terribly wrong and someone does hurt you, it is not your fault. You have the right to say no, and it is his fault if he does not respect that.

Get away for a romantic weekend.,
Rekindle old memories.,
Have regular date nights.",How to Be Romantic After 502," This gives you an opportunity to break from your lives and enjoy each other in a relaxing place.

Relax by a lake.
Take a trip to a big city. Go out for a nice dinner. See a show. Go out for drinks.

Compliment and motivate each other.,
Be confident in your bodies.,
Share activities.",How to Be Romantic After 503," Being romantic can be as simple has believing in your partner. Help them feel good about their goals, dreams, and journeys ahead. When things get tough, it’s not about telling them what to do. It’s about them knowing you’re there to be supportive.


Compliment them with positive and inspirational words.
Consider saying something like, “I know it’s tough right now, but you’ve got this” or “You are the sunshine in my day.”

, Do things that make you feel sexy. Value yourself and your partner. Though your body or your partner’s body may have changed over the years, you can be confident and sexy. Keep a youthful attitude. Smile. Have fun. Be playful.
Avoid comparing your or your partner’s body to when you both were in your 20s, 30s, or 40s.

Give thoughtful gifts.,
Show your love with words.,
Be caring in your actions.",How to Be Romantic After 504," Gifts can help to brighten your partner's day. They don't need to be big things. Sometimes the most memorable gifts are given when they are least expected. While it's still wise to give your partner gifts on holidays and special occasions, think about these ways to show you care on ordinary days:Be creative. Draw, write, or get crafty. Consider painting a picture of your partner's favorite flower, or a place they like to visit.
Find something that they love. Whether it's music, games, sports, movies, or something else, think about what would make them happy.
Give your talents. Play a song for them. Make them a delicious meal. Decorate a space to fit their tastes.

, Communicating your love with kind words will make your partner feel valued and appreciated. This can be done in person, via text, over a phone call, or through email. No matter the form of communication, it's important to tell them how you feel.When you see your partner and they look nice, express that with words. Consider saying, ""You look so beautiful tonight"" or ""You look so lovely, as always.""
If your partner is working hard, then make sure to respond with positive words. Say something like, ""I love how hard you're working"" or ""You really are doing an amazing job.""
Avoid talking about what you dislike about their appearance, or how they are doing something poorly. To be romantic you need to avoid nit-picking.

, Acts of kindness can be very romantic to your partner. They show that you care. Doing favors or helping out with chores are acts of caring that remind your partner how loving you are. Consider these actions to show you care:


Help with tasks around the home. Do some extra chores that need to be done.
Go the extra mile when your partner is stressed. For example, make them a special dinner.
Share your time or skills with your partner. For example, if you're good at fixing things, then work a project that needs to be fixed for them.

Be loyal.,
Find the humor.,
Listen, don’t interrupt.,
Learn how to respectfully disagree.,
Be reliable.",How to Avoid Fights with Your Girlfriends2," Don’t talk about your buddy behind their back. It’s disloyal and disrespectful. And chances are it won’t take long for your opinions to reach your friend’s ears. Hearing criticism from a third party is very hurtful and will likely trigger an argument.

, If things turn too serious while you’re hanging out, lighten the mood with laughter. Laughing releases feel-good chemicals that help dissipate stress hormones. And sharing a chuckle might help you share a solution to any issues at hand. A few ways to lesson tension in the moment might include:


Watching a funny video online
Telling them a joke
Following a comedian on Twitter

, Arguments sometimes spring from a feeling of not being heard. Make it a habit to quietly pay attention to your pal’s thoughts and personal feelings. Doing so shows respect and builds trust between the two of you. Some good listening strategies include:


Making eye contact and facing your girlfriend when she is talking.
Using neutral, leading phrases to show you are paying attention, such as “yes,” “go on,” and “I see.”Eliminating distractions by turning off your cell phone, closing your laptop, and turning off the TV.
Rephrasing what your friend has just said. You can summarize something your girlfriend just said and turn it into a question or statement to clarify.For example, if your friend has just been telling you about a fight she had with someone else, you might say something like, “So she just slammed the door in your face and you haven’t talked since then?”

, No two people will ever agree 100% of the time. So when a minor disagreement pops up, be especially considerate of the other person's viewpoint. Shutting your friend down and declaring yourself right will only breed resentment, paving the way for future arguments. Emphasize instead points of agreement between you and never invalidate your pal's perspective on things.For example, if your friend hated a movie that you really enjoyed, then you might say something like, “I think that we both agree that that movie had some great moments, and it is okay that you did not like it as much as I did. I value your perspective and I still like going to the movies with you even if we have different tastes.”

, Keep your word, always. Trust is at the heart of all good relationships. If you keep cancelling outings at the last minute your pals will rightfully start to be bothered by your unreliability. Or, if you promise to feed your friend's cat and forget, expect a long wait between before their next text message. Being a good friend means making promises and keeping them.

"
"
Admit any mistakes.,
Stay focused.,
Establish common ground.,
Take five.",How to Avoid Fights with Your Girlfriends3," If you sense an argument building, own up to any mistakes you’ve made. Sometimes that’s all it takes to transform your friend from angry to agreeable. Plus, saying you’re sorry will position you to receive an apology too, if warranted.For example, if you were late to meet your friend for lunch, then you might say something like, “I am sorry for being late for our lunch date! I feel really bad about keeping you waiting.”

, If things are still going south, don’t bring up prior disagreements. Therapists say ‘stockpiling’ issues from previous arguments and then unleashing them later aggravates the situation.To bring a swift end to an argument stay focused only on the subject at hand.


For example, don’t bring up something that happened three years ago as extra ammunition during an argument. Just focus on the problem at hand.

, When things are turning tense, look for points of compatibility. Getting back to ‘normal’ in a relationship can sometimes be as simple as reminding the other person that you agree much more than you disagree.


For example, you could recall your shared dislike of handlebar mustaches, have a laugh and move on.
If the point of disagreement is something more serious, then you might try to find something about your values that bonds you together. For example, you might remind your friend that you both value nature conservation, even if you don’t always agree about the best way to accomplish it.

, If tempers are rising suggest a short break from the conversation. Anger can sometimes cause us to say things we later regret. Also, it gives you both useful time to process your thoughts and emotions.Try telling your friend something like, “I really want us to talk about this, but I think we should wait until we are both feeling more relaxed. Do you want to talk about it tonight after our aerobics class?”

Figure out WHY the person in front of us is acting hysterically.,
Be aware that there isn't always a quick answer, or anything you can do.,
Be prepared to defend yourself.,
Ask someone to help you if the stranger has not left you alone.,
Ignore the other person completely and persistently continue you way.",How to Deal With a Hysterical Stranger," This may sound a simple task to do, but bear in mind that the reason why somebody is angry, unreasonable and even aggressive might be much more complicated than what you primarily considered. Try to reason the other by your words if possible to calm the hysteria away. NEVER act aggressively! Things will just get worse, plus you might also hurt yourself or even end being beaten.;
, There is always a reason why somebody acts hysterically, but sometimes it just might happen that that reason is something out of your solving range.


So if there is something you can do to help, then do it, but if not the best solution would be to do nothing. This may seem cowardly or irresponsible, but if there is NOTHING you can do to help, then the next best thing is to just try not to make things worse. So yes, act passively and let the stranger's outburst go by you.
If the stranger accuses you for something (it really could be anything), go with his flow. If by any chance his words have the slightest portion of truth in them, apologise and take responsibility. If not, just ignore and go away.

, Should it happen the person you tried to avoid starts pursing you, blocking your way and/or threatening you, then things are getting serious. Consider the fact that the stranger you are facing could easily be mentally ill. So while on his side he cannot be accused for his acts, you will take full responsibility for whatever you do. Don't fall on his/her level and act crazy, 'cause that's where your ""opponent"" has the most experience. Act passively, apologise if he/she believes you did something wrong be reasonable and act like you take what he said seriously into consideration. Try not to cause any disagreements, solve the issue the person may have with you and continue your life.


NEVER, ever, not once call the hysterical person ""hysterical"", ""crazy"", or anything you believe that might be offensive. Don't be cynical and rude with your whole behavior either. You can freely think whatever you want, but if you want to get out of trouble appear understanding and polite. Even if you get offended by the other person, try to get OUT of your discomforting place, don't be fool enough to make things worse. Besides, when arguing in public with a fool, the audience can't tell the difference. The best way to prove yourself as civilized is to act like one. If it helps, think of yourself as a superior being that will not allow himself fall in the level of someone beneath.

, You might get lucky enough to find a man of excellence and wisdom standing near you, ready and willing to help you. If you ask a few people that saw the other person's hysterical act for help an find them really unwilling to support you, reconsider you own behaviour. It maybe was you who started things or gave ground for more hysteria. You know it really is not bad admitting your own faults and correcting them. Sure the other person did not behave in a good way to you, but even if that is the case, just fix your fault and reduce you contribution to the problem.

, If treated as such, call a friend or a policemen. After all, you don't know the guy, from the little time you spent with him you figured that you don't like him and therefor you are not obligated to waste you time with him. That is the last step. That means try the others first. There might be reason to his hysteria after all. The minute you will think you wasted may have helped somebody deal a problem he/she had which caused the ""hysterical"" behavior. Always running away from others problems makes people selfish jerks. You want to end up being called egocentric bastard? Don't think so. Not to mention that there ARE things that would drive almost anybody temporally insane.

Find interesting conversation topics.,
Know when to be quiet.,
Talk about what you know, but don’t be a know-it-all.,
Listen.,
Say what you mean, but do so respectfully.",How to Avoid Being Annoying While Around Your Friends1," Talk about things you think would be of interest to your group of friends. Even though you may find one topic interesting, keep in mind that your friends might not, so avoid monopolizing the conversation. Current events, favorite movies or celebrities can all be good options.For example, if your friends are big football fans, you could ask, “What did you think of the game last night?” Or you could talk about a recent shared activity: “Nicole’s party was great, wasn’t it?”
Don’t gossip. While most people enjoy gossiping about other people, it’s not polite and can backfire on you pretty easily. Keep people’s secrets and don’t talk about another person behind their back.
If you have a significant other, don’t overshare about your relationship. It makes other people who aren’t in a relationship feel bad, and most people get tired of hearing you talk about it after a while.;
, Sometimes people can get caught up in the excitement of hanging out with their friends and forget to let others get a word in edgewise. Make sure you are giving others space to talk and avoid holding court for too long.


Know when you are monopolizing the conversation and people are becoming bored. Good indicators are people avoiding eye contact with you, beginning to turn away, or chat amongst themselves.Don’t talk just to talk or fill dead air. Learn to be comfortable with silence. If silence makes you uncomfortable, you might want to look into learning meditation or spending some time alone with your thoughts in silence.Walk or study without headphones or background music.

, Even if you truly are the expert in a particular topic among your circle of friends, do not act that way. No one likes to be corrected or lectured at. Everyone has something to contribute to the conversation, even a beginner.


Don’t brag about your accomplishments. If people are interested, they will ask you about them.
If you don’t know about a topic, don’t pretend that you do. Ask questions instead. People love to share their knowledge about something they care about.You could say, “I think it’s so cool that you’re interested in artificial intelligence. I know a little bit about it, but not much. Could you recommend any good websites about it?”

, One of the best things you can do for a friend is listen to them. Listening helps strengthen your friendship and build empathy. If you’re prone to talking too much, ask your friends questions about themselves. Most people love to talk about themselves. Ask open-ended questions instead of yes/no questions. For example, “Tell me about your trip to Spain!” is better than “Did you have fun in Spain?”If your friend comes to you with a problem, don’t jump in and give them advice on how to fix it (unless they ask for it, of course). Just listen to them and say things like, “Wow, that sounds really hard. I’m sorry you’re dealing with that.” Sometimes people just need to unload, and having someone to listen to them helps them feel better., Don’t dance around the point. People cannot read minds, and if you expect them to read yours, it can be extremely frustrating to be around you.


Sometimes it can be difficult to find the courage to speak your truth. It might help to think if you will look back on this situation with regret if you didn’t speak up.
If someone hurts your feelings, call them on it. Say, “It really upset me when you said I suck at math. I studied really hard for that test,” instead of withdrawing into yourself and not telling people what is wrong. “When you did/said this, it made me feel like this” is a good formula for expressing hurt feelings. It lets the other person know how their behavior made you feel without them feeling defensive."
"
Have good manners.,
Respect people’s boundaries.,
Quit looking for attention.,
Stay humble.",How to Avoid Being Annoying While Around Your Friends2," Be polite. Say please and thank you. Having good manners goes a long way in helping people not find you annoying. Think about talking to a polite person versus a rude one: Who would annoy you more?Laugh at people’s jokes. Laugh even if they’re not really funny (unless it’s an offensive joke). It’s polite and makes the joke teller feel good.
Don’t burp, pass gas, or spit around other people. Keep your bad habits, such as cracking your knuckles or chewing with your mouth open, under control. If people start to notice these bad habits happening consistently, it becomes grating and instantly annoying!

, If someone says for you to stop teasing them, bothering them, or getting in their face, stop immediately. No means no.Say “I’m sorry,” and step away from the person. If you stop when they ask, most likely there will be no hard feelings. Don’t say, “Can’t you take a joke?” or “Calm down.”

, Constantly needing to be the center of attention gets on everyone’s nerves. If you are incessantly texting your friends, butting your way into conversations, or making everyone look at you while you do something, people are going to begin to withdraw from you.


Ask yourself why you need all this attention. Oftentimes, people who engage in attention-seeking behaviors have low self-esteem for are feeling insecure about something.Stay out of drama. Don’t create it, and don’t participate in it. While it often feels good to be in the middle of it and gives you a great attention rush, people begin to see that you are a drama tornado and will do their best to not get sucked in. Drama will give you attention, but not authentic friendships., Don’t have an entitled attitude and expect to be treated better than everyone else. Don’t expect people to bend to your whims.Keep your word. If you say you are going to be there at five o’clock, don’t roll in a little after six. Keep your promises to others, and if you can’t, let them know as soon as possible."
"
Talk to your friends.,
Know who you are.,
Examine your behavior.",How to Avoid Being Annoying While Around Your Friends3," Your friends might be able to help you shed some light on your annoying behavior. They can tell you what behavior gets on your nerves and possibly give you some ideas to correct the behavior. Talk to a friend or friends who will tell you their opinion kindly and honestly.You could ask, “I realize that you guys get annoyed with me when I get really hyper. Have you noticed anything about my annoying behavior? I really want to stop it and am trying to figure it out.”
Press your friend for specifics. They might be uncomfortable and not want to make you feel bad, and say something like, “Oh, I don’t know, sometimes you just get annoying.” You could say, “What specifically do I do that gets on your nerves?”
Acknowledge to your friend that is an uncomfortable conversation for the both of you. You could say, “I really hate talking about this, and I think you do, too, but I really want to change my behavior, so I’d appreciate your insight.” Keep the conversation light: “I know; I drive myself crazy sometimes!”, Don’t try to be someone you’re not. Resist the urge to change who you are just to fit in. You will be unhappy, and you will not be able to cultivate healthy friendships.If you think you need to change yourself to fit in a group, maybe you should change the group instead.

Make new friends by getting involved in new activities at your school, religious organization, or in your community.

, Consider spending some time looking at your behavior and understanding why people find you annoying. Figure out what is the underlying reason for the behavior. This might be something you do with an adult you trust or a counselor, or something you do on your own.


For example, do you talk incessantly because you get nervous? Do you mope and drag everyone down because you want to talk to someone about how you really feel?
You could try writing in a journal to sort out your behavior and emotions. Journaling helps clarify what you feel and learn more about yourself."
"
Set up a meeting in person.,
Remind them kindly.,
Be direct.,
Avoid letting the loan go unpaid.",How to Ask Your Friend to Pay Back the Money They Owe You1," Invite them to chat over a coffee or lunch. Keep the situation casual, so your friend feels comfortable talking to you openly. You can email, call, or text, but people are more likely to fully understand this conversation, if you conduct it face-to-face where they can see your body language and facial expressions.Make sure you're able to meet one-on-one. You don't want to embarrass your friend.
Send an email, text, or call and say something like, ""Do you have some time to meet and talk this weekend?""
If you want to give them a heads up on what the conversation is about, you can say something like, ""Can we meet up Friday to talk about that loan I gave you a few months ago?""
If you want to make sure your friend is comfortable, let them pick the location. Say something like, ""I wanted to talk about that loan I gave you awhile back. Can we meet at your place or somewhere close by to talk about that this week?"";
, In some cases, your friend really may have forgotten about the money owed to you. Start by reminding them about the loan. You can say something like, “I was happy to give you that money last month to help out, but I was hoping you could pay me back before my rent is due.” This reminds them that the money was given and acknowledges that the money was a loan, in case they had misinterpreted the loan as a gift., If the gentle reminder doesn’t produce an apology and offer of repayment, address the issue head on. Sometimes, phrasing your request for repayment as a question can soften the blow. Try saying something like, “Do you know when you’ll be able to pay me back?”


Insist on a precise answer to your direct question. Responses like, “I hope to get it back to you in the next few months,” are not adequate.
If your friend avoids responding or responds vaguely, push them to set a deadline. You can say something like, “I’m understanding the next few months as meaning no later than three months from today. Can we agree to that?”, The longer you allow your friend to avoid payment, the less likely you are to have the loan repaid. Additionally, if you end up needing to take legal action, letting the loan go unpaid for significant periods of time beyond the original repayment date indicates to the court that you may not have expected repayment."

Spot when you're giving advice based on personal beliefs or opinions.,
Decide if you're just telling someone only what he or she wants to hear.,
Avoid advising someone to do something simply because it benefits you.,
Avoid speaking on topics you know nothing about.,
Avoid acting omnipotent and insisting you're an expert over a friend or family member’s life.,
Tread on eggshells when tempted to give relationship advice.,
Don’t give unsolicited advice.,
Be silent.",How to Stop Giving Terrible Advice," Everyone has his or her own allegiance to a certain belief system. Whether it’s political or religious, it’s best to keep those beliefs private and not project them onto others in the form of “advice.”


Avoid suggesting that people fix issues based on your own set of religious or political beliefs. Both highly sensitive subjects, even people who are within your same belief system may differ on certain topics and subjects or the extent to which these should guide actions and decisions. Instead of making a blanket statement based on personal beliefs, stop and consider that your friend or family member could believe something entirely different––and aim to be accommodating to his or her beliefs.;
, Are you trying to “get in good” with someone and only giving them advice based on what you think they want to hear? Massaging someone’s ego disguised in the form of advice can be hazardous and can have grave consequences, especially if you're not really thinking through the consequences of the agreement. Another reason for doing this may be that you simply want the issue to be over and done with so that you can get out of there––this too shows a lack of sensitivity to the nuances of the matter and the need to carefully judge the situation.


Are you being supportive of someone’s bad decisions and/or backing them up with additional suggestions? In the case of numerous celebrity deaths, people like Michael Jackson and Anna Nicole Smith allegedly had close confidants who, in order to remain in the inner circle, would help them obtain substances that ultimately contributed to their death. Going along with what someone prefers can simply be enabling them to continue with bad behaviors that harm them. Sometimes you have to be tough and disagree, just to be ultimately kind to them.
Could you be falling for the blame game by going along with this person's wish to blame others for failure instead of telling them that maybe they need to take responsibility and actually learn from this incident how to improve? Blaming someone else for failure is easy and may make you seem supportive initially because it bolsters the anger or frustration of the person you're comforting. However, doing so will only prevent your friend, family member or colleague from avoiding the same error in the future and it won't call attention to their own responsibility for whatever has happened to them. Be very careful of falling into this trap of bad advice, especially if you're prone to making quick judgments and jumping to conclusions.
Have you ever felt that you've been in a situation where you've been intimidated by the source seeking your advice and you felt the need to provide information based on what you thought they wanted to hear just so that you could stay safe or unharmed? Infamous leaders, managers, bosses, parents and even celebrities can present a powerful front to others, which can leave some hangers-on feeling intimidated and afraid to “tell it like it is.” This is the famous ""yes-man"" or ""yes-woman"" problem, when someone in a position of authority is only ever told ""yes"" when they need honest, forthright advice. Review this if it's happened to you and determine not to fall into this trap again.
Are you giving advice based on what you need to say just to get your work done? Sometimes, when you stop caring about the job you're doing, you go along with everything just because you've fallen into a rut and have no more engagement with it. In this case, your advice is probably a cross between being a yes-person and a supporter of the either blaming someone else or going along with ""how it's always being done"", not caring that the old ways no longer work. It's not helpful to anyone and while you might be playing it safe enough to stay under the radar (unless the company goes bust), you may stay in that rut of and experience a very unfulfilling career.

, Don’t cross sell a product or service simply for personal or financial gain. This can happen with home sales products or home business pyramid companies. For example, you have a friend who suffers from painful, chronic dry skin. While perhaps visiting a dermatologist (an expert) could be decent advice, folks who give advice based on personal gain might tell their pal to simply purchase a jar of special cream they're peddling, disregarding what might really be causing the person's skin problems (which could include a serious underlying medical condition). Although you may firmly believe in the product, you may have other motives (whether you realize it or not) for advising your friend in just such a case.


It can be fun to sell things like makeup, lingerie and party items from home. Just don't be pushy––sell the benefits generally, don't use your personal knowledge of friends and neighbors to force a decision upon them through tailored advice.

, Some folks believe they are oracles of information, making rash judgments on nearly any topic. Others are self-anointed layperson experts on the law, medicine, engineering, you-name-it, professing to know the answers because they picked up a random book and read it, or watched a show on the topic and think they know it all. Remember that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, especially when it comes to professional information––there is good reason people spend years in training and professionally trained people are always aware of gray areas, nuances and traps, which a layperson (someone not trained in the field) may simply miss through having a superficial understanding.


How credible is your advice? Your advice must be based on experience and expertise. If you have neither, don't open your mouth about the matter.
Reading it in a women's or men's magazine or seeing it on TV does not make it a truth. Magazines and TV shows give snippets of current information as the journalist interpreting the information sees fit. A lot is left out, a lot is tailored to the ideas of the day and much of it is sensationalized (never let the truth get in the way of a good story). Tomorrow the data may be proven wrong but you might be stuck believing what you read or saw in 1992 just because you didn't see the update. Don't be tempted to view popularized medical/legal/financial, etc., information as a reason to start dispensing it yourself.
Winging advice can alienate you from others because they will soon realize you're clueless or that you're cobbling together some correct assumptions and many incorrect ones.
You risk losing credibility in the eyes of friends or colleagues when you play ""I'm an expert"" at something you're clearly not expert at. Perhaps at first people will believe you, but after a short while, your cover will be blown when time and again your advice is disproved.
Realize that even experts know when to say ""I don't know"" and to acknowledge the limits of their opining or advising. If you want to add your two cents, back it up with a disclaimer. Let people know you really don’t know what you're talking about, but since you were asked for an opinion, this is where you stand based on what you do know. Be sure people understand that you have no personal experience or educational background on the matter, but that you're speaking from your gut.

, Don't assume you know what's right or good for them, especially not based on bad experiences in your own life (even worse if your bad experiences have resulted in you not living a fulfilled life). Don't be the type of person who will explain how to discipline a toddler even though you've never been around or had children, smugly insisting that the recipient of the advice is being blind or even dull about something that is “so easy” to accomplish.


Pull back when you think you see a very clear-cut, easy solution but haven’t walked a day in the other person’s shoes. It’s like the non smoker telling the smoker to “just stop smoking!” You don't know how hard anything is for another person unless you've either experienced the full extent yourself or you've spend time truly witnessing what they're going through.
Reconsider doling out “expert” advice unless you’ve been asked and have been in the exact same position. However, instead of just telling the other person the “way it is”, it is far more likely to be of use to the other person if the advice you give is couched within the terms of your story. Start by saying that you empathize with what the other person is dealing with and explain what you did in a similar situation. Make it clear that you have absolutely no expectations of them doing the same thing though, unless that's what feels right for them.
If you don't have a child but you love dispensing advice that begins with ""When I have a child I won't ,"" then start learning humility. Ask any parent about their expectations pre- and post-child. It's like chalk and cheese, as everything they were certain about is turned upside down by reality! It is hard enough raising children without receiving bad advice––restrain yourself from this point on.

, It's only natural that you want to shore up your friend's or family member's self-esteem when relationship woes hit them but be very careful as to how far you go about advising them. Telling them to divorce or leave someone is really heavy (and unwanted) advice and it is not usually your place to make such a life-changing suggestion. Be tactful and ask questions about their happiness, fears, concerns, sense of direction, etc., and listen to their explanations rather than put ideas into their head. Simply by giving them a talking space to work through their feelings out loud without judgment may be the best way you can advise a person who has relationship problems. And if you don't think this, think back to times when people gave you relationship advice that you wished you'd never heeded––it's the sense of not owning or reaching your own decision that tends to live on and may well distance the decision-maker from feeling secure about ever being able to make the right choices.

, Every situation does not require advice, so understand that when someone does not ask for your advice, they usually don’t want it. Unfortunately, if you cannot distinguish between simply being supportive versus jumping in with hordes of advice because you believe the friend/colleague wants you to fix his/her problem, you risk overwhelming them and muddying the problem even more.


Understand that you don’t need to weigh in on every matter and topic surrounding your friends, colleague or family’s life. Every matter in life is not ripe for judgment, so understand when a friend is venting, he or she may just want to blow off steam to a caring friend and not hear about how to resolve or fix it.

, Listen, listen, listen. Most people have already decided somewhere deep down what is they're going to do about any given situation, problem or decision that they're apparently wanting advice about, even when they haven't owned up to this consciously yet. You're a sounding board or a feedback mechanism, and just letting them air their story or concerns and listening without judgment is often the best way to avoid giving bad advice. In many cases, the person will make up their own mind what to do regardless of your offerings. In summary, the two simple ways to work around the trap of bad advice are:


Listen and only give advice if asked.
Don't expect your advice to be followed. Realize that they'll decide what it is they do or don't want to do and if they want to change things.

Tell them what you need the money for.,
Ask them to repay some of the money.,
Set a deadline.,
Create a repayment plan.,
Deduct the value of services.,
Decide what means more to you.",How to Ask Your Friend to Pay Back the Money They Owe You2," Often times, people who rely on friends or family members to give them money may not be great at handling their personal finances. These people may selfishly think that having money for themselves is more important than repaying the loan. In these cases, it may be beneficial to let the person know why it’s important that they pay you back soon.


Try saying something like, “I have to pay my property taxes next month, and I’m really depending on you repaying me to make that payment.”
You can even say something like, “My budget has been stretched pretty thin because of the loan I gave you, and repaying it would help me get back on track financially.”
Remember, you don’t need an actual reason to want the money back. The loan should be repaid, but this is another way to improve your odds of getting your friend to pay you back without losing the friendship., If your friend is unable to pay the full amount owed to you, ask if they can pay some of the money to show they are serious about making a repayment effort. The more upfront and honest your friend is about their financial situation, the better able you will be to determine whether they can truly afford to pay you back, or if they need more time. Regardless of their financial situation, recouping some of your losses is always preferable to none.You could say something like, ""It would be helpful to me, if you could make a payment towards the loan today.""
If you're worried your friend may truly be having trouble repaying the money, say something like, ""I know you're still struggling, but is there a small amount you could pay me now?""

, Sometimes, people simply work better with a timeline. Let your friend know you’d really like to be fully repaid by a certain date. Be willing to extend this if you can. You probably don’t want to lose your friend over a personal loan, but if you really need the money paid back, setting a specific deadline may help.Before your meeting, think through some possible payment plans you think may be feasible for your friend. Presenting these to your friend will take the pressure off them to come up with these ideas.
Say something like, ""What amount would you be able to get by without each month?""
Try to help your friend figure out when they will e able to make payments by saying something like, ""Do your bills come out at the first of the month or towards the end? You can pay me at the opposite time, to make repayment easier for you.""

, Schedule due dates and payment amounts, and ask your friend to honor the agreement. You can even request that they sign a formal document at this point, if you’ve already tried the other methods of getting repayment without effect. This can make it easier for friends to return your money, since they don’t have to repay it all at one time.Don't shy away from asking your friend to commit to a repayment plan or from asking them to sign a formal agreement, especially if you have loaned them an amount of money that is significant to you.
Start by saying something like, ""This may be overkill, but I want to make sure we're both on the same page to repay this loan. I wrote up something to help us both stay on top of it.""
Make sure your friend understand your initial document is just a suggestion, and walk through possible changes to make repayment easier. You may say something like, ""I know you have a vacation planned for May, would it be helpful for you if we skipped this month?""

, This may seem strange, but your friends are likely there for you when you need them. If the friend drove you to the airport, helped you with a home improvement project, or took care of your kids free of charge, consider deducting what you would have paid for the service from the amount they owe you. This is an especially good idea, if your friend really cannot afford to repay the loan.


In some cases, it may even be appropriate to ask the friend to perform services in lieu of payments. For instance, if you need to go out of town, you can say, “I’m leaving for a business trip, and will be gone for ten days. Could you water my plants and watch my dogs? I’ll deduct $300 from what you owe me.”
If your friend is trying to pay you back, but struggling to financially, offer them the opportunity to help you instead. Say something like, “I really appreciate you trying to pay me back in the time we agreed upon, but would it be easier for you to watch my kids for me this weekend while I’m at a conference instead of paying me this month? I’d really appreciate the help.”, In extreme cases, you may have to choose between getting your money back or keeping your friend. This will likely be a difficult decision, but if you’ve put in effort to get repayment and your friend simply can’t afford to pay you back, it might be time to think of the loan as a gift."

Send a demand letter.,
Look into online legal claims resources.,
Gather your documents.,
Know the statute of limitations.,
Prove where the money came from.,
Collect following the decision.",How to Ask Your Friend to Pay Back the Money They Owe You3," The first step in the process of legally recouping a loan is to write to the friend asking for repayment, and giving them a certain amount of time to come up with the money. You should talk to a lawyer prior to sending this letter, and have it notarized. The letter should also be sent by courier or through the mail using a signature tracking system, so you know and can prove your friend received it. Include as many specifics as possible in the letter.The letter should detail the exact amount owed, length of delinquency in repaying the loan, other attempted methods to recoup the loss, and potential court dates if the money is not repaid.
For instance, your letter could say something like, “On December 3, 2015, I loaned Joe Smith $600 for his construction business. I asked for repayment by October 3, 2016. I have asked for repayment in person, in writing, and attempted to make a payment plan. Mr. Smith has been unresponsive. I am seeking legal action to recoup those losses, if I am not repaid by December, 3, 2016. At this time, we will schedule a court date to discuss the matter in the presence of legal counsel.”
If your friend responds to the letter and pays the debt in the aforementioned time frame, there's no need to continue legal action.

, People Claim is one of the most popular tools, but there are a number of similar websites and even apps that make filing a claim to recoup a loan fast and simple.

These online legal resources typically offer free and paid services. In most cases, you’ll be advised to attempt to complete your legal claim without paying for service and add on paid assistance from the legal team, if your initial claim is not effective.Do your research into online or app based claims services. Most are reputable, but others are just out to take even more of your money without helping you recoup losses.
You can read online reviews, check with the Better Business Bureau, or look for information on the site about the lawyers who will be assisting you.

, Before you go to court or even talk to a lawyer, have as much evidence as possible available. Keep receipts, bank transfers, bank statements, any written agreements you had for repayment, and any emails or letters you’ve shared with your friend. All of this information may be important to prove you are truly owed repayment. In legal cases, the burden of proof always lies with the prosecutor not the defendant, so keeping good records will make it easier to prove your legal right to repayment., The amount of time you have to recoup money from personal loans is different in every state. Do your research or ask your lawyer about any possible statutes of limitation before taking legal action., One of the keys to claims ending successfully is proving that the money you lent was earned legally. This may seem silly, but it’s actually one of the most common ways people get out of repaying personal loans. If you wrote a check for the loan, simply offering bank statements from the account is adequate to show where your deposits came from.If you paid the person in cash, you may have more difficulty proving the loan ever happened or that you got the money from reputable sources.
If you can show a bank withdrawal for the amount on the date in question, this may be adequate.

, Even if you win a legal case, it’s often difficult to enforce the agreement. Document every payment or missed payment, and return to court sooner rather than later. Simply avoiding court fines and legal fees may encourage your friend to make the payments they agreed to."

Be forward about asking for it back.,
Ask a question about it.,
Send a message regarding the item.,
Constantly bring it up.",How to Ask a Friend to Return an Item They Borrowed1," Be bold and come out with your request. Even if they’ve had it a long time, just assume they have intended to return it, and say, ""I’d like to get my copy of X-Men back when we meet next."" With that direct approach, embarrassment or common courtesy will likely cause them to return your item., By inquiring about the item you’ll be less confrontational. It suggests uncertainty, and allows your friend to be confident in their reply, as if they were the one who decided to return the item. Try a few of the following approaches:


""Are you done with my copy of Twilight? I’d like to have it back when you’re done.""
”Hey, I’m looking for my hat, do you still have it?”
”Would you mind giving the video game back to me?”

, A message allows you to be direct without having to confront your friend. It’s easily less personal.There is possible misinterpretation, so be careful with your wording.


Facebook allows you a great way to send a message. Send a private message with just enough information to let your friend know you’d like the item back.
Shoot your friend a quick email. Nothing extravagant is needed. Just ask for your item back.
Text your friend. Ask for the item and include their favorite emoticon to make it less harsh.

, Whenever you talk to your friend, bring it up. No matter the conversation, steer everything back to the loaned item. Your friend will quickly get the hint.

Find a place and time where you can talk privately.,
Apologise.,
Accept responsibility.,
Keep your voice quiet and calm.,
Consider writing a letter.,
Admit your behaviour caused them pain or embarrassment.,
Understand their point of view.,
Explain your behaviour.,
Tell them you will not do it again.,
Offer to make it right.,
Acknowledge the importance of your friendship.,
Ask for forgiveness.,
Let your friend decide what they need.",How to Apologise for Offending Your Friend," Most apologies feel pretty uncomfortable for both parties, and it’s probably better to do it away from others’ eyes and ears.When you’re ready to apologise, take a minute to collect your thoughts before approaching your friend.


Try saying, “Hey, Mark, can I talk to you for a minute?” People generally get the sense from this question that you need to talk to them privately, and it is a more serious matter.
Step away from others toward a quieter, more private location.
Make sure you talk to your friend when they have a few minutes to spare, not when they’re rushing off to class or work.;
, Apologise for the specific thing you did wrong, whether it was your behavior, a joke, or something you said. Say what it was you did to upset your friend. In apologies, it is important to take ownership of your behaviour.For example, say “I’m really sorry I made fun of your outfit in front of your crush,” instead of, “I’m sorry about what happened back there.”

, You do not apologise that your friend has hurt feelings, you apologise that you created your friend’s hurt feelings because of what you did.


Don’t say “I’m sorry you took it the wrong way.” This implies that there is a right or wrong way to feel about something. No one is right or wrong for feeling how they do.Don’t say “I’m sorry if what I did upset you.” This apology puts the burden on the person you hurt and doesn’t make you take responsibility for your behaviour.
A better apology would be simple, direct, and acknowledge the pain you caused: “I’m so sorry I hurt your feelings.”

, You want to appear contrite and humble, not looking to argue. If your friend begins to yell at you out of anger, resist the urge to yell back to avoid a fight.

, If your friend is too upset or angry and doesn’t want to talk to you, you might want to write an apology. Put some effort into a sincere, thoughtful note.


You can email a note, handwrite one, or even send a card.
Check out How to Apologize or How to Write an Apology Letter for examples of written apologies.
Be sure to follow up with an in-person apology once your friend is more willing to listen to you.

, Even if you don’t understand how your joke wasn’t funny or your comment was offensive, you nevertheless hurt your friend. Express regret that your actions made your friend feel this way.You could say, “If I could do it over again, I never would have made that joke. I am so sorry I offended you.”

, Don’t try to change their opinion or argue for your side, just listen to them and try to understand where they are coming from. Let them explain to you why your behaviour was offensive to them. When people feel heard, they tend to become less angry.Putting yourself in another person’s shoes and trying to see things from their perspective is called empathy. There are several ways to show empathy, and one of the most important ways you can be empathic is to listen. Listen to your friend explain how they are feeling without arguing or interjecting your thoughts.Perhaps you said something offensive about your friend’s ethnic background or religion that you genuinely had no idea would be upsetting. Take this opportunity as a chance to learn and understand where your friend is coming from.
For example, you could say, “I didn’t know that your food was part of an important tradition in your culture. I wouldn’t have made fun of you for eating it if I had known. I’m so sorry. I would love to learn more about this tradition.”

, If your friend is open to hearing you, let them know why you chose to do what you did.Keep in mind they may be too upset to listen, in which case, let it go for now. Be humble and sincere, and if you sense an argument brewing, back off.


Do not be defensive. For example, “You do it to me all the time, so I thought it was okay!” does not make the listener feel that you are accepting responsibility. It also creates defensiveness in the listener.
When explaining your behaviour, acknowledge that you still shouldn’t have behaved as you did. For example, “I was really tired last night, and that’s why I snapped at you. It’s no excuse, though. I should have left early instead of being mean to you.”Try saying, “I truly didn’t mean to hurt your feelings when I pulled that prank. I know we like to joke, and I really thought you would find it funny. But now I can understand why you didn’t.”

, Indicating you learned from this situation helps maintain trust in your friendship. Your friend will not be walking on eggshells around you, concerned you will intentionally hurt them again.You could say, “I learned my lesson that other people’s families are off-limits when it comes to jokes. I won’t do it again to you or anyone else in the future. I can understand now why I made you so mad.”

, An apology that truly gets people past the negative incident will include some attempt to right the wrong.A wholehearted attempt to repair the situation is almost always seen positively through the eyes of the offended person.Some ways you could attempt to make amends include:


Replacing an item you ruined, or giving the person money to replace it.
Tell others who witnessed the incident that you were wrong and shouldn’t have done it. You could also help protect your friend from future offenses by letting people them know a certain behaviour is off-limits. You could say, “Hey guys, I know you heard me make fun of Mike’s brother earlier. I was wrong to do it and really upset him. So let’s help him out and not make fun of him in the future, okay?”
Doing something kind for your friend: Treat them to lunch, offer to wash their car, or help them study for a test.

, Let your friend know how much they mean to you, and how you hope that this incident will not negatively impact your relationship. Acknowledge your history together.


You could say, “I really screwed up with this. I feel terrible that I damaged our friendship by offending you in this way. You’re such a good friend to me.”
Talk about how long you’ve been friends and the common history you share. Do not say this in a way that makes your friend feel guilty for being offended; rather, note its importance to you. For example, “I remember how you stood by me when my mum got sick last year. It meant and still means so much to me that you were there.”

, Once you have apologised to your friend and they have accepted your apology, you may also want to ask for their forgiveness. People are more willing to forgive after a heartfelt, humble apology, and if they can trust you to keep your word that you will not hurt them that way again.You could say, “Can you please forgive me for making that mean joke about you?”
Forgiveness can take time. Let your friend know that you understand this. You could say, “I hope you can forgive me someday for this, but I know you might not want to right now.”

, Even if your friend accepted your apology, they still may need a little space to get over their hurt feelings. Take your cue from them.


Give your friend a few days if it seems like they need some space away from you. You could check in with a text message after a day or two and invite your friend to an activity you know they would enjoy: “Hey, how’s it going? Do you want to go work out this weekend?”
When your friend is ready to hang out with you again, invite them to do something special with you. Do something you both enjoy, and pay for the activity if there’s a cost associated with it.

Stop beating yourself up.,
Realize that not everyone has to like you.,
Look at the friendships you see around you.,
Be aware that not everyone is naturally social.,
Decide whether you want to change.",How to Accept That You Don't Make Friends Easily1," Worrying about your social life won’t change anything, so try to relax. Think positively instead of punishing yourself with negative thoughts. You’ll have an easier time attracting friends if you’re kind to yourself.For instance, stop telling yourself things like, “I can’t talk to people.” Replace those thoughts with something like, “It’s OK to feel nervous around new people sometimes.”;
, You can’t please everybody, and if you try, you might lose what makes you uniquely likable. Don’t take it personally if someone doesn’t want to be friends with you. It just means you weren’t a good fit for each other., It might seem like everyone you know has a happy, thriving social life – but look again. Plenty of friendships aren’t as healthy as they seem on the surface. When you notice the imperfections in other people’s relationships, you’ll be less likely to hold yourself to an impossible social standard.For instance, some friendships are based on convenience instead of mutual liking. In other friendships, one person is using the other for attention, popularity, or money.

, While we hear a lot about how humans are social creatures, the reality is that making friends is challenging, nerve-wracking, or tiring for many people. Once you realize you’re not the only one who struggles to make friends, you may feel more at ease with yourself.It’s also important to realize that many friendly, outgoing people weren’t born that way. Plenty of people have improved their social skills through practice, and you can do the same if you want to.

, Ask yourself whether you’re happy the way you are. If so, there’s no need to change anything, no matter what other people might say. If you do decide you want to change, that’s okay too – just make sure you’re doing it for yourself and not to please others.Many shy or introverted people feel perfectly content with a small circle of friends. Not everyone has to be outgoing and chatty.

Avoid being critical toward your friend.,
Take responsibility for your own happiness.,
Manifest your own positivity.,
Avoid matching his negativity.,
Be compassionate.,
Protect yourself.,
Consider seeing a therapist.",How to Survive a Negative Friend1," Lecturing your friend about his negative patterns can make him feel even worse, and he may turn on you. Criticism is difficult for everyone, but it’s especially difficult for someone with negative thoughts and emotions circulating in his head.Trying to vent to him about his own behavior may just escalate the situation and make him feel attacked. Provide a supportive environment to the best of your abilities.;
, If you let your happiness depend on a negative person, it will end in disaster. Keep your emotional distance from a negative friend. Avoid getting sucked into his world and then needing to solve his problems in order to be happy yourself., One of the most effective methods for helping a negative friend, and helping yourself too, is to remain positive in the face of his negativity. This will keep you happy and show your friend an alternative to the way he sees things and acts in the world.


Take a break. Humans can ""catch"" emotions; in other words, the emotions of people around you are likely to rub off on you.Even if you are a very positive person, if you are around negativity too much, it may make it harder to maintain your positive outlook. Take a break from your friend's negativity sometimes.
Another way to maintain your positivity is to stay in tune with your own emotional experience. If you're starting to feel negativity rubbing off on you, check in with yourself and remind yourself that that isn't something you want. For example, ""I'm starting to feel angry at restaurant servers because my friend has been complaining for five minutes about ours. I don't have a problem with our server. This anger isn't mine."" You'll be more able to sustain your own positivity if you focus on it.Use humor. Redefining a negative experience in humorous terms can help counteract the brain's natural impulse to focus on the negativity of a situation.The next time your friend starts in on a rant, flip the situation humorously: ""I'm sorry your car didn't start and you had to run for the bus. But hey, you did say you've been wanting to get more exercise, right?""
Remind yourself when your friend's negativity is irrational. It can be easier to maintain your own positivity if you disengage from irrational negativity. For example, if your friend is complaining that your night is ruined because you have to see a movie in 2D instead of 3D, remind yourself that this is completely irrational. You still get to see the movie, and you can still have an enjoyable evening. Disengage from your friend's irrational thought trap., It may be tempting to join your friend in negativity. Research shows that people would actually rather do an unenjoyable activity with friends than an enjoyable activity alone.However, reinforcing the negativity will only make it worse. He will think that it’s acceptable and you may even push him farther into negativity.

, Research on compassion suggests that it’s a “win-win” way to treat people.There are mental and physical health benefits associated with being compassionate, such as buffering you against stress and increasing your social connectedness. Social connectedness has its own benefits, such as increasing your immune system. Compassion also helps others. Acts of compassion create compassion in the other person as well. Giving freely can cause the other person to want to give freely. Basically, compassion is a great way to keep yourself and the people around you healthy.


For example, look for ways you can help your friend. If his car dies, offer to give him a ride or jump start his battery. If he complains about a family member, offer to let him vent to you. These small gestures will produce a big effect in both of your lives.

, It’s unpleasant to “break up” with a friend, but sometimes it’s the best option. It’s good to brush negativity off and genuinely accept a friend despite the cloud hanging over his head. However, sometimes the negativity is too much, and you may need to say goodbye. If it comes to that, feel good about the fact that you care about yourself enough to avoid the black hole of negativity.Sometimes, friends' negativity can trigger unpleasant or traumatic memories from our own past. For example, if you have recovered from a past substance abuse problem and your friend is constantly complaining that her family wants her to stop doing drugs, this negativity could trigger painful memories of your own past. If your friend's negativity continues to ""push your buttons"" or cause painful triggering, it may be best to step away.

, This can be especially helpful if you really want to keep your friend involved in your life but are having a hard time dealing with his negativity. A therapist can help you learn healthy ways to cope, and help you learn ways to frame your thinking in healthy, helpful ways so you can stay positive.


If your friend's negativity is severe, such as talking about suicide or self-harm, talk to a trusted parent, teacher, counselor, or other authority figure. Your friend needs more help than you can offer.

Ask your friend to sign an IOU.,
Put the repayment plan in writing.,
Use apps to make repayment simple.,
Assess your friend before lending money.,
Avoid lending to friends you don't want to lose.",How to Ask Your Friend to Pay Back the Money They Owe You4," Many people do this prior to lending money to ensure they are protected later, if the friend refuses to repay. This is a great way to start the lending relationship off on the right foot because the terms of the agreement are clear from the very beginning. An IOU can easily be changed down the line, if your friend needs a little extra time for repayment. Starting with an IOU also makes it easier for you to take legal action later, if this step is necessary. Check out How to Write an IOU for more information., If you haven’t asked your friend to sign an IOU prior to lending the money, you should still ask them to agree to a plan once they’re able to start paying you back. Put this plan in writing and have it notarized. This makes it more legally binding, if you need to go to court later, and it will likely encourage your friend take the repayment more seriously., There are numerous apps available that make paying friends back any amount of money, from $50 for dinner to $50,000 for a small business loan, quick and easy. Use apps like Splitzee, Venmo, Square Cash, Splitwise, Pay Pal, or Google Wallet to simplify asking for and receiving money.


Splitzee, Splitwise, and Square Cash are your best options, when the money lending situation is for a shared expense. For instance, if you pay the monthly bills in your apartment and have roommates who pay you back.Venmo, Pay Pal, and Google Wallet are better for large amounts of money. These applications allow you to send bills and reminders to your friend, and most of them have no fees, if you’re simply transferring money from bank to bank., Ask questions about why they haven't gone through more traditional channels (banks, credit cards, etc.) for financing. Try to find out whether their current hardship truly is temporary or if understanding finances are something the friend struggles with regularly. You may not want to lend money to a friend, if they are very unlikely to repay the loan.


Start by asking something as simple as, ""Why are you asking me for a loan?""
It may be uncomfortable, but ask you friend, ""Do you have a large amount of outstanding debt?"" Before you lend them money, it's fair to expect them to be honest about their financial situation.
Ask if they can agree to a repayment timeline before lending, ""I understand you're struggling financially now, but when do you think you'll be back on your feet?""
Perhaps most importantly, ask you friend what they're doing to get out of debt. Say something like, ""What are you doing right now to change your financial situation? Can you get a second job or take on more hours at work?""

, Despite your best efforts, you may still lose your friend, your money, or both if you lend to a friend. Before you get financially involved with your friend, make sure you're willing to lose them or the amount of money you've loaned them.

, Technically, you’re not borrowing it since it’s yours, but it could be funny to ask in such a way. Play it up by begging a bit, ""Could I borrow it back? Pretty please? I need it! I’ve always wanted one like that.”

, A slight bit of embarrassment can be minimized if sarcasm is used. Find a way to bring irony or humor to the situation.


”You’ve had it forever. Is there any tread left on the tire?”
”I’m pretty sure the shirt you borrowed won’t be in fashion by the time you give it back.”
”How many times have you beaten the game I lent you by now?”
""It's been so long since you borrowed it I forgot if it's a DVD or a VHS.""

Visit your friend.,
Mention its presence during conversation.,
Pretend you forgot it.",How to Ask a Friend to Return an Item They Borrowed3," Go on a social call to your friend’s house and act as if the visit is unrelated to the loaned item. Eventually get around to talking about the loaned item, or about something related to your loaned item.


A movie: “Remember that Halloween dance scene in Karate Kid?”
A tool: “My yard is a mess. I’ll have to weed eat for days.”
A clothing item: “What I really need is a black scarf to complement this outfit.”

, Note the object in the room, something close enough to be picked up. When calmly talking about the item, mention you had the same item once. Maybe even say how much you enjoyed having it.

, When you’re near your friend and see the item, say, ""You know what? I think this one is mine! Did I leave it here?"" Playing dumb is often a good way to be less threatening. They won’t be able to deny the truth. They’ll likely mimic your feigned ignorance.

Make a list of your positive traits.,
Spot what's getting in the way of you making friends.,
Turn weaknesses into strengths.,
Learn to enjoy your own company.",How to Accept That You Don't Make Friends Easily2," Build your confidence by writing down the personal qualities you’re proud of. Keep these traits in mind when you start to feel critical of yourself or shy around other people.If you want to make more friends, think about your qualities that make you a good friend. For instance, maybe you’re compassionate, accepting, and trustworthy.

, Be honest with yourself and think about what goes wrong when you try to make friends. It’s not much fun to analyze your flaws, but once you know why making friends is hard for you, you’ll be able to change your behavior.A few common issues that make it hard to find friends include shyness, social anxiety, complaining a lot, and expecting too much from new acquaintances.
If you’re not sure why you struggle to make friends, ask someone you trust for their perspective. Make sure you’re prepared to hear the answer, though.

, Instead of trying to get rid of your flaws, look for ways to turn them around. Using these traits to your advantage is usually easier than trying to change your whole personality.If you’re not very talkative, for instance, you could practice being a more active listener, so people feel comfortable opening up to you.

, Become more secure in yourself by getting comfortable with spending time alone. Pick up some solo hobbies that you look forward to doing on a regular basis. During quiet moments, take the opportunity to reflect on your strengths, weaknesses, and hopes for the future.When you’re comfortable being alone, you’ll feel better about yourself no matter how many friends you have. You’ll also be less likely to rush into unhealthy friendships just for the sake of having friends.

Be friendly and positive.,
Get involved in activities you enjoy.,
Rely on the people around you for support.,
Choose your friends carefully.",How to Accept That You Don't Make Friends Easily3," Put a smile on your face when you go out, even if you feel nervous. Treat other people with courtesy and thoughtfulness. Instead of complaining, put a positive spin on your comments. Other people will like being around you if you’re upbeat and happy., If you’re shy about meeting new people, start by getting out of the house and doing things you like. Breaking the ice with someone new is easier when you can connect over an activity or a shared interest.For instance, you could join a group related to one of your hobbies, volunteer for a cause you care about, or sign up for a competition.

, You may already have a stronger support network than you realize. People like parents, teachers, coaches, and siblings can support and inspire you as you build up your strengths. Make time for the people you care about, and don’t be too shy to ask for help and advice when you need it., Don’t rush to befriend people you just met. Get to know people slowly, and invest your time and energy into those who care about you and treat you well. It’s better to have one close, trustworthy friend than it is to have many shallow friendships."
"
Think about your words.,
Be careful about delivery.,
Watch your pace.,
Assert yourself.,
Change the direction of the conversation.",How to Survive a Negative Friend2," The last thing you want is to add to your friend’s negativity by being too critical or hostile. If you would like to tell your friend that you think he is seeing a situation more negatively than necessary, think about the best way to say this.Use ""I""-statements rather than ""you""-statements. For example, “Quit being so negative” is going to have less of a positive effect than “I feel like there’s more to the situation than you’re seeing.” ""I""-statements sound less judgmental, which can make the other person more open to hearing what you have to say.

, What you say isn’t the only important factor. Tone and nonverbal cues are just as important.Yelling or throwing your hands up in defeat are going to increase negativity in the room rather than work to fight the fire effectively.


Gentle eye contact and nodding along to what your friend is saying, if you agree, are great ways to create a positive interaction.
Maintain an even tone of voice. Staying calm when your friend blows up may help her realize that there's more than one way to respond to a problem.

, Research shows that speaking slowly causes people to perceive you as “more caring and sympathetic.”In order to communicate with a negative friend in a way that promotes positivity and keeps you from falling into the same negativity, pay attention to how fast you are speaking.

, You want to be compassionate and positive in your approach, but that’s not the same thing as allowing yourself to be stepped on. Sometimes a negative friend may try to override your opinions. Maintain a firm stance when it comes to your freedom to express yourself and have a differing point of view. Assertiveness is about meeting the needs of everyone involved, not just one person.Clearly express your desires, wants, and needs. Use direct language that can’t be contradicted. For example, say “The way that you’re acting right now makes me uncomfortable. I’m going to leave, but we can talk later if you want.”
Include empathy. For example, “I understand that you want to keep talking about this, but I’m not comfortable with this conversation, so I’m going to leave.”
Set limits. For example, ""I am happy to listen to your complaints for five minutes, but then I would like us to change the subject so we don't get too bogged down in negative feelings."", If a friend is negatively ruminating on something, change the subject to something you know will cheer him up.Injecting positivity into a situation can be a lot easier and more effective than trying to fight negativity.


For example, if your friend is complaining about a bad day at work, ask him if he wants to go bowling or see a movie. Offer to pay for his ticket.

Recognize pessimism.,
Look for signs of depression.,
Talk to your friend about depression.,
Watch for signs of anxiety.,
Encourage your friend to seek treatment for anxiety.,
Get a grasp on insecurity and self-esteem.,
Realize that negativity is partly unconscious.We tend to think of negative behavior as a choice, but it’s more complicated than that.",How to Survive a Negative Friend3," Pessimism is the orientation toward life of expecting that things will go poorly. Usually, people become pessimistic because things in their lives actually did go badly.Pessimistic people often seem negative because they are quick to shoot down ideas and possibilities. Just remember that these people most likely have a history of bad things happening in their lives, so from their perspective, pessimism might seem totally reasonable.


People who have pessimistic views may see positive thinking as ""sticking your head in the sand"" or refusing to acknowledge life's problems. You can help encourage your friend learn to think more positively by modeling healthy positive thinking in your interactions.For example, a friend with a pessimistic view may say, ""I shouldn't even try for that interview, because I'll never get the job."" Someone who is refusing to acknowledge reality might respond, ""Oh, you'll definitely get the job! There's no way you're not the best!"" While this may sound positive, it isn't helpful because it's clearly unrealistic and doesn't acknowledge your friend's genuine concerns.
Instead, be positive but realistic: ""Okay, maybe you might not be the most qualified person in the world for that job...but you won't know if you can get it unless you apply. You do have a lot of the qualities they're looking for. What would it hurt to apply?""

, Depression is a mood disorder marked by symptoms such as feeling hopeless, an inability to feel pleasure, and extended fatigue. Depression is the source of a lot of negativity; understanding it will help you understand negative friends who may be depressed. Depression is caused by a lot of different factors outside the control of the person, such as genes, family environment, and peer environment. People who feel depressed have difficulty mustering the energy to do things. Because of how tired and “low down” depressed people feel, they may seem really negative and unhappy.People with major depression can't just ""snap out"" of feeling bad. However, depression is very treatable with therapy and medication.
Other symptoms of depression include: frequent feelings of sadness or teariness, angry outbursts, lack of interest in things you used to enjoy, changes to weight, sleep, or appetite, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and frequent thoughts of harm to self or death., Depression is a serious condition that makes it hard for people to connect emotionally and live a happy, healthy life. You can't ""fix"" your friend's depression, but if you've noticed signs that worry you, talking to her can be a good way to show you care and encourage her to get help.Frame your talk with ""I""-statements, such as ""Lately I've noticed you don't want to hang out as much. I'm worried about you. Would you like to talk?""
Ask questions. Don't assume you know what's going on. Instead, ask your friend some questions, such as ""Have you been feeling this way for awhile? Did something happen to make you feel this way?""
Offer support. You should let your friend know that you care about her and are there to support her. Often, people with depression feel very bad or worthless about themselves. Let her know that you care for her and are there for her by saying something like, ""I really value our friendship. Even if you don't want to talk right now, I'm always here for a chat if you want.""
People with depression may respond with anger or irritation to your attempt to help. Don't take it personally, and don't try to force the issue., Anxiety can cause frustration and irritability. People with anxiety may feel powerless in their own lives, or terrified of things that don't seem scary to others. They may spend so much time worrying about the fear that they have trouble thinking or concentrating on anything else.People who experience a lot of anxiety may be snappy and lash out more than people who don’t, creating a lot of negative emotional energy in their lives.


If your friend constantly seems to worry about things or feel ""out of control"" of her own life, she may be experiencing anxiety issues.
Like depression, anxiety is a mental disorder that is serious but can be treated. You can't ""fix"" your friend's anxiety, but you can show her that you care about her and want to support her.

, Many people with anxiety feel bad about their inability to control their worrying, which paradoxically leads to more worry. They may feel that seeking treatment is a sign of weakness or that they're ""broken."" Encourage your friend by reminding her that seeking treatment is actually a sign of strength and self-care.Use ""I""-statements when you talk to your friend about her anxiety. Don't make her feel worse about herself by saying things like ""You need to work on your anxiety."" Instead, say something reassuring and kind, like ""I feel like you've been really worried and stressed out the last several times we've spent time together. Are you okay?""

, Many times, people who feel insecure or inadequate have a difficult time being positive and responding well to positive events.This can feel like an act of self-protection, since they are suspicious of being rejected or hurt more. As misguided as it may be, understanding the logic behind it can be useful in dealing with it. You can help build your friend's self-esteem in several ways:Give her positive feedback. Overcoming that self-protective instinct takes time. Whenever you see even the slightest hint of growth, tell your friend something positive about it. For example, ""I'm so glad you decided to come out to the bowling alley with us today! I've really missed you.""
Encourage her. Overcoming negativity is hard work, and she will have relapses. Keep encouraging her to try new tactics.
Listen to her. Many people may feel low self-esteem because they feel others don't listen or care about them. Take the time to listen to your friend, acknowledge her concerns, and share your ideas with her. This will make her feel involved in your life, and let her know that she's important to you.

, Negativity, whether it’s coming from depression, pessimism, anxiety, insecurity, or something else, is something that no one has complete control over. There are steps people can take to reduce negativity in their lives, but judging someone for being negative can sometimes just make things worse.


Remember that you can't ""fix"" your friend's problems. However, you can be there to support her. Just remember to take care of yourself, too.

Apologize.,
Listen and Respect.,

Give your friends space.,
Consider whether friendship is still in the cards.,
Know that not every friendship is the same.",How to Revive a Friendship," Don’t wait for your friend to reach out. If you want to reconnect, make yourself available, either by reaching out or by inviting your friend to meet with you. A phone call or an email are quick, easy, and respectful ways to convey your interest to speak or spend time together. However, you should consider your options regarding how to reach out.;
, Depending on the degree to which you’ve grown apart, there are different recommended routes to take. The depth of your previous friendship, and the context in which you drifted apart are important factors when considering how you should approach an old friend.If you simply haven’t seen or spoken with someone in a while, reach out casually. A message on an online media platform that you both use may work. An email is better because it is a more reliable and secure method of communication. People also tend to check their email more frequently.
Consider sending a letter. If you had gone through a conflict with your friend, be wary of rekindling old animosities. Take care not to make them feel as though they are under pressure to respond. Don’t just call someone you had a falling out with; this may make them feel uncomfortable or may even upset them. A note or card gives them time to think and contemplate a response.
Do more than just text. While texting is great way to convey information of send a quick hello, it is not a productive method to rekindle a relationship. If you feel your relationship is casual and comfortable enough to contact a friend via text but you haven’t spoken in a while, give them a call. The more personal approach will indicate your interest to truly reconnect.

, Don’t feel as though your friendship has ended or become less important. Friendships often change when people get married, move, or have kids. If you’re missing an old friend, there’s a good chance your friend misses you as well. It is always appropriate to try to reconnect.


Recognize the importance of circumstances. If you had drifted apart because your friend went through a major life change, and you recently went through a similar life change, you may soon find you have even more in common now than ever before!Don’t wait any longer! The more time you spend missing your friend without acting on it, the further you may drift apart. Know that it’s okay if you haven’t spoken with someone in a while. You may actually make their day by letting them know you’ve been thinking about them and would like to reconnect.

, If your friend doesn’t respond, or does so hesitantly, you can try to convey your hopes to reconnect again. Don’t rush though. Allow time in between contact. If they simply don’t respond, accept the fact that they may not be ready or willing to reconnect for the foreseeable future., Know that the present is not the past. Your friend may have changed substantially. Don’t expect them to be the person they were when you were closer.


Holding expectations about someone else affects the way you feel about them, which is unfair to them and may lead to unwarranted expectations about the potential to rekindle your friendship.
Meet for coffee or lunch instead of going out at night together. This will allow each of you to interact more casually, with less assumptions or expectations about the meeting., If you have something to apologize for, do so as soon as you are able. Be completely honest. Know that your friend may still be experiencing some negative emotions about whatever happened between you, and that negative emotions may even arise for you upon meeting up with your friend again.


If you were at fault for something that led to a conflict, even only partially, accept that fault.
Tell your friend that you’re willing to put the past behind you, and that you’re willing to speak about whatever happened if they’d like to do so.Try something like, ""Hey, George, I'm really sorry about that argument we had. Want to catch a beverage together someday soon and catch up?""
Try, ""Sally, you know, I've felt really bad about the way I acted a while back. I'm so sorry. I’d like to get together again sometime, if you’re interested.""

, You should always be respectful when interacting with other people, and all the more when interacting with friends. One of the surest ways to indicate that you respect someone is by listening intently during conversation. In order to understand what a friend is feeling or thinking, try to consider your friendship from their perspective.Practice active listening. Especially during meaningful conversations, make sure to follow these tips to help you listen intently:Summarize what it seems like the other person is saying when you are unsure.
Encourage your friend to continue with short prompts such as “Then?” or “Oh!?”
Use “I” statements when responding. Reflect about what the other person is saying out loud, by beginning with, “I feel like…”
If something is unclear, ask them to expand upon a point you don’t understand.



, Whatever the context of your friendship now, you undoubtedly have positive memories from experiences you shared together in the past. Recall some of the enjoyable moments you spent together, particularly those that might get you laughing together again.


By recalling positive memories of your own, your friend will likely recall similar memories of their own, and you will both end up remembering more about your friendship than either of you had remembered independently.
This alone will rekindle positive feelings towards one another, if not a resurgence of interest in spending time together again.

, Notice that this step comes after apologizing. Not only do you need to forgive a friend that you hope to continue having a relationship with, you need to forgive them even if they don’t apologize. If you and a friend are not fully able to resolve an issue, you still may be able to have an amicable friendship.


Know that there are learning and growing opportunities for both individuals in every friendship. Respecting one another can help you both find the positive in the relationship you had before and the relationship you will have moving forward., If you commit to getting together, immediately act on it by making specific plans. Talk together about what days or evenings you have free in the coming week and at least settle on a day and time to meet.


If the day comes and you’re not as free as you’d hoped, compromise. Avoid rescheduling if possible; Instead of lunch, meet for coffee. If you’re unable to meet up, make specific plans again.If your friend invites you out, go! There is no quicker way to let a friendship fall by the wayside than continually turning down opportunities to spend time together.

, Know that even when a friendship is rekindled, especially after a long period of time, it will likely not feel exactly as it had before.Even if it’s harder to share your lives with one another, you can still value each other’s friendship – you may just have to accept the fact that you won’t get as much time together as you’d like.

, Be aware that your hopes or expectations for reconnecting with a friend may be different than their expectations, even if they’re willing to meet. If you meet, but a rekindling of your friendship seems unlikely, leave with the knowledge that you both still respect each other enough to reach out to one another again in the future. In the meantime, don’t allow yourself to be stressed about a situation that is out of your control., Nor will every friendship stay the same. For that matter, no friendship will ever be perfect. More importantly, the context of your relationships with other human beings will change, perhaps out of the blue.


Don’t hold it against your friends when they change. Accept them as they are now, just as you had accepted them when you’d been closer. Understand the difference between types of friendships. In the course of your life, you will have relationships that amount to acquaintances, casual friendships, and close friendships. Put your time and effort into nurturing relationships with those people who value their time with you, respect your perspective, and encourage you to grow in whatever capacity you choose."

Settle your dispute in small claims court.",How to Lend Money to a Friend," You are not obligated to lend anyone money, and many friendships have ended over unpaid loans. Therefore, you should think carefully about whether to lend them the money, especially if it is a larger loan.


Avoid lending money to friends that you know tend to behave irresponsibly with money. You may value your friendship with them, but that doesn't mean they are good candidates for a loan.
If your friend just needs a couple dollars to cover lunch, don’t overthink it. You may need to borrow that money later on. A few dollars here and there between friends shouldn’t be significant, if they are important to you.
If they need a few hundred dollars to cover the rent for the apartment that their family lives in because they’ve just lost their job, then they’re probably asking out of desperation, and will do their best to pay you back. On the other hand, if they are asking for $1,000 to take their new girlfriend on a trip to Las Vegas, then you might want to reconsider the character of your friend.;
, When lending money to a friend (or to anyone, for that matter), there is always the risk that they won’t or can’t pay it back. Therefore, before you decide to lend them money, think about how that will affect you if you never get that money back.If it is your closest, most trusted friend and it is a small loan of around $30, it probably isn’t going to cause that much trouble if they fail to pay you back. On the other hand, lending that same friend $10,000 may do great harm to your relationship and your financial health.
Remember that you should never lend more than you could afford to lose. If you would be unable to meet your own financial obligations if your friend doesn’t pay you back on time, then you definitely cannot afford to lend the money.

, If this is a friend who is very important to you, then it may be wise to simply think of the loan as a gift. If you have the feeling that they are not going to pay you back, but you want to loan them the money anyways, then just tell yourself it’s a gift. This will help you from becoming resentful if they don’t pay you back after all.You can still tell the friend that the money is a loan, and that they should pay you back when they can. However, in reality, understand that you may never see the money again. In most cases, this is probably not the best way to go; however, if the friend is very important to you and the money is not, then it is one way of looking at it.

, Before taking steps to give them the loan, you should discuss the loan with the friend, especially if it is a large sum. You have a right to know what the loan will be used for, and why they don’t have the money. Explain that you don’t want money to ruin your friendship, so you want to talk about how repayment of the loan will be handled.


It’s important to be honest in your discussions. Tell them that you want to help out however you can, but that you also have to look out for yourself. Point out that is very important to keep the lines of communication open, and that if there is a problem with paying the money back that they should talk to you rather than avoid you.
If you feel embarrassed being so forward about the subject, tell them that your spouse/lawyer/accountant is making you be clear about all this in order to protect your own financial interests.
Ask them why they aren’t getting a loan from a professional lender. If the loan is for a very large sum, it is certainly OK for you to ask this when considering your decision. They may have a good reason why, or they may not, but either way, it is an important piece of information that you should take into consideration.

, Whatever the reason, say “no” if you need to. If the reason you don’t want to lend the money to your friend is because you don’t think they’ll pay you back, but you want to maintain your relationship, it may be best to give a different reason why you won’t be giving them the money.For example, you can say, “As a personal rule, I don’t lend money to friends. It’s not that I don’t want to help, but I’ve lost too many friendships over money, and I don’t want to lose you.”
If they put you on the spot and you don’t know what to say, you can tell them you have to go home and look at your budget. Then, send them an email saying, “Sorry, I would like to help you, but it’s simply not within my means to lend you that money. Let me know if I can help you some other way.”

, Especially if you are lending a large sum of money (what “large” means depends on what you believe is a large sum), it is critical that you create a document that lays out the terms of the loan. This document will lay out who is lending the money, and to whom, how much money is being lent, when the borrower is expected to begin paying back the money, and when the sum should be paid in full. The document should also include any interest that is to be repaid.Understand that this document will, most importantly, protect you in the event that your friend is unwilling to pay you back. However, it also serves the purpose of making the terms of the loan clear and explicit, which will, hopefully, help avoid any misunderstandings.
Remember to have the borrower sign and date the document, as it will not be enforceable without their signature.

, Most states follow the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The UCC states that, in order to be legally enforceable the document must include the following information:It must be a written document that is signed by the borrower. You, as the lender, may also sign the document, but you don’t have to.
The document must promise the payment of money.
The document must state a fixed amount of money (with or without interest).
There must be a definite time that the money should be repayed.
The money must be payable to a holder. As the lender of the money, and the holder of the document, you are the holder.
The document should only pertain to the money to be repayed. That is, there should be no other acts included in the document.

, In the document, you should lay out when you expect to start being repaid, and when your friend should pay you in full by. Make sure to include any interest that you expect to receive, as well as what the consequences are if a payment is not received on time.


For example, if you lend your friend $500 on February 1, you might lay out a plan that says that they are to begin paying you back on April 1 and that they are to pay you $100 each month with 0.5% interest on payments that are paid on time or early, and with 5.0% interest for payments not received on time. Make it explicit that the last payment should be received no later than August 1 of the same year.
You don’t have to come up with this payment plan all on your own. You can work out something together with the friend borrowing the money, but make sure that you include all of the details in writing.
Charging interest is not mandatory.

, Having a document notarized is important because it requires a third party to verify that the people signing the document are the people they claim to be. This is important because your friend won't be able to come back and say that you forged the signature, as it has been notarized. This usually will require both of you to go to a notary public (banks usually have one notary public on staff, but attorneys can also notarize documents) along with two pieces of photo identification, and the document to be notarized.Understand though, that notaries do not offer legal advice, nor does having a document notarized imply that the person signing the document understands what is in the document.
It may seem like a lot of trouble to do all of this, but it is for your own protection. If your friend says you aren’t being a good friend by making them go through all of this, then you might want to rethink the loan, as a good friend will understand that you are only looking out for your own well-being.
Keep the original of the document for yourself, and make a copy for your friend so that both parties can refer back to it as necessary.

, If your friend isn’t paying you back according to the schedule, then it’s time to take action. Before resorting to legal action, though, you should try talking to them. There may be reasons that they haven’t sent you payment, or they may have simply forgotten. Sometimes, people feel bad bringing up such a subject, but in this case, you should definitely not.


Remember that it is your money that you earned, and they felt that they could ask you, so you can ask for it back.

, The first time you contact them about why they haven’t repaid you, try to keep it light and casual. Make it clear that you’re not accusing them of avoiding repayment, but that you’re concerned for their welfare, and want to be of help if you can.


For example, you can say something like, “I just wanted to give you a quick call/email to see how things are going. I noticed on my calendar that you were supposed to send me a payment yesterday, but I didn’t notice anything in my bank. Is everything alright?”
Contacting them in a very offensive way will immediately make them defensive. If you call and say, “You owe me my money, and you didn’t repay on time, what the heck is going on?,” you sound angry and like you’ve already assumed that they are never going to repay.

, If this is a friend you have known for a very long time, and that you trust completely, it is OK to give them a little wiggle room, if you want. If you get in touch with them, and they explain that they had not forgotten about the payment but that their child broke his arm, and they needed the money to pay for the doctor, but that they can get it to you next week, then it may be wise to give them the benefit of the doubt.


Giving them the benefit of the doubt is for your friendship. However, if it is a friend you do not have much trust in, or they don’t seem apologetic or concerned about late payments, then there is no reason to be understanding.

, If your friend continues to avoid repaying you, tell them what will happen if they don’t pay you back. This is not a suggestion that you should threaten them with violence, but rather that you won’t just give up on getting paid back what you’re owed. For example, explain to them that if they don’t pay you back, you won’t ever be able to loan money to them again.


You may also explain how their failure to stick to their end of the deal has really damaged your trust in them, and that you don’t feel like you want to be around someone you can’t trust.
Remind them also, that you have a written agreement. So not only are you able to withdraw your friendship, you are able to take them to court if you want to.

, If you think that you are eventually going to have to take your friend to court, it is important to create a paper trail. Therefore, sending them past due notices in writing after 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days will help you to establish what happened in the event that legal action is taken.Be sure to keep copies of the letters and send them via certified mail so that your friend won’t be able to say they never received them.
State in the letter the terms of the loan and when they were supposed to have paid you.

, If your friend continues to avoid paying you back, it may be time to get tough, especially if you don’t believe the reasons that they’re giving you as to why they haven’t paid you back. Contact them again, either by email, phone, or in person. Calmly let them know that you didn’t want it to come to this, but that if they can’t pay you back the money they owe up to that point by a certain date, that you will be taking legal action.


Understand that this may offend your friend, and you do risk ruining your friendship. However, if you value the money more than the friendship, it is what you will need to do.

, If you have tried to get the money back from your friend by talking to them, but it doesn’t seem like they are going to pay you back you have two options. You can just give up and convince yourself that the money was a gift, or you can take legal action to get the money back. However, if you do decide to take legal action, realize that there is a decent chance your friendship will be over.


Depending on the size of the loan, it may be worth taking legal action (assuming you took steps to prepare yourself for this possibility when you gave the loan) even if it does ruin your friendship. Someone who borrowed a large amount of money, and didn’t care enough to pay you back is not your friend.
Understand that money you give as a “gift” to a friend is not tax deductible, so you cannot claim it as a deduction on your tax return. Furthermore, you may be subject to the gift tax if you are a US taxpayer and you give them over $13,000 in a calendar year., Hopefully you have taken steps to protect yourself from this occurrence, so you will have your signed, notarized document stating that you lent money to your friend, and that they were supposed to have paid you back by a certain date. If you do not have such a document, you may still be able to take them to court as oral contracts are considered binding. The problem is that the existence of oral contracts are very difficult to prove.


If you had an oral contract, you might be able to prove that such a contract exists if there was a witness to the agreement.
Gather together any emails you may have sent asking for the friend to repay the loan. This will create a paper trail, which will demonstrate that you’ve tried to resolve the matter by other means., At this point, you will need to hire a lawyer who will guide you through the process of taking your friend to court. The lawyer may begin by writing an official letter to your friend asking them to repay the money that they owe you, or be ready to deal with the issue in court.Sometimes, an official letter such as this will be enough to motivate your friend to start repaying what they owe.
Be aware that a lawyer won’t be free. You will have to pay them for the services, so be sure that the money you are to be repaid will be more than the amount you will have to pay the lawyer. Otherwise, while you may get your money back, you may end up losing money or just breaking even depending on the sum involved, and the services the lawyer needs to provide.

, Unless you have lent your friend an extraordinary amount of money, you will likely deal with the matter in small claims court. If you have hired a lawyer, they will guide you through the process of filing a claim. If you haven’t, you will need to contact the county clerk where you live (or where any agreement you created was signed), as the rules for filing a claim vary from state to state.Generally, you will need to sign an affidavit confirming that you have tried to resolve the issue outside of court, fill out a complaint form, which asks for the details of the claim, and pay a filing fee, which can typically range from $15 up to $100 depending on where you live.
At this point, you must send a “statement of claim” to the defendant (your friend). You can do this yourself, through your lawyer, or through hiring a private company who will “serve” the defendant.
If your friend continues to avoid repayment, you will typically both be required to appear before a judge who will determine what course of action to take. Keep in mind that if your friend decides to repay you what you’re owed at any point, it is your responsibility to contact the courts to let them know.

Pass by the friend who ignores you.,
Beware the interloper.,
Avoid the queen bee.,
Decide whether or not the friendship is worth continuing with.,
Cease staying in contact.,
Tell your friend the friendship is over when this feels appropriate.",How to Identify Bad Friends," This is a person who likes to use you because you have assets like a car, your own apartment or home, lots of money or a vacation property. Or, they may be using you to get close to your best friend, good friends, girl-/boy-friend or sibling. This type of person will eat up your house or home and even use your personal hygiene products. But when you confront them, they become angry. They disrespect you and your belongings.


You may notice borrowing becomes an issue. They borrow money and never pay you back. Borrow your clothes, property, and never give it back. Or, they return it damaged. They may even let other people use/wear your belongings, without asking you first.
They may also ask for a favor but can never return a favor.
When you tell them that you have something new (clothes, furniture, even friends), see if they pay more attention to you.;
, This type of person lives by the mantra: ""It's all about me"". They will always talk about themselves. Also, they won't care about you; they're not interested in your day, how you're feeling, etc. You may also notice that they brag a lot. Whether it be about themselves, materialistic possessions, boyfriend, getting married, or a vacation, they always find something to make them sound better than you. They think the world revolves around them, and them only.


This type of person seems to always have an opinion about everything. An opinion is a person's ideas and thoughts towards something. It is an assessment, judgment or evaluation of something. An egocentric person has no theory of mind, cannot feel empathy for others, and believes everyone sees what he/she sees (or that what he/she sees in some way exceeds what others see). It appears that this is shown mostly in younger children. They are unable to separate their own beliefs, thoughts and ideas from others, and if you share your ideas, they'll criticize them or ignore you.

, This person always comes to you when having problems for advice, and lets you know in no uncertain terms how much hardship they are going through (often blown well out of proportion to the facts). But when you need advice or would like to vent, they're very short with you. So it's not fair when you don't mind spending two hours plus to cool them down––instead, for you, it's like five minutes. You're not a therapist, so don't let them air their grievances at your expense.


This type of person may stay mad at you when both of you have had a fight. This is because they only accept their point of view.
Pay attention to how they tell stories. They'll start off with beginnings like ""Oh my gosh..."" and ""I can't believe..."". They'll often scream ""You don't understand what I'm going through!"" They crave attention and steal the spotlight.

, This type of person can't share you with other people. When they do see you with other people, they're jealous because they want you all to themselves. They'll even squeeze themselves into relationships with you and your best friend. They can't keep their hands to themselves. And yet, this clinginess has a strange hierarchy that leaves you out when a more important person is about to cling onto––for example, this person likely can't include you to see a movie with their boyfriend/girlfriend, as that person becomes the center of their world. And while they spend lots of time with this person, when their other half is busy, they want you all the time. It's a sure sign that this person can't bear to be alone and that all you are is a babysitter. They'll compliment you until you return affection. Be very certain that this friend may ditch you for their significant other if they come around.

, This person smiles in your face, but when around other people, they make you feel small by continuously putting you down verbally. They may also do things such as drugs and deny it. They might promise to call you back, but never do. Always keeps you waiting. Always make excuses as to why they didn't call you. They never keep their promises, and it's their hobby to gossip. Listen into their conversations. They'll likely be talking about you or someone else.

, This person never acknowledges your ethnicity/culture/opinion. This friend considers you something else, and think it's alright to insult your heritage using derogatory slang words around you while knowing it offends you. They know you're uncomfortable and want to encourage it. They'll often brag about how ""rich"" or ""beautiful"" they are, and are spoiled by their parents.

, Nobody wants a friend checking your assets. For all you know, this so-called friend may be working for someone else to find about you. This type of friend may use spying techniques because they are jealous, or they want to teach you a lesson. Another reason may be if they want to get close to your network or friends and acquaintances. When you're speaking with someone, do they hover nearby? Do they always want to know what you're doing? They aren't really interested in you, so try to dump this friend as soon as you find out that this one is poisonous.


You might notice that these people always need to know everything. For example, you may be talking to another friend about a confidence and she/he was not right there, but comes across the room wanting to know what you're talking about. Well, okay, that can be nothing; don't be paranoid. It may be a ""close-friend"" but a spy could and would go much further, often really trying to overhear conversations, and sneaking to read email, or borrowing cell phones, reading texts, between you and other people.
Spies often lie. They may lie about their name, age, etc. to you.
Be careful of extremes of nosiness. They may soon blackmail or bully you.
If you feel intimidated or threatened by this person, tell an authority or elder you trust.

, This type of ""friend"" is absolutely infuriating. When you are hanging out with them and other friends of yours, they are always talking to you and start socializing with your friends. However, when you are hanging out with them and their friends, they absolutely ignore you and ""forget"" to introduce you to their friends. If there are three people on a sidewalk, you, them, and their other friend, you'll always be the third person walking behind. The third wheel. Every time you try to spark up a conversation he/she ignores you and continues to talk to their friend, or interrupts you and continues blabbing. This is a sign of insecurity masquerading as coolness; it's unkind and unwanted.

, This person uses you and your ideas/intellectual assets; interferes with your social/professional contacts; takes over conversations you're having with others; tries to network and make friends with anyone you talk to; and generally climbs on you to get where you're going, not setting her own course. This so-called friend seeks promotion/or has gotten promoted on the backs of more talented colleagues, manipulating authority, making him- or herself look good at your expense and often using ideas and insights you shared with her. They'll copy everything you do. You're their role model and the center of their eyes. They'll turn every conversation into an interview, so they can find more about you to copy. You might become exhausted trying to evade their interloping so you can maintain your own friends & contacts without their interference. They have low self esteem and have trouble making friends so let you do all the work it takes, then try to reap the rewards of your effort.


If you say ""I'm going to compliment 's shoes"", they will beat you to it and act like it was their own observation. If you say, ""I think will be good for a job opening I saw"", they'll chase the person down and suggest applying for the job. If you work with someone like this, they'll take credit for your ideas and tell the boss about your latest, greatest thoughts, saying: ""I was just thinking ..."" after you explained to them how you arrived at your conclusion. They'll copy your ideas, your favorites, and your observations. If you are in school with this person, she'll run to the professor with every brilliant insight you share and pretend ownership. This person is very insecure and needs you to show her the way; she feels entitled to share in all your relationships.

, This type of person is really dominating. They don't accept you if you have different opinions to theirs. Instead, they accept you only when you think like them. Some are like this only because they are insecure, but others are merely jerks with a need to dominate. They'll have their own army to defend them, look up to them, and worship them. But the most fearsome thing about them is that queen bees often take advantage of friendships and might turn every one of your ""friends"" against you over the course of a day just to wreck and break you. They are just despicable and deadly, so steer clear.

, If your friend is one of the ""bad friend"" types above and they sap your energy, patience and resources regularly, it's a fair bet that you're better off cutting this person out from your tight knit friends.


Decide whether this person is even worth keeping as an acquaintance. This will depend on the context––if you need to keep working with this person or seeing them at family get-together, then keeping a calm and distanced acquaintanceship may be the best option. On the other hand, if this person has no other formal links to your life, you may wish to cut the bond entirely.

, If you are always the first one to contact a friend and you're getting tired of little to no response, stop contacting them. Block them from your contacts, and leave all the text conversations that have them. Avoid seeing them in public. If this person is a true friend, they will reach out if they notice they haven't heard from you, and it only takes a few minutes to text, email, or call someone. If they don't, you're wiser about this friend's attitude and you can begin to spend more time with the friends who do care.

, If you can't quietly distance yourself and refuse all invitations to go places with this friend, you'll need to be up front about ceasing the friendship. The best way to break up with a friend who isn't working out is to confront them face-to-face or by phone and tell them crystal clear that you feel unable to continue the friendship for such and such a reason.


Avoid using blame language. Although you don't want to say ""it isn't you, it's me"" type language, you do want to make it clear that this is about your feelings and your peace of mind. Avoid insulting the character of the other person or blaming them for your feelings.
Remind the other person of the other friends in their life, and even recommend a new friend if this seems appropriate.

State your honest feelings.,
Dismiss the insult.,
Laugh.,
Remain calm.",How to Stop a So Called Friend from Putting You Down1," Sometimes your friend might not realize that what they said was hurtful or inappropriate. Perhaps they thought you would take it as a joke, or maybe they did not think before they spoke. Don’t be afraid to tell them how you feel in a direct but gentle manner. Your friend might realize that certain topics or jokes are off-limits with you.


You can try saying something like “I’m really hurt by that” or “When you say things like that, I feel as though I am worthless.”
Try not to respond with sarcasm. Your friend might mistake it as acceptance of what they are doing. For example, if your friend makes a comment on your weight, instead of a dry “thanks,” try saying, “I don’t find that funny.”;
, Sometimes bullies will upset you just to see your reaction afterwards. If you learn how to brush off insults, you will not be giving your friend any satisfaction from the put down, and they may stop when they realize that they have no power over you. One way to do this is to simply ignore the insult and assert your positive qualities. Swallow your anger and make a statement that both calls attention to the inappropriateness of the statement while signaling that you don’t care what they think.For example, if your friend puts down your appearance, say, “I don’t care what you think. I think I look beautiful.”

, When someone puts you down, they may be trying to assert dominance over you by reducing your confidence. Humor can turn the situation around by giving you control over the insult. If you cannot come up with a witty comeback, try just laughing in response. If your friend really meant to hurt you, you will be proving to them that you are too strong for such silly tactics.If the insult really hurts you, tell your friend that you do not find it funny.
Don’t make a joke at your friend’s expense, or it will continue the cycle of insults. Instead, use self-deprecating humor. By being able to make fun of yourself, you demonstrate that you don’t care what others think and that you are comfortable in your own skin. This can help discourage others from making fun of you!

, Anger is a natural response to insults, but it can worsen the situation. If you respond to your friend with anger, they will try to accuse you of overreacting, and they will use your anger against you later on. Instead, remain calm and try to display indifference to your friend. When speaking to them, use a flat tone of voice. If you are very angry, express it through your words.


A good calm dismissal is to just say “I’m sorry to hear you think that.”
You can also state your feelings by saying, “I don’t want to be angry with you, but when I hear you say such things about me, it upsets me.”

"
Act now.,
Do some honest analysis of the situation.,
If it was your fault, apologize.,
Talk.,
Listen to your friend.,
Make a decision as to the worth of disputing points about your behavior or issues that have arisen in the friendship.,
Acknowledge your differences.,
Avoid being naive.,
Find a compromise.,
Show willingness to strengthen your friendship and to avoid growing apart ever again.",How to Save a Friendship," The moment you're aware that the two of you start growing apart, do something about it. Waiting will only bring about an inevitable permanency of the loss of your friendship. Be prepared to be the one who makes the initial steps; your friend may be laboring under the belief that it's something you've done to harm the friendship, so it's not worth waiting around for them to solve things.;
, Sit down and think back to where it all went wrong. Was it your fault? Was it something you said or did or didn't say or do although you should have? It is important to think about your inaction at certain points such as all those times you failed to make a call to see how your friend was, or when you missed appointments, or failed to show up at important events. Think carefully and do not make irrelevant decisions.

, Briefly explain your side of the story and avoid making excuses or shifting the blame. By taking responsibility for your part in damaging the friendship, you prove that your desire to keep your friend is more important than your pride or sense of self-righteousness.

, If you can't seem to find the reason for the growing interpersonal distance between you and your friend, suggest that the two of you simply talk. Tell your friend that you're sad that things don't seem to be that great between the two of you anymore and that you'd really like to work out whether it might be possible to restore the friendship you had in the past. Your willingness to work through the issues will be appreciated, especially if you make it clear that you're totally open to hearing their side of the story. Whatever you do..DO NOT lash out and become angry upset or make your friend upset. This will make the barrier between you bigger and it will evidently be harder to get her/him back. Try not to interrupt your friend while explaining their side of the story. Instead, listen attentively.

, If a third party has been telling different stories to both of you to cause conflicts, listening to your friend is the best way to spot it. Ask who told them that if you hear that you said something you'd never say in a million years. It's amazing how fast a third party liar's mind games blow up in their face once the victims compare notes. So even if someone is trying to avoid you, ask why and be prepared to listen no matter what your friend says.

, If your friend has the wrong end of the stick and has misunderstood things that you've said or done (or not done), then by all means clarify what you believe to be the case. However, do not be argumentative or confrontational, as this will cause your friend to feel defensive and it will simply speed up the end of the friendship. Try not to expect the friendship to fix itself. You must try yourself to break the barrier between you and get along. Be patient, explain clearly how you see the situation and give your interpretation of past events without judging or defensiveness. For example:


Your friend might accuse you of never being there during important events in the opening of their new business over the past year. They might say that it got to the point that every time he or she asked you to help out, you seemed too busy or disinterested in their new venture even though at first you had been very supportive. You might reply that you accept it was wrong of you to never be available to talk things through. You might also outline what happened to prevent you from being the close friend of former times. For example, perhaps you had to take care of a sick child or spouse, all the while trying to hold down your job with its unforgiving deadlines. Provide factual explanations of why you weren't as engaged with your friendship as you could have been rather than offering excuses - the truth is important. And don't seek sympathy or pity but do clarify why you were not able to be there for your friend.

, Your friend might be footloose and fancy free while you're a dad to three kids. As life changes around us, friendships change too. However, this doesn't mean that you lack that vital connection that sparked the friendship in the first place and shifts in your working, personal, and lifestyle doesn't have to undermine your friendship. Talking openly about the changes is important, as well as accepting that the two of you have different trajectories but still have space, love, and respect for one another in your lives.


If your friend has distanced from you because of changes in your lives, take the opportunity to reassure each other that while life has changed, the importance of your friendship has not. And acknowledge that if you have changed, you certainly don't expect your friend to change.
Resurrect some things that the two of you can still enjoy doing together. For example, set aside a regular night, afternoon, or day when the two of you meet up to spend time together doing the things you both enjoy such as seeing a movie, sitting in a cafe, playing a sport, etc.

, While you may want to rescue the friendship, be alert for signs that your friend is deliberately seeking to end it. Given that this is an unthinkable prospect in a previously loving, and caring connection, only resort to believing this is a possibility if the signs make it extremely obvious, for example, if your friend goes out of their way to avoid you, or stops answering your calls, or can never be found by you but mutual friends don't seem to have this problem, it's possible that your friend is trying to end things. If this is the case, try to revive things but don't beat yourself up if it fails because it's not your fault and the other person has made a choice that you can't change.

, Assuming your friend has talked and listened, and both of you have cleared the air, look for ways that you can reach compromises on the things that have undermined your friendship to this point and look for ways to set the relationship back on track. If you mean as much to this person as they means to you, through mutual compromising in the end you will have at least made some progress in the right direction.

, Once you have worked through the challenges facing your friendship and come to a shared solution, show your friend how much they mean to you. Start creating new memories and precious moments that will make the unpleasant page in your common history look insignificant and never worth mentioning again.

Set aside one on one time.,
Use active listening.,
Ask questions by referring to what the other person said.,
Pay attention to body language.,
Pause to think about the other person's point of view.,
Don't voice every disagreement you have.,
Focus only on important problems.,
Forgive the other person's actions if necessary.,
Express gratitude.",How to Relate1," If you have trouble relating to someone close to you, these steps will help you understand him better. The first step is to spend time alone together, to make it easier for you to focus on that person. This is especially true if the friend is feeling introverted or shy, or if he is not comfortable discussing serious or personal topics in front of a group.;
, Give the other person time to talk about their problems, their feelings, or anything else that is weighing on them. Make a concerted effort to avoid distractions and pay attention. This is called active listening, and can take practice to develop. Turn off your phone, face the person you are listening to, and occasionally nod or say yes to show that you are listening.Practice focusing on what she is saying, and not on how you react to her words or how you plan to respond.


Your friend may not be ready to talk about personal topics at the same time you are ready to focus on them. Let your friend have a more casual conversation if that's what she wants, but still practice these listening and relating techniques.

, Establish a connection and show that you are listening by referring to the point he just made.A question is an excellent way to do this while involving the other person and clarifying anything you're unclear on. Try these examples, changing the content of the question to fit the topic:


""When you said you were stressed in your job, is that because of the workload, or some other reason?""
""If I understood you right, you're worried your father will be upset about you moving out of town?""

, While listening, watch the person's facial expressions, gestures, and other movements. If he crosses his arms, moves further away, or makes repeated nervous gestures such as adjusting his hair, he may be uncomfortable. Consider suggesting a more casual topic of conversation.


Learn more about reading body language.

, Resist the urge to respond with the first reply that comes to mind. Instead, take a moment to imagine how that person feels. Even if you think her interpretation of the situation is wrong, pretend you are in her position and have the same idea of what's going on. Could you see yourself responding in a similar way, or at least feeling the temptation to respond in that way?


For example, your friend accuses you of intentionally excluding her from a party, when in fact you tried to invite her and failed to reach her. Instead of defending yourself immediately or getting offended, try to think about how you would like to be treated if you genuinely thought your friends were avoiding you. Letting her know that she is still your friend by inviting her to another event may be more effective than arguing over the details of the last one.

, Relating isn't about winning a fight, or even communicating every opinion you have. Stay honest, but don't automatically vocalize every argument or negative reaction you have. Respect your friend by allowing him to hold a different opinion than yours.


As a rule of thumb, disagreements that lead to harm or negative emotions should be discussed openly. Disagreements that do not actively affect your relationship can be left alone. For example, differences in political views rarely affect regular interactions between friends, as long as they refrain from arguing over them.

, Approach disagreements or conflicts with a critical eye before you rush to find a solution. Is this problem something that will drive the relationship apart, or is it a ""pet peeve"" that you can learn to ignore or work around? Part of relating to someone involves allowing her to take some actions you disagree with, understanding that it works for her.


Often, the two of you can agree not to be around each other during certain actions or events. For example, watch a television show privately if the other person finds it offensive, or give her time alone to see her friend that you don't get along with.
Sometimes, even apparently serious problems can be worked out with a respectful compromise. For example, you may respectfully attend each other's different religious ceremonies for important holidays or events, but agree not to attend each other's weekly religious service.

, Forgiveness is more easily said than done, but if there is ""bad blood"" between you and your friend, it is worth taking the time to work through it, either with him or by yourself. You do not necessarily need to understand the motivation behind your friend's actions, but if you wish to relate to your friend in future, you will need to move past resentment.Note that if the other person is not ready to admit fault, he may be angry when you tell them you forgive him. Keep the forgiveness to yourself if you think this may be the case.

, Create a closer bond by recognizing when the other person does something for you. Thank that person for compliments, assistance, and kind acts. The positive emotional connection may make it easier for you to understand your friend in future, or at least stop you from jumping to negative conclusions about her actions.

"
"
Talk with your friend.,
Look at pros and cons.,
If you decide that you would both benefit from ending the friendship, plan out how you're going to tell them.,
Start with, ""I think we should talk..."" Tell them, ""I haven't found it very easy to enjoy this friendship the way I expected to.,
Expect hurt feelings.",How to End an Unhealthy Friendship," Ask them how they feel about the friendship. Whether they say they're happy with the way it is, or they don't, you should still think about your final decision.;
, What are you gaining that matters from this relationship? What are you losing? What would you gain and/or lose from ending this friendship? How about your friend? Ask them how they feel if they know the friendship may be ended. If they're oblivious, don't ask, because this could seriously hurt them, and make them feel like you're carelessly calling it quits, whether it's you causing the problems or him/her.

, First, find a good time and place.


The lunch table, when they're having a good day isn't such a good idea, because this makes the conversation seem public, and it only ruins the nice day for them. Maybe when it's just an average day, you can approach them after school with what you have to say. That's a time when everyone's focused on getting home, so, most likely, no one will bother you.

It is also a good idea to avoid talking to your friend when he or she is having a bad or not-so-good day, or when he or she is feeling down. Choosing a time like this would only make him him or her feel worse.


Just make sure you find a private location to tell them where no one's likely to overhear what's going on or witness the whole thing. That way, they can think about it at home, where they can cry if they must, and talk about it with someone without interruptions. They can grieve with comfortable, familiar surroundings.

, How do you feel?"" Make sure you explain your reasons why it isn't easy to continue calling yourself his/her friend. If they want to talk for a minute, by all means, let them! This is about both of you.

, Things don't always turn out the way they were planned to. That's basically the whole lesson you (and your former friend) could learn from this. Maybe you could learn even more from it! Maybe this person will try to win you back. Tell them, ""it just won't work out. We've tried."" Just move on with your life.

Write down as many details as you can remember.,
Get in contact with other people that knew the specific person you're searching for.,
Know how to search online.,
Search for your friend's name on Google Image search.",How to Find an Old Friend1," If your search ends up dragging on or producing unclear results, you'll be thankful for as much detail as possible. Try to remember your friend's hair color, height, maiden name, family members' names, and the names of all towns he lived in and places he worked for.;
, Ask them questions about when they've last seen them, talked to them, or any personal information like last known email addresses or phone numbers.


If you and your friend had a major falling-out, some of your contacts may not cooperate.
It's worth combing your address book to see if you have written down any connections to them that you have forgotten about.

, A simple search engine attempt often doesn't lead anywhere, but it's worth a try. Whether you're using Google or one of the more specialized services described later, it pays to know how to make your search more effective:


Search for nicknames as well, even if your friend didn't have one when you knew her. For instance, an ""Elizabeth"" might now go by ""Beth,"" ""Betty,"" or ""Liza.""
Search for just the first name, in case your friend's last name changed with marriage or divorce.
On search engines, enclose your friend's name in quotation marks, then add more information such as the school she went to, the city she lived in, or the business she worked for.

, If you see a face that may be your friend, follow the link to the website the image showed up on. Even if this doesn't lead to contact, you might find a more up-to-date photograph of your friend, which can help you identify him in later search results.

Schedule a time when you two can be alone.,
Introduce the topic carefully.,
Use “I” statements to deflect blame.,
Ask your friend why they do what they do.,
Allow your friend to respond.,
Set firm boundaries.",How to Stop a So Called Friend from Putting You Down2," It is best to have a serious talk with your friend in private. You do not want to embarrass them in front of your other friends, or else you will look like the bully. Suggest a time when you both are available and ask your friend if they want to hang out.

, Start by asking them if you can talk about something serious. Bring up the topic in a cautious manner. You should not blame them or accuse them of wrongdoing; rather, tell them that certain things have been causing you stress and anxiety recently.


A good way of starting the conversation can be, “Hey, can we chat about something? I want to have an honest talk with you. You’re a good friend to me, but recently some things have been happening that have really hurt me. I want to make sure that we can come to an understanding together so that we can remain friends.”

, Beginning your sentences with “I” instead of “you” make your statements sound less accusatory. You do not want to blame your friend because they might respond negatively, and they may even blame you in return. Instead you want to foster an atmosphere of acceptance and communication. Your statements should start with statements like “I think” or “I feel.” For example, you can say, “When I hear that I am overweight or chubby, I feel as though I am ugly and worthless.” Or you can try saying, “I know that sometimes you like to joke around, but I feel sad when I am told that I am dumb.”

, Invite your friend to be completely honest. Inform them that you will not judge them before asking them why they put you down so often. If they react negatively, emphasize that you want to know their side of the story and that you are not angry at them.


You can say things like, “why do you always comment on how much I eat?” or “why is it so funny that I like to read comic books?”
You may even ask them how they might feel in your situation: “How would you feel if someone kept making fun of how you do your hair?”

, Your friend might be confused, surprised, sad, or angry about the conversation. Give them plenty of time to think through their answer and respond. If they say something you disagree with, wait until they have finished speaking before you defend yourself. Do not interrupt them or it will escalate the tension in the room.

, At the end of your conversation, you should both set boundaries for your relationship. Both of you should come up with ideas of what is and is not acceptable within the terms of your relationship.For example, you may not want your friend to tease you about a crush while your friend might be uncomfortable with how you talk about their family. At the same time, you both might be fine with jokes about each other’s habits or hobbies. If you both agree to these boundaries, your friendship will actually become stronger than it was before.

Respond immediately.,
Tell them to stop, don’t ask.,
Remain strong even if they appear upset.,
Seek help from a trusted authority.",How to Stop a So Called Friend from Putting You Down3," Don’t let a grudge fester inside of you. Immediately call attention to their tactics. Let them know that you are not happy with what they are doing. Make eye contact and use a firm, clear voice. By being assertive, you will establish that you are serious about what you are talking about.

, Asking is a very indirect, polite way of calling attention to their habits. If you have tried talking through the problem and failed, give your friend a firm, direct “Stop.” This may jar them and express just how upset you are with the situation. Call attention to previous times when you pointed out their bad behavior to reinforce how their pattern of bullying has persisted.


Try saying, ""Hey. I asked you to stop pulling pranks on me. I talked to you last time, and then we talked privately, and you said you understood. Now I'm telling you: I'm not going to put up with it any more. Stop it.""

, Some people may respond with anger or crying in an attempt to guilt you for calling them out on their rude behavior.You should remain strong and calm in the face of such emotional manipulation. You can apologize for upsetting them, but you should not back down.

#* You can say, “I’m sorry that this is upsetting for you, but when you put me down, I feel the same way that you are feeling now.”, If the friendship turns verbally abusive, you may need to seek outside help. Because the abuse is coming from a trusted friend, it can be difficult to find support groups that will boost your confidence and provide advice. If you are still in school, approach your parents or a teacher for help mediating the situation. If you are in college, try going to your university’s counselling services for assistance. In the workplace, ask your boss or HR to intervene. Outside of the workplace, you can find friends, significant others, or counsellors who can help you navigate the difficult situation.


Venting to another person can help give you perspective, and it will also help you process your emotions so that you can confront your bullying friend without crying or yelling.Try not to consult a friend who is also friends with your frenemy. They may try to defend your bully or they may tell your bully what you said in an innocent attempt to patch your relationship. Try to find someone who is distant from the situation. They can provide a clear-headed and objective perspective on the matter.

"
Reduce contact.,
Tell them you want to stop being friends.,
Ignore angry texts or emails.,
Enforce your boundaries.,
Keep your social group.,
Make new friends.",How to Stop a So Called Friend from Putting You Down4," If a friendship is hurting your self-esteem, causing anxiety, or inducing feelings of self-doubt, it may be time to end the friendship. The easiest way to do so is to slowly reduce contact with the other person. Stop scheduling time to hang out together outside of school and work. Don’t text them unless you absolutely need to. By slowly cutting off contact, you give yourself time to find other friends while avoiding a potentially nasty confrontation., Sometimes you might have to tell your friend face to face that you want to stop hanging out together. This can be very difficult, and it will probably occur after you have tried talking to them several times about your issues. If they ask you why, try to explain without blaming or accusing them.You can try saying, “Look, we have had some good times, but I think I need my own space.”
If they ask why, deflect the blame towards yourself. “I don’t think we have a similar sense of humor. Sometimes what you find funny is what I find hurtful. I don’t think you’re a bad person, but I don’t think we make good friends.”
If you don’t want to tell them outright, you can give an excuse for not seeing them. For instance: “I need to spend more time on my work and less time on socializing” or “I’ve been neglecting my health, and I need to focus more on taking care of myself.”

, If your ex-friend tries to contact you in anger, ignore the messages. Don’t respond with equal anger. They may say things that you find are wrong or disturbing, but they may be trying to provoke you so that you appear to be the bad guy. Swallow your anger and ignore the messages. Distract yourself with another activity, and if their attempts at contact worsen, block their phone number and social media accounts.

, If your ex-friend repeatedly ignored your boundaries in the past, they will probably not start respecting them after you cut them off, even if they promise to improve. It may be easy to let them back into your life. It is fine to acknowledge that you had good times together while still recognizing that it was a toxic relationship. Let them know that you are firm in your decision, and don’t be swayed into being friends with them., If you and your ex-friend had many mutual friends, it can be hard to cut off contact, but you should not lose all of your friends because of one person. That said, your mutual friends may feel compelled to take a side. If your ex-friend tries to cause drama, stay strong. Do not spread rumors or speak poorly of your old friend. Tell your friends that you and your ex-friend had a falling out and that you still respect them even though you have gone your separate ways.


Try telling your friends, ""All I'm going to say is that we had a fight. I think they are still a good person, but we need our space.""
If your friends push you for details, resist the urge to badmouth your old friend. Good friends will see that you are being a bigger person and will respect you for it.

, You may encounter your old friend in social settings, at school, or during work. The transition will be easier if you are able to make new friends outside of your usual social group. Join a club, start a hobby, or take an evening class. You will meet new people who are not associated with your toxic ex-friend.

Be aware of the judgements you make.,
Don't criticize ""shallow"" behavior.,
Try to ""translate"" other accents or writing styles into your own voice.,
Practice a method of starting a conversation.,
Read more literary fiction.,
Watch films and television with the sound turned off.",How to Relate2," Most of us make immediate snap judgements when we see or hear a person. This doesn't mean we need to act on them, or that we're bad people for thinking of them. However, it's good to recognize that these judgements can prevent us from relating with people. The first step is to notice when you make these judgements.


Do you avoid certain topics with certain friends because you assume they won't be interested?
Do you get annoyed or anxious when you see a stranger on the street or public transportation, before he has said or done anything to deserve it?
Do you dislike people with certain superficial traits, such as a tattoo or a choice of activity?

, A common complaint by people who have trouble relating to others is that other people are shallow, immature, or even stupid. Dismissing someone with these insults makes it unlikely that you'll ever discover another side to her.People having fun can often be annoying to people who don't share their idea of enjoyment. If someone parties more than you would like, or acts hyper and obnoxious in a group of friends, consider that you might still get along with her in a calmer environment.
Fashion choices, makeup, or even choice of activity are often more superficial than people think. Don't let your stereotypes get in the way of a conversation.
Keep an open mind about other people's lifestyles. Activities you look down on may be fulfilling for other people, or provide benefits that your lifestyle doesn't. Even if someone admits to ""guilty pleasures"" that don't appear to be beneficial, consider that these may reduce stress or boost energy levels before she returns to more productive or challenging activities.

, It's easy to stereotype someone based on his accent, his use of ""text speak,"" or even a certain phrase that annoys you. Before you respond, imagine yourself or a respected friend making the same statement with a different tone or word choice. Does it sound more reasonable?

, If you want to meet new people, find a way to start conversations. It's easier to get an accurate idea of someone's personality once you're chatting. Here are a couple simple ways to accomplish this:Ask a simple question to get started. If you smoke, ask whether the other person has a light. Ask a stranger in a big city whether she come from the city or moved here from elsewhere.
If something funny or alarming happens nearby, make a comment on it, or just make eye contact and raise your eyebrows.
Bring along a conversation starter, such as a dog or a noticeable, unusual piece of clothing.

, At least one study suggests that reading ""literary fiction"" or realistic fiction can increase your ability to relate to other people.This may be due to these works explaining characters' motivations or showing their experiences in a more realistic setting, which can help readers understand the motivations of people in everyday life.


This probably has no effect unless you are reading a story that you feel emotionally involved in.If reading a story feels like a chore, stop and try to find literary fiction you may enjoy more.

, Train yourself to read body language and facial expressions by turning the volume and subtitles off and trying to figure out what is going on.If you have difficulty with this, try watching the films with a friend who is good at reading body language, and have her explain her interpretations to you. Move on to watching by yourself once you have more practice.


Watch foreign language films without subtitles to practice interpreting tones of voice as well.

"

Use social media sites.,
Use dedicated people-search websites.,
Sign up for friend-finding websites.,
Search by alma mater, military service, or business.",How to Find an Old Friend2," Search for your friend's full name on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social websites, as well as Google or other search engines.


On Facebook, type in a name in the top search bar and hit enter. On the left-hand pane, select People. A list of filters should appear at the top of your search, where you can enter possible locations, workplaces, or schools.

, Pipl is one of the more impressive free search services out there.You can also try ZabaSearch, or purchase a search for a few dollars on Intelius, advancedbackgroundchecks, radaris, peekyou, Veromi.com, or Spokeo.com. You can often take the free partial results from several commercial search sites and patch together phone numbers and addresses, without actually paying for the data. Every site has different information, though most of it tends to be pretty stale. Spokeo tends to have the freshest data.


Make sure to scroll all the way through the Pipl results. An email address may be buried in an old blog post, online survey, or forum comment.

, This works best if you suspect your friend may be looking for you as well, since these websites leave public messages for people to find. Try Lost Friends


Be very cautious with sites that require a credit-card sign up, as they may be scams, or end up being more expensive than you anticipated. All the options above are free.
Check your Spam or Junk Mail folder for the confirmation email while signing up.

, Many alumni sites require paid memberships to use, or will ask your friend to pay in order to view your message. Still, some of these sites can be useful resources, if you know where your friend went to school.



ZoomInfo's search is a great resource for people in the corporate world.
BatchMates is a free alumni reunion site. It is focused on India but includes members worldwide.
If your friend served in the US military, check its online Buddy Finder.

"
"
Search marriage records.,
Check US political contributions.,
Search court records.,
Use the UK electoral register.",How to Find an Old Friend3," Search online for ""marriage records"" and the name of the country your friend last lived in, or her state if she lived in the US. These records are often only available in person, but your state or county website should direct you to the office where you can check these in person.


If you do find a marriage record, but no accompanying contact information, you still have the name of a new person to search for (the spouse), as well as a potential change of name to take into account.

, In the United States, if your friend donated more than $250 to a political campaign, her name is recorded on the Federal Election Committee website, often with an address as well.

, Again, you'll need to search for ""court records"" along with the name of the country or state your friend lived in, as there is no single database where you can look these up. In many cases, you'll need to file a request with a specific court to get more information, so this method can take a fair amount of time.Do not be fooled by scam sites that charge you money to search government databases.

, To search this database for free, inquire of your local Electoral Registration Office, or ask your local library staff whether the service is available.You can also pay a few pounds to a private company to perform this search for you.

Meet some new people and stop harping on the old.",How to End a Friendship," Do you think your anger will subside, or is this really the end? Friends fight and still stay friends, and you can't expect perfection from them all the time. But if you're fighting more than feeling friendly, it's probably time to bail. Who wants to be with someone they're always arguing with, anyway?Ask yourself some questions to better understand things:


Was your disagreement a one-time occurrence or has been ongoing? If your disagreement just won't die, maybe the friendship should.
Does the issue itself matter more than the friendship? Voting for different people is one thing, but if someone deeply disagrees with your core beliefs, it may be a deal-breaker.
Is there a hurt or a slight that neither of you will apologize for? Are you so proud/upset that you can't say ""I'm sorry"" and move on with your lives?;
, Sometimes friendships don't end with a fight, but with a fizzle. Has it been awhile since you felt like calling up your friend for a chat? Do you find yourself making excuses not to hang out? If so, ask yourself whether you or your friend could do anything to save the relationship, or whether you even want to. People change -- it sucks, but it is true. Don't fight it if you don't have a reason to.


If you're old friends, give it another shot. People go through rough patches, and it's no excuse to cut and run because things aren't fun for a few weeks.
Drifting apart doesn't mean you won't one day drift back together. Just stop hanging out for a while -- it's as simple as that.

, Rushing from ""best friends"" to ""I'll never see them again"" is childish and extreme. Would just hanging out less accomplish the same goals? Does it make you sad to imagine life without the person, or does it make you feel relieved? If you aren't sure this is what you want to do, then just try seeing less of them. It's a lot easier, less dramatic, and mature than cutting them out of your life all at once.


Simply put, are you still willing to put in energy to keep this relationship going? If the answer is no, then move on and make the break.
If you already know that you'll be happy to get rid of the drama, boredom, or other negative feelings that you associate with this person, ending it is a good idea. Ignore the mutual friends, activities, and other nonsense. If they're bad for you, end it.


, If your friend is a danger to you or your health, screw social etiquette and end it immediately. If your friend is manipulative/hurtful or you're afraid he or she will have a violent reaction to your friendship's end, just hit the brakes now. No conversation needed. Stop taking calls and texts, unfriend the person on Facebook, and don't show up in places where you know that person will be.


If you're in danger, notify authorities (a boss, school officials, the police) immediately. This is no longer a friendship worth handling alone.

, Friends go to different schools, move to different towns, or gravitate to different activities, and they start hanging out with other people. It's quick, painless, and usually mutual. To gracefully put a friendship out of its misery (or let it wilt, if that sounds too harsh), you should:Keep your conversations in safe, shallow territory. Keep all of the emotional, personal baggage in your own bedroom and out of their house.
Lose touch with them. Don't make as big an effort to call or text. Skip a phone call or two. Don't overdo it , of course. But if you're not friends, you don't need to be in constant communication.
Decline invitations to chill. As the distance between you grows, stop spending time with the ex-friend. They'll stop calling eventually, once they get the idea.

, You want straightforward results? Be a straight shooter. Rather than leaving the person guessing why you aren't talking to him or her anymore, set aside a few minutes to talk to them. If you're just not interested in hanging out with someone, this may be a bit extreme. But if they are toxic to your life, old pals, or otherwise damaging your life you need to own up to your decision and tell them honestly.

, This way you can hightail it out of there when the conversation is over, or if things get heated (which they shouldn't... but may). Coffee shops and public parks are good choices.

, Cut right to the chase -- ""I don't think we should hang out anymore"" is about as blunt, and effective, as it gets.

, Don't throw blame or talk trash about them. For example, instead of accusing the person of drinking too much, go with ""I need time to focus more on my studies and less on partying.""

, Make sure they understand your position too. It's important to let your friend tell you what he or she thinks about the situation. However -- it should not change your decision. You spent a lot of time thinking about this. Don't undo it all in thirty seconds.

, You may also be tempted to apologize for ending the friendship. But unless you've done something wrong, there is no reason to be sorry for choosing to cut ties with someone. Just get it done and get out of there. 

, No matter how you end a friendship, the person is likely to try to get in touch once or twice. Let the person know if they are still welcome to talk to you or not. If you are not crystal clear about your expectations, then don't end things until you are. If you're wishy-washy now, both of you will likely slip into old habits later.


If you are willing to keep in touch with this person, make it clear what kind of communication is cool with you. You don't have to ignore someone's very existence just because you don't want to hang out anymore.
If you never want to speak to your former friend again, warn them of the consequences if they don't listen. And, like any other promise, make sure you follow through if they do.

, Sometimes losing the worst people hurts your the most. You had good times, though. They were cool, fun, and funny when you were friends. Losing them, no matter how bad things got, is going to feel like ripping off a bandage. It hurts, and it stings in the open air, but it's for the best.


Your friend might not take it well. One or both of you might end up crying, begging, or flying off in rage. But whatever the current emotions, they do not erase the reasons you had for ending things.
You're going to feel guilty, end of story. Just remember that, no matter how broken your relationship may have been, it's normal to feel responsible for the death of a good thing. It will pass with time.

, Chances are good that your friend will be angry enough for the both of you. Hurt feelings morph quickly into anger, and anger leads to doing things you'd probably rather not do. If you feel tempers rising on either side, take a step back and get out of there shortly. Like cookies on a hot tray, you'll both cool off faster when you're separated.


If your former friend tends to become aggressive when confronted, you should expect verbal or even physical backlash. End things in public, and bring a friend or write a letter if you're really worried.
You're going to be angry for a while if your friend hurt you. It's normal. But don't let your anger pull you to the dark side, young padawan. Once you let the friendship go, let the emotions go as well.

, More likely than not, it's impossible to completely break it off, especially if you still have to see the person at school or work. Passive aggression, the great weapon of slighted friends the world over, can only hurt you if you let it. Get mentally ready to deal with some mind games in the months after you cut things off. The best defense -- completely ignoring the attack.


If your former friend is passive-aggressive, expect back-stabbing behavior after you break off the friendship. Try and remember that it is, in the end, kind of your fault for ending things, and that you shouldn't strike back.
You already ended the relationship. Don't make things worse by trying to sabotage or hurt them after you've already ended it.

, It's nothing personal. It is just hard for people to be friends with two people who are no longer friends for each other. People will naturally gravitate toward either you or your friend because playing both sides puts them in the middle of the war they want none of. Note, however, that this is by far the most melodramatic outcome. More often than not your social group will shift a bit and move on.

, Meeting new people will signal to your former friend that you have a life outside of him or her. It will also help you feel better about the friendship's end since you'll have great new people in your life. Some fresh ideas will do you good -- as long as you're on the lookout for behavior similar to the friend you had to leave.

Identify your role in toxic relationships.,
Give it time.",How to End a Toxic Friendship," The first step from detangling from a toxic person is admitting what the relationship is. Even if you've decided to ditch a toxic friend, you may still be hanging on to certain notions about your friendship. Be honest with yourself that the relationship is toxic and does not benefit you in any way. Not only will this help you abandoned a toxic friend, it will help you have higher standards in the future.Think about what you get, if anything, out of the relationship. Chances are, you no longer have fun with this person. They are probably a drain on you. You probably feel exhausted after spending time with them.
Accept you cannot make them change. Toxic people can sense when someone is pulling away, and will try to do things to get you back in their fold. Remind yourself that a toxic person is unlikely to change, even if they swear they will. This will prevent you from getting dragged back into the relationship.
Mixed feelings are normal and to be expected, but that does not mean you should continue a toxic friendship. For example, you might truly admire or love your friend, and the your friend might have some admirable traits, but that doesn't mean that the friendship can't be toxic. It is okay to love a friend, but to still want to move forward.;
, Breaking off any friendship is tough, and abandoning a toxic friend can be particularly rough. Your friend may try to deny wrongdoing or talk over you. Making a script ahead of time, and practicing, can help you stay calm and on track when confronting a toxic person.Write down all your thoughts first. Then, look over what you've written. Try to pull out the most important thoughts and form a few clear sentences explaining why you're ending the relationship.
Practice your script a few times. You can practice in front of a mirror or just recite the words to yourself. You do not want to be reading off the script when you confront the person, so try to have your words more or less memorized before confronting your friend.

, You want to make things clear when breaking off a toxic relationship. Toxic people can be very clingy and controlling and may not take no for an answer easily. Being as clear as possible can help you sever ties on no uncertain terms.You don't have to be brutal. Even if this person has hurt you tremendously, being unnecessarily aggressive can escalate the situation into a fight. Try to be clear without being insulting.
State your feelings, and your expectations from here, as firmly as you can. For example, ""I feel like I'm not getting anything out of this relationship. I do care about you, but it's becoming too hard for me to maintain this relationship. I think it would be best if we go our separate ways.""

, Decide where you want to go from here. Make a list of your personal boundaries ahead of time, and make sure to make these clear to the friend. If you don't want them, say, contacting your further, make this clear. Never apologize for having boundaries. These are important to a healthy relationship dynamic.State your boundaries as clear as you can. For example, ""I want to let you know, I don't want contact for awhile. I need time and space to heal. I would like you to refrain from texting and calling me in the future.""
If you need to express boundaries to others, do so. For example, you may not want to see this person at group events. Let others know. For example, ""As you know, I'm breaking off my friendship with Gillian. It's fine if you still hang out with her, but let me know ahead of time if she's going to be at a group event. I don't want to see her for a bit because I need the space.""

, Toxic people may struggle to understand your needs in any given situation. Toxic people tend to take advantage of empathetic, trusting people and may try to see you again after you break things off. Make it very clear that you do not wish to see them in the future and will not be contacting them from here.It's okay to be a little blunt here. Again, don't be aggressive, but be firm. Say something like, ""I do not want to see you again, so please do not try to contact me.""
Toxic people may have trouble letting go, and attempt to get you back into their folds. To make it clear you were serious about not wanting further contact, ignore texts, calls, and emails. You may want to block the person's number.

, There is no reason to continue interaction on social media if you have removed someone from your life. Delete, unfollow, or de-friend this person on various social media outlets. This will help you regulate your emotions better, as you will not constantly see updates on this person's life.Not everyone keeps social media profiles private. If your friend does not keep their Facebook or Twitter page protected from the public, resist the temptation to check up on them after deleting them. This is only likely to stir negative emotions, resulting in you feeling bad.

, It can be hard to let go of a relationship, even a bad one. A toxic friend may also have planted false ideas in your brain, such as the notion only they can understand you. You may have to create motivation for yourself. Give yourself small rewards for limiting communication.Set goals for yourself and reward yourself for achieving them. For example, if you ignore the person's texts for a week, treat yourself to a new outfit. If you don't check their Twitter for a month, buy yourself a meal at an expensive restaurant.

, You do not want to end up returning to a toxic friendship. However, toxic friendships can take up a lot of time and energy. You will feel the absence of this person in your life, and may be lonely or confused for awhile afterwards. In order to fill the void, keep busy.Take up a new hobby to keep yourself distracted. You could, for example, try knitting, sewing, baking, or anything else that interests you.
Try to find new friends. Forming new, more positive relationships will help you feel happier and confident at having abandoned a toxic person. Join a club, volunteer, or go to an event alone and strike up conversation with someone.

, After leaving a friendship, you will not feel 100% like yourself for awhile. It's important to acknowledge and feel your emotions, even if they're negative. Rather than trying to push away uncomfortable feelings, accept them as they occur.Remember that relationships are difficult. No one is completely free from feelings of discomfort after breaking off an emotional bond. Do not try to fix negative feelings right away, as this will prevent you from working through your issues.
Remind yourself relationships are about personal growth. While you may feel bad now, you've made an effort to make healthier choices about relationships in the future. This will ultimately benefit you, even if the moment is difficult.

, Once you've left a toxic person, surround yourself with those who remind you about all the good, and positive things that come out of a relationship. Find healthy, positive role models to help you cope with your feelings and move forward.Reach out to your friends that are positive and supportive. Make plans to get together and hang out.
Open up about what you've been going through. Be honest that you just ended a friendship and could use some extra support.

, Many people who end up in a toxic friendship have a tendency towards bad relationships. Look at your history with friends, romantic relationships, and family relationships. You may consistently play a certain role in relationships that is negative to you. Being aware of these kinds of patterns can help you break free from them.While you are not responsible for someone else's poor behavior, you may be vulnerable to toxic people for certain reasons. Maybe you tend to be passive in relationships and are uncomfortable stating your needs. Maybe you were taken advantage of emotionally by a parent or loved one at a young age, and are a people pleaser by nature.
Figuring out why you end up in negative relationships is key to breaking the patterns. If you've been in a lot of toxic friendships, you may want to see a therapist to help address the issue.

, Do not expect to feel better overnight. Healing takes time. Do not push yourself to feel better right away. Allow yourself the time you need to mourn. It's normal to be upset for a few months after ending a friendship. Remind yourself this is temporary and that you will eventually feel better."

Determine why you are ending the long term relationship.,
Once you have made the decision, don't second guess yourself.,
Recall the good times, and try to remember the friendship in a good light, if possible.,
Don't call the person you have decided to stop being friends with, just slowly phase the individual out of your life.,
Once the past friend calls you, you need to stay strong in your resolve to end the relationship.,
If you see this friend out and about, just smile, but keep moving.,
If you decide after several years that you want to try being friends with this person again, go ahead and give it a go.",How to End a Lifelong Friendship," If the reasons start with the fact that you have known each other for over 30 years, but do not have mutual affection or interests in common, or the person makes you feel drained and unhappy when you are around them, it is time to end this friendship for maintaining your own personal self-esteem and personal health.;
, You are making a healthy decision to find new friends who support you, don't go back to this unhealthy relationship just because it is comfortable.

, It is always difficult to stop being friends with someone, even when the act of friendship is one-sided or turns unhealthy for you. It is perfectly acceptable to recall the good times, but don't obsess over them.

, Do this in a natural way so that they won't notice a sudden change in your behavior and think something is up. You can do this by ignoring phone calls and only calling back when you are on your way to an appointment, you want to become very busy. Get out there and meet new healthy friends that lift you up. This friend will only contact you to lean on you, bend your ear for more of their personal complaints, or ask to borrow money again. They will not call you just to see how you are doing, so don't expect it. Prepare how you will respond to this friend when he or she does call, after you have stopped calling for awhile. Be ready to wait several days, weeks or months, because this type of friend will not notice that you are gone right away.

, Say you are very busy and you're not sure when things will calm down. Sound happy and be positive. You know this person very well so be prepared when you talk to them. Know what you are going to say and practice with a spouse or family member, but keep things short. You will need to do this several times, as this friend will not believe at first that you are no longer there for them. If they ask you out to lunch, say you are going out with friends and can't make it, but don't reschedule. If they want to talk about her new promotion at work, say you can't talk now, you are finishing a project yourself for work and have to go. Think of any excuse to get off of the phone. They will eventually either come over to your house to see what is up, or they will break down and ask if she/he ""did something to offend you."" If they come over, be polite and tell them you're on your way to an appointment. If they ask if you are offended by something they said, say ""no, I'm just very busy and don't have a lot of spare time lately,"" and get off the phone.

, If they stop and talk to you, again keep things short and sweet. Appear to be very happy, even if you are having a difficult day. This will send the message to this past friend that you no longer need them and are faring just fine without contact. Eventually they will get the hints and stop calling you, because you are no longer giving them what they want or need.

, In several years' time (not several days or months) people can change, and your vain friend may have turned over a new leaf. But if you find that they are the same person you left before, pass again. Anyone can legitimately be busy, so use this as an excuse, but don't elaborate that you have exciting news, etc.
