Find a store that sells leather by the strip.,
Find a store, in your town or online, that sells spikes.,
Find a hole punch.,
Measure your arm.,
Draw your pattern on the leather piece.,
Cut out your pattern.,
Make four or five evenly placed holes on either side of the gauntlet.,
Make a pattern on the leather with a ruler and pencil.,
Make sure you like where you're putting the spikes.,
Get a good lace for your gauntlet, string it up, and you're all set.

",How to Make Spiked Gauntlets," You don't need to go crazy on the quality. Just make sure that it isn't so weak that the weight of the spikes will mess up the leather. You need a piece at least 12"" by 18"" (approx 30cm by 45cm).;
, Size is entirely up to you.

, Probably at the leather store is a good bet. This is a metal tube with a sharp end, that you hit with a hammer to make holes.

, Make this a little bit big, maybe an inch or so on each side, just to be on the safe side.

, This is a matter of personal taste. You can go with a square piece, or make it smaller at the wrist, and get bigger until your elbow. For the latter, you want to make it taper into a peak at the top, otherwise its uncomfortable to wear the thing.

, Use a carpet knife or exacto blade. Be very careful with these objects.

, Again, personal taste dictates how many you want. These are for the laces, which hold the thing on your arm. If you want to be fancy, get the little metal rings to put in there at the leather store. If you want straps, you're on your own.

, Or just go crazy and put them in random order. Make a grid on the leather, remembering not to put them too close together, especially if you have large spikes with large bases on them. Then, at all of the spots where the grid lines meet, make a hole. This will take a long time, and it will be loud. Make sure to do this on a work table, or at least on something you don't mind having tons of little round gouges in.

, Pound on spikes can't ever be moved once they're on there, and constantly recreating holes for screw-on spikes will damage your gauntlet - if not make it look tacky. To put on the spikes (for screw-on spikes), put the screw through the back, and put the spike on. Make sure to tighten with a screwdriver, otherwise they run the risk of coming off. Dab the tip with super glue if you're paranoid about them coming off, but be sure to use a little, otherwise it'll spill everywhere and the gauntlets will have off-white splotches on them - and act fast. Super glue can dry in seconds.

Wear a dress with a short skirt that extends down to the mid-thigh.,

,, A strapless dress will also work. If selecting a dress with straps, choose wider straps instead of spaghetti straps to keep your look consistent with the fashion of the era. Avoid dresses with sleeves.

,, Bright colors, especially red and pink, are eye-catching and completely appropriate for this costume. A cigarette girl needed to catch patrons’ attention, after all.

,


Match the shoes to the color of your dress.
The higher the heel, the better. If you feel unbalanced in high heels, though, lower heels will still work. Just keep the heel narrow, not chunky.

, Use fishnets or dark nylons to keep consistent with the look of a 1940’s nightclub.

,, The holes should be mid-way between the two ends., Choose a ribbon color that contrasts with the color of your dress. For example, if you have a red dress, opt for black ribbon.

Love your music: Everybody knows a look without a background is nothing.,
Be original: This should be a huge part of your life.,
Enjoy : Despite from what many people think, indie is not about being boring, you should actually be a really active person, and knowing the right places in your city.,
Love vintage: That's right.,
Get the look: Basically go for a grunge look, but taking it to today's fashion.,
Accessorize.",How to Get an Indie Rockstar Look," So, before you start looking like an indie rockstar, you should listen to the right music. This will make the entire process a lot more natural. You are not limited to stereotypical indie bands such as Arctic Monkeys or similar. Indie people are known for being really open to any sort of music, and knowing a lot about it. You should be able to maintain a conversation about any of the different ages of rock (classic, art, punk, metal, stadium, grunge, indie) because these are the ones who created the whole indie movement. If possible, join a band, sing or play an instrument.;
, Indie people love art above all things (even more than coffee) so express yourself through art. Paint, photography, music, filming, are all great ways to express your artistic interior. Go for one that suits you the best, or even better, more than one.

, Meaning the right places for vintage shopping, coffee, concerts, art expositions, and so on. Frequently go to them with your friends, and have fun.

, Indies LOVE vintage. Vintage everything,music, clothes, cameras, movies, shows, accessories, and so on. Vintage gives indie a true sense of originality that is hard to find in a mainstream store.

, This mean, mixing a vintage band tee with some black vinyl legging, grey low top converses or flats and a simple black jacket. Some indispensable items in your closet should be vintage tees, flannels shirts and dresses, skinny dark jeans, legging, flats, and great sneakers. In this try to go for Adidas superstars, low top neutral colored Converses (black, white, or grey, if possible) and neutral colored Vans canvas. Ankle boots look really nice too.

, Accessories can make or break and outfit. In jewelry, you don't want anything too big or tacky. A great option would be a simple golden, black or silver long necklace, golden or silver charm bracelets (if you want a more edgy look, you can go for studded bracelets) and simple earrings, just if you want, that match the outfit. Piercings are also a great option for a more edgy look, just keep it simple. A snakebite, a nose ring, maybe some extra studs in your ear. Don't wear two facial piercings at the same time. Another great way to accessorize are scarves. Solid colors, animal print, plaid, or anything that you want, as long as it matches your outfit. Berets give a bohemian look, and are a must and those hippie headbands look really cute. You'll need some simple black or white belts, and maybe a studded one. Sunglasses are CRUCIAL. The ideal would be to have more than one, to match with the outfits.

Listen to music.,
Watch indie films.,
Go thrifting.,
Talk to people.,
Get invited.,
Be cultured.",How to Follow the Indie Trend," Indie fashion and living is very centered around music. Go to your local record store and browse categories such as 'Alternative', 'Acoustic', 'Pop', and 'Rock'. You don't have to listen to a certain band in order to classify yourself; just do a little research on the bands that you find interesting. You want to be able to converse with others about good music.;
, An indie film is often low-budget and artsy, but you can also find the indie vibe in movies like Juno, The Darjeeling Limited, and even Napoleon Dynamite. The colors are clean, vibrant, and the film gives off a faint antiquity. Often times, cult-classics such as Pulp Fiction, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly; and Donnie Darko also make their way into indie culture. Once again, you don't have to rant and rave about your favorite movies in order to 'transform' yourself; simply educate yourself on good films by watching them.

, Thrifting means going down to your local second-hand store and choosing pieces of clothing that are interesting and eye-catching. Take a look at the indie fashion gallery 'LookBook', online at Lookbook.nu for inspiration. You can also pick up a copy of Nylon magazine, which features indie fashion, music, and movies. Some prominent street-fashion/indie culture stores are American Apparel, Urban Outfitters, and Forever21.

, Chat with local music junkies, chat online at Myspace or Facebook, find out who knows what about different shows and go to them. Showing up at a local venue for a concert really puts you right in the center of the indie trend and you can make friends that enjoy listening to the same music. House parties are another great way to meet new people with similar music and fashion interests.

, Party and dance! You don't have to muscle your way into a popular shindig in order to get noticed. Take it easy. With time, you will find yourself at parties here and there, and maybe eventually you will have your own!

, Indie people are often identified by their eclectic taste range. Educate yourself on all different kinds of movies, music, literature, and more.

Photography is usually a hobby of an Indie kid.

,
Be nice to everyone.",How to Dress Like an Indie Hipster," Change your image to something that is totally unique and totally you. Being an indie kid or a hipster means that you are openly quirky and you don't care what others think.;
, Clothes are important for an everyday lifestyle, so let's start with them. Indie kids always have that ""I really don't care"" look, but they actually do put thought into their clothes. Here are good examples of Indie threads to get.


Of course, the Indie tops. Stock up on t shirts with your favourite band name, cool artistic pictures, or just plain ironic sayings. Your shirt should describe who you are. Stay away from t shirts from Hollister, American Eagle, Delia's, Abercrombie, and mainstream places like that. However, Urban Outfitters and American Apparel are great, but expensive. When it's cold, oversized sweaters are the way to go. Any colour, any pattern, anything. Cardigan sweaters are also great for fall, but also get them bigger than your normal size. Flannel button ups are really versatile for any season, too.
Next step is the bottoms. These are easy, basically the tighter the jeans, the better. Own many different skinny jeans as you can, in colours like dark blue, black, and grey. If you want to switch it up, a pair of corduroys also is great for the Indie/Hipster look. If you're into skirts, high waisted skirts on the shorter side. Same goes for shorts.
You can't be Indie, without the proper Indie footwear. Girls can pretty much pull off any kind of shoes, but the following are the best. Vans (slip ons or lace ups), boat shoes, moccasins, colourful flats, equestrian style boots, converse (hi or low tops), Tom's shoes, colourful heels. It's actually pretty hard to go wrong with shoes.

, Now that you've got the basics, it's time for accessories. Indie girls love to ornate themselves in accessories. Long, dangly earrings in any shape or size will work. Stock up on bracelets, with a cool watch and maybe some things you made yourself. Headbands no longer go across your crown, it's all about the forehead. When it's chilly, tie a scarf around your neck. Any kind of rings, if you really want unique jewelry, buy off of etsy.com. Also, the independent designer name will definitely score you Indie points. Thick rimmed, huge glasses. You don't wear glasses? You're about to start to. You can buy fake glasses almost anywhere.

, Most Indies like to rock the pea coat, double breasted is better, but single breasted is okay if that's all you have. Member's Only jackets are definitely vintage, and therefore cool. Sweatshirts with something ironic on them are acceptable too. When it's not that cold outside, a good hoodie is a need.

, Don't go dying it every week or straighten the living daylights out of it. If it's straight, keep it straight, if it's curly, keep it curly. Makeup should also be pretty natural.

, Homemade, naturalistic. Rings are a must.

, Make clothes at home. Alter stuff you already have.

, Well, because its good for you.

, Books make our brains work harder than computers...pick up a book!!

, Blog. Blog. Get a blogspot, tumblr or whatever. Write!

,, But choose friends wisely.

Get the ""Indie"" hairstyle.,
Do the make-up.,
Get a couple pairs of skinny jeans.,
Buy some comfortable tees.,
Cardigans and sweater vests are essential for any indie girl wardrobe.,
Get some cool shoes.,
Get some cute Indie accessories.,
Be quirky and unique.,
Have fun and remember to live life to the fullest.

",How to Dress Like a Hot Indie," There really isn't a specific hairstyle you need to do. Just do a hairstyle that is relaxed and cool. Possibly even backcomb a little bit, but don't go mad with it. There's a fine line between indie and scene! You can find a specific actress, singer, or model who you like, and take a picture to your hairdresser. If you don't get it right the first time, just scrunch it before you go to bed and get that just-woke-up look!;
, Neutral eyeshadow is always best; colours such as tan, brown, grey, black, peachy pink, and white are rad. Apply a light tinted moisturizer pink blush, and finish with (maybe) black mascara and black liner. Don't over apply, remember that less is more. Makeup is to highlight your natural features, not to take away from them.

, Try them in black, grey and dark wash blue. Occasionally, you can wear colored skinny jeans. Yellow and purple are great. If you're more into the vintage feel, a light wash (but not too loose!) is great with moccasins and a vintage top.

, Patterned and solid colors are perfectly fine, as are band tees (now that you've got the indie jams, it's time to show it!) Clever sayings can also be indie. Remember to check out Goodwill (not just girls' section!) for some cool tees :)

, Black, grey, off-white/white and brown are great, but you aren't limited to those colors. Try wearing them with your favorite, solid-colored camisoles. Either wear them completely unbuttoned, up to the middle, or with the just middle button done. Regular jumpers are also great, but don't get the mainstream ones- find some funky patterns at a Goodwill or online.

, Converse (preferably High-tops), Vans slip-ons, Authentics, Eras and Sk8-His, and any types of Keds look awesome. Occasionally, wear some funky flats. Note: most of these shoes are coming into the mainstream now. Some shoes to consider are Sanuks, desert boots, Vans Chukkas, Nike Dunks (or any vintage Nike's really), or funky boots. Combat boots are great, as long as they look authentic! You can't really go wrong with shoes, just don't get the black/neon/patterned/hello kitty Converse, you'll look like a poser. But wear whatever you want because it's your style :)

, Braided head wraps, beret style floppy knitted hats, interesting jewelry such as long/short metal necklaces (have you ever thought of DIY?), leather bracelets (faux-leather for the vegans), black rubber bracelets, over sized metal rings with stones set in them, over-sized sunglasses, and large faux-leather totes easily complete any indie wardrobe. As for earrings, any vintage-y, metal hang-downs or pretty studs (pearls are great!) are perfectly acceptable. Feathers and other tribal accessories are great, and quite hip. Nicely patterned head bands look great on short/medium hair- get creative!

, Be yourself, no matter what others may think of you. Just remember to always treat others the way you want to be treated. Don't start arguments or fights and be caring to everyone, even your enemies.

",How to Dress Like a Real Indie Girl," Typically, indie girls will have lots of layers, and both long and short hair works for this look. Make sure not to backcomb or tease underneath because you DON'T want to look scene. Your hair color should be natural, or dyed a vibrant shade of a natural colour. Again, stay away from the scene look. If you're more into the grungy side of indie, you might try dying a random piece of hair snow white for a really individual look. Most girls have red or orangey red hair. Curly or straight hair is fine. Do whatever you're comfortable with.;
, Not many indie girls have piercings, but if you're a bit of a rebel, you can get away with ONE facial piercing and still look indie. Stay away from silver or black studs, as those will give you more of an emo look. Try a simple elegant gold stud. These look great with red and blonde hair and will give a great 80s rock n roll look to black haired beauties.

, Have a varied collection of simple tops, everything from vests to gypsy style tops, in all different colours! Don't get drawn to just black; you will shine if you change the colours you wear often. Also, vintage tees are good - try truffleshuffle.com for LOTS of amazing prints! Soft blouses with ruffles or small polka dots are good, as are peach or cream lace dresses. Every indie girl should have a really girly dress. Skinny jeans in all basic colours are fine (try light blue denim with rips at the knees). Big jumpers, cardigans and hoodies are essential - if needed, borrow some big sweaters from your dad, brother or boyfriend. Pair the oversized sweatshirts with a pair of shorts and lace tights and you'll look adorable.

, Loafers, or 'Moccasins', are an absolute must! Any colour or design works. Converse are kind of common these days, but if you like them, wear them. Any kind of pump is great and try find some old Nikes or Adidas trainers. Ballet slippers, brogues, simple heels, and Macbeth's are also needed.

, Steer clear of plastic rainbow jewelry - it gives more of a ""scene"" look and doesn't fit the indie girl style. Look around charity shops and find some vintage style brooches, necklaces, and bracelets. Big wooden beads are great, as are pearls. If you like boho, try putting a small dream catcher on a long chain for a unique statement piece. Swallows, crystals, keys, peace signs, and anything kitsch is good too.

, The makeup you choose all depends on your particular outfit. If you're wearing a pastel coloured dress that is floaty and soft, you might want to add a hard edge by wearing lots of black eyeliner - Taylor Momsen style. If you're wearing rugged jeans with a velvet blazer and Ramones tee, you might only want a thin line on your top lashes and some mascara. Make sure your skin is clear and radiant-looking.

, This is very important! Listen to whatever music you like; any genre is fine. Typical bands could include: French Films, Wild Beasts, The Young Friends, O. Children, The Horrors, The Drums, Crystal Castles, The Cure, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Libertines, and Frightened Rabbit. Get to all local gigs, and go to see as many signed bands as possible.

, It is VERY indie to turn your skinny jeans up at the bottom to just above your ankle, and is also pretty indie to wear your top button on your shirt done up. Wayfarers, hippy bags, and circus-inspired fashion adds to your uniqueness too. Do anything you want with your look - just make sure it works.

Be yourself.,

Rock a set of headphones.",How to Dress Indie," Being indie means you're independent—it's where the name comes from. What does independent mean? It means you do your own thing. It doesn't matter what current fashion trends are, were, or will be -- you just do whatever you feel like. So don't even worry about dressing indie -- if you're dressing like you want, that's it.


Just make sure you like it because you like it. Society's voice is so obnoxiously loud sometimes it's hard to determine if it's us making the decision or someone else telling us to make the decision.;
, Alright, so if there's one thing that actually is indie, it's avoiding brand names. An indie kid wouldn't be caught toting a Coach purse or a pair of $250 True Religion jeans. They tend to be a bit more logical than that -- if a similar, well-made, quality piece can be found at a vintage shop, where's the contest?


But again, do as you please. Just because the mainstream likes something doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Embrace a trend or two if you honestly like it -- just don't stop embracing it when it falls out of favor!

, Being indie is about appreciating what is ""good."" And ""good"" is timeless -- not temporary like trends always, always are. Because of that, indie people generally appreciate vintage items and timeless pieces (think 40s - 70s). If you find something that's old school that you like, rock it! It was good then and it's good now.


Whether it's a vintage band tee or your sister's Kelly Kapowski t-shirt, remember: Do you like it? Not very hard to forget! Who knew being indie was so effortless?

, Since you're free to be who you are, mix it up! Go a little Jackie Kennedy, go a little John Lennon, go a little Artist Formerly Known as Prince if you damn well please. If you like it, you'll feel confident. And if you feel confident, you'll rock it.


Don't worry about certain pieces fitting into a certain label. Do you like that plaid shirt but you know it screams hipster? How about that studded cuff that almost comes prepackaged with eyeliner? Cool. Go for it! When you mix 'em all, the look is quintessentially you.

, You're probably gonna read a bunch of stuff on the Internet or see a bunch of videos or talk to a bunch of your friends about what indie is. If they say ""dude, you gotta wear skinny jeans"" or ""whoa, what are you doing in those Converses?!"" shrug it off. The whole idea of indie is that there isn't a look you have to abide by. Feel free to correct them, too!

, If you're chilly, do something about it. Throw on that cardigan over a t-shirt or a vest. Wear a scarf in July. Throw on tights under your dress and socks over those.


You can clash or not clash. It's all good. If you do clash, you may end up looking a bit Hipster -- but unlike Hipsters, your look isn't screaming I-dont-give-a-damn so hard that it seems like you do.

, Again, anything goes. Wooden bangles, a dreamcatcher pendant, an old locket, one of those headband-or-is-it-a-choker necklaces from the 90s, whatever strikes your fancy that day. Hemp bracelets, doorknocker earrings, and long necklaces are cute and add a feminine touch to any outfit, but whatever interests you is great.


Vintage pins and necklaces are also cute. Look around at garage sales and thrift shops to spruce up your wardrobe.
Scarves, headbands -- they work for both sexes. So does the quintessential messenger bag (denim, leather, you name it), though if you really wanna rock the Lisa Frank backpack, more power to you.

, Really, anything is kosher. You're not very surprised by that, hopefully. But if you're looking for something specific, here's something to get you started:


Vans Authentics are a safe bet. They even come in a wide variety of colors. Mono black (canvas and rubber both black), any shade of green, navy, or off white are great choices, but those aren't your only options.
Moccasins are very important to an indie wardrobe. They add the unique and antique look to an everyday outfit. They can vary in design, color, and they go great with just about anything. Some great moccasin online sites are Minnesota moccasin, the moccasin shop, or moccasin house.
Nike Dunks have become popular recently because of the nostalgia it can bring, and the limited edition styles they come in. In addition, they look good on just about everyone. Some may want to avoid these, because Nike Dunks could be looked at as mainstream. However, Nike SB dunks or Nike iD Dunks are more individual, if you have the money for them.
Sanuks also add great touch! They come in different styles and color/patterns. Check your local boat shop or gb shoe warehouse
Girls can also go for some cute flats in whatever color, pattern or style they choose. Funky platforms and gladiator sandals are also great choices if you're tired of boppin' around in sneakers.

, There's nothing more independent and totally you than something you've made yourself. If you can sew, you can start. And if creating something sounds like a task, try tailoring a piece you already have or adding your own touches to an item growing dust in your closet. You can reinvent your wardrobe without making a single trip to the store.


And if sewing isn't your bag, try dyeing, knitting, crocheting, or any other project that can turn something boring into something brilliant.

, For girls in cold weather, pea coats in any color are great, whether they're double-breasted or not. When it's chilly, cardigans are your best friend! Striped, patterned and solids are great and look fabulous with any T-shirt or tanks.


For guys in cold weather, vintage leather or Members Only jackets are a great option. If you'd like, you can even deck them out with cool pins! In chilly weather, vests or sweater vests look awesome with anything. You can also try a track jacket; they come in lots of colors and are great year-round.
Scarves (for men and women) are great year round because you can get them in cotton, linen, silk and wool. They're a classy touch to add no matter what outfit you're wearing. Bright colors and neutrals both look great, as long as they go well with your outfit. Bandanas can also be made into a cool scarf -- singular or with two tied together. You can also wear a scarf in many different ways -- even a simple scarf can make the most basic outfit seem amazingly unique.

, Indie kids have a pretty good grasp on what's good and what's terrible for the environment. If they can reuse something, they will. Thrift shops are happening places! So donate your clothes, shop second-hand, make your own, and don't let fashion affect your carbon footprint.


Generally, you'll wanna stay away from fur and the like, too. Animals are a huge part of the environment! Take the time to know what goes into your pieces and who or what it's affecting.

, If your hair is straight, wavy, or curly, let it out in all its glory. No need to spend hours in the bathroom ""correcting"" it. What's wrong with your hair the way it is? Nothing! And it's way better for your hair not to be exposed to all that heat. So flaunt what your mamma gave you, even if it is a nappy pile of coarse straw.


That's not to say you can't do things with it. If you wanna throw it up, shave it off, rock the mullet, go for it. Just don't get too involved with dyes and thermal treatments. That's not you, you know?

, If there's going to be one generalization, it's that indie kids are up on the music scene. So get yourself a nice pair of retro or designer headphones that'll add a touch of mystery for when you're walking about. The best pair of headphones that suit the purpose that come to mind are the Grado SR60's.


Once you get your headphones, try to find killer underground bands and songs to listen to. Most indie kids don't prescribe to the top 40 and like to pave their own path when it comes to their musical tastes.

While you're at it, you might want to look up people like Florence Welch, Kurt Cobain, Brendon Urie, Christofer Drew, and Death Cab For Cutie, to get ideas for what type of apparel you should be aiming for.;
, Most indie kids nowadays wear skinny jeans. Avoid the obnoxious bright neon ones, and stick to ""classic"" light/dark blue ones, dark/light grey, and black jeans. If you're a girl, or comfortable enough in whatever gender you are, you can get simple ruffled/floral printed skirts too. If you're unsure what to look for, just google indie girls.

, Look for older or older styled clothes. Raid your parents' closets, go to your local thrift store (you can find TONS of great things there), do whatever you can to shop vintage. Buy some of the things from Urban Outfitters, American Apparel, H&M, and Forever21. Avoid most ""clubbish"" or otherwise bright and neon clothes. Stick to dulled or darker (don't look goth or emo though, think kind of like what they were in Harry Potter and Twilight) clothes. Look online also for websites.

,


Tops for guys- vintage band shirts (the Ramones, Nirvana, etc), plaid button ups (open or closed), sweaters, ugly sweaters (like the old kind of vintage ones? If you're unsure, google Christofer Drew sweaters), Henleys, vests, graphic tees (don't get the ones like ""average Saturday: video games, video games, video games!"" those are annoying, instead try a site like http://www.threadless.com, and get the more artsy shirts), plain shirts like simple striped tee shirts, v-necks, (H&M sells good v-necks but you can try American Apparel for more low cut, sheer v-necks), solid color hoodies (try colors like midnight blue, black, and grey, nothing like purple, etc) cardigans, and pea coats.
Tops for girls- pretty much the same idea, except you can get a little more feminine, flannel, floral tops, etc. Like I said pretty much the same idea as guys.

, You're going to need a lot of these, avoid band scarves though, or like the cheap ones with glitter stitched into them. Instead shop for the bohemian kind of ""Russian old woman"" scarves, I know the Feugo in my mall has them, and the Value Village near my house has TONS. Also infinity scarves, muffler scarves, and simple plain colored scarves work too. Bracelets- you're going to want to pile on the bracelets, but don't go for cheap beaded ""ravver"" bracelets, you'll look like a scene whore. Instead go for the ""St.'s bracelets"", (even if you're not religious, you can always peel the stickers off), arrow-head friendship bracelets, peace sign bracelets, etc. It should come about midway up your forearm. Google ""Christofer Drew"" or ""Christofer Drew bracelets"" for more ideas on that.

, You're going to want it to grow longer, if you're a guy or a girl. For guys, don't straighten it TOO excessively, or you'll look scene. Wash and condition it daily, then add some volume product, blow dry it straight, then kind of mess it up on the top. It takes a lot of experimentation, but it kind of ends up looking like Christofer Drew's hair. You could also just go natural. It saves a lot of time if you like your natural hair, but grow it out to about shoulder length. For girls you have a bit more options. You could go natural, curl it (then comb through the curls so it's not so stiff) buy a crimper and crimp it.

, Crazy fun hats (like were wolf hats, sailor hats, cowboy hats, sombrero hats, army helmets, etc.) are a good option also. You can get a lot of those on ebay too. Indian headdress are also pretty fun if your going to a show or something. However, avoid bright neon.

, Try to listen to these types of music:



Anti-folk:

Florence + The Machine, King Missile, Peggy Sue, Supercute!, Hop Along, Plain White T's, AJJ, Nevershoutnever, Musemath.



Punk:

Panic! At The Disco, Green Day, Pierce The Veil, blink-182, Black Flag, Bad Religion, Bad Brains, NOFX, Rise Against, Nirvana, Less Than Jake, Sex Pistols, Talking Heads, Imogen Heap.



Grunge:

Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, L7, Foo Fighters, Silver Chair, Bush, Tad, Mayday Parade, Hole, Sonic Youth, Local H.



Indie:

Modest Mouse, Arctic Monkeys, Arcade Fire, Vampire Weekend, Death Cab For Cutie, Interpol, Bright Eyes, Wilco, Blur, Oasis, MGMT, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Kills, Superchic.



Folk:

Fleet Foxes, Pentangle, Beirut, Bellowhead, Faun, Old Crow Medicine Show, The Transads, Malinky.



,



Screamo:

A Day To Remember, Silverstein, Underoath, Pg. 99, Blessthefall, Saetia, Alexisonfire, Circle Takes The Square.



Indie Pop:

Coldplay, Fall Out Boy, Blondie, Paramore, Simple Plan, Echosmith, All-American Rejects, twenty øne piløts, The Verve, Fun., Snow Patrol, Neon Trees.



, Go shoeless whenever you can though. And avoid obnoxious bright, checker pattern, or ""ed Hurley"" style shoes.

Decide what type of project you would like to do: Necklaces, bracelets, headbands, lanyards, belts, etc.,
Craft stores are a very good place to find an assortment of beads.,
What would you like to string your beads on?,
When you finish each project, make sure you secure the ends so that the beads don't slip off.,
Enjoy your beautiful jewelry works.

",How to Make Love Beads," The type of wire or cord and the type of beads depend on what you would like to do. Are your projects going to be intricate and costly, or inexpensive and simple? Are you going to give these works of art away, sell them, or are they a self-project? Are your projects going to be just beads, or would you like to incorporate charms, pendants, bead holders, knots, etc.?;
, You might even be able to recycle old jewelry, or stage jewelry if you want to. Get beads that you like the most and that you feel will be easiest and most fun to work with; Also make sure you get enough for your purposes so that you don't run out of beads in the middle of a wonderful creation!

, Make sure that whatever you choose to string your beads or charms on can fit through the bead/charm holes:
-String/Twine/Thread (doubled or single line)
-Wire (thin or thick)
-Hemp
-Clear plastic line or fishing line
-Ribbons (silk, fiber, synthetic, etc.)
-Stretchy cord (good for bracelets!)
-Other materials

, You could even tie it around a bead and secure the ends that way. A tiny spot of superglue on the knot does wonders. You could also incorporate clasps, lobster-claw clasps, etc.

Note that wearing fur is considered by many to be cruel and unethical. If you like the look but don’t want to wear real fur, there are many good faux fur clothing items available.;
, Crocheted and lace dresses, tops, hats, and bags are staples of Boho Chic. Beads, fringe, and embroidery are also hugely popular, and can appear in your clothing and your accessories.

, Boho Chic clothing comes in many patterns: floral and avant-garde-style accents are popular, as are checks and ethnic-inspired prints.If you do experiment with fun patterns, be sure to pair them with relatively neutral items for a balanced outfit.

, A key ingredient in Boho Chic style is comfort — you’ll see a lot of soft, loose-fitting, flowy clothes, often worn in layers.


Maxi dresses (full-length, usually loose-fitting dresses) are a great example of the flowy comfort common to Boho Chic.
Cut-offs and a flowy white lace top paired with a long, beige knitted sweater is another example of a comfortable Boho Chic outfit.

, Not everything you wear has to be flowy — you can combine flowy shirts with fitted pants or skirts, or vice versa. Here’s an example of an outfit you could wear in colder months, when the rain and snow make flowy dresses and skirts impractical:


Pair some faded, fitted light-blue jeans with a white chambray top and a big, knitted, neutral-toned sweater.
Add interest to the outfit with a long silver-chain necklace punctuated by a pretty stone pendant — turquoise would work well.
You could also combine this outfit with a colorful, jewel-toned scarf.
For shoes, go with brown, tan, or beige ankle boots with a relatively low, chunky heel. (Think cowboy boot heels.)

, Ballet flats and ethnic-inspired sandals (i.e. Greek, Roman, or African) are the generally accepted staples of Boho Chic. For cooler weather, you can wear cowboy boots, ankle boots with thick heels, or high ‘70s-inspired boots.Leather and suede are the preferred fabrics for shoes; natural shades such as beige, tan, and brown are recommended.
If you’re vegan, it’s possible to buy convincing vegan “leather” versions of natural leather shoes.

, Bright colors are great for adding heat to your Boho Chic outfit; just make sure they’re colors you would find in nature — for example, jewel tones like ruby red or sapphire blue, or the bright green-blue of a clear mountain lake.

, With all the patterns and layers available, building a Boho Chic outfit can be daunting. Avoid the temptation to wear all of your favourite things at once. You’ll also want to avoid being too colourful: aim for mostly neutral tones plus one or two accent colors.It’s also important to consider textures. Wearing patterned pants with a lace top and a crocheted fringe vest would definitely be going overboard.
Similarly If you’re wearing a beaded top, it may be overkill to wear a bunch of beaded necklaces with it.
If you're unsure of what sort of color combinations to use, an online search for “Boho Chic color combinations” will return a lot of creative suggestions.

, If you’re curvier, look for items with more structure, as flowy items and layers can make you look bigger than you are.If you’re thin and short, you may get lost in long, flowy layers; aim for shorter tops and/or skirts, slimmer fits, and shoes with heels., Boho Chic is all about layers, and accessories are an important part of this.

, Bracelets are a must-have for the Boho Chic style. Thin silver bangles and colorful, woven Mexican bracelets are amongst the most popular types. For a creative twist, you could also wear wooden bangles.


You can wear bracelets on your ankles (i.e. anklets) too! Thin, dangly silver ones are nice.
You can also wear bracelets (also known as armbands) on your upper arms: braided and metal armbands are popular.

, Boho Chic earrings are dangly and often combine metal and natural stones. They can also include feathers and leather. As with everything that is Boho Chic, seek out natural shades and materials.

, Boho Chic necklaces range in lengths, but what they’re composed of is generally the same: natural materials and colors.


Leather, metals, stones, shells, fringe, cottons and wools are common materials. (These are also common materials for earrings and bracelets.)
Ethnic-inspired pieces are particularly popular.

, Fedoras and floppy, wide-brimmed hats are popular in Boho Chic, as are crocheted caps. Floppy, wide-brimmed hats in neutral tones are often paired with long dresses, or with flowy tops and short shorts.

, Floral headbands were hugely popular in summer 2015. Other types of head pieces that are popular include braided headbands and chain tiaras.



Tying scarves or bandanas around your hair or wearing them as headbands is also popular.

, Colorfully patterned handbags as well as handbags with fringe and tassels are popular Boho Chic choices. As with everything Boho Chic, aim for natural fabrics and shades.

, Big sunglasses in varying shapes are key elements of Boho Chic. Round glasses and aviators are quite popular, but anything big and vintage-looking will do — choose what looks best on your face!

, Select your accessories carefully, taking your entire outfit into consideration. You want to make sure that a) your accessories match the tone of your outfit, and b) they aren’t competing with each other.


You don’t need to wear five necklaces with big stone pendants on them: just choose the one that looks best with your outfit.
You probably don’t want to wear a chain tiara with jeans and a simple white top. It would be more appropriate with a summery maxi dress.

, The idea is to look natural without appearing washed out. To figure out what shades of makeup to buy, look at your face when you’re flushed:


After working out or doing something that gets your heart rate up, have a look at your face. What color are your cheeks and lips? These are the colors you want to aim for in doing your Boho Chic makeup.

, If you have perfect skin, lucky you! If you’re like the rest of us, you’ll want to put some concealer on any breakouts, and perhaps even put a foundation on your whole face.


If your skin is pretty smooth, with only some light redness, try a tinted moisturizer, BB cream or CC cream instead of a full foundation. This will help even out your skin without being too thick or cakey.
If your face is shiny, apply a light powder foundation. Do it with a brush instead of the applicator to help it spread more evenly.

, Highlighting balms and powders are wonderful for adding a bit of extra glow to your face. Apply it to the inner corners of your eyes (the skin beside your tear ducts), your upper cheekbones, and in that little V-shaped dip where your philtrum meets your lips.


If you’re feeling adventurous, you can also apply a highlighter to other parts of your face, such as your chin and forehead., Once your face looks clear, add some light blush to your cheeks. Smile and apply a light dusting of blush from the apples of your cheeks outwards, following the natural curve of your cheek.


When applying blush, think youthful radiance, not post-intense workout.
A little bit of blush along the bridge of your nose will help give you a sun-kissed look — just don’t go overboard lest you wind up looking sick, with a red nose.
If you're tanned or have darker skin, you can use a bronzer instead of blush.

, Boho Chic makeup ranges from neutral to smokey eyes. For a more traditional Boho Chic, look, wear shades that play up your eyes without making it obvious that you’re wearing makeup.


Earthy browns, reds, and golds are popular paired with a non-clumping black mascara on curled lashes.
If you do go for a more dramatic look on your eyes, stick with a neutral lip, otherwise you’ll risk looking overly made up.

, If you wear nothing else on your lips, wear lip balm to keep your lips looking soft and juicy.


If you want to wear lipstick, choose something that looks natural on you.
Glosses, stains, and moisturizing lipsticks in pink, peach, and wine and berry shades are popular.
Avoid vibrant matte lipsticks and sparkly glosses — these will look unnatural on your lips.

, Boho Chic hair is most popularly shown as being long and wavy, and in natural browns, reds, and blondes.


If you don’t have long hair, don’t worry, just aim for a hairstyle that looks classic — ideally not spikey, razored, or shaved.
Loose braids and loose waves are amongst the most popular styles worn.
If you insist upon flat ironing your hair, give it a bit of curve at the bottom so that it doesn’t look unnaturally straight.

Use belts, scarves, and hats to complete your look.",How to Have Bohemian Style," You are trying to create a sort of relaxed gypsy look. This means that you will want to layer clothes over each other to get a truly bohemian look. As the look has been inspired by travelling gypsies and hippies who travelled with everything they owned, this means that they layered clothing over other pieces to keep warm and to avoid having to carry extra clothing.You can, for example, wear a tight fitting bralette under a flowing shirt, you can layer a jacket over a loose-fitting tunic, or even layer all three together.
This has the added advantage that if you get warm or cold you always have a layer you can remove or put back on whenever you need to.;
, The whole idea of bohemian style is free and flowing. Long maxi skirts or peasant skirts are good ideas, as well as tunics and light tops. Anything that makes you feel light and comfortable is a good choice.


You can also look for flowing dresses that you can then layer other pieces over or under to get an effortless look.
Try to keep the layering towards the top of your body. You want the look the draw attention to your face, and if you do a lot of layering on the bottom (e.g. wearing pants under skirts) you will draw attention downwards which creates a “heavy” look.

, Though you can certainly wear everything loosely fitted, if you want to, you can also throw in a few fitted pieces. For example, if you are wearing a very flowy tunic, you might then put on a pair of tight leggings, which will give you a bit of shape while also emphasizing the flowy shirt., A true bohemian is unlikely to purchase brand new clothing as the style focuses on vintage clothing in addition to caring for the environment. Head to your nearest flea market or thrift shop where you can probably find good deals on clothing, and you may even be able to find original pieces from the 1960s and 1970s, which will really boost your bohemian wardrobe.If you know how to sew, you could even make your own clothing using whatever fabrics and patterns you like.
If you do buy new clothing rather than going to your closest trendy clothing shop (think H&M) opt for independently owned small businesses where you can find out how and where the clothing was made. The clothing will certainly cost more, but it will also probably be of much better quality and will last you a lot longer.

, With such a focus on being in harmony with nature, you should look for clothing that is made of natural fibers such as he,p, cheese cloth, hemp, and cotton. You could also include a few pieces that are made of chiffon, lace, or silk.Avoid fabrics such as polyester, which are made synthetically.
Look for fabrics that have are fair trade and ethically sourced. If you aren’t sure and the shop owner can’t tell you, you can also search the internet for brands that have pledged to make their clothing out of fair trade fabrics.

, If your hair is naturally wavy, then you can just wash your hair and let it dry naturally. You can tame any frizziness by applying a small amount of mousse to your hair while it is still a bit wet. If you don’t have naturally wavy hair, you can still get natural waves by applying a bit of mousse and/or texturizing spray to your hair before using a blow-dryer with a diffuser attachment.waves


When drying your hair with the diffuser attachment, flip your head upside down and dry on the cool setting. Use your fingers to scrunch your hair while drying to encourage waves to form.
If you have very, very straight hair that refuses to curl then don’t worry! Long, super straight hair is also a good bohemian look!

, Another hairstyle that brings to mind the bohemian style are braids. If your hair is long enough you can braid your hair into a crown around your head for a more complex look or you can simply braid your hair into a straight braid.


Remember that the key is to have a messy, effortful look so don’t worry if your braid isn’t perfect. In fact, if your braid is perfect, you should pull it out just a tiny bit to give it a less polished look.If you can’t braid but still want to style your hair in some sort of up do you can apply a bit of mousse or texturizing spray before bulling your hair up into a messy bun.

, The essence of boho is a very natural and fresh look. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to wear any makeup at all as this is certainly the most natural look. However, if you do want to wear makeup, understand that the big bold makeup looks are out of the question.


If you choose not to wear any makeup, do put on some moisturizer with an SPF before going outside. This will keep your skin looking fresh while also protecting it from the harmful UV rays of the sun.

, If you have any blemishes you want to cover up using foundation, opt for a foundation that provides light coverage and advertises an illuminating finish. This finish will give you that dewy skin that everyone wants.Apply your foundation lightly and evenly all over your face. You just want to apply a thin layer in order to cover up any blemishes, but you don’t want a makeup look that looks heavy.

, The bohemian style emphasizes being one with nature. Being involved in nature means spending time outside, which means having a bit of a sun-kissed glow. Applying a little bit of bronzer on your cheekbones and forehead will give you a naturally kissed by the sun look. This will make you look healthy and fresh.Use the bronzer sparingly though. You just want to add a bit of glow.

, The cat eye and the smokey eyeliner are not good options if you want to emphasize the bohemian style. Best is to go without any eye makeup, but if you want to apply a little bit of eyeliner or mascara choose neutral earth tones such as olive green and brown.


Apply just a very thin line of eyeliner in order to emphasize your eyes, don’t draw thick lines, and only apply a few light coats of mascara.

, If you want to wear something on your lips, keep it very natural. You can even just put on some lip balm with an SPF. If you want to use color, you should definitely avoid bright colors like red and pink. Instead, stick to peachy neutral tones that will add a bit of color to your lips, but will still look natural.Choosing a neutral lip shade that is right for you will depend on your skin tone and hue.

, If you like painting your nails you can do so, and you can even go a little crazy with it. While most of the bohemian style involves keeping everything simple and natural, you can spice things up a bit by painting a metallic gold or bronze on your nails. You can also stick with the natural look and choose a neutral shade.Don’t feel like you have to add polish to your nails. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to.

, If your outfit is pretty subtle, you can add a few bold pieces of jewellery, but stick to natural tones and avoid jewelry that is plastic. Instead, look for pieces that you like that are made from leather (avoid this if you are a vegan), shells, beads, and woven threads.Turquoise and wood are also great materials to use in jewelry. If you are having trouble finding bohemian jewelry, head to your local flea market or thrift store!

, Because the bohemian style places emphasis on being good to the environment, try to choose jewelry that is handmade by artisans. Don’t just go to the cheap jewelry store down the street and pick up a bunch of jewelry. Instead, go to a weekend market where artists are selling their work and look for jewelry there.


If you don’t have weekly markets in your area look to see if there is an organic shopping center in your area. These shops typically sell food and household items, but they also sometimes offer a small selection of accessories.

, If you feel like your outfit is still missing a little something, try adding a hat, scarf, or belt. You can use a pretty scarf in many different ways. You can wear it around your neck, drape it over your shoulders, or even tie it around your waist as a belt. If you have a thick, funky belt that you love, then wear it over a long flowy shirt to create a bit of shape.If you are having a bad hair day choose a floppy hat or a beanie to cover up your hair. Since one of the main ideas of bohemian style is layering, adding a few extra accessories can really complete the look.

It generally wasn’t until later in the hippies movement and the next decade that colors and patterns were brighter.Try wearing a leotard, undershirt, or other garment meant as activewear or underwear as a top.Consider going without a bra underneath your shirt, as it was very popular for female hippies to abandon this item of clothing.;

If you care to find perfectly authentic items from the decade, do some research into the brand and style to find out when it was made, or ask an expert on vintage clothing to help you authenticate it.
Check out garage sales, estate sales, and flea markets for other great options and potential hidden gems.

, Check sites like eBay and other online stores where individual sellers advertise their vintage clothing or personal pieces that they’ve held onto since the ‘60s.


There are also a number of online stores like ModCloth that bring very retro styles, including hippie style, into modern-day clothing.

, Tie dye your own shirt, headband, or any other clothing item or accessory using rubber bands or string to tie up white fabric and create patterns with different colored dyes.


Create all kinds of patterns with tie dye, like a spiral, stripes, polka dots, or rosettes.

, If you enjoy making your own clothes or want to learn how, you can pick up your own fabrics in earth tones and floral patterns and use them to follow sewing patterns for the items you want to make, like bellbottoms or mini skirts.


Some fabric stores may sell retro sewing patterns, or you can check out online shops or antique malls for those that sell truly vintage patterns straight from the ‘60s!, Add fringe, embroidery, patches, or beading to the hems, sleeves, and seams of nearly any piece of clothing to give it some extra hippie flair.


Make any pair of pants into bellbottoms by cutting open the seam along the outside of the calves and sewing in a triangular piece of fabric.You can also add fun wide sleeves to a top with a circle of fabric attached to the end of each existing sleeve.If you don’t want to buy clothes or modify your clothes, simply pair different textures, colors and patterns in your wardrobe that you would never ordinarily think to put together. Hippie style means anything goes, as long as you like it!

, Get ideas for what to buy and how to wear it by studying some of the women that made hippie fashion popular in the 1960s. Look up images of icons online or in books to get a sense of their styles.


Try out the look of tousled hair and big round glasses that Janis Joplin wore, the natural afro and maxi dresses of Marsha Hunt, or the shawls and flowing shirts of Stevie Nicks.
Finding a fashion icon can help you narrow down the specific type of hippie style you want to emulate, be it peasant folk singer, blues rocker, or psychedelic babe.

Add more to your outfit to pull the look together.",How to Be Braze1," It can be curly or straight. You should not have bangs, nor should you use headbands or barrettes.

Incorporate a scarf in your outfit.",How to Dress Boho," Bohemian is a word that relates to the style of the Roma, a group also known as the name ""gypsy"" of central Europe.Clothing or outfits that match your image of this known style of performers, fortune tellers, and free spirited vagabonds will likely do well for your boho styles outfit., Naturalness is one of the major tenets of the boho style, which was greatly influenced by the hippy mentality that environmentally friendly clothing is preferred to synthetic fibers.This ideal is reflected in the bohemian style through the use of fabrics such as:


Cotton
Cheesecloth
Linen
Silk
Hemp

, Another influence of the hippy movement on boho style is its emphasis on freedom and openness.In boho style, this is represented by light and airy fabrics, like dusters, light weave scarves, and silk shawls., In line with the environmentally friendly ideology, boho makes use of many earth tones, like deep browns, tans, and autumnal reds.Think about offsetting these dependable earthy colors with light colored neutral shades, like taupe and cream., One of the most notable features of boho style is its use of various patters in less traditional combinations, layered in a way that expresses and highlights your character. Rather than drawing attention to a particular article of clothing, as you might normally, try to mesh the patterns you choose.For example, you might make an outfit:


Floral themed
Polka dotted
Subtly pinstriped
Gingham themed

, When coordinating so many different styles and patterns, balance can be difficult. Try to keep any one part of your outfit from being too busy pattern-wise than the rest of it. In boho styles, the eye should be naturally drawn to the face as the central feature of the outfit., Many secondhand stores have a surplus of clothing from this period, and here you might find out peasant blouses and maxi skirts that you can use in your bohemian style.The heavy influence of hippy style on clothing from this time period makes it ideal for boho fashion.


You might also visit garage/yard sales and estate auctions to find these articles of clothing.
Modern versions of these creations can sometimes be found in specialty shops.

, The origins of the bohemian people, the Roma, are theorized to be on the Indian subcontinent.Over the course of the Roma people's migration to central Europe, many bold patterns and styles, like those you might see worn in parts of Africa or India, were adopted.


Pair these patterns with different patterns without giving too much weight to clash.
If outfit cohesion is important to you, you might choose a theme, like floral patterns or simple geometric designs, like polka dots and stripes.
Be sure you give contrasting colors and patterns a try. You never know when two seemingly opposing patterns will bring out the bohemian in you!

, Too many dangling ends or busy patterns at the bottom of your outfit might draw attention away from your face; the bohemian style begins at the face and then travels to the rest of the body.Make use of layers to sweep around less flattering parts of your body, as you might by flaring bottom layers to offset square shoulders.

, The base layer in boho style is often thin and relatively well fitting when compared to outer layers. Many wearers of boho style begin layering with a spaghetti top, bra top, a vest, or stretch t-shirt.These more fitted base layers will allow to add more layers on top without appearing swaddled. Over top, you might add:


A knit cardigan
A loose-fit tunic
A kaftan
A fitted vest, The simple garments often associated with central European peasantry have long been a staple in boho style.Rough spun garments can simulate this appearance, but you should also consider:


Cheesecloth skirts
Linen skirts
Maxi skirts
Leggings
Flared jeans, Plainer boho dresses and fabrics can be brought to life with spangles and faux jewels. Large, chunky, earth toned jewelry can create a richer look for even the plainest seeming boho item. Some options include:


Metal bangles
Wooden wrist cuffs
Glass bead necklace
Long dangling earrings, Or, you might make use of modern accessories that are fashioned in vintage designs. Some examples of this might include turquoise bracelets, aged lockets, and ornate pendants. Combine these accessories in layers by using various lengths, like you might when wearing a long, medium length, and short length necklaces., The artistic and frequently hand-worked design of most artisan crafts can bring an air of Bohemia to even everyday outfits. Look for items that are nature themed, or crafted with natural products, like:


Worked leather
Natural metals (like copper)
Glass beads
Stones (like quartz and onyx)

, While fur cuffed shoes might be a little outside your price range, boots adorned with faux fur can improve the natural appeal of your outfit.Leather and suede are in line with the naturalist philosophy of boho, so these are also options you should keep in mind. Other footwear to consider:


Ankle boots
Flat sandals
Gladiator sandals, You might consider including an earth tone scarf in your bohemian braid.Another popular look uses a bandanna around the crown of your head to frame hair done in a simple updo.These looks will make you fit right in with the boho crowd.

You don't always have to wear black. Just wear clothes that allows you to be comfortable and mobile.;
, Nothing says tough like massive arms. Get in the gym, hit the bench press and squats, and hit them hard. You don't need to tell everyone you have been working out.

Rock the ""just got out of bed"" look.,
Shop like a hipster.,
Acquire some basic wardrobe items.,
Buy some clothes that help society.,
Adjust your makeup.,
Try a new hairstyle.",How to Be a Teenage Hipster(Girls)1," One main aspect about a hipster's style is her ability to look like she stylishly rolled out of bed and threw on the first ensemble she found. Though you shouldn't actually try to do this, you should try to go for a look that makes it look like you didn't spend hours trying to pick the perfect outfit but that you just threw it together at the last minute -- even if that's far from true. Here are some ways to make it look like you just rolled out of bed:


Don't spend hours styling your hair or it will be too obvious that you put care into your looks.
Don't spend hours doing your makeup, either, or it'll look like you put too much effort into your looks again.
Don't spend too much time making sure your outfit is ""matchy matchy"" -- the colors can go together, but it shouldn't look too neat or perfect.
Don't wear too many articles of clothing that are obviously new.;
, If you want to shop like a hipster, the more pricy stores that you can check out are American Apparel, Urban Outfitters, and Anthropologie. But if you really want to look like a female hipster, try raiding your mother's (or your grandmother's!) old wardrobe, finding gems at garage sales, or shopping at thrift stores to get that perfect hipster look.


Many female hipsters have a more quirky sense of style, looking more tomboyish than super girly.
You can also go to stores like Walmart or Target and find plain items that don't look cool, but which are so uncool as to be cool all over again.
You can also rip, tear, or add patches to previously un-hip items to dress them up.
Do you have a pile of clothes you haven't worn in years collecting dust in the back of your closet? If so, see if you can rescue any of them and make them cool all over again in a retro way.

, Though there isn't a set hipster uniform, there are some items that you should have in your closet if you want to make the most of your teenage hipster transformation. Try these items:


Graphic tees.
Skinny jeans. They can be dark denim, light denim, or regular denim.
Button up ""mountain-man"" plaid shirts.
For shoes, try TOMS, lace-up Vans or Keds, Converse, or ballet flats.
Accessories like assorted friendship bracelets, long, chunky necklaces or shorter, ""dainty"" ones. Chunky rings are a good addition too. The most common teenage hipster accessory is a pair of black thick-framed glasses.

, If you are the kind of hipster that buys clothes to support charities, check out these clothing lines: TOMS, Sevenly, or Common Threads.

, Makeup isn't required, but if you like to wear it, stick with neutral and natural. For skin, the clearer the better! Don't cake on the foundation, and you try a little blush to make your cheeks rosy. Stick with earth tones, on the eyes and don't go overboard. Definitely stay away from glitters and flashy makeup. A nude lip is great! And if you're going to paint your nails, go with a pale pink, a navy blue, a basic black, or just a layer of clear polish.

, Cut it all off in a pixie cut or keep it really long. Try a messy updo, a loose side-braid, a ballerina bun, boho waves, completely straight. If you're confident enough, have half shaved off like Alice Dellal. Try asymmetrical cuts (one side longer). It's very important for people to question your look but secretly like it.


Bangs or a block fringe with straight hair are popular haircuts for hipster girls.

Take up martial arts, boxing, self-defense, or wrestling and become very, very good at whichever one you choose.,
Build up your pain tolerance.,
Take the dirty job.,
Research the lives of famous and historical tough guys.",How to Be a Tough Guy2," Don’t talk about it constantly or brag about it, because people will find out that you are good at these things eventually regardless. Bragging is not something that a tough guy would do, that’s something a poser would do. Eventually people will know you as a fighter and think of you as being hard and tough. Even more importantly, you will be tough. , It is true that pain is necessary to know when something in your body is wrong, but don't let it dominate your mind. This is related to not complaining. It's okay if something hurts, but learn how to deal with it. Don't do something crazy like sticking your hand on a hot stove to build pain tolerance or anything like that. Try going on long runs to feel what it's like to be in discomfort for a long period of time. Adopt a sport like wrestling. These are natural and healthy ways to build your pain tolerance.

, Whenever a list of chores is being given out, do what nobody else wants to do and do it with pleasure. Of course, you already have to have adopted the tough guy mentality for this to work. If you clearly hate the dirty job you won’t be doing yourself any favors. Make the best of it and don’t complain – that’s really what being a tough guy is about. Just take what comes to you and run with it.

, Reading about people like Theodore Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, George S. Patton and David H. Jarvis will help give you inspiration. You can also read war strategy books. The most notable ones are ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu, ""The Book of Five Rings"" by Miyamoto Musashi and ""On War"" by Carl von Clausewitz. "
"
Avoid complaining.,
Don’t be overcome by fear.,
Be unpredictable and maybe even mysterious.,
Earn the respect of other people.,
Remain calm whenever possible.,
Try to always be kind to others.,
Be loyal to those who are loyal to you.",How to Be a Tough Guy3," This is one part of being a tough can that you can start working on immediately. Even if bad things happen to you try to make the best of it and don't look for sympathy from others. This takes no special talent; you just have to develop an inner strength to deal with problems on your own. Try keeping everything in perspective. You might have a bad day and there is no denying that can be rough. However, you don’t need to tell everyone about it. Keep in mind that many people have bad days, and that this is something you can deal with on your own. Of course, if you are in deep emotional pain and need help that's a different story. But if you're just walking to a restaurant in the winter and you feel kind of cold, you can probably handle it. , It’s okay to be afraid of things, but learn how to overcome your fear. Bravery isn’t about having no fear; it’s about being afraid of something but then doing it anyways. Learn to be assertive. You can overcome your fears by facing them even when you feel uncomfortable. For example, lets say you’re really afraid to drive a motorcycle but you think it looks really fun. Maybe that is something that you could try out. Do the scary things that you would actually like to do. Tough guys enjoy adrenaline, conquer their fears and go outside their comfort zone to improve themselves.

, If you are unpredictable, people will not know what to expect from you. There’s no need to constantly talk about problems you had growing up or with your family. If you are quietly tough and silent you will earn much more respect. People will fill in the gaps. This doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to speak, just don’t complain about your problems.


Being unpredictable means you don’t only have to do the classic tough guy things. Take up martial arts or wrestling. Learn to play guitar. Don’t fit into a box and you will be a true tough guy.

, One huge part of being a tough guy is having the respect of those around you. You aren’t a tough guy just because you say you are. If other people truly believe you’re tough then you’re doing a good job. Try to learn a skill, or multiple skills, and excel at it quietly. This is a great way to earn peoples respects. Bragging and showing off your ego will do the opposite. You can earn the respect of others by treating them well, being fair, listening to others opinions, and trying to follow your moral compass.


Do not help someone if they don’t show you the proper level of respect. You don’t need to grovel in order to get people to like you. In fact, you should avoid that at all costs. If someone does not respect you, earn it quietly or don’t worry about it at all. If they get in your face about not respecting you, you are allowed to stand up for yourself. Don’t let anyone walk all over you. , Many people act tough but when they are faced with an emergency they respond by getting panicked, or losing their cool, or blaming other people. Instead of worrying or getting scared take necessary measures to prevent, correct, and minimize the problem. This is a huge part of being a tough guy and it doesn’t involve having big muscles or being able to punch really hard. You just have to be calm and collected. Take control of these types of situations. For example, if a friend gets hurt on a hike be the one who responds quickly and administers first aid. , This is especially true for your friends and those you know are in a weaker or more uncomfortable position than you. You don’t have to go out of your way to pamper people but if you can help a person out, you should! Try to do it in a way that doesn’t draw attention to yourself or makes you the center of attention. People will respect you and see you as tough if you silently take care of your business in a kindhearted way. Think about what it means to be the white knight. Defending victims of bullying, stepping in and speaking up on behalf of the mistreated – these are the real ways to be tough. If you pick on people who are weaker than you you’re not showing that you’re a tough guy, you’re just being a jerk.
Don't try to be overly helpful, know the difference when someone needs your help and when they can figure it out on their own. If someone is getting attacked you should help him, but if someone is searching for a comb you don't have to run to the store to find them one.

, Never betray your friends or your girlfriend or your family. Exhibiting loyalty is a huge part of being a tough guy, and it will also make you a good person. Being loyal means being there for your loved ones through the thick and thin. If a family member is sick and needs your help, they should know they can count on you even if it is an inconvenience.

Never call yourself a hipster.,
Avoid the mainstream like the plague.,
Don't act like you care.,
Go heavy on the sarcasm.",How to Be a Teenage Hipster(Girls)2," Hipsters come in all shapes and forms and they all want to be unique and cool. Never ever call yourself a hipster, you’ll look and sound like a poser. If anyone asks if you are, say no. Or walk away and act like you don't know what they're talking about or you can act awkward and change the subject.


You can even roll your eyes or get angry if someone calls you a hipster.

, If you really want to be a hipster, then you have to reject mainstream culture and work on finding your own, more independent interests. That means playing bocce with your friends in the park instead of watching the Super Bowl, learning how to make your own tahini instead of going to Burger King, and never listening to any mainstream radio stations.


Even if you secretly love Beyonce, Lady Gaga, or Britney Spears (gasp!), you can't talk about them in public.
Most hipsters adopt an eco-friendly and healthy eating lifestyle, so no more going to The Olive Garden, McDonald's, or Pizza Hut -- no matter how badly you crave it.

, Even if you're really upset because your friend has hurt your feelings, or you're really excited because you found out that the cute guy in your math class with the thick-framed glasses has a big crush on you, you have to learn how to control your emotions -- a slight frown or a slight smile should be the most that you can muster. You don't have to be unfriendly, but you should avoid waving wildly, giving loud hugs, or openly falling into a crying jag in public.


To a hipster, everything is ""pretty cool"" or ""just okay"" -- your emotional spectrum shouldn't be too wide.
Rolling your eyes, looking at the floor, or languidly checking your phone is a great way to look like you don't care.
And try not to crack up, no matter how funny something is -- go for a quick laugh, a chuckle, or even just say ""that's funny"" without cracking a smile.

, If you want to be a true hipster, then you have to learn not to take things at face value and to use a winning and wry sarcasm to express even the most basic thoughts. If it's pouring rain, you can say, ""I think I'll go for a jog"" in a flat tone that may make people laugh or at least snicker. Be sarcastic to your girlfriend as well as to any guys who come your way, even if they try to ask you out.


If you manage your sarcasm the right way, people will be charmed and amused by you. Just don't overdo it, or people will feel like you don't take anything seriously.

If you like art, check out the work of Georgia O'Keefe, Alice Neel, Pablo Picasso, and Andy Warhol.

, Listening to indie, underground, and even classic music is a big part of being a hipster. To be a hipster, you can't listen only to what's popular, but have to be able to recognize cool music with the potential to make it big -- at which point you'll have to ditch it completely. You can't just listen to the music on your LP player or iPod -- to be a true teenage hipster, you'll have to make an effort to go to concerts, whether the venue is the basement of a tiny cafe or a larger (though not too large) arena. Here are some bands to check out if you want to get into the female teenage hipster groove:

Listen to some music from other countries especially from Japan, China, Korea, Australia, France, Italy, Finland, Russia, Germany, Poland, Sweden, and Great Britain.;
, Listen to your music whenever you're not at a show. Myspace is a good way to find music that is made by amateur artists just like you and pros alike. You can also listen to entire albums with buying the album or song only an option, not mandatory. If your parents don't approve of Myspace or you just don't like the site, check out sites such as SoundClick, purevolume, tightbeatz (hip-hop and R&B) and such. Napster is more of a stereo kid music program than iTunes. Listen to only unsigned and indie on Myspace.

, Value your physical appearance. Don't be ashamed of who you are and what you look like.

, Post lots of pictures of yourself, your friends, and shows you went to. Go on Facebook too just to keep in touch with other stereotypes and fan pages of your favorite bands but do not make that you dominate social networking site.

, Try buying a video camera and try making videos of you or your friends doing fun stuff together. A webcam is a must.

,






wear scene, punk, or gangsta clothes.






Buy over sized aviator sunglasses in assorted colors such as black, red, white, etc.






Wear Converse Chuck Taylors/slip-ons, classic Vans, Duffs, Air Force Ones, and Bathing ape shoes.






Rock layered hair.






Don't wear a band tee if you've never heard of the band before.






Wear oversized hoodies (full zip too).






Band Ts are your best friends. When in doubt just wear a band tee and a pair of jeans.






Wear tight, straight leg or baggy jeans.






If you don't own contacts, wear thick framed glasses in either black, white or red.






Wear lots of bandannas and beanies.






Invest in wristbands with spikes or pyramids on them.






Never use backpacks - use messenger bags instead.







, Unless you're taking a test which requires pencils only, you should always write in pen. Randomly strikeout or underline your writing.

,, Say words like ""hella"", ""dude"", ""rad"", ""tight"", ""lame"", ""poser"", etc. Remember to use them often and incorporate them into as many conversations as you can.

, Read their biographies and know all the members and their songs.

, No track, tennis, basketball, golf, etc. If this isn't for you, than Moshing or mountain biking can always be your favorite.

, Add lots of bumper stickers.

, Keep your GPA at 3.0 or higher. Stereo kids do cross over with the nerd stereotype.

,, Get an idea of what type of Stereo boy you want to be:


Grungy Stereo: Conor Oberst, Travis McCoy, Aaron (from The Almost)
Punky Stereo: Travis Barker,
Emo Stereo: Pete Wentz, Daniel Issac,
Ghetto Stereo - Pharrell Williams

Get band tees of your favorite rock groups, old and new.,
Wear slim pants or tight pants.,
Jackets add a great touch to your look.,
Choose a hairstyle.,
Get some shoes.,
Accessories are essential for the rocker look.,
Hats can be a nice touch.,
Wear cool tees.,
Make sure that you actually love music.,
*Be your own self.,
Know who about who's in a band.,
Be nice to everyone.,
Learn.,
Be yourself.,
Enjoy a wide range of rock music.",How to Be a Rocker," Also, get some shirts of slogan or ads or just plain tees and maybe some tees of concert venues. Plus, you can never go wrong with a good old Jack Daniels T-shirt. Anything with skulls isn't necessarily rocker. Striped thermals are also very rocker. Black/Gray and Black/White stripes are best though.;
, It doesn’t matter. It's your preference. Bondage also works. If you're going with baggy, camouflage is a good choice along with black jeans. With tight, leather, black, or blue jeans will work well. Make sure you have some holes in those jeans!

, Black leather jackets are always perfect. No need to spend any big money though, you can get a much cheaper leather jacket at your local motorcycle supply shop that is of the same quality and will probably last longer. A solid color hoodie (black, gray, etc.) would be another good choice, along with striped hoodies (black/gray or black/white). Denim jackets are good too.

, Long hair (the longer the better), short hair, medium, and buzzed are all fine.

, Converse, Vans, combat boots, boots, or even white trainers, it really doesn't matter. Avoid Jockey or New Balance shoes, however.

, Spiked and studded wristbands are a must. Rings are also good, with silver rings or with skulls or tribal patterns, it's good to wear them in excess on your hands. But with gold, be careful! You don't want to be mistaken for Flava-Flav do you? If you decide to wear sunglasses, don't spend too much, you may end up losing them anyway. Good choices include Aviator and Wayfarer design.

, Bandannas, top hats, fedoras, skull caps, or even the simple baseball caps are all acceptable, (just look at Tom Morello, for example).

, Wear ones that express ""you"".

, Like, bands like Bon Jovi or Nickelback, and others. Never deny that you love this kind of music. There is no way that you should care if people don't like you for it!

, You are not anyone else; don't act like it. Rock music isn't about fitting in–– it's about breaking the mold, doing something nobody else has ever thought of. Not just acting stupid, doing something significant. But remember, as Kurt Cobain (the lead singer of Nirvana) said, it's better to be dead than ""cool"".


Don't copy other rockers. ""Oh, James Hetfield has slicked back hair, I'm doing that, David Draiman has snake fangs, I'm getting some, etc."" Do your own thing, set your own trends. And, you have to know your music. If you wanna be a rocker, you have to know what you're talking about. Search your favorite band on Wikipedia, learn their history, then people will realize you know what you're talking about. Simply, you wanna be a rocker? Be a rocker.
To be a ""rocker"" isn't a goal. It's not a scene or a trend. At least, not a real ""rocker"". All that really means is to be a rock star, or an aspiring musician whose music is generally under any genre of rock (Whether it be Classic, New Age, Hard, Alternative, etc. etc.).

, For example: Ozzy Osbourne in Black Sabbath, Slash in Guns N' Roses, Keith Richards in The Rolling Stones, etc. You'll look poser if you can't back up your favorite band.

, You'd be surprised how much cooler people will think you are if you're nice to them. People will just think you're a loser if you're always acting like a jerk.

, Consider taking a few voice lessons or buying a guitar, bass, keyboard or a drum set and take lessons. Try to find a few friends who play an instrument, (typical rock n' roll instruments are drums, electric guitar, electric bass, vocals, and keyboards), and try to form a band, write some music and practice!

, All the rockers aren't acting like someone they're not.

, Listen to: The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Pink Floyd, Van Halen, Aerosmith, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Whitesnake, Black Sabbath, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Nirvana, ZZ Top, The Doobie Brothers, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Grateful Dead, The Eagles, and many others.

Have tattoos.,
If you can, adopt the XXX straight-edge policy.,
Pump iron.,
Most important, spread the word of local gigs and watch out for each other in the mosh-pit.",How to Be an Aussie Hardcore,";
, etc. Do not confuse these bands with true Hardcore/Gabber, such as Angerfist, Neophyte and Art of Fighters. These bands are significantly better than the type of hardcore you will be listening to, and if you mix styles and start listening to gabber by mistake, you will be far too hardcore to be hardcore.

, Is it also acceptable to wear tight black jeans or low distressed jeans, with a studded-black belt. For the shoes, either skate shoes by DC or Emerica, or low top basketball shoes, and an ill fitting ' band t-shirt. Optional is a band hoodie, and an army (box) cap, with writing or a sticker still on the Brim (Volcom, Atticus and Stussy have a great range).

, For example ""mosh for glory, fight dance to hurt people"". But don't fake it, if you're not feeling it, or you will get flamed on the boards.

,,, Use ""hXc"" as often as possible.

, The more the better.

, Not only is it real HxC, but very respectable in modern society.

, Use the gym, a lot.

, Being HxC doesn't mean being a total jerk. Respect is the number one rule in Australia Hardcore

Cover your head.",How to Be a Skinhead," Skinhead politics come in several forms, from neo-Nazism to political apathy. Many skinhead groups are focused on music or worker's rights and have nothing at all to do with racism. Before you decide to become a skinhead, you have to understand the different political sects of this group of people:


Anti-racist (SkinHeads Against Racial Prejudice, or SHARPs) are aggressively opposed to neo-Nazism and racism, though they don't always take a stance on other political issues. The label SHARP is sometimes used to describe all anti-racist skinheads, even if they aren't members of a SHARP organization.
Apolitical, centrist or anti-political skinheads keep their political views out of the skinhead subculture. They often have a sense of working-class pride, but not so much in a political sense. Most traditional skinheads, or ""trojans,"" fit this category.
Left-wing skinheads are anti-racist and anti-fascist, taking a militant pro-working-class and socialist stance. The most well-known organization in this category is Red and Anarchist Skinheads (RASH).
Right-wing skinheads are conservative and patriotic, but not necessarily extreme or fascist. This type of skinhead seems to be common in the United States.
White Power or neo-Nazi skinheads are racist, extremely nationalist and highly political. Despite the common moniker, many neo-Nazi skinheads have no connection to the original skinhead culture in terms of style or interests. SHARPs and traditional skinheads often refer to them as boneheads or hammerskins (which is a specific organization as well as a general term). Racist skinheads are found largely in prisons, as part of the Aryan Brotherhood or other white supremacy gangs.;
, Before you go and call yourself a skinhead, it's important to have an understanding of the different styles of skinheads, which relate to the working class, music, and culture, not just politics. Once you choose your skinhead style and political affiliation, you can begin to get the look of the sect you desire. You can read more information about the skinhead look in the second section. Here are the main types of skinheads, based on their style and interests:



Traditional skinheads. These skinheads, also known as trads or Trojan skinheads, do not believe politics or racial bias to be central to their subculture, and focus their beliefs on music and culture instead. They affiliate themselves with the original skinhead movement, which was focused on pro-worker's rights as well as the skinhead beliefs about music in the 1960s. They also are known to wear a silk handkerchief in the breast pocket of their overcoats or suit jackets, pocket flashes, patches that state their beliefs, or button badges.

Oi! skins and punk-skinheads. These skinheads are into Oi! and punk music. They are known for having more tattoos, shorter hair, high boots, tight clothes, and flight jackets. The original Oi! bands were strongly based on pro-worker beliefs, though today, the political beliefs of Oi! skinheads takes on a broader spectrum.

Hardcore skins. This skinhead group originates in the United States. They are part of the hardcore punk music scene that includes bands such as Sheer Terror, Murphy's Law, and Warzone. Their look is more casual, with baggier pants, windbreakers, and hoodies.

, You can ally yourself with some political aspect of being a skinhead, or you can abstain entirely. Whatever you choose, pick the best match for your beliefs and convictions. Find a group of skinheads in your community, and make sure that your beliefs line up with theirs. Do not get influenced to believe anything that does not feel authentic or meaningful to you.


Once you know which type of skinhead you want to be, you have to do your research. If your type of skinhead centers around a belief in music, whether it's ska, reggae, or hardcore punk, then you have to go to concerts, listen to albums, and do everything you can to be knowledgeable on the subject so you don't look like a poser.
Skinheads have been known to reject hard drugs, so if this lines up with the affiliation you've chosen, you should abstain as well.
Skinheads are known to make a good, honest living without pretense. See if you can measure up.

, When people see you dressed as a skinhead, some of them will automatically assume that you're a neo-Nazi or white supremacist. Whether or not this is the case, be prepared to talk calmly and rationally with them about your beliefs when they ask. When people see that you are a skinhead, they may make many assumptions about you that are far from the truth.


Be ready to deal with the repercussions of your looks, and have a solid plan for explaining who you are why you believe the things you believe. If you are a skinhead who is not racist, it may take some effort to convince people, who have certain misconceptions against skinheads, that your movement is not racist in nature.

, Traditionally, dating back to the 1960s, skinheads have been identified by their short or closely-shaved hair. However, not all skinheads do this. Crew cuts and pompadours are common among certain groups. If you do cut your hair, using a 2 or 3 grade clipper-guard is typical. Today, many skinheads clip their hair without guards, and some of them even cut it with a razor. Additionally, most male skinheads do not have mustaches, beards, or any other distinguishing facial hair.


Some skinheads have also been known to have sideburns that are neatly trimmed.
Female skinheads had shorter cuts in the 1960s and then, during the 1980s, began to sport feather cuts, which are shorter around the head, with more fringe around the front, back, and sides of the head, leading to a more feathery look. Some female skinheads even wear their heads almost completely shaved, with just fringe and bangs left in the front.
Some believe that originally, when skinheads shaved their heads in the 1960s, it was to rebel against the hippie culture, in which long hair was prevalent at the time.

, Straight-leg, dark wash jeans with cuffs rolled up (to show boots) are common among several groups of male skinheads. Lee or Wrangler jeans have been popular among this group. Flat-fronted slacks and bleachers (jeans splattered with bleach to resemble camouflage), as well as BDU combat trousers or cut-off shorts, are favored among punk and Oi! skinheads. Skinhead girls often wear the same pants as boys, with the addition of camouflage or plaid miniskirts, regular skirts, and fishnet stockings.

, Working-class longshoremen in the United Kingdom were among the first skinheads, and as such warm knit sweaters became a skinhead fashion staple. Long-sleeved, V-neck sweaters or vests are usually worn over button-down shirts or a contrasting T-shirt. Button-front cardigans are favored by women skinheads. When the skinhead movement originated, many skinheads, who did not have the means for many expensive clothes, would spend their money on nice jackets and elegant wear and would go out to dance halls.

, Some skinhead groups favor wearing suspenders or braces over shirts. These can come in various colors or patterns, and are usually in 1/2- to 1-inch widths. If your braces are wider, that may make you look like a White Power skinhead, or like you just don't know what you're doing.

, Flight jackets, in black or green, are popular skinhead outerwear. A sheepskin coat, or dark or plaid overcoat, is also appropriate. Donkey jackets, with or without PVC shoulders, harken back to British dockworkers and are also favored in skinhead fashion. Additionally, dark pullover or zip-up hoodies are commonly worn by several different groups.

, Again, because the first skinheads were dockworkers, army surplus or generic work boots remain common staples of skinhead fashion. Dr. Martens (aka Docs, Doc Martens or DMs) boots and shoes are iconic choices for both men and women. Several skinheads also wear Adidas Sambas. Loafers, monkey boots and vintage bowling shoes are also popular. For the most part, men and women skinheads wear the same types of shoes.

, Boots and other shoes are generally straight-laced, which looser laces on Sambas. Generally speaking, black is the safest choice of lace color, as white laces on black boots are most often associated with hammerskins (white power skinheads). The color codes vary by region and aren't always relevant anymore, but the general assumption is still to equate white laces with white power.

, Black and white socks are basic choices, while some groups prefer red socks. Argyles and black-and-white checkerboard socks are also popular in some circles. Overall, though, socks should match the laces on the shoes and the outfit as a whole.

, In order to cover shaven heads from the cold, some skinheads wear traditionally warm hats. Trilby hats, pork pie hats and flat caps (aka scally cap, benny or driver cap) are traditional choices. Less common but still visible are bowler hats (aka derby hats), mostly among those skinheads influenced by the film A Clockwork Orange.

, Get lots of choppy layers, and dye it different colors. THINK SCENE HAIR! Coon stripes and leopard prints always work. Stereo hair is the same as scene, but its better because its stereo. Tease it, dye it, fry it, straighten it, put a Nike headband around it, put bows in it, brush it to the side, part it weird, have fun with it.

, Have a clean layout, with lots of bright colors in the background, stereos all over the place, writing, gore, brass knuckles, and stuff like that. Put pictures up of you sitting on a stereo and write STEREOKID fresher for the caption. The best thing about being stereo, is it's OK to say you're stereo.

This includes hardcore dancing, skanking, rave jumping, and every other kind of dance.

, All.the.time. If you're not old enough, then party. A lot. Always have the raddest parties that everyone wants to go to, and always be at the parties everyone goes to. Also, if you're underage, you could try to look for a cool coffee-house-hangout-with-live-music sorta thing near where you live.

, This will also help you make more friends and have the true stereo personality.

, Sure, sometimes we all get a little blue and don't feel like ourselves, but if you are depressed and negative all the time, you are going to make all of us stereo kids look emo and yourself look like a poser. I also understand that sometimes we all go a little blank, but don't be the most boring person on this planet or all stereo kids will be stereotyped this way. If you are feeling down, excuse yourself from the people you're around and go to calm down in private, and return to your friends as your normal cheery self. Don't make a bad impression on a budding trend!

, They'll ruin it.

, Like indoors, at night, in pictures, when you wake up, when you go swimming, when you go out with friends. Most stereo kids are known for wearing Dolce and Gabbana glasses and aviators non-stop.

",How to Be a Nammer," It will stick with you. As a nammer, you'll be regarded as a downtown person and seen as people who party too much, get wasted, and provocative. Remember, not all nammers are like this, but you have to realize the negative connotation of being a gangster.;
, Facebook is the most popular social networking site in Vancouver, so it's bet that you use it. You can keep up to date with all your friends and connections. Be sure to have a lot of photo albums with your friends and club nights.

, (for girls).


Nammer girls have a wide variety of shoes. Always have a pair of Ed Hardy converse, and wear lots of flats, and high heels for special occasions. Uggs are also popular.
Wear skinny jeans that fit your size and figure. Sweatpants with your school logo are usually worn during lazy days. Most popular brand for pants are True Religion, Ed Hardy, Rock and Republic, Guess, and Armani Exchange.

For regular shirts, shop at Bebe, TNA, and Aritzia.
Be sure to have large sunglasses for when you go out in the sun.
Be sure to dye your hair. Some nammers decide to keep their hair black, but many decide to dye it a lighter brown or blond. Platinum blond highlights all of your head are a nammer staple. Be sure to keep your hair long, but very layered and tease it.
Wear a lot of makeup. You always have to look perfect, so always have foundation on everyday and nude lips.

,, As a nammer you should have a lot of confidence and a circle of friends to back you up. Always take care of your turf and don't let any outsiders in, and if they try to start shit, get your nammer boy friends to smash them up. Be sure to walk like one too. Walking around with that ""don't mess with me I have back up"" aura is effective.

,, Nammers go out a lot and are often seen doing the 'nammer squat.' You can find them cruising around, visiting friends, partying, and usually, clubbing. Many of them get fake IDs to go into 19+ clubs, but nammers always go to all age or high-school only ones as well.

, Nammers do this all the time.

Wear whatever clothes you feel the most comfortable in.,
If you'd like to wear makeup, great!,
Don't be worried about how to dance.,
Some people like to use glow sticks or battery-powered lights as part of their outfits and/or accessories.",How to Be a Raver," This is an open-minded community that values individuality, so express yourself through your appearance! Try funky graphics, patterns and colours, and keep in mind that many events will have black lights to make neons glow. Also try playing with different textures of fabrics, such as faux fur or silk. Keep in mind, though, that you may get hot and sweat from all of the dancing you'll be doing. Don't feel pressured to dress in a specific way (unless there's an official dress code of course). Most importantly, wear whatever makes you happy.;
, If you would prefer not to wear makeup, that's also great! Some people choose not to wear any makeup due to sweat from dancing. Remember, everyone, not only women, can express themselves via makeup in any way they choose. Some people go for colour, and some people draw designs on their skin with makeup or temporary tattoos. Get creative!

, If you think you don't know how to dance, you're only lying to yourself. Try to let the music take over your body and don't overthink it. You can find tutorials on certain dance moves and styles online, or you can scan the crowd at the event for inspiration.If you don't want to dance you don't have to; there's always a place to just chill and take a break, but a huge part of the rave culture is letting go of inhibitions and moving to the music.

, When you're starting out with shows, just hold them in your hands while you dance at first, and let your hands move naturally. Once you start feeling comfortable, play with them a bit. Try attaching them to your clothes or your body to accentuate the way you move, or getting EL wire and making your own light-up rave gear. Have fun with it! Also, try to practice in front of a mirror in a room. Watch the way the light flows, and use the reflection as a guide to improve your dancing and invent new moves.

Listen to metal music.,
Get a haircut that suits you.,
Get some clothes, leather pants and jackets, ripped shirts (but not too crappy) and band shirts!,
Make some metal friends.,
Always be yourself.,
Try making your own music.,
Try starting a band.",How to Be a Metal Chick," Some bands are: Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Dio and Dokken. Black Metal would be Gorgoroth, Marduk, Satyricon, Mayhem, etc. Melodic, Folk, or Power Metal bands you might like would be Eluveitie, Finntroll, Ensiferum, Helloween, Iced Earth, Hammerfall, Amon Amarth or God Dethroned. Recommendations for heavy or brutal bands are Death, Nile, Suffocation, Morbid Angel, Devourment or Skinless. Go to their concerts! Don't waste your money on the ones you don't like though because you will seem like a poser.;
, Most metalheads' hair is red, blonde or black. You can tease it as long as you don't look like the 'scene kid', but a mullet type hairstyle, which is a quite old style from the 80s, is good. Most metal chicks have long hair! So grow out your hair or have corn rows.

, Your shoes can be heeled boots, platform heels, and flats (depends on the style of your flats).

, Look for people wearing t-shirts of bands you like, or hang out in areas where people listen to metal. Start hanging out with the people you might have thought were weird when you were younger that listened to the hard rock music like Bon Jovi or Motley Crue.

, Find your own personal metal style. You should know your stuff, and which music you like in metal depends on you. Don't feel the need to listen to certain bands or dress a certain way in order to be cool; focus on what you personally like.


Be cautious about people who dismiss you as ""fake."" It's okay to be new to metal, and to still be exploring what you enjoy. It's also okay to like different things from what most metalheads like.

, Get an instrument like a guitar or drum or use your voice. If you are a better singer than an instrument player, do that. Guitars can vary like bass, and electric, you could get a cool design if you have the money for a wicked awesome one. And for drums, just make sure it isn't a kid drum set.


Only some metalheads are musicians; it's okay if you appreciate music without making your own.

, Get your friends who know how to play instruments or sing. Guitar, drum, and piano are the staples of metal bands. Listen to metal for inspiration, and come up with unique sounds and lyrics.

Surround yourself with guidettes and guidos, and date a guido if at all possible!

",How to Be a Guidette," You can't be a real Guidette without confidence.;
, Take some genuine effort for that. Glamorous could be anything though. Wear as much makeup as you can, make sure to always use a light lip color. Also, straighten the hell out of your hair. Dying it wouldn't be a bad idea either. Be sure to buy plenty of hair gel and/or hair spray. Learn to crimp your hair, but also wear it super straight sometimes. Wearing big hoop ear rings is also a plus.

, You want to look as fierce as possible. Make sure your boobs pop out of your tight shirt, and don't hesitate to stuff your bra or wear more than one bra at once.Wear tons of animal print to show off your wild side.

, Going clubbing and dancing is an unmistakable part of Guido culture. Be sure to get out of the house and on to the streets of New York/New Jersey and hit up those clubs. Your fellow Guidos await you! And always look good when you go out, alright? Alright!

, Shop at Ed Hardy, Juicy Couture, Armani Exchange, Bebe, Puma, etc. Buy bags from Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Prada, etc. Wear Designer Shades with Designer Hats, a big must!

, ""Hon"", ""GTL"", ""Bro"", ""Babe"", ""Kid"", ""Grenade,"" and the unforgettable ""FIST PUMP""

, Go to the gym, work out a few times a week, and be sure that your stomach stays FLAT, but still enjoy some good Italian cooking.

, Look as unnaturally tan as possible; even when it's cold out! Tan at least 3 times every week, more or less. Buy a home bronzer if you can't go that much.

, Okay, this is REALLY important. YOUR. HAIR. NEEDS. TO. BE. B I G. And when I say big, I mean big. The guidette hair should be dyed either bleach blonde or black. You could highlight it, but don't let the blonde or black highlights blend into your regular hair color. Either crimp or pin straight is acceptable.

, Preferably fake. Get a french manicure, can't go wrong there.

Dress for the time period.,
Do retro makeup and hair.,
Accessorize for decadence.",How to Be a Gangster Girl1," Most monster costumes are based around the fashions popular in the 1920s to 30s. The popular silhouette for women's clothing at the time was loose throughout, with a dropped or undefined waist. Flapper dresses with lots of fringe were also popular. Neutral colors were in fashion, as well as bright accent colors such as red, coral, jade green, yellow and deep blue. See what you can dig up at your local costume shop or consignment store.;
, A makeup entered the mainstream in the 1920s, women began to wear dark red lips and smoky black eyes. For your hairstyle, try finger waves for long hair or straight hair with the bottom curled in for shorter hair.

, Finish your look with fishnet stockings and black or red heels, then add period-appropriate accessories. Wear a long strand of pearls tied in a knot about halfway down, or a thick, Asian-inspired cuff. Try a sparkly headband over your forehead or an embellished comb in your hair. For an extra costume-like effect, wear a feather boa and put a tiny toy gun in a thigh holster.

Remember these words if you want to be a hipster.",How to Be a Hipster Quickly," You can't be a hipster without knowing how you're going to do it. You need these steps to figure it out. (Or you can be a TRUE hipster and not take advice from a website as mainstream as wikiHow. Your choice.)

The Typical Hipster: This is the type of hipster to sort of 'run with the crowd', as much as you can as a hipster. They prefer to wear normal Ray Bans (or the knockoffs, since name brands are WAY too mainstream.) and red lipstick for females. The personality associated with this hipster 'breed' includes a local cafe rendezvous at least weekly, scoffing at 'Ignorant, self(ie)-obsessed mainstream girls who only wear makeup and name brands', and shopping at thrift stores.
The Artsy Hipster: Favoring the beret, black-and-white striped shirts, suspenders, and red skinny jeans, these hipsters are more likely to be at a Poetry Slam than to be writing a Sci-Fi or a romance novel. They're easy to spot, and you'll know them when you see them.
The 'Granny' Hipster: This hipster ONLY shops at thrift stores, ONLY buys antique furniture, and prefers tea over coffee. These ones are stupidly mistaken by the mainstream world as 'Tumblr Hipsters'. As a bonus to all of the vintage décor, these hipsters like standing up for the environment, and will also most likely have their head in a book at the park.;
, Look like you just threw something random on and walked out the door as soon as possible. Here are some tips.

Mismatch things. It's perfectly fine to wear shorts, a vintage or flower-print blouse, and 80s style leg warmers: that's PERFECT. Try also: Skinny jeans, a striped shirt with wild-patterned suspenders, and combat boots. Be creative. And remember, if everyone takes advice from the same website, it's no longer hipster: it's just mainstream. *Shudders*
Grab some old, beat-up Converse, Toms, or Vans to wear with anything. Literally.
When in doubt, just wear something off-brand: No hipster will ever be caught wearing Under Armour.

,
Put it in a messy bun.
Try ruffling it or doing pinup curls. Maybe braid it overnight.

,

Mainstream: The worst possible thing you could do or be as a hipster. Starbucks, loop 'buns' (in Step Three of Part One), and on-brand things like Victoria's Secret are examples.
Fixie: A bicycle
Java: Coffee

Observe true hipsters.,
Find a hobby.,
Be eco-friendly.,
Find obscure bands.,
Get the look.,
Natural Hipsters.,
Punk Hipsters.,
Thrift Store Hipsters.,
Add it all together.",How to Be a Modern Day Hipster," It's very likely that there's at least one hipster in your school. If there is, start picking up on what they do, wear, and what clubs (if any) they're in. Clubs can be really helpful. Joining things like Green Club, PAWS, Young Democrats, and Gay-Straight Alliance are very hipster. It's also very hip be passionate about all your views. Make sure to get your religious views straight (though most hipsters aren't religious) as well as your political and philosophical views. Have a view you truly believe in and stick to or don't hold a political view at all!;
, All hipsters have at least one hobby. Whether it be photography, poetry, playing guitar, knitting, recycling, or painting! If you're interested in something, go ahead and pick it up! It's very hipster to devote yourself to a certain thing, and be seriously into it. You also need to make sure you get your work out there. For instance if you knit, tell people! If someone likes your scarf, and you knit it yourself don't be afraid to say so!

, Hipsters are all extremists when it comes to the earth. They typically all recycle and most of them only buy a product if it's biodegradable. If you're not eco-friendly, don't worry because it's not too hard! Start small by planting your own vegetable garden, that way you don't buy over processed vegetables from the grocery store. If you aren't a vegetarian already, you might want to look into it, because being a vegetarian is VERY hipster. It's also very hipster to only eat health foods that you buy at your local health food market.

, Hipsters listen to a multitude of genres, but perhaps the most important is the one that no one has heard of. Whether it be German techno or lighthearted jazz funk. A hipster always has a ton of music on their first generation iPod, with their big over-the-ear headphones from Urban Outfitters. Make sure that no one has ever heard of any of your bands, that boosts up your hipster cred a load. It's also very important to have some of the classics. For example Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Yes, R.E.M, and The Ramones.

, Here is the hard part. There are several types of hipsters. There are the natural hipsters, the punk hipsters, and the thrift store hipsters. You need to decide which genre you fit into. So see the categories below for reference:

, Natural hipsters usually wear their tops tucked into their pants/shorts. They typically wear lace up, low top Keds (colors like salmon, light blue, and denim are best) They wear their hair in either a bun on top of their head, or just down. Natural hipsters always let their hair dry naturally and never wear a speck of make-up. They always have clear skin and natural, un-layered and uncolored hair. Their clothes are typically plain colors or a patterned top paired with plain shorts. It really varies. They tend to be the most eco-friendly of all the hipsters, and are ALWAYS vegetarian or vegan. They listen to obscure bands, and are constantly on Tumblr. They shop Urban Outfitters, American Apparel, and occasionally thrift stores. A natural hipster is never seen without their aviator sunglasses in the summer. They usually drink only water, tea, and black coffee. They also typically restrict themselves to eating extremely healthy foods and tend to do yoga in their free time. Perhaps the most envied of all the hipster groups, but also the hardest to perfect!

, Their style much resembles that of Taylor Momsen or Miley Cyrus (via 2011) They usually wear too much eyeliner, bleach their hair or dye it jet black and let it grow below the rib cage and wear really baggy, yet fashionable clothes. They wear tons of rings, and necklaces, listen to Nirvana and look like total sex-kittens. Punk Hipsters are definitely not one to be messed with. They party hard, and are often certified geniuses (much like Ke$ha). Punk Hipsters buy their clothes from Topshop, Urban Outfitters, and thrift stores. They wear black combat boots a lot and you'll often see them in aviator sunglasses as well. They like to wear fishnets or any other black tights under a pair of cut off shorts with a vintage band-tee such as The Rolling Stones, Nirvana, Hole or something ironic like Simon & Garfunkel.

, Thrift store hipsters are a more To-Each-Their-Own sort of category. You can really do anything and pull it off if you have a couple essentials. You have to have multiple ugly sweaters and cardigans from thrift stores and you MUST have a pair of Dr. Martens (preferably in a floral print). Other than that thrift store hipsters are just another way of saying stereotypical hipster kid who just wanted an ironic name so they'd stand out in a crowd.

, Now that you have a general idea, you should go on Weheartit.com and type in ""Hipster"" in the search bar. The pictures that come up are a PERFECT example of true hipsters! Good luck, in an ironic way.

It will be too expensive and you’ll risk looking like a poser. Make alterations to your closet one step at a time, and be patient with yourself as you learn how to be more of a genuine hipster.


Capturing the hipster look is difficult because the goal is to avoid mainstream fashions which are also not easy to define.
Overall, being hipster is about looking different than the masses. The irony is that you may end up looking just like other hipsters who are trying to be different.;
, Black needs to be the number one color in your closet. It goes with everything, is slimming, and pairing it with other colors is edgy.To avoid looking too gothic, pair black with bright colors or a mix of olive, navy, and khaki.


Mix your colors but don’t match them exactly to each other. You want a smorgasbord of color options instead of the same thing repeated over your whole body.You can mix patterns as well as styles. Two different kinds of stripes on your jacket and pants can work together-just pair it with a plain undershirt.

, Your goal is to look different and stand out from all the people who wear mass-produced items. You will need a few staples in your closet:


A vintage leather or denim jacket
V-neck t-shirts in plain colors for layering
Button down flannel shirts, hoodies, or baggy sweaters
A beanie or vintage brimmed hat
Skinny jeans
Any kind of leather boots, vintage sneakers, or moccasin-style shoes

, Pants are an important asset in the hipster wardrobe. Your pants should either be very tight, like a pair of skinny jeans, or extra baggy, like jogger pants or 70s style bell bottoms. Traditionally, skinny jeans are your best day-to-day option.

, The most recognizable hipster glasses are the black, squared-off frames for both guys and girls. You can also get a pair of brightly colored ones to help you stand out even more. If you don’t wear glasses or wear contacts, invest in a pair of sunglasses that are mirrored and have that same squared-off hipster shape to appear mysterious and cool.

, Accessories don't just have to be for girls. Hipster guys defy the norm. A tote bag from your local record store or a messenger bag for biking around will hold all of your essentials. Scarves can be worn on your neck with a deep V-neck or as an armband.


Observe other hipster guys to see how they style their scarves with leather and metals cuffs to make a feminine accessory more rugged.
Common hipster hat options include: beanies, classic fedoras, porkpies, and bowlers for the more daring., Facial hair is a staple for hipster guys. It makes you look rugged and . You can also grow your hair out down to your shoulders and pull it back with bandanas, hats, or hair ties. The more hair you have, the more you’ll look like a hipster.Invest in beard or ‘stache wax to keep your hair looking groomed and attractive. Trimming is also important to do every once in awhile.
If you let your facial hair become scraggly, be aware that you’ll start to look like a mountain man hipster instead of an urban one. The choice is yours though, either look is trendy right now.
Don't worry if you can't grow in full facial hair. It's an addition to the hipster look, not a requirement.

, To find the right pieces to fill your wardrobe, you can’t always shop at mainstream stores at the mall. You still want to fight the appearance of being mainstream so you need to dig around in little hole-in-the-wall shops to find the right pair of distressed boots and pre-owned leather jackets.The older, the better should be your rule of thumb.
Thrift and consignments stores will help you save money since they're less expensive than most name-brand stores.

, As a hipster you need to be picky because you don't have time and money to do everything, so you need to know what's worth your attention. Decide which music you like best or which coffee shop in town has the best drinks. You want to have standards and be able to tell people which restaurant is the best in town or why a certain film director is better than another.


Always have a reason as to why you like or dislike something. You need to be able to explain to people why one musician is superior to another.
Be careful not to make any feel inferior because they like something you don’t. You can voice your opinions, but don’t be a jerk about it.

, Pepper in quotes from indie films or song lyrics from obscure bands. If your friends can chime in, that’s great, but it’s even better when you can impress people with knowing things that they’ve never even heard of.Watch classic 80s movies or look for vintage game consoles like Nintendo 64 or Intellivision to impress people of your knowledge of old-school culture.
Nostalgic things are a big part of hipster culture. Any TV shows or bands or fashion trends from your childhood or even your parent’s childhood are worth looking into and talking about.Hipsters take pride in “bringing things back” from the past.

, Part of the hipster lifestyle is being on the lookout for secret restaurants or coffee menus or that elusive taco truck in the park on Thursdays. If you can find something exclusive and unheard of, it gives you the satisfaction of knowing you found it first. You have the power to keep your discovery to yourself or share it with your friends and social media., This is the most difficult part of being a hipster to master. Being ironic means to be intentionally contradictory to what people expect. For example, wearing a t-shirt with a classic rock band name on it would be ironic if you don’t like classic rock but instead love techno music. Sarcasm is another form of irony that you can work into your vocabulary.
When you react to events, do it in the opposite way people would expect. For instance if you’re favorite band is coming to town and your friends know you’ll be excited, react as if it’s not a big deal because that is what they would not expect.
Irony is not a concept everyone understands correctly. Know that there are many ways that people define and interpret irony.

, Now you definitely do like and care about things in life, but being a hipster means that you don’t show it. By actually caring about things but acting like you don't, you'll also be acting ironically. Practice reacting to things apathetically, as if they're not too exciting.

, Shop at your town’s farmer’s market or explore the used book and record stores instead of going to a corporate store. As a hipster, you want to support smaller business and start-up companies instead of the big, overbearing corporations that run the country.The attitude behind shop local for some hipsters is that big companies don’t need more money and don’t care about you anyways.
Getting to know the businesses in your area is a better way to avoid being mainstream.

, Secret or 'underground' shows are a great way to find new bands to listen to that only a small group of people know about yet. Many of the artists and bands that you’ll want to listen to will be “indie” or independent musicians without a major record label. Indie music is a staple genre in any hipster’s music library.Your local record shop will have plenty of flyers and people who can tell you where to find shows and what bands are up and coming.
In addition to indie music, any vintage or old music.
Your music tastes are how you can show people that you’re cultured and well-rounded.
Even though you’re looking to enter the hipster subculture, you can stay true to your own music tastes. Indie and classic music has so many different subgenres that you’re bound to find some new favorites.

, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook are some of the biggest platforms for hipsters. You have the ability to share articles about new indie bands or post photos from the secret new juice bar in the yoga studio downtown. The internet is a tool you can use to show other people your hipster outfits of the day and how you’re working on the hipster lifestyle.

, Hipsters are often confused with being hippies, but in some ways the two subcultures are similar. Going vegan, not eating or consuming any animal products, is an active way to deviate from a mainstream lifestyle while also helping the environment., If you really want to commit to a hipster lifestyle, look into buying a fixed gear bike and use it for your main transportation. You’ll be getting a workout and helping the environment at the same time.

, You don't have to jet set around the world to travel; you can treat your hometown as a whole new world to explore as well. Use social media to research new places to visit or find urban art or hole-in-the-wall venues yourself.


Make sure your phone and camera are charged and have free space for all of the pictures you’ll want to take to show everyone back home.When you do travel to other cities, use new companies like Airbnb to book quirky places to stay instead of a typical hotel.
Do your research before going to a new city or place so you know where all the cool locals hang out.

, Being around other hipsters will help you learn the culture and attitude of being a true hipster. You don’t have to completely change groups of friends but look to make new friends as well.


Some of the most popular watering holes for hipsters are the independent coffee shops, record, book, or comic shops, or concerts."

Adapt period-appropriate menswear.,
Do dramatic makeup and hair.,
Add accessories.",How to Be a Gangster Girl2," Appropriate the traditional 1920s mobster look for feminine use. Start with something like the classic, double-breasted pinstripe suit. Add black shoes and an elegant tie, as well as a fedora.

, Wear the same bold red lip and smoky eye that Jazz Age women did. Either tie your hair back in a tight bun (to better accommodate a hat) or try loose finger waves.

, If your suit has a breast pocket, add a flashy handkerchief. Pin a bright flower on your lapel for extra feminine effect. If you're planing on taking off your jacket, add a slim pair of suspenders over your blouse.

Know your colors.,
Wear smart shoes.,
Mix up your wardrobe.,
Add bold accessories.,
Think about how you wear your hair.,
Exude confidence.",How to Be a Gangster Girl3," Most modern gangs have specific colors in which members dress. Make sure your clothing doesn't accidentally telegraph allegiance to a rival gang by being the wrong color.

, You need to be able to run, so skip the heels and sandals. Pick shoes that allow you to sprint easily and don't feel uncomfortable after several hours on your feet.

, Rotate a variety of styles through your daily look. Slim-fitting tank tops, plaid button-up shirts, baby tees and off-the-shoulder blouses are street appropriate. For jeans or skirts, find a fit that works for you and go with it.

, Use loud, big accessories to display your confidence. Common gangster girl accessories include bandanas, hoop earrings, sunglasses, cross necklaces, and big rings.

, However you style your hair, make it a reflection of your attitude. Be aware that a long ponytail makes it easy for someone to grab you and pull you down if you're running.

, Look people straight in the eye and keep you posture straight. Subtle cues like this communicate that you're fearless and in control.

Learn about the attitude.,
Know that you don't have to get wasted, take drugs or be promiscuous to be a rocker.,
Like the bands you like.,
Clothes do not make the rocker.,
Don't be mean to other people because you think it's tough.,
Don't try to fail all your tests/exams to look hard.,
Check out new local bands, or start one of your own.,
Don't limit yourself to just one type of rock, try everything.",How to Be a Female Rocker," Being a Rocker doesn't require being sassy to your teachers, being mean to other people in order to try to look tough, trying to be a 'rebel' or any other stereotypes associated with it. Anybody can be a Rocker, and they can either have Straight A-grades or like the colour pink. There will always be people who'll tell you that you should be like this or be doing that or dress that this to be one, but these people are probably just insecure about their own identities, and don't require your time.;
, Get that out of your head. This is a myth. Getting wasted and taking drugs are signs of immaturity. Everyone gets curious, and some people become drunk by various situations, but doing them purposefully will just make you look stupid and childish. Being promiscuous will only get someone a reputation, and drinking and taking drugs are harmful to your body. Again, people will tell you that you should, and you're not 'true' if you don't, but this is false. 'True' comes from inside you. What's the use of being a rocker if you're too ill from having your stomach pumped?

, Most people who are Rockers will favour Rock above all other genres, but it doesn't mean you can't like anything else. A lot of rock is influenced by Neo-Classical, such as Yngwie Malmsteen and Trey Azagthoth, and you are free to listen to Jazz, Punk, Garage, Dance, whatever you're into. Also, people will judge the bands you listen to. Some may call you a Poser or Wannabe, but there's no such thing. You're not a Wannabe for liking what you like. People who say that are just trying to demean you and make you feel bad. If you really like a band, why not get a couple of t-shirts, or badges for your bag. Show how much you admire them.

, The same goes for Piercings. Some people choose to dress all in leather, some don't, some choose to get a multitude of piercings and tattoos, others prefer not to. It's all up to you. Dress like whatever the hell you feel like, it's no one else's business how you dress, and it's your attitude and personality which makes you who you are.

, It isn't, it just showcases how scared you are. It's like putting a big flashing notice around your neck that says 'Hey, look at me, I'm really insecure so I take it out on other people'. And it's not nice. You wouldn't like it if someone did it to you. If they're mean to you, it's a different story, but it would surprise you how many people will like you if you're just nice.

, Other people might think that, but even Jimi Hendrix finished his education and joined the army. And you can't be busy being a rocker if you're in detentions all the time. What's the point in being a rocker if you have no education. You can't do much with that.

, It's a great way to express yourself and making friends who like the same stuff as you.

, Each sub-genre is bound to have something that you like.

Gather your materials.,
Use the bowl and candle to create soot.,
Scrape off the soot into the mixing bowl.,
Mix the soot with corn starch.,
Store the powder in an airtight container.",How to Make Fingerprint Powder1," You will need corn starch, a measuring cup, a lighter or matches, a candle, a ceramic bowl, a knife or paintbrush, and a mixing bowl.The mixing bowl can be glass, plastic, or ceramic. However, you can’t substitute the ceramic bowl for another kind of bowl. The process of making the fingerprint powder can crack glass and melt plastic.


If you decide that making your own powder is too much trouble, you can buy it from science and hobby supply stores or online.;
, First, use the lighter or the matches to light the candle. Next, hold the bottom of the ceramic bowl over the flame. The candle will burn a layer of soot onto the bottom of the bowl.Move the bowl over the flame so that every part of the bottom touches the candle.


Wear an oven mitt or use a dishtowel to protect your hand from the heat.
Always be careful when working with an open flame. Children should have adult supervision.

, Hold the soot-covered bowl over the mixing bowl. Next, use a dull knife or a paintbrush to scrape the soot off of the ceramic bowl and into the mixing bowl. You will have about a teaspoon of soot. The more soot you have, the more fingerprint powder you will be able to make.


Repeat these steps to make more soot as many times as you’d like.
Scraping soot is very messy. If you want to avoid getting soot on your fingers, wear gloves. Similarly, cover your workspace with a towel to keep it clean.

, Use a measuring cup to evaluate how much soot you have gathered. Next, add an equal part of corn starch to the soot.Mix the two powders together well with a whisk.


For example, if you collected a ¼ cup of soot, you would need to add a ¼ cup of corn starch.

, Place the fingerprint powder in a plastic food storage container with a lid. Alternatively, store your fingerprint powder in a plastic re-sealable bag. These containers are airtight and won’t allow any moisture into your powder.


Keep the container on a shelf in a low-traffic area. Otherwise, someone may knock the powder over and create a sooty mess.

Find a fingerprint.,
Dust the powder over the print.,
Use clear tape to lift the print.Find some clear plastic tape.,
Display the fingerprint.",How to Make Fingerprint Powder2," Search for household items that have been handled recently. Choose items with smooth surfaces. The smoother the surface, the easier it is to lift a fingerprint.If you want to practice lifting fingerprints, you can make your own by touching a glass.


Avoid trying to lift prints from soft, pliable surfaces. These surfaces require a special fingerprinting chemical., Once you’ve located your fingerprint, sprinkle some of your fingerprinting powder over it in a thin layer. Next, carefully brush the powder over the fingerprint, covering it completely.Once the print is covered, gently brush the excess powder away. You will see a dark, clearly-defined fingerprint.


Gently blow on the fingerprint to help remove excess powder.

, Measure out a small piece. Next, press the sticky side of the tape against the dust-covered fingerprint. Slowly pull the tape away to lift the print.


Smooth out any wrinkles in the tape before lifting the print.

, Press the sticky side of the fingerprinted tape onto a sheet of white paper or a white note card. The contrast of the dark fingerprint against the white paper will make the print easier to examine.

"
"
Catalogue your family.Ask each of your family members for a fingerprint.,
Classify your prints.,
Compare any found fingerprints.",How to Make Fingerprint Powder3," Tape the fingerprints on a notecard or a white sheet of paper. Record each family member’s name, birthday, and gender.


You can catalogue one finger or all ten if you’d like. If you record all ten fingers, it will be easier to identify found prints.

, Fingerprints come in three categories: arch, loop, and whirl. These patterns are found in the lines from the fingerprints. An arch looks like a short bump. A loop looks like a long, thin arch. A whirl resembles a circle surrounded by smaller lines. These classifications are important when identifying fingerprints.


Write the fingerprint classification for each family member on their fingerprint card.
The different shapes can also lean left or right.If so, indicate which direction the whirl, loop, or arch leans on the family members fingerprint card.

, When you find fingerprints around the house, compare them to your catalogue. Look for matching classification and tilt. For example, if the fingerprint you found was a whirl that leaned to the left, you would look through your catalogue for a similarly identified print.


Store successfully identified fingerprints on the back of their respective fingerprint card. This will make future identifications easier.

Observe someone who's interested in art and point out unique things in the room or setting.,

An example would be if you see a black and white flower. Would the artist notice the positive and negative space and shading and angle of the flower whereas you just think its pretty? Art museums are a great place to go to try to see the world through the eyes of an artist because that's where artists have portrayed what they've seen through their eyes.;
, Drawing helps to let you focus and break down line, shape, space, and mass when looking at everyday objects. if you don't have paper draw the item in your mind line by line and see how it adds up to create the object.

,, Literally. Something that looks like one thing to a normal person looks completely different to an artist. If you aren't sure you think quite that way, relax! Most people weren't born that way! The brain is built to be wired and rewired so you can most certainly begin to think differently. The next time you see an ordinary object like a chair, don't think 'chair' think something new, something completely different, something a little weird, but don't be afraid of weirdness, embrace it!

, If at first you get average results, challenge yourself to think something completely different. It'll be fun!

, Its part of what makes artists so creative! Being able to think of something that no one else does makes you completely artsy and cool! Just think, if people like Salvador Dali or Picasso were 'normal' would they be quite so famous?

, Artists do new things all the time, the unconventional the uncool, the odd, the eclectic. If you see something you've never seen before, pick it up. If you see an old place you've never been to, go inside. You might be amazed at what you find. Even if you don't, you should be willing to take the risk.

, Or one anything! No object has only one use, no words only mean one thing. The possibilities of anything are only as limited as you imagine them to be.

, Or do whatever it is artsy that you like to do. Feel a perfect breeze? Write a poem about it. See a funky outfit? Draw it. Hear a melodic sound, write a song about it. Do a bit of what you do every single day. If you do, by the end of this year you will have at least 365 pieces of artwork. You will boost your talent and also be quite prolific.

, Pretend you are them, speak like them, walk like them, behave like them. True, you may raise some eyebrows but let them rise! The more you do, the more quirky and individual you will become and then you will be able to have a deeper connection with that person or thing!

Recognize the difference between a rabbitat and a cage.,
Consider available space.,
Provide cozy nooks.,
Leave a space for a litter pan.,
Secure the playground.,
Consider time for play when outfitting the rabbitat.,
Add some dirt.,
Spread a layer of hay on the ground.,
Place greens and flowers in the playground.,
Provide clean food and water.,
Up the fun factor with toys and tunnels.",How to Design a Rabbit Playground," You can use your rabbit playground as housing for your rabbit, or it may be part of daily playtime. In general, a rabbitat is a larger, more open space that provides elements such as grazing space, foraging opportunities, and hiding spots. Cages may be smaller and a space in which you house the rabbit when you’re away.Consider using an enclosed playground instead of a cage. The more room your rabbit has to play, the happier it is. This also integrates your rabbit more effectively into your family.
Use pre-fabricated cubes, puppy pens, and stackable rabbit condos for the playground. You can also order pre-fabricated rabbit playgrounds or even boxes you have around the house. These differ from cages in their spatial dimensions and what they offer a rabbit for hiding, climbing, and foraging spaces.;
, Rabbits naturally jump around in the wild. They also like to spend time underground. Your rabbitat will need enough space for jumping and burrowing.Ideally, your rabbitat should be at least 32 square feet.Designate space within a room or an entire room for your rabbit playground. If you live in a small home or an apartment, you may want to invest in stackable hutches, cubes, or condos. These allow you to offer plenty of space for jumping and hiding as well as a litter pan.Make sure your designated space is in a cooler spot. Rabbits are very sensitive to heat and don’t like direct sunlight. Bedding you add can keep your rabbit warm if the room or weather is cooler., Rabbits are most active at dawn and dusk. Because of this, they often sleep during the day.Incorporate dark, cool, and cozy spaces in the playground for your rabbit to sleep. These also provide an area to hide if your rabbit feels threatened.


Use boxes or hutches as sleeping spaces. These provide shade and darkness that allow your rabbit to sleep and hide. They also offer cozy nooks and corners that your rabbit can cuddle into.
Place a dark cloth over the playground if you’re using stackable pieces. This can provide necessary shade and darkness for your rabbit to sleep and hide. You can use an old sheet or purchase a cover specifically designed for rabbit housing and playgrounds., Rabbits are very clean animals. They generally choose one specific area for toileting.Make sure you allot sufficient space for your bunny’s litter pan for its health and happiness.Use a cat litter pan for your bunny. Rabbit litter boxes are often too small to make a bunny comfortable.

, No matter if your rabbit playground is indoor or outdoor, keeping it secure is very important. This can prevent your rabbit from escaping or other animals from preying on your pet. It also ensures that your rabbit can hide if it is scared. Rabbits can die of fright if a predator is visible at close range.Make sure any latches on the playground are secure. Check to see that your bunny can’t jump out of the playground if it is exposed to the open air.
Avoid leaving your rabbit unsupervised in the playground if it is not the primary housing. This can prevent your rabbit from injury or other harm.

, Take a moment to consider how much time a rabbit needs in a play every day to stay happy and healthy. This can help you decide where to splurge and save on the playground. Your rabbit should spend at least 5 hours a day in the rabbitat to promote its health and happiness., Rabbits live in warrens in the wild. These are underground networks of interconnecting burrows and tunnels. Adding dirt or garden soil to the rabbitat provides extra fun for your rabbit and allows it to indulge its natural behaviors.Designate a space in your outdoor rabbit playground for dirt. Make a small pile of regular garden soil for your rabbit to enjoy.
Fill a small litter pan with dirt if your rabbit playground is inside your home. This can provide your rabbit with the enjoyment of burrowing while containing the mess to one area.

, Hay is a key component to any rabbit’s diet and well-being. It provides something to munch on as well as nesting material for warmth.Adding a layer of Timothy or mixed grass hay can help keep your rabbit happy and healthy. You can find mixed grass and Timothy hay at pet stores, most large retailers, and many hardware or farming stores.


Use alfalfa hay if you prefer. However, it’s higher in calories and calcium than mixed grass or Timothy hay, which can promote weight gain.
Make sure there is plenty of hay in the rabbitat’s sleeping space. This keeps your rabbit cozy and warm.

, Rabbits don’t need greens as a major part of their diet. However, fresh cut greens and flowers do have dietary and emotional benefits for rabbits. Add a variety of upright greens and flowers so that your rabbit can stand up and stretch to reach the leaves, just like it would do in nature. Make sure that your rabbit doesn’t get more than a handful of greens every day.The following greens and flowers are safe for rabbits:Alfalfa, radish, and clover sprouts
Beet greens
Cilantro
Dandelion greens and flowers
Mint
Mustard Greens
Pea pods
Parsley
Peppermint leaves
Raspberry leaves
Wheat grass
DaisyMarigold
Cornflower
Sunflower
Lavender
Rose

, Rabbits need fresh food and water every day. This helps maintain their health and happiness. In addition to any greens you place in the rabbitat, make sure that your rabbit also has readily accessible clean food and water every day.Feed your rabbit high quality food such as alfalfa or Timothy-based pellets. In addition, give the rabbit one cup of vegetables for every 4 pounds of body weight. Some vegetables rabbits like include bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, celery, spinach, and watercress.Treat your rabbit to 1-2 tablespoons of fruit per 5 pounds of body weight. Fruits rabbits enjoy include apples, melons, peaches, pineapple, plums, and raspberries.

, Your rabbitat should have spaces for tunneling, grazing, exploring, climbing, climbing, chewing, hiding, and perching. Your choices of hutches and condos provide ample opportunity for these. You can increase your bunny’s enjoyment by adding toys and more tunnels to the playground.Set PVC piping and/ or toilet or paper towel rolls for additional tunneling options.Paper bags also provide good tunneling options.
Provide wooden chew toys for flinging, chewing, pulling, and batting. Untreated wicker baskets and wood branches also make great chew toys.
Consider plastic cat and baby toys that your rabbit can push over and make noise. Metal lids are a great alternative to toys.
Place a couple of old towels in the playground for your rabbit to bunch up and scoot around with its paws. Just make sure the rabbit doesn’t eat the towel.

Dress appropriately.,
Wear light colors.,
Wear light makeup.,
Get the right hairstyle.,
Smile often.,
Keep a pleasant look on your face.,
Carry yourself with open body language.,
Be kind to others.,
Focus on the positive.",How to Look Sweet," If you want to look sweet, it's important that you dress the part. Typically, a sweet look is achieved with modest clothing and youthful silhouettes, whereas wearing tight, revealing clothing will give you a more mature look. Keep a fun and youthful image in mind when you're getting dressed to achieve a sweet look.


You can still dress cute while wearing modest clothing. For example, pair skirts and shorts with sweaters or crew neck t-shirts. Or instead of wearing a dress with heels, throw on some cute flats or sneakers. Combining cute skirts and dresses with modest and youthful pieces like sneakers and sweaters will create a sweet look.
Instead of wearing tight fitting clothing, wear clothes that create a more youthful silhouette. Instead of a curve hugging dress, throw on an A-line dress (fitted on top, with full skirt bottom) or a baby doll dress (short, straight cut, and not fitted to the body). Tighter fitting clothes will give you a sexy, mature look, which isn't exactly the sweet look you're going for. Stick to youthful silhouettes that aren't too revealing.;
, Lighter colors look much sweeter than darker colors, so make them a bigger part of your wardrobe. Swap out your dark colored clothing for light pastels, bright colors, and neutrals. Dressing in this lighter color palette automatically creates a sweeter, fun, and youthful look.If you choose to wear patterns, go with girly, cute patterns such as polka dots or floral prints. Avoid bold, crazy patterns.
Keep it simple. A sweet look is a simple, classic look. Don't over-accesorize or go crazy with patterns.

, The sweet look isn't achieved with heavy contouring or intense eyeliner. Instead, go with a more natural look. Looking sweet is often associated with youth and innocence, so light makeup will give you the best results.


Go with lighter colored lipsticks and lip glosses as opposed to deep colors.
Use a small amount of foundation to even out your skin instead of caking foundation on to cover your skin. Applying heavy makeup looks much more mature, and less sweet.This will give your face a natural, radiant glow.Use shimmers or highlighters to highlight your cheekbones instead of contouring. This will give your face a natural, radiant glow.
Use blush to give yourself sweet, rosy cheeks.If you love experimenting with makeup, play with bright lipsticks and eyeshadows. These lighter, brighter colors will give you the sweet look you're going for without the dramatics of a heavy eyeliner or dark lip.

, The perfect hairstyle makes or breaks any look. If you want to look sweet, it's best to avoid extreme hairstyles like mohawks, bright blue streaks, or a half shaved head. Go for a simple, more traditional hairstyle instead.


Stick with natural hair colors – blondes, brunettes, blacks, and natural reds – instead of bright crazy hair dye colors like red, blue, pink, etc.
Get a classic haircut. Whether you go with shoulder length with bangs, a short bob, a cute pixie cut, or long flowy waves, your hair should have a classic, simple cut. This will give you the sweet look you're going for. Avoid any wild or asymmetrical haircuts.
Stick with simple hairstyles. Leave your hair down and tuck it behind your ears, try a nice bun, go with a simple ponytail, or wear your hair in youthful pigtail braids. Whatever style you go with, keep it simple and classic., Smiling does wonders for your outward appearance and your inner happiness. When you smile, you are automatically seen as a kinder, sweeter, happier individual. Smiling often leads to laughter and results in you actually feeling better. When you project this kind of positivity, people are naturally drawn to you., In addition to smiling, keep your face soft and sweet. Keeping a pleasant, relaxed look on your face will result in you looking sweeter. Your forehead and eyes should be relaxed, and your jaw should remain unclenched. This will help your face to look more relaxed.

, Sweet people come off as kind and approachable. Keep your body language calm and relaxed so that you appear to be more approachable. Although you should avoid carrying tension in your body, you should still hold your head high and maintain good posture.


Don't close yourself off from people. To do this, avoid any type of body language that closes you off from others, such as crossing your arms.

, Being nice is the most important quality of a sweet person. When you're kind to others, people enjoy being around you more. If you desire to be viewed as a sweet person, it's important that you act like a sweet person.


Being kind will also make you and those around you happier. The happier you are, the sweeter you become., Nobody enjoys being around people who are constantly complaining or being mean. We tend to be attracted to positive people because they make us happier. When you project a positive attitude, people are more likely to view you as a kind, sweet person. Being positive creates a better environment for everyone around you."

Have an interest in music- There's no point in acting like your musical when you have no interest in it whatsoever.,
Have some musical talent- It helps if you actually have some musical talent, e.g.,
Always be listening to music- Try carrying around an iPod/music player.,
Dress the part- Music is a form of art, it's expressing yourself, as is your fashion sense, so make an effort to look the part.,
Get the natural look- When it comes to hair and makeup, keep it natural.,
Don't care what others think- If you want to listen to Mozart then you listen to Mozart.,
Lets others see your talent- If you're an amazing singer or can play the guitar really well or whatever your talent, then get out there and show the world.",How to Look or Be Like a Musical Girl," Try listening to lots of different styles/genres and not just sticking to one. For example: Only liking metal and rock music. Try researching different genres on iTunes or the internet- and that should come up with some good artists for those difference genres. Some examples are: pop, classical, techno, dance, rock, metal, blues, country, etc.;
,: playing an instrument, writing your own songs, etc. If you don't already play an instrument then try getting some lessons for something that interests you. There's no point getting lessons for flute when you really want to play piano. Or if you already play and instrument then, if it's possible, start to learn another one. You could also try singing, composing or song-writing too. Search the internet for some good tips on how to do these.

, Fill it up with lots of different music including your favourite artists as well. Create a playlist including songs from lots of different genres of music so when someone asks you what you're listening to, then it won't always be the same thing as this will make you seem more musical.

, Casual but funky is the key- don't go overboard. Try to be unique as well. Try wearing jeans and hoodies with cute accessories. Investing in a pair of converse is also a good idea because they are casual but still look cute and cool. Try wearing skinny jeans and cute top or a skirt with leggings and a hoody. You don't have to dress the same as everyone else. Another good idea is accessories with musical notes on them or t-shirts with musical designs. Just remember- the key is expressing yourself.

, Simple mascara and eyeliner to make your eyes stand out and maybe a little bit of bronzer or lipgloss if you want. Try dying your hair a shade of dark from or a reddish chestnut brown. Wavy or tousled hair looks natural and like you haven't spend ages fussing over your hair. Accessories such as headbands are also a good idea, or just throw back your hair in a simple ponytail, bun or plaits.

, If you want to play the flute and love heavy metal music then you do that. Stay true to yourself and don't let others take you out of your comfort zone. Just remember that it's your life and your musical taste and not theirs.

, Try performing your school assembly to get you started off. If you get stage-fright then try performing in front of just a few close friends or family, and as you get more confident you'll gradually be able to perform to even more people.

Get a hutch at the ready!,
Decide where you are going to put your rabbits hutch/shed!,
Fill it with bedding!,
Decorate!",How to House a Rabbit," You don't actually need a hutch, you could just use a shed which is attached to a playpen, so they get the warmth and fresh air they need. But if you are deciding to get a hutch, make sure it's big enough, because in some pet shops they are not spacious. You will know if the house is big enough because your rabbit can hop nine times in a row and his ears won't touch the top of the roof. Also make sure it is waterproof so no water comes in because your rabbit will get damp and become ill. Make sure it's warm enough so your rabbit is nice and warm especially in winter.
, An ideal space to put a rabbit house is in a place which is dry and is also in shade. Make sure that the hutch/shed is away from predators., Provide sawdust or hay and animal bedding or recycled paper for its bed. But if you getting a shed for your rabbit, just fill the rabbit's bed with recycled paper or bedding for animals. Make sure you put carpet down so your rabbit's feet don't get cold., It would be really boring for a rabbit to have a house without any toys, so make sure you include them. Also provide them with a hay and vegetable rack, drink bottle and food bowl. Provide it with toys such as paper bags filled with flowers treats food and hay and grass, a ball filled with nuggets and toilet tubes. you can also get lots of other stuff to customize your rabbits home!"

The location, in combination with the cage itself, will provide the shade the rabbit needs to keep from overheating in the summer and should also keep them out of bad weather in the winter.


Rabbits can get heat stroke because they only sweat on the pads of their feet.
The only bigger danger than heat to outdoor rabbits is cold. A heater won't work for two reasons: the rabbits will huddle to it (and are more than likely to burn themselves), and it can also start a fire.;
, A basic rabbit cage, also known as a hutch, is simple a box that is raised off the ground. Standard rabbit cages are made of wood and wire, and are big enough for the rabbits to sit up on their hind legs and to stretch out.Decide on the height, width, and depth of the box of the cage. This is a good starting point for your design. Make your enclosure at least five feet deep by six feet long and tall enough for the rabbits to not hit their fuzzy heads on the roof when they jump. If more than one rabbit inhabits the space, make it a couple feet longer.
Decide how far off the ground the cage should be. To keep the rabbits from predators, make sure it is at least 3 feet off the ground.The cage is usually long enough to have two sections, in order for the rabbits to have a separate sleeping section.The sleeping section should have solid sides, so that the rabbits can snuggle inside if the temperature gets cold.
The roof of the cage can also function as its door, with the roof attached on one side with hinges, so it can be lifted up.It should not be totally flat, as a pitched roof with an overhang will keep rain out more successfully.There is no one way to design the cage but as long as the structure is secure and the inside is big enough for the rabbits, you are on the right path.

, You will need a saw and a drill, in addition to a staple gun and some snips to cut wire mesh. The saw and drill will help you make the frame and the staple gun and snips will help you to attach the wire to the frame.


Additionally you will need a tape measure and pencil to make measurements and mark them.

, A rabbit cage has all the basic things a house does: a roof, walls, and a floor. However, unlike a house, the roof of a rabbit cage can function as its door and the floor and some of the walls are usually made of wire mesh.


Get wire mesh that has gaps small enough so that the rabbits can't get their heads stuck in it. Steel works well, but there are many safe varieties (just make sure it is not lead).
You will also need enough wood to build the frame you have designed. While the size of the lumber doesn't really matter, it may be easiest to get basic 2 x 4 lumber from your local lumberyard or home improvement center. Add up all of the measurements from your design in order to figure out how much lumber you will need to build the cage frame.
You will also need a tight metal mesh for the bottom of your cage. While much of the floor will be covered in natural bedding material, such as hay, the floor underneath should not be solid. One reason for this is that a mesh floor allows urine to leave the cage, so your rabbit isn't sitting in it.
Materials for the roof should include plywood, roofing material, and hinges to attach the roof to the box of the cage. You will also need additional plywood to build a few solid walls on the cage.
Alternatively, you can buy an all wire cage from a pet store and then build a frame around it. This will allow you to completely remove the wire cage from the frame in order to clean it.Some sources even suggest using wood pallets as the wood for your cage. You will need to take the pallet apart and reuse the pieces., Take the measurement of each piece from your design and then cut a corresponding piece of lumber. It may be easiest to number each piece on your design and then put the matching number on the pieces of lumber after you cut them.

, Work in an organized fashion. You can build the box of the cage first and then attach it to the supports it will sit on afterwords. Start with the box, fastening the pieces of lumber together with screws, so that the finished box is the size you desired.


Then build the supports for the box to sit on, making sure that it is tall enough and sturdy enough to keep the box, and bunnies, upright.
Remember that you should have an area that has solid sides, so that the rabbits can get away from cold weather and have a cozy place to sleep., Make sure to cut the pieces of mesh so that they cover each opening in the frame you built completely. You should have four side pieces and one floor piece. Once you have cut all the pieces, grab a staple gun and start attaching the wire.


Make sure the rabbits can't slip through the gaps in the staples.
If you decided to buy a pre-made wire cage, simply slip it into the frame that you built. Make sure that the wire cage is secure and fits correctly., Your solid walls should be made of plywood and can be screwed directly to the framing of the cage on the outside. Your cage will need a few solid walls. The sleeping area of the hutch should have solid walls, so that your bunny can snuggle in and keep warm when the weather is cold.


You should also put a solid wall between the main area of the cage and the rabbit's sleeping area. This will ensure that the sleeping area is a completely protected space. You can use plywood for this wall as well but you will need to cut an opening in it that the bunny can easily get through.

, Cut your plywood to completely cover the top of the cage. Screw the hinges onto the plywood and then onto the frame.Add roofing material to the top of the roof, making sure that the roof will be water tight.


You may want to put a security latch on the roof. This will keep the roof from blowing up in a strong wind or predators from opening up the top of the cage and getting your rabbits.

, Toys and other amenities are a plus that will help the rabbit thrive.


Once the hutch is all set up you can place the rabbit into its new cage.

Find the right size cage.,
Get an indoor rabbit cage.,
Build a bunny condo.,
Try a puppy pen for your rabbit.,
Have a free range rabbit in a bunny-proofed room.",How to Choose a Rabbit Cage1," Different sized rabbits need different sized cages. Make sure the cage you choose is spacious enough for your particular rabbit.Cages should be at least fourteen inches in height or enough height so the rabbit is able to sit upright without banging her head.
Have roughly five square feet of space in the cage for your rabbit. For smaller rabbits, you may need less, but they should have plenty of space to run around.
Provide enough extra space for your rabbit's toys, litter box, food, and water. These should not count towards the five square feet of space needed for your rabbit to run around.;
, Indoor rabbit cages can often be restrictive for your rabbit. Make sure you have enough space in the cage for your rabbit. You should also be able to leave the cage open so he can get plenty of exercise.Give your rabbit enough space in his cage. There needs to be enough room for him to move around in the cage and lie down. The minimum size is three hops long and two hops wide. Of course, the bigger the cage, the better it will be for your rabbit.
Make sure your rabbit has space for food, water, a litter box, and toys. He will need things to do and to eat and drink in his cage.
Try a cage with a front door for your rabbit. Purchase a cage that opens either from the inside and/or outside. Cages with doors that open out enable your rabbit to come and go when he wants, whereas doors that only push in mean you have to get the rabbit out of the cage yourself.
Make sure your cage has protection for the rabbit’s feet. Cage flooring can injure the rabbit’s feet, so provide soft material that can cover the cage flooring, such as an old blanket or towel., Bunny condos are bigger cages that give your rabbit space to run around. You can make a bunny condo out of a variety of materials, including wood, metal, or old furniture.


Think about what potential materials you may have already around the house. You can make a bunny condo from a variety of used materials.
Use wire storage cubes, which are available at most retailers. This can be an inexpensive way to build a bunny condo, though it may take some time to complete.Avoid chicken wire, since rabbits can chew the wire. If they chew chicken wire, rabbits can hurt themselves.
Keep metal slats close together so your rabbit will not get stuck. She may put her head through and not be able to escape, leading to to injury or possible strangulation.

, Puppy pens are fences that give your rabbits a wide range to run around. They provide your rabbit space inside and allow him to move around wherever he wishes.A puppy pen can be good to give your rabbit more space. It's more open than a regular cage and less work to make than a bunny condo.
Puppy pens are available at most pet stores. They do not usually have a top, but enable your rabbit to roam around inside the pen.
Get a puppy pen that is high enough so your rabbit cannot leap over the top. Over 36 inches (91.4 cm) is ideal to keep your rabbit from hopping away.
Using a puppy pen can be good if you’re trying to get your rabbit used to being in open spaces before giving him free range. This will reduce his stress and make sure he is not overwhelmed by too much space.

, Free range rabbits can roam around the home and have plenty of space to exercise. Make sure your home is safe for rabbits by bunny-proofing your home.Bunny-proof your home. Conceal any drapes, rugs, or electrical cords that rabbits could choke on or hurt themselves with. If you can’t bunny-proof the entire home, consider keeping your rabbit only in one room that you can bunny-proof.
Put electrical cords in vinyl tubing to make sure your free range rabbit will not hurt herself on electrical cords.
Introduce your free range rabbit slowly to other pets. They should get along (if the bunny doesn't consider it as a predator), but be sure to supervise at first.

Plan out the design.,
Gather and cut your plywood.,
Gather and cut your wire mesh.,
Review the remaining supplies.",How to Build a Rabbit Hutch1," Standard rabbit hutches are made with wood and wire and can vary in shape and size depending on your preferences and how many rabbits you’ll be keeping. There’s no one way to design a hutch but here are some things to keep in mind:The rabbit should at least have enough room to sit up on its back legs and stretch out.
The cage should be roughly 4 times the size of your rabbit at the very least. Keep in mind the age of your rabbit and how much it will continue to grow.
Hutches are typically divided into at least two sections in order to give the rabbits sleeping areas that are separated from the other area(s).
If it’s an outdoor hutch, it should be built on legs that are at least 4 feet (1.2 m) tall, so that they cannot be easily reached by predators.;
, You will need at least 2 large pieces of plywood. The dimensions will vary depending on the size of the hutch you’d like to build

For example, two pieces of plywood with measurements of 24”x72”x3/4” would be adequate for building a hutch that’s meant for up to three rabbits.






Unless you order pieces of plywood that are to your exact specifications, expect to do some cutting, most likely with a power saw.







, In order to build your own cage, you’re going to need some good wire. Here are some things to consider:

Chicken wire will not be strong enough to house rabbits and keep out predators.






Use 14 or 16-gauge galvanized wire, preferably made specifically for rabbit or bird housing.






The mesh for the top and sides of the cage should be 1”x2” or 1”x1”, but the floor wire should be approximately ½”x1” so that it can support the rabbit’s feet.






Be sure to have a good pair of wire cutters and gloves. A Dremel tool or metal file will also be needed to remove any sharp protrusions from the wire.






Rabbit wire can be purchased from most rabbit cage suppliers, and can be purchased in full rolls of 50’ to 100’ or can be cut to your specifications.
You may also want to consider purchasing a pre-made rabbit cage and simply building the frame around it.

, Other supplies will be discussed in further sections, but at this time you may also want to consider some recommended, though not necessary additions.


Drop trays aren’t mandatory, but they’ll make cleaning beneath the rabbit hutch a much more pleasant experience. They also add some extra protection from the bottom of the cage.
Roofing material such as shingles, plastic, metal, etc will add extra protection from the elements and will make your hutch last longer.

Find an outdoor cage for your rabbit.,
Keep your rabbit safe from predators.,
Make sure your rabbit is warm enough outdoors.,
Interact with your rabbit on a daily basis.",How to Choose a Rabbit Cage2," Outdoor cages for rabbits are often hutches, which are raised cages that keep your rabbit off the ground. Give your rabbit plenty of space, while also providing him with protection from predators and weather.A hutch should be stable and high off the ground.
Consider a wire floor cage with a mat or other flat service for the rabbit’s feet. Wire floors can make sure feces or urine can drop through to the ground or to pans below. Never house a rabbit directly onto a wire floor as this causes a painful condition called sore hocks — make sure you provide a soft surface for him to stand on.
Have enough space in your rabbit’s outdoor cage. He should be able to stand up without his ears touching the roof, stretch, and be able to hop. The bigger the cage, the better it will be for your rabbit., Outdoor cages expose your rabbit to potential predators, including cats, dogs, birds, and raccoons. Your outdoor rabbit cage needs to be off the ground and provide your rabbit with somewhere to hide if she gets frightened by predators.


Place the rabbit hutch high above the ground. Don’t make it so tall that the rabbit gets frightened, but the hutch should be tall enough for the rabbit to feel distance from any potential predators that approach the hutch.
Give the rabbit a shelter, such as a small box or travel carrier where she can hide. Rabbits may get frightened if approached by predators, so she will need somewhere to conceal herself.
Keep the top of your rabbit’s outdoor cage enclosed. Open cages are not good outdoors, since birds, cats, and raccoons can easily get into a cage with an open top.

, Rabbits are mammals and need to regulate their body temperature. Give him plenty of shelter outdoors if you choose an outdoor cage. If you live in an especially cold environment, it’s probably not a good idea to keep a rabbit outdoors.Provide your rabbit with a warm blanket or rug. Make sure the blanket is thick enough to keep the rabbit warm when the outdoor temperature is very cold.
Place a small shelter in your rabbit’s cage. It should be concealed from the elements and give the rabbit a way to avoid cold and precipitation.
Don’t keep a rabbit outdoors if you live in a colder environment. Outdoor rabbits can freeze to death if exposed. Consider keeping the rabbit indoors if it’s too cold where you live.

, Rabbits need plenty of attention, especially if they are living outdoors in a cage. Make sure to pet or play with the rabbit every day if she lives outside.Don’t pick up the rabbit abruptly. Since they are prey animals, rabbits may think you are a predator and become frightened.
Sit on the ground and wait for your rabbit to come to you. Your rabbit may like being petted, but not picked up.
Give your rabbit plenty of exercise outside of the cage. Rabbits need 20–40 hours of exercise per week. They like to explore, so make sure to keep an eye on your rabbit when she is exploring.
If you do pick up your rabbit, place one hand under her rib cage and another under her bottom, so the rabbit can’t kick. This will protect you from her powerful legs and nails. It will also make sure your rabbit is adequately supported.

"
"
Give your rabbit a litter box.,
Make sure your rabbit has plenty of toys.,
Put a water bottle or crock in his cage.",How to Choose a Rabbit Cage3," Most rabbits need a litter box, especially if they are an indoor rabbit. There are a variety of a litter boxes, so choose the best one that provide for your rabbit’s housetraining needs.


Start with a simple rectangular litter box. Choose a size that doesn’t crowd the cage and still gives the rabbit plenty of space to hop around.
Find a small, medium, large, or extra large litter box based on the size of you rabbit. Smaller rabbits may need a small litter box, since they may not be able to hop in and out of larger ones.
Use newspaper between the litter and the box itself. This can help limit the amount of expensive litter you need to purchase. Watch to see if the rabbit chews the newspaper, since you may want to get rid of it if that’s the case.
Clean the litter box regularly. Negotiate how often to clean it, since a dirty litter box can turn off the rabbit from using it. However, if you clean the litter box too often, the rabbit may think he is not supposed to use the litter box.

, Rabbits are playful creatures who like to chew, toss, dig, and explore. Provide your rabbit with stimulating toys so she will not get bored while she is in a cage.Supervise your rabbit when she is playing. Any toy can be dangerous, so make sure your rabbit does not get hurt.
Rabbits like to chew, so cardboard, wicker, and hay are fun for rabbits. Be careful that they do not have any chemicals such as varnish on them when you give them to your rabbit.
Find toys that you can toss around the cage. Rabbits are interested in movement and like to explore things that move.
Look for toys that dispense food. This will encourage rabbits to keep playing with fun toys that give her something to eat.
Old towels can also be a fun toy for rabbits. Observe the rabbit to make sure she does not eat towels or any of the above toys.
Toys bring you and your rabbit closer together. Having playtime with toys will form a closer bond with your rabbit.

, Rabbits need water on a regular basis, so you need to have water available to them all the time. Choose either a crock or water bottle for your rabbit. Some rabbits prefer one or the other, but either one should work well for your rabbit.Crocks are small ceramic bowls that you can put water in. Choose a crock that’s sturdy and won’t tip over.
Cleaning crocks can sometimes be a pain. Since the crock sits on the floor of the cage, it can get dirty. Make sure to clean your rabbit’s crock regularly.
Throw out any crocks that have chips or cracks, since they can potentially injure rabbits if they ingest chips from the broken crock.
Water bottles are another option for your rabbit’s cage. They are usually suspended from your rabbit’s cage, so you can avoid much of the cleaning involved with crocks.
Suspended water bottles usually need to be refilled about once a day. Inspect the bottle carefully when you refill it to make sure there are no leaks.

Collect all the materials you will need.,
Open the shelving system and review the contents.,
Connect 2 wire panels with 2 connectors, as shown,  making a corner.,
Connect the four corners created above to form a square with two panels on each side.,
Build a platform for the rabbit to jump onto.,
Extend the walls upward by assembling more panels above the perimeter panels.,
Place the enclosure at the desired location in your home.,
Place the dish tub in a corner of the enclosure under the shelf.,
Lay the blanket or towels across the shelf.,
Place the food and water bowls on the floor of the cage.,
Recheck all connections in the sides of the cage.,
Introduce your rabbit to his or her new home.",How to Build an Indoor Rabbit Cage," The wire cube shelving system is the most important, as this will form the walls of the enclosure. The amount you'll need will vary depending on the size of your enclosure. One package of 16 squares is enough for an enclosure 30x30x30 in big, but two packages will create a much more spacious and comfortable enclosure. Buy these shelves from Target, Walmart, or a similar store, or find them online. The rest of the materials you can buy from your pet store or find in your house.;
, You should have at least 16 squares of wire shelving and plenty of connectors to tie different squares together at the corners. Practice assembling them to get an understanding of how they work together.

, At this point you will need to decide how large you will make the enclosure. This article will show an enclosure 2 panels in each direction, but to make a larger or smaller enclosure is quite easy. Simply use more or less panels in each direction until you have the desired size.


Repeat this step three times to create a total of four corners.

, This will use a total of eight wire panels and 16 connectors. If you want a larger enclosure or an enclosure of a different shape, continue connecting panels together until you have the shape you desire. 

, Use two panels to form the platform, placing them horizontally, one panel high, over half the inside of the cage. Place one more panel vertically, underneath the center of the shelf, to support it.

, This will double the height of your enclosure to ensure that your rabbit will remain safely inside.


If your rabbit does not jump very high, you can skip this step. However, to make sure the enclosure will keep your rabbit safe, and to give your rabbit a little more space and freedom, it's generally better to make the cage taller.

, Choose somewhere with enough light and air to keep your rabbit happy, but make sure it's out of the way of your family so that people aren't constantly running into or tripping over it. Make sure to put the enclosure on a surface that will support it. For example, putting it on a plush carpet floor might make your rabbit happy but will very quickly dirty the carpet beyond all recognition.

, This will be your rabbit's litter box.

, The spacing between the wires of the panels is often not close enough to allow the rabbit to use it as floor. Using the towel to cover the panels allows for a comfortable place to sleep, relax, and eat.

, Do not place them onto the shelf. This will limit the mess that could be made from spilled bowls.

, A sturdy construction will ensure that the rabbit is enclosed when wanted and provide a safe home for your pet. Perform this check periodically to keep your cage safe and prevent your rabbit from escaping.

, Congratulations, you have finished!

Create the basic frame.,
Attach the top and bottom.,
Create a space for the door.,
Attach the door.",How to Build a Rabbit Hutch2," Now that you have your rolls of wire, it’s time to start cutting and building a cage.

From the 1”x2” wire, use wire cutters to cut six pieces to the lengths you require. For example if you were building a cage that was 24”x48’ you would cut 4 pieces at 48” and 2 pieces at 24”.






Cut a piece of your tighter-meshed floor wire as well. Make sure it's the same length as the longer pieces you just cut.






Using C-rings, attach the two smaller pieces of wire you cut to one of the longer pieces in order to create the back and sides of the cage.







, Don’t get carried away and just start attaching everything at once. Remember that you still want to add a divider and leave room for a drop tray.

Take the section of floor wire, the one with the tighter mesh, and use C-rings to attach this to the cage, but not at the very bottom. Attach it about several inches from the very bottom to allow yourself space to add the drop tray.






Attach the front of the cage, again using C-rings






Punch holes in the edges of your divider and attach it with C-rings to the inside of the cage. Make sure your divider leaves enough room for your rabbit to move around freely from area to area.






Put the top on the cage and make sure to attach the divider to this as well.






You can now attach the final piece of wire on the very bottom of the cage, which can be used to hold the drop tray.






Use your wire cutters to cut an opening at the front of the cage so you can slide the drop trays in and out.







, Now you have a great cage, but unfortunately nothing can get in or out.

Cut an opening in the front of the cage and be sure to cover the exposed edges with plastic trim.






From the spare wire that you have left, cut a piece for your door that is slightly bigger than the hole you made in the cage.







, Take the piece of wire that you cut and attach it to the using C-rings so that it adequately covers the opening you created. Attach a latch to make sure that the door stays shut.

Create a frame for the cage to sit on.,
Create the legs.,
Attach the legs to the frame.,
Put the cage in the frame.,
Put the sides on the frame.,
Build the roof.",How to Build a Rabbit Hutch3," You’ve built the interior of your hutch, now it’s time to start fortifying it a little more.

Cut lengths of 2”x4” lumber to measurements that are slightly larger than the cage itself. Remember, the cage has to fit in the frame.






Using hammer and nail, construct the frame around the cage.






Attach metal L-brackets to the inside corners or the frame for the cage to sit on. This will protect the wood from direct contact with cage.







, You can make your hutch as tall as you like, but remember that if you’re putting it outside, you want to keep it about 4 feet (1.2 m) off of the ground to protect the rabbits from predators.

Cut the 2”x4” lumber to your preferred length.






Make sure the legs are all the same length or your hutch will be wobbly.






You can also use larger pieces of wood, like 4”x4” lumber, if you want sturdier legs.







,

Turn the frame upside-down.






Nail the legs to 4 corners of the bottom of the frame. Make sure they are spaced evenly.






Turn the frame right side up and make sure the hutch stands firmly in place.







, You can easily just rest the cage in the frame now, you should be able to remove it with ease.


You can nail the cage to the inside of the frame with braces if you’d like it to remain in the hutch permanently or sit more securely







, Now that the cage is inside the hutch, you need to give it a little more protection.

Measure the sides of your frame and cut two pieces of plywood so that they’ll adequately cover each side.






Nail each side down






Do the same for the back of the hutch.






If you’d like to give your rabbits more ventilation, don’t nail the sides down, but attach them with hinges so that they can be opened and closed.







, You’re almost done! Your rabbits have everything but a roof over their heads.

Measure out and cut a piece of plywood that will completely cover the top of your hutch.






Nail it down securely to the frame.






Add shingles, metal roofing, or plastic to the top of the roof for extra protection.







"
"
Place the rabbit hutch in a safe spot.,
Secure the rabbit hutch in place.,
Prepare the hutch for your rabbits.",How to Build a Rabbit Hutch4," If the hutch will be inside you probably don’t have to worry, but if you put it outside, here are a few things to remember:


Put the hutch in a nice, shady spot where it won’t be to prone to the inclement weather.
Position it where you can easily see it from your home, so you can keep an eye on it.

, Place the hutch on even ground so it’s not in danger of tipping over.

, Your rabbit’s home is just about complete. Now you get to do some interior decorating.

Lay down soft hay or unbleached shredded paper or paper towels to the cage for bedding.






Secure a drip-feed water bottle to one side of the cage and make sure that it’s always filled with fresh water.






You can also attach a food tray, but you can also get away with using a ceramic or stainless steel bowl.






Provide a designated litter area as well. Rabbits tend to use one area only as a bathroom and giving them a set location makes sure that they’re not sleeping in a mess.

Furnish your rabbit’s new condo with rabbit-friendly accessories.",How to Build a Rabbit Condo," Purchase two boxes of wire storage cubes. Once you remove all of the wire mesh grids from the boxes of storage cubes, you’ll know how many you have to use. Each grid square will likely be 13”x13” or 14”x14”depending on the brand you buy.


A common design may consist of front and back walls that are both three grids high and three grids long with the side walls being three grids high and two grids deep.This design gives you space to build two or three levels up for your rabbit without commandeering a large portion of any room.;
, This is the most time consuming portion of the whole project. Build one wall at a time by setting the grids together in your decided formation and zip tie the ends tightly together.Place a zip tie at each end where the two grids come together. This means that a 2x2 set of grids will have four zip ties in the middle where all four squares come together.Don’t forget to build one for the roof of the condo as well.
Make sure each zip tie is tight. Use a pair of pliers for more leverage if you need to.

, You don’t want to leave your rabbit anything hazardous to chew, so you should cut the excess length off each zip tie as closely as possible without breaking the tie.

, Once you have each individual wall built, use the same process with the zip ties but at 90-degree angles to connect the walls and form the entire structure.


You may find it easier to start with the roof on the floor and turn the structure over once all the walls and roof are attached.

, Once you have all of the walls connected, you will need to snip a few ties to make a door for getting your rabbit in and out of the condo. If you clip the ties in an upside-down L going up two grids and across one from the bottom center of the condo, then you’ll easily be able to swing this section open for letting your rabbit out and also getting in to clean the condo.In order to keep your rabbit from pushing the door open once you’ve completed the project and moved your pet in, you can simply use three small spring clamps to hold the door shut.For an even more cost effective option, you can even use something as simple as 1 1/4” binder clips to hold the door shut., You most likely do not want to set the condo on top of your carpet in a room since rabbits tend to be messy. Instead, take the floor measurement of your completed design and purchase a piece of plywood that you can set the condo perfectly on top of.


If you tack short pieces of plywood around 6” high to the outside of the flooring base, the condo will fit inside this lip, which will give it more stability, and it will also keep hay and anything else inside the condo and off the surrounding flooring.If you don’t have access to tools for cutting the plywood, you can take the measurements to the home improvement store where you purchase the material and have them cut it for you.

, Since rabbits may try to gnaw at the wood or, at the very least, soil it, you want to cover the plywood with something a bit more rabbit friendly. A cheap and simple solution is a roll of vinyl shelf liner that will be both easy to install and clean.

, The 1” wooden dowel rods will make a foundation for the upper levels of the condo. You can easily slide the rods in the spaces between the mesh before cutting them to size.


If you plan to make a level that is only one or two grids wide, then you can use two rods (one in front and one in back). If you plan on making a larger level, then you should insert additional support rods.
Use 1” rods or supports because they’re sturdy enough and anything larger might not fit through the mesh in the grids.

, You’ll probably want to cover this piece of plywood with something easily cleaned such as the vinyl shelf liner as well. However, you can always put a towel or something more comfortable for your rabbit on top of the liner.


If you build the second level slightly higher up, you can always use another board as a ramp for your rabbit to reach it, though a hop will suffice in most instances.

, Never place your new rabbit condo in a spot that isn’t rabbit proofed. A corner close to electrical cords, for instance, can still lead to your rabbit chewing on something it shouldn’t.

, If you didn’t add pieces of wood to the flooring base, you can simply place short (maybe 6”) pieces of plywood around the base of the condo at this point to keep hay and other objects inside., If you want your new rabbit condo to be mobile so you can move it between rooms (or even just move it to clean behind it), then you can easily screw castors to the bottom of the piece of flooring plywood.This will make it very easy to roll the condo around.


Make sure there’s a lip around the base to hold the condo in place as you push. Otherwise, you’ll just push the structure off the base.
Ensure that none of the screws penetrate all the way through the floor of the condo since the sharp edges can hurt your rabbit.

, Remember that rabbits will chew just about anything they can reach, so keep the condo free of anything that could be potentially hazardous.

Be unique.,
Be open-minded.,
Find out what you like - your interests and hobbies.,
Love and trust yourself.,
Organize your closet.,
Realize that sometimes, people might not accept you for some of the decisions that belong to you discovering you.,
Be happy - do so without costing others their own happiness.",How to Be Your Own Person," Don't alter your style for the latest fashion; don't purposely oppose it either. Dress how you feel and how you like. If others don't like it, just don't care. It will be hard at first, ignoring them, but if you keep on doing it, they will stop taunting you. This will be a great way to see who your true friends are, because they are the ones who will accept you anyway.;
, Don't shut everyone down before you know them. Don't judge a book by its cover. Check everyone out and see who they truly are, because the odds are that they are also just pretending to be someone they're not and there's someone else inside. Who knows, you just might find you have things in common with people you never even dreamed of.

, If other people that you find ""cool"" likes something you can't stand, don't pretend like you like it as well. You have to respect it, but you don't have to like it. Even people that you have a lot in common with might have that one thing they like that you don't. But don't forget that no person is exactly like another, so it's alright to befriend these people, because you have enough in common.

, You've accepted that you are different, now you have to love it! Be happy that you're not like every other idiot in your class. Trust yourself before you can trust anyone else. You have to understand the true meaning of trust before you tell just anyone your deepest darkest secret.

, Don't just act original, dress original. If you go to a school with a dress code, try to accessorize or break the rules a little. If you're willing to go to the extreme with your look, go ahead, but you must know the consequences of breaking the rules. Wear what you like. Go through the different groups and styles and take out aspects of them YOU find fashionable and collaborate the different genres to create a style that is you.

, They were to used to the you they wanted to believe really was you, but it wasn't. Do you follow? With this I mostly mean your family. They say that family accepts and loves you unconditionally, no matter what. I've learned from my own experience that family members, especially parents, may not really like the new changes. Don't care. Do whatever you want to do and whatever makes you feel happy*. Don't be stupid and do illegal crap, but if they fuss about silly stuff, just ignore it. You can't ditch your family, but if they can't take you for you, it won't be a crime to distance yourself from them a little. Your own originality is at stake here. Bottom line, don't let anyone try to run your life and make you what they want you to be. Be who you want to be. Don't take it too far, but it's no problem to be yourself.

Don't reject trends like the plague.,
Look for outfits or pieces of clothing that make you feel good in your own skin, that are comfortable, and that match with your outfit.,
Get some skirts and shorts in any fabric, as long as it is cute.,
Look at vintage trends and analyze them carefully.,
The most important part of stellar style is pre-loved clothes.,
Look online or in some stores for environmentally friendly clothing, and/or clothes that have green messages on them, like ""Save The Whales"".",How to Become Stellar1," Stellar is about individuality, not dressing like everyone else and claiming you are non-conformist.


If you like something, then wear it, but if the style doesn't appeal to you, then you don't have to wear that. If you love that t-shirt in the Abercrombie store, then don't be scared to buy it. On the other hand, if you don't really think that all-natural wool scarf from a non-chain store fits with your style, then you're not obligated to buy it.;
,


Don't worry if you get teased about not wearing something everyone else is sporting.
If your friends are as shallow that they will reject you for your clothes, then they weren't good friends in the first place. #*However, there are some clothing items that every stellar kid can find as a staple of their wardrobe, and will get you recognized as such.

, Look for details that you like. Maybe nice buttons or pockets on the sides, or a belt to go with it. Remember: ""If the shoe fits, wear it!""

, A lot of old fashions can be incorporated into any stellar kid's wardrobe. #*Try long graphic tees. They can be in any colour with a simple picture. They should be long (but not baggy) enough to go past your waist, especially with a wide-necked collar.


Wear any top that is cute, even if it seems mature for your age group, like buttoned-up shirts. Reject people who jump on you (figuratively) calling you a tired, dead stereotype because of one clothing article you're wearing.
Another vintage trend is vests. They are like the ones you see on a waiter in a tux, but tailored to fit a girl. These can go over a t-shirt to give you a laid-back look, and they can come in a few colors like brown and black.
A lot of stellar girls wear leg-warmers, but you should make sure that the wool (or other fabric) is made from an environmentally friendly producer. Remember, being stellar is part of a lifestyle as well as the fashions. These can be worn over basically any type of shoe except sandals and boots, but that is just basic fashion sense.

, These types of clothes look as if they have been already worn by someone, or made by an amateur. The thread might be purposely shown in the stitching in a different color, or there could be different patches of colours or patterns. You can get these from many brands, such as Old Navy. Ask the store manager first or check the label to see what country it was made in to avoid buying sweatshop labour-made clothes.

, A lot of this clothing is made without chemicals in the cotton that speed up the growing process. The chemicals used to do this can be harmful to you, which is another reason to try environmentally friendly clothes.

Be social.,
Be confident.,
Be funny.,
Practice kindness.,
Be a positive person.,
Practice versatility.,
Have fun!,
Be true to your friends.",How to Be Weird and Loud but Not Obnoxious," Be an extrovert, start conversations with others, and socialize. Be talkative, but stop to listen to what others have to say instead of constantly talking over them. Be loud, and talk a lot - but not too much. Be aware of the point where people are starting to get annoyed because they can't get a word in edgewise around you, and then stop talking.;
, With confidence comes charisma, and others naturally flock to people with charisma. Be confident and don't worry about what other people think. Be yourself and love yourself.

, Tell jokes, write funny jokes or stories, or simply be random and spontaneous. Watch funny TV shows to get ideas. If you find something on TV really funny, quote it in front of your friends to make them laugh. Remember not to make jokes at other people's expense - this will hurt their feelings and annoy them, and they'll think that you're obnoxious.

, A sweet, loud person is much more endearing than a mean loud one. Work on being there for your friends, listening to others, and helping with and anticipating their needs. Give gifts, help out a friend who needs a boost, and be there when your loved ones need you. This will make all the difference.

, Be happy and friendly; people don't want to be around people who are negative and who bring them down. Don't complain a lot, be positive! Be nice and friendly to people you just met. Be the kind of person that cheers up others. Always see the glass as half full instead of half empty, and find the positive aspects of every situation.

, Gregariousness is great, but in more serious positions it can be insensitive. Learn to listen well to others, and be serious when you need to.

, Have as much fun as possible. Live in the moment and be carefree. Don't take jokes too seriously yourself. Go to parties, throw parties, go to school dances, go to concerts and have a blast while you're there! Enjoy what life has to offer! Live your life while you can. Have as much fun as a person can possibly have! If you are having fun everyone will have fun too.

, Make a lot of friends, dump the ones who are bad friends, and love the ones who are good. You can never please everybody, so stick with the ones who like you. Get with your friends and be a good friend to them. These are the people who love you for who you are, weird loudness and all!

Know that the music for stellar kids can be whatever you fancy, but most of us stick to indie music, emo, or modern rock.,

Go to Google, and search ""music map _________"", but where the underscore is, put the name of one of your favourite bands.,
Visit Imeem.com.",How to Become Stellar2," Artists like Snow Patrol, Hard-Fi and K.T. Tunstall can help branch out your music tastes. Don't be afraid to listen to something you wouldn't normally!

Understand that everyone's personality is a little bit different.,
Stay who you are.,
Branch out your personality.",How to Become Stellar3," Don't let yourself fall into the mindset that if you are the emo subculture you must always be depressed and sad. Stellar is not about turning into a trend zombie; if fashion and subcultures have gone so far that you have to change your personality to fit in, then that's probably not who you want to be.

, If you're shy, then stay that way; there's nothing wrong with being quiet. It's also called introverted. If you don't want to appear antisocial, then just make sure people know you're shy, not angry or silent. If someone starts talking to you, smile and reply to them, but let them know that you don't want to talk very intimately about yourself.

, If you wouldn't normally do something, i.e. rock climbing, then go outside your comfort zone and try it! You'll probably end up better from the experience. Stellar kids aren't known for being afraid to try something new, which is what the fashion is about.

Get your hair cut choppy.,
Invest in good quality make up.,
Keep lips natural.,
Make your nails a statement.,
Get a more edgier funk for the days you want to wear eyeliner.,
Use straight skirts.,
Wear cool tops.,
Add shoes.,
Accessorise with gaudy, colorful jewelry but use one per outfit.,
If you wear glasses, make sure they're plastic rimmed in black.",How to Look Funky," If you like long hair, give it layers, texture, and chop it up. If you want it short, chop it up. If you don't like choppy, at least get it dyed. It should be black or blonde (one of the two extremes) with one complimenting neon shade accenting it. Straightening looks really good with these two descriptions of hair styles. Put in a little shine serum to make hair look healthy after frying it with dye and the iron. Absolutely no ponytails.


If you want to fully embody this new style, get used to waking up early everyday to shower, style hair, put on makeup, compile a great outfit, get pumped with music, and eat breakfast :) .
To style, add a volumizing mousse when hair is wet because after its dry and straightened it can look limp. Run texturizing cream in hair to create definite pieces/ it brings out the choppiness if you end up styling your hair that way.;
,


Foundation matches your skin color and blush, if any, is nude (so it doesn't detract from your eyes or lips).
Eyes are done electric choosing two bold colors, like cobalt and lime, and playing them on your eyes with half a lid one color and half another. If only wearing eyeliner on eyes, its loud and colored doing the outer rims of the eyes the brightest. Sparkly eyeliner by Pop cosmetics or Urban Decay is great for only eyeliner looks. (By the way, Urban Decay is amazing makeup for the look you're going for. NARS cosmetics has some funky duo eyeshadow like the cobalt and lime and fuchsias and pinks).

, Lips, like your blush and foundation, are close to natural color. To pull off funky makeup, one plays up the eyes or the lips, but never both. You want to look hot, not like a clown.

, Gunmetal silvers, bright greens, dark blues, tangerine oranges, blinding fuchsias, and any other shade; feel free to express your hands. The thing about these colors is they only look good on short rounded nails and they have to be solid, smooth, and unsmudged to work. If they're glossed and neat they look cool if they're not they look like trashy funk.

, Wear skinny jeans - dark denim or color. For hippie funk days, wear ultra flare jeans in lighter washes. For those normal days, boot cuts in fall and winter and slight flare in summer.

, They are great in blacks, silvers, bright reds, and bold blues.

, Tops with peace signs, tops with cartoons, patterned tops, colorful tops. Cool tops that fit well into your outfit and match your shoes and accessories.

, Shoes are contrast black and white, color, shiny, or sequined.

, The point is to look funky but without clashing statements. Colorful or studded belts are awesome, too. Don't forget a cool, colorful hat to finish the look!

, A designer alongside of them is great.

, Don't say anything like ""I'm so weird"" or ""I'm such a freak"". The key to being offbeat is having others think that you think you're completely normal. Be the exact opposite of self-aware. You have no clue how interesting you are!

We all eat, and feel the same spectrum of emotion. However -- we, as individuals are unique. Not one of us is the same as anyone else because we are a combination of experiences, personality, and outlook that no one else has ever had or ever will have. If you want to be unique, congratulations. You already are.


Seriously. Even twins don't share the exact same experiences. Even if they did, the experience would get filtered and interpreted differently in their heads and that's really the only place reality exists. No one has lived your life. No one ever will. So it's all the important to live it for you and to be yourself -- because you are what's unique. That's the concept we'll be exploring.;
, The natural human inclination is to fit in. Ever heard of the Asch conformity experiments? They sit this one poor bloke down in a room where everyone else is in on the joke. Then they hold up two lines: one's the size of, say, your finger; the other is around the size of a ruler. Everyone's asked which one is longer, Those in on the joke say, ""the finger-sized line, obviously."" What does the uninformed soul do? He agrees. He knows it's wrong but he conforms anyway. It's human nature.That was a long-winded way of saying you're going to want to be like everyone else and that's fine. That's the way we're wired. When we're like everyone else, it's safe. It's like going to a restaurant because it's popular -- must be good then, right? Well, maybe, maybe not, but it certainly is a lot easier to make decisions that way. In short, it's fine to go along with the group, but make sure it's the wisest decision.

, Pursuing any label, including unique, is fruitless. That's an egotistical drive to be different, to be better, really. There are a billion other people on this earth that are aiming for abnormal, too. Instead of sealing your fate like that of a hipster (what started off as anti-mainstream slowly became the norm), just aim for you. Whatever it is, it's good and true.


It's easier to pursue no labels when you realize they don't exist. A quick trip to a foreign country will prove this in the first three seconds off the plane. Visit another culture vastly different from yours and see what they deem normal. Or just think about it your head right now. Odds are you can easily come up with a handful of things that would be ""abnormal"" in your society that are totally acceptable in theirs.

, Heads up: this entire article is going to be about making your own decisions and making sure your decisions are your own. In order to do that, you gotta be confident. First thing. If you're second-guessing your every move and looking to other people or things for direction, you're not you. The only thing in this world that is unique is you, so get on that.


Telling someone to be confident is just about as effective as telling someone to disappear in a poof of air. It's a task that takes incredible determination and time. After reading the wikiHow article (if this is a point you need to work on), ask a few friends how they do it and what they did to become more confident. You'll be surprised how many people are working on it.

, This one is hard -- as a human (and especially in today's society), we naturally thrive in a group. But to the extent that it's possible in your own life, see that you can live without plenty of things. For starters, that means no addictive habits. That just takes away from you, controls your urges and controls your emotions. No thank you.


Easy steps to take are throwing out the fashion magazines, not doing things just because your friends want to do them, and finding your own opinions on hot topics instead of relying on the news or your circle to form them for you. However, you could take this much further to mean make your own clothes and cook your own food -- but the definition is up to you.

, This is a fairly abstract concept that has many faces. Take ten minutes to sit back and reflect on what it actually means to you. Do you want to just dress differently than everyone? Do you want to shun the political ideals of your culture? Do you want to have a personality that's so dynamic no one's quite sure how to peg you? What?


Also meditate on the why. If you want to be unique because someone told you to, you're not off to a very good start. This has to be for you. What led you here? What makes you feel like you're not unique? Answering your questions first will lead you on a quicker, more efficient path.

, Alright, because this article is about being you, we gotta find out just who you are. Do you know? Hopefully, because no one else does! What do you value across the board? In friends? In relationships? In products? In human culture?


When you come up with a list of 10 or so things, these are what you should strive to be. These are not labels -- these are good qualities that are important to you. Whether it's honesty, justice, or high-quality denim, it's saying something. It's pointing you in the direction of your uniqueness.

, Another unfortunate aspect of being human is that at some point in our childhood, we become aware of others' judgment. Someone makes fun of our My Little Pony folder and it gets tossed in the trash. This sucks and it's totally unnecessary, but inevitable. We start developing insecurities and they take over. We become afraid of people and their words. Think about how silly that sounds!


Our insecurities force us to play games. Instead of asking that boy or girl if they like us, we end up hinting, teasing, dancing around the topic and driving ourselves crazy. We're afraid of what they might say. If we just asked them, ""Hey, do you like me?"" everything would be simpler and we would probably be happier -- but most of us can't do that out of fear. Fighting this inclination is saying what you want to say, meaning what you say, and doing the things you want to do.
The next time you don't do something because of the presence of someone else, do it (within reason of course -- don't go prance around naked at the Starbucks like no one's there). If someone else is inhibiting you, ask yourself why? Do you have a valid, rational reason? Or is it insecurity keeping you from being you?

, After you've determined your core values, it's time to get to your goals. What do you want to be? What do you want to do? How do you want to feel every day? Now, how might you accomplish these things?


You might think this is superfluous -- maybe you're thinking, ""What do my career goals have to do any of this?"" Again, you're trying to pinpoint you. There is not another person in this universe who looks like you, acts like you, and wants to be a professional cake decorator in Australia and live life as adventurously as possible.
Knowing your goals is the first step to achieving them. It's the first step to giving yourself direction. When you know your goals, you can pursue who you are. That unique you. That you that isn't a reflection of anyone else but you at your true core. Your actual wants and desires as opposed to the ones society tells you to have.

, The keyword here is ""your own."" Okay, two keywords. Try not to be influenced by other people's emotions; spending too much time thinking about other people's thoughts can lead you away from your own. Most emotions are contagious -- how do you actually feel?


Sometimes being around certain people turns us into someone else. Sometimes that's good and sometimes it's bad. On a certain level, though, you should have a red flag going off in your head that's screaming ""this is unnatural."" Does that happen to you? What environments do you find yourself not listening to your own emotions and just going with the room? Pinpoint those. When you pinpoint them, you can do something about it.

, Don't say something for the sake of saying it. Instead, take a moment after a conversation starts to think about what you know and what resonates with you, then begin talking. Try to listen to what other people are saying without being sucked in, and without immediately casting aside their ideas. An engaging debate can be fun, stimulating, and teach you a lot about your own values.


It's tempting to gossip or complain to bond with others. If there's one thing all of us are good at, it's those two things. Think about the negativity though. Do you actually feel that way? Or did that person spin it in a light that made you want to agree? Take in their opinion, but assess it on all sides. Some people can be quite intoxicating -- are they right or are they just charming? Get yourself alone and evaluate your original opinion. If you want to change it, great! That means you're open-minded. Just know why you're changing it!

, Don't give in to peer pressure, whether it be your parents, friends or teachers. Be skeptical and explore ideas for yourself. As the Syfy channel, George Carlin, and a bajillion others have said, ""Question everything."" Whether it's your religion, your take on democracy or your feelings toward Brussels sprouts (maybe you actually like them...), think about it. What was handed to you and what's something you've actually given thought to?


This can be quite disconcerting. You may find that you don't agree with your parent's religion or your country's ideals or all your friends' tastes in music. Know that this will be jarring initially if you do encounter something in your brain that was planted there (imagine realizing you've been ""inceptioned""). But it's challenging and it will lead to growth.

, So we talked about fighting your insecurities and how insecurities lead to games. Those games need to stop! They're a direct result of people telling you how to behave or instilling some worry in you that's keeping you from your actual desired behavior. Instead, take that list of values you have and take a deeper look. How might you act if you embodied those values in all your actions?


By games, if it wasn't clear yet, we mean saying or doing one thing and meaning another. When you say, ""God, I'm so fat. I can't believe it,"" you're actually saying, ""I feel fat. Please tell me I'm not."" Some of these games are asking for attention, some of these games are manipulative, some of these games are just seeking information, but either way, they're not you. So there's no place for them in your uniqueness.

, Avoid trying to dress to please others. If you follow fashion trends that you don't actually like, it will be harder to make connections because you'll be wearing a false shell. Instead, dress to suit your personality and your tastes. Why would you do anything other than that?


Sure, to a certain extent, shopping in stores means adhering to trends. It wouldn't be on the racks if people didn't think it would sell. But you have so many options nowadays, you can assemble a style all your own. You don't have to be hipster, you don't have to be eclectic, you just have to like what you wear because it's you.
Buy things that you like, look good in, and most importantly, need. If you want to be unique, avoid buying clothes just for the label. You'll look like everyone around you, and your clothing won't reflect your personal style or tell others about who you are.

, When the time comes for an opinion (and those times crop up often), standing up for yourself must be done to showcase your individuality. How can you be unique if you don't stand for anything? As Katy Perry eloquently puts it, ""I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything.""


If someone contests your opinions, don't automatically budge. Ask them their reasons for disagreeing -- are they rational? If so, take a moment to think about it. It's possible they're right. Standing up for yourself does not mean you shouldn't be open-minded! Assert yourself initially and analyze the situation. Maybe there is a better way.

, There are gonna be haters. There are always gonna be haters. And that's awesome! Having haters means you're doing something. You're out there and doing something that someone doesn't approve of. Fantastic! How better to do something and be hated than doing nothing at all. And you know what? That's no skin of your nose. Let them handle their negativity. It has nothing to do with you.


As Elbert Hubbard says, “Do nothing. Say nothing. Be nothing.”By being judged, you're on their radar. Being a target means you're not reveling in obscurity. It means you're pursuing you and not blending in. Fan-freaking-tastic.

, In the same way that you should be open-minded to others' opinions, you should be open to new activities! As children, we are often stuck only exploring the world our parents present for us. When we grow up, we need to explore for ourselves, finding what we actually do and do not like. You can't have opinions on things you know nothing about -- and no opinions, no preferences? That's definitely not unique.


Try to do something new every week. Whether it's getting up and doing karaoke, trying that new Palestinian restaurant, or reading a book you would never normally read, do it. You will find things you like and your personality will grow.

, Along with trying new things, learn new things, too! There's an entire world out there that you don't know about (many, actually). Pick up a book that you'd never otherwise give a passing glance. Spend an hour on wikiHow looking at random titles. Expanding your horizons will introduce you to things you didn't even know you enjoyed.


The Internet is an absolutely fantastic resource. There are so many resources out there to start learning. Simple things like ""Today In History"" or Khan Academy can get you started and are totally fun and effortless. The more knowledge you have, the more unique it is to you!

, A while ago we mentioned how haters only exist when we actually do things. We talked about how the haters shouldn't affect us -- now we're talking about actually attracting them. Not purposefully; they'll show up on their own when you do something notable. So make a target of yourself by doing something that puts you out there. Some people will love it and others will hate it. Cool.


You don't have to be a performer. You don't have to be a painter, a writer, or anything that literally puts your work on display (though that would be great). It can be as simple as making your opinions known. Getting your voice heard is something so many people are afraid to do. It doesn't matter how you do it, so long as you do.

, Try a hobby or a sport that you've been wanting to participate in. When you do the things you love, you tend to meet people that are more in tune with you and will be compatible friends in the long run. And you'll be happier, too. All of a sudden everything will seem to jive.


Along the same lines, don't do things you don't enjoy! If your friends want to go dance to techno music while getting schwasted and wearing neon and side ponytails and you're just not feeling it on a Tuesday morning, don't do it. Do your own thing. Maybe you want to spend your Tuesday morning contemplating Picasso's blue period. Maybe you are hungry for waffles. Maybe you want to organize your Tupperware. If you'd enjoy it, go for it. Listen to yourself! Only you know what would make you happy.

For clothes wear bright or neon colors!,
Try dying your hair or temporary dying it.,
Be nice, cheerful, and optimistic.,
Be more outgoing and accepting.,
Accessories are very important!,
If anyone starts giving you a hard time about yourself or your clothes try to ignore them.,
If you can wear make-up then get as many bright eyeshadows as you can!,
Doodle Supplies.,
Be yourself.",How to Be a Rainbow Chick," Anything that draws attention to you (in a good way). Be sure to have a bunch of shirts and even jeans in neon colors! You aren't only limited with your clothes though, if you don't have as many brights as you wish then just add some accessories and brighten yourself with those!;
, Many rainbow chicks have hair as colorful as their clothes and personalities, but don't think that you have to dye your hair. It's your hair so do with it what you like and what you think looks best on you!

, Attitude is one of the most important things! Rainbows aren't mad or sad so try to keep a happy aura with you or if for some reason something is wrong and you just can't help but feel down it's OK. try to talk with someone about whatever it is and when everything is all better shine bright and be happy!

, Don't be mean to someone just because they aren't like you, instead try getting to know them! If they end up being mean then just stop hanging out with them because if you hang out with negative people you will probably be called a 'poser' more often. Also try new things. You never know if you're going to like the new sport that has caught your eye or if that band everyone is talking about is really as great as they say. Don't be afraid of new things.

, You should get headbands, necklaces, rings, earrings, etc... in many different colors! You could also make Kandi bracelets (like Kandi kids or ravers do. Just get bright beads, stretchy string, and some friends together and make a bunch of them!) Don't be limited by what the stores have either you can always try to make some cute and original pieces! All that matters is that you have fun trying to create your next big piece.

, They are either jealous or they aren't very accepting. DON""T EVER CHANGE BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE SAYS TOO! Stay true to yourself and you'll be happier than you would be if you stopped doing what you love.

, Hot topic and Claire's have great selections! Try looking for funky eyeliners too, they come in a lot of colors, mascara does too! The possibilities are endless if you just look in the right places!

, If you're one of the more artistic rainbows then you might want to carry around a book or paper and some writing utensils, even if you're aren't very good at drawing it's a great way to spend time that would otherwise be wasted. Crayons, colored pencils, and markers are some of the cheaper supplies that come in many colors! If you're feeling very artistic then go and try some modeling clay or painting, you never know if it's fun unless you try!

, While some may say you can't be upset, that is wrong! Whoever wrote that must not have been a true rainbow. All people get sad it's normal. If you don't get sad then there is something wrong with you! If you are trying to convert into a rainbow always remember: You can still have emotions when you're a rainbow, but just try to look on the good side! If you didn't get the leading role in the play then try to be happy for whoever did, if you got switched out during a sports game feel good for whoever got put in, etc...

Don't be hung up on what other people think about your style.,
Be a kind, thoughtful and nice person.,
Define your weird.,
Decide how you will reflect your weird and unique style.,
Be self accepting.,
Realize that some people are going to boss you and tell you what you ought to be doing.,
Be quirky and use your humor, wit or charm to be supportive.,
Go ahead, have some quirk-tastic fun!",How to Be Weird and Different," While it does matter what people think about your manners, cooperativeness and thoughtfulness, how you look and the style you choose to adopt isn't their judgment call. Realize that a lot of people would love to be unique and out there but they're so totally afraid of not fitting in that it's just easier to pick on people who do have the courage to be different. Being different is about taking a risk and doing something people don't tend to do on a normal basis.;
, It's a mistake to take a generalist statement about ""be yourself and don't care what others think"" and confuse that for ""if I feel like being a rude schmuck who makes millions on the backs of other people's hard labor, that's okay"". You can be different/weird and unique without being a total trump about it. Don't stoop to the level of other people who act meanly and hate on you; ignore them, smile at them, and wave them off. You don't need to joint the small-minded brigade but you can be polite toward them. And, in general, be a nice person who cares about others and show a supportive and uplifting attitude. Whatever your weird, don't base it on being a mean-head.

, Whatever it is, it must come from within and be something you are personally comfortable with. Being weird for the sake of being weird won't work unless it resonates with your sense of humor, personality type and personal quirks. Own your weirdness.


Whatever you define your weird as, it must be something you display at home and out. If you've only the courage to be this way at home, that's fine to begin with but let it branch out in time, so that the world can see your weird too. Grow in confidence and give others the strength to truly be their own selves too by seeing your role modeling.

, Will it be through clothing, your mannerisms, the way you speak, the things you have to say? Maybe it's a combination of these things, maybe it's more than these things. Again, that is something that only you can really discern for yourself.


You're not really going for looks, you're going for attitude. Display your weird attitude in a variety of fun and interesting ways.

, To be different, learn to accept yourself. The thing is that most people do not, and hence are easy prey for the pack mentality because they're too scared to stand out and voice their real opinions. The popular girl at work or school doesn't necessarily have the greatest self-esteem, she's just a great mimic with a louder voice or deeper pocket, enabling her to bend to the will of the masses with greater impact. That doesn't mean she's right or the yardstick by which to measure yourself or anyone else for that matter. Realizing this can help you to be proud of who you are, to shout it out and to stick to being different.

, They're going to tell you in no uncertain terms that you're just not fitting in. These are the alpha conformists, the ones who don't like to see the boat being rocked because they've spent a considerable amount of time, money, effort and lack of thinking on adopting what is socially appropriate as their style. So, if you hear someone say ""you should stop doing that, it's getting really annoying"" or ""stop being so weird, you're creeping me out"", that doesn't mean you should stop being yourself by any means. If you change to fit their needs, you're not being different and you're caving into their idea of what's appropriate. Instead, be alert to their agenda. Stick with your preferences. And be reassured, either others will appreciate your strengths in sticking up for yourself and/or you might just meet someone who likes exactly the weird you're rocking and give you the much-desired support.

, Let others know that quirkiness rules all by showing those who respect your style and difference some love. Connect with those who get you and what you're doing. This gives you support and it frees them to be truer to themselves too.


If someone says to you ""You're weird"", say ""Thank you, we are all going for weird here, and I'm stoked you've noticed!"". Don't apologize or excuse yourself, don't say ""Yeah, I get that a lot"" and don't whimper. Live your weird with pride.
Form a squad of like-minded people. Hang out together, feel good together, be a force of strength together. It's also just a really nice thing to do.

, If you feel like being different is a hard job, or you feel pressured or stressed, it's time to relax! Lay down on the sofa, take a walk, whatever makes you feel comfortable. If it feels too hard, maybe you're trying too hard to reach beyond your real self just for the sake of being even weirder––don't do that. Instead, find your comfort zone within your weird and stick with that. You are free to make changes at any time you like––that's a part of what keeps you free to be who you really are at any stage in your life.

If twee people are happy, they let the world know by wearing a grin and putting a pep in their step. If twee people are sad, they listen to nostalgic mixtapes, cry, drink tea, and go on solemn walks. ""Twee"" is practically synonymous with being open-hearted, so don't be afraid to show the world the way you feel!


Being open-hearted also means being sensitive to the way others make you feel. Twee people's emotions are strongly affected by their relationships with their friends, their families, and especially their significant others. Romance is the source of great joy and heartbreak for twee people, who tend to invest their emotions heavily in their relationships.;
, When most people hear the word ""twee"", they associate it with a sort of extreme, even affected (but not insincere) sweetness. In fact, ""sweet"" is even one of the words used to describe ""twee"" in the Merriam-Webster dictionary.Twee people should aim to be polite, humble, and invested in their interactions with others. In addition, twee people should be conscious of other people's feelings and should hold others' feelings in high importance.

, Twee people are quick to fall in love and are firm believers in love at first sight. The twee-est may harbor innocent, semi-childish crushes for people before they even speak to them for the first time. Twee romance plays out like a high-school fantasy: boy meets girl, boy and girl share an instant connection, boy shows his affection in a cute and modest but memorable way, girl reciprocates, and so on. For twee people, there's no age too old for holding hands at the park, so don't be afraid to be as bashful as a teenager the next time you ask someone out.


Twee people also (stereotypically) tend to be attracted to certain types of people (although, on the other hand, harmless defiance of convention is very twee). As a reference, think of the romantic leads in twee movies, like Zoey Deschanel's Summer Finn in 500 Days of Summer or Woody Allen's Alvy Singer in Annie Hall — intellectual, witty, whimsical, spontaneous, emotionally intense people.

, Twee people don't spend their free time test-driving sports cars, mingling at glamorous night clubs, and going on expensive trips. Instead, they're more likely to enjoy less ""serious"", financially-demanding pursuits. To a twee person, an afternoon spent picnicking in the park, writing in a journal, playing folk songs, or enjoying a cup of coffee at a local cafe is just as appealing (if not more so) than any of the options listed above. When they can, twee people enjoy life's simpler joys — below is just a short sample list of the sorts of things twee people might be caught doing on a day off:


Hiking
Browsing the selection at a record store
Writing and/or practicing their own music
Making a mixtape for a friend or crush
Watching old movies
Writing their own literature or nonfiction
Enjoying local sights and sounds with their significant other

, To twee people, many traditional ideas about adulthood are outdated, misguided, or flat-out wrong. Being an adult doesn't necessarily mean acting overly serious or abandoning one's passions in favor of a stable career to a twee person. In addition, the time after graduating college isn't necessarily an invitation to start ""acting like an grown-up"" — though twee adults obviously need to practice responsible decision-making to be able to hold down a job and/or raise a family, they often pride themselves on their ability to retain some of their positive childish traits as they grow up. This can include:


Having a mischievous sense of humor
Having a somewhat dainty, non-conventional sense of style
Enjoying childish hobbies and past-times
Having an innocent, wide-eyed appreciation for the world

, Like the members of many other modern subcultures, twee people prefer to do their shopping at vintage, retro, and thrift stores rather than at new clothing stores. These stores have two big advantages — they save money, which can be tight for someone who has a stereotypically twee profession (like ""card writer"" — see Her and 500 Days of Summer) and they also sell old, worn, and out-of-fashion clothes, which make up the majority of a twee person's wardrobe.


In general, the goal of twee fashion is to cultivate a ""retro"", endearingly gawky aesthetic.There are many different ways to do this — read on for more info.

, Twee people love their accessories. To a twee person, each accessory is a chance to add a new bit of retro, ""cool-but-uncool"" flavor to their outfit. Look for unconventional or out-of fashion belts, jewelry, purses, backpacks, shoes, and more to give the perfect finishing touches to your twee ensemble.


In addition, you'll want to wear glasses if you can. These classic twee accessories instantly can give almost anyone a bookish, intellectual look, making them the perfect complement to any twee outfit. When possible, go with older styles of glasses like horn rims, wayfarers, and so on.

, It's only natural that, with tastes that favor intellectual pursuits, twee people can tend to dress in a way that's somewhat nerdy. There's a big difference between wearing a pocket protector and being ""twee-nerdy"", however — while ""ordinary"" nerd style usually comes about when someone inadvertently wears something unflattering, ""twee-nerdy"" style is completely intentional and, thus, can look pretty chic. Below are just a few nerdy fashion ideas:


For men: Skinny jeans or colored chinos, vintage printed shirts with dorky patterns (tucked in), older formal wear.
For women: Skirts/jumpers, gawky glasses, plastic barrettes, tops with dorky prints, ""librarian-esque"" outfits.

, For the twee person who's into the outdoors, nerdy clothes may not be the best fit. In this case, it's time to fully embrace the twee love of autumnal fashion choices. Beards, sweaters, and knitted items dominate twee outdoors fashion. Just a few outfit ideas are:


For men: Beards, plaid shirts, flannel, over-sized jackets, band tees, bomber jackets.
For women: Scarves, floral dresses, sun hats, knitted skirts, boots.
For both: Shirts with cute animal prints, leather/knitted belts and accessories, poorly-sized sweaters and cardigans, almost anything bought from Etsy.

, Retro chic is a huge part of twee fashion — if it's not fashionable to wear a certain piece of clothing today, there's a decent chance that it can be incorporated into a twee outfit. For the best outfits, look for bold retro pieces that compliment your natural look. Below are just a few ideas to get you started:For women: Vintage leather shoes, non-black dress pants, embroidered shirts.
For women: ""Sailor"" tops, old-fashioned stockings, tops with frilly lace collars, button-up skirts, vintage leather belts.
For both: Faded tees (twee band tees are best), anything with conspicuous buttons.

, Twee people love their music. Stereotypically, twee people show a preference for a certain sweet, wistful style of rock/pop music that became popular in the late 80s and early 90s. Just a few of the artists that are generally considered to be part of the twee ""canon"" are:Belle and Sebastian
The Pains of Being Pure at Heart
The Vaselines
Calvin Johnson
Peter, Bjorn, and John.
Any artist on NME’s Classic C86 mixtape
For maximum twee-ness, you'll probably also want to listen to your own custom mixtapes — or, better yet, ones your crushes have made for you. If you don't know where to start, try checking twee discussion sites like Twee.net for user-submitted playlists., Twee people often like to consider themselves as being well-read, so a twee person will usually be quick to discuss their favorite pieces of literature and show off their book collection. A twee person's tastes in literature will (stereotypically) reflect their emotional nature and childlike curiosity for the world around them. Just a few samples of twee reading material include:



The Catcher in the Rye (a twee classic)
Dave Eggers, Miranda July, Arundhati Roy, and other modern twee masters
Esoteric non-fiction (e.g., books about obscure historical events, nature, etc.)
Whimsical children’s books (Where the Wild Things Are, etc.)

, Though the term ""twee"" may not often be used on the silver screen, certain movies are indelibly associated with the twee lifestyle. These movies usually portray quirky romances and/or a character's struggle with his or her looming adulthood and often use both comedy and drama to achieve a bittersweet tone. Below is just a short list of movies that are often considered to either be ""twee"" or to portray twee characters:


Nearly all Wes Anderson movies
Most Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg-starring movies (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, The Squid and the Whale, etc.)
Most Zoey Deschanel-starring movies (500 Days of Summer, etc.)
Most indie (or indie-style) romances and comedies (Juno, Garden State, etc.)
Older movies that share themes with the ones above (Annie Hall, The Graduate, etc.)

, Twee people take pleasure in designing the aesthetics of their living space to reflect their twee tastes. The rooms of twee people are their ""sanctuaries"" of twee-ness — places where they can be immersed in their twee interests. Try adding some of the following touches to your room to make it a little more twee:


Retro/out-of-fashion furniture
Lots of books and/or vinyl records
Old-fashioned wallpaper or pastel-colored paints
Posters, etc. for twee media
Somewhat childish flourishes (bunk beds, etc.)
When in doubt, use bedrooms as portrayed in Wes Anderson movies as style guides — the director's aesthetic is unmistakably twee., As noted above, twee people tend to enjoy simple, yet satisfying pursuits. Typical twee hobbies are delightfully whimsical — sometimes even bizarrely formal. Most of all, however, twee hobbies are natural expressions of the participant's twee sensibilities. Just a few twee hobby ideas include:


Tea parties
Art exhibitions
Twee music concerts
Picnics/hikes
Wine tastings
Indie film screenings
Browsing libraries

You have to be comfortable with expressing your individuality, wearing what makes you feel good, saying what’s on your mind, and generally living life the way you want to live it. If you can’t stop trying to satisfy other people or to do what you think other people expect you to do, then you won’t ever be strange.


Of course, it can feel easier said than done to stop caring what other people think about you, and you won’t be able to do it overnight. Still, you can take steps to start doing your own thing little by little, until you find that one day you’re no longer worrying about what anyone else will say about it.
One way to make it easier to do this is to hang out with people who don’t judge you for marching to the beat of your own drummer and who make you feel comfortable with doing whatever suits you.;
, Though you may want to be strange, there’s no need for you to dye your hair pink, start wearing a hula skirt, or to yodel at the top of your lungs in the middle of class—unless, of course, that’s really what you want to do! You can find your own way to be strange without making it look like you’re trying too hard. Focus on doing what feels right instead of on making an impression.


If you try too hard to be different, then you may not feel like you’re being true to yourself. Of course, if you really do want to be completely random and shocking, then you should feel comfortable going for it.

, Though you may think that people who are strange are loners, misfits, or generally unhappy people, it takes real confidence to truly be okay with being strange. If you want to step outside the box and be strange, then you should make sure that you’re happy with who you are and what you have to offer. You have to be secure in yourself first before you go out on a limb and put yourself out there, or you will be disappointed if people don’t react the way you hoped they would.


Work on loving yourself for who you are and on being proud of your strengths. Make a list of all of the things you’re good at and be pleased with yourself for that success.
Being confident doesn’t mean being perfect. It means being happy with your strengths while also embracing your flaws and working to improve wherever you can. If there are parts of you that you don’t like but can’t change, such as your height, then you should work on accepting those if you want to be truly confident.
Though confidence doesn’t come overnight, you can take steps to build it. One thing you can do is to have absolute confidence in your body language. Work on standing tall, making eye contact, and avoiding slouching or looking at the ground.

, If you truly want to be strange, then you have to be comfortable with being an individual. This means having your own fashion, your own tastes, and your own ideas instead of following someone else’s ideas of what strange or normal may be. You have to be able to confidently voice your own opinions, be ready to disagree with the popular trends, and to generally assert yourself even when it would be easier to stay quiet.


If you’re a true individual, then you’re prepared to be a complicated person with many sides. You don’t need to be perfect to be your own person and should feel comfortable admitting your mistakes.
Being an individual means not being a follower or being part of a crowd. Though you don’t need to be a loner, if you’re just doing what a lot of other quirky or different people are doing, then you’re not really being an individual.

, If you want to be strange, then you have to have enough knowledge to be able to know random things about random subjects, and to surprise your friends with tidbits of information when they least expect it. Whether you like comic books, geology, Japanese, or any other subject, read up on it as much as you can so you feel armed with knowledge and facts when you face the world.


If you’re well-read and know what’s going on in the world, then this will give your strangeness more legitimacy. You don’t know want it to look like you’re being weird just for the sake of being weird without having the knowledge to back it up.

, One thing that most strange people have in common is that they’re not shy. They’re happy to talk to new people, to share their thoughts with people they don’t know that well, to try new things, and to be open about their feelings. If you’re too quiet to give people a sense of your personality, then it’ll be hard to be strange. Of course, there’s something to be said for the dark, brooding strange type, but if you want to truly be strange, then you have to reveal enough of yourself for people to get a sense of who you are.


You don’t need to be chatty or energetic; you just have to be open enough to share your thoughts, however strange they may be.

, People who are strange are known to do things that nobody expects. Whether you’re in a group or out by yourself, if you want to be strange, then you have to be ready to surprise people. You can be as spontaneous as you want and know that you can totally shock people when they least expect it if you want to be strange. Remember that, if you’re ordinary, then people feel like they can predict whatever you’re going to do next. Here are some ways to completely do the unexpected:


If you feel inspired, burst into a song and dance
Start quoting from your favorite movie or book
Tell people a surprising fact about yourself
Surprise people with your ability to play an instrument, speak a foreign language, or perform a card trick
Be completely random. Interrupt your friends in the middle of a conversation to tell them what you had for lunch, or to cite a funny fact about your favorite movie.

, Strange people also don’t tend to be the most social creatures in the world. If you want to be strange, then you have to make an effort to be awkward whenever you can. The general rule is that people who are strange are that way because they don’t follow societal norms. One way that they go against the grain is by not interacting normally with many people. This can come off as awkward behavior, and you can easily pull it off. Here are some great ways to be awkward:


When someone comes up and starts talking to you, walk away without explanation.
Retell the same story three times in one conversation and then apologize afterward every time.
Tell overly personal stories to people you just met.
Burp in public without excusing yourself.
Stutter and mumble a lot.
Whenever there’s a short silence, cry, “Awkward!”
Talk to complete strangers, even when they’re obviously busy.

, If you want to be strange, then you can’t just do what everyone else around you does in your spare time. Though you don’t have to try new activities just because they’re weird, if you want to be different, then you have to go away from the mainstream. Part of being strange is the willingness to try new things that would not appeal to most people. It can also mean trying things that are fun and quirky and a bit out of the ordinary. Here are some fun activities you can try that would set you apart from the mainstream:


Learning magic tricks
Writing your own comic books
Playing the ukulele or the banjo
Learning the art of face painting
Learning a hard-to-master foreign language

, Though there are different ways to be strange, from being the loner strange type to the quirky strange type, one way to be strange is to have an extra energy that most people don’t possess. This energy will allow you to share your interests, to be more active than most people, and to have the will to share random facts and information with the people around you. If you want to be strange, then being highly energetic is one approach to take.


When you’re really excited about something, try talking a mile a minute. One way people can be strange is because they don’t talk the same way as other people.
Don’t be afraid to share your excitement about something. Don’t play it cool and and act less enthusiastic about a subject than you want to be.
If you feel like bouncing around or being extra active, even if that means doing jumping jacks in the middle of a conversation, then no one is stopping you.

, For instance, tell your friends that the ceiling is distracting. Elaborate and say, ""It just like... sits up there"" in an awkward tone. Keep staring at it with wide eyes and act utterly transfixed. Ignore anything your friends or the people around you say for a few minutes. The more ordinary the object that you’re mesmerized by, the better.

, Though you don’t need to dress completely wacky just to be different, you can start dressing in a way that makes you feel a little bit less like everybody else. You don’t need to wear a long trenchcoat or a shiny pink dress with sparkly heels if you don’t feel like it, but you should put yourself out there and wear graphic tees, brightly-colored jeans, fun hair accessories, a unique amount of makeup, or just something that makes you look and feel differently while still being you if you want your appearance to immediately signal that there’s something different about you.


Have a weird hairdo to match your clothes if you want to. Use the stiffest hair gel you can find. Spike your hair straight up, or invent a cool, strange hairstyle. This is all about imagination.

, Carry it around and talk to it like it was your pal. Make sure you act like the object really is your best friend and that anyone who tries to tell you that you’re talking to an object is crazy. Look really shocked, angry, or hurt when someone tries to point out that you’re not acting normally.

, Make up your own words to throw in as you speak in the odd accent. When asked where you're from, say Alaska. Most importantly, make the accent viable; don't just mumble your way through. If you’re really convincing, then this will really confuse people and will make them think you’re strange. Make sure not to fall out of the accent the whole time you’re around that person.

, Just take a seat and clasp your hands together and close your eyes. You'll be awed by the reaction. If someone tries to stop you, just shush them and tell them you’re in the middle of an important meeting.

, Throw a fit at a fancy restaurant because you want chicken fingers and apple juice. While waiting for your food, you should grab the fork and knife and clench them in your fists, keeping the sharp-sides up, and then bang the bottom of your silverware on the table continuously. (For variety, throw in your own personal beat or drum line.)

, Then make weird noises and shapes with your hand and twitch your head. This will definitely make you look strange. You should only do this if it’s fun for you and if it doesn’t feel like you’re putting on too much of a show.

, Try selling them at school or giving them away as gifts. Even if it’s something very simple and obviously shoddy, make it look like you really put a lot of thought and effort into it.

, Pretend as if you are floating in an another planet. Just act as dreamy and out of it as possible, and it won’t take long for people to think you’re truly strange.

, Even if they have a boring or short name (i.e. Jane), think of something off-the-wall (i.e. Janey-Jane)! It’s even better if the person obviously does not like the nickname, or if you don’t know the person nearly well enough to give them a nickname. You can even try to invent a nickname for yourself and keep trying, without success, to get it to stick.

, This is yet another way to be completely random and to make people see that you’re strange. If it’s a quiet moment or someone has just told a serious or touching story, then this will be especially effective. You can even try humming to yourself in the middle of a test until your teacher and the surrounding students notice what you’re doing.


If humming or singing at odd times isn’t doing it for you, you can try gobbling like a turkey when it’s especially quiet. This will work particularly well around Thanksgiving!

, This is another way to instantly look strange. For example, you can go to a wall, sniff it, and say a random thing, such as, “Hmmm...minty.” You can even try to smell other people’s hair, though this will freak them out or come off as offensive. You can also smell yourself, if you want to make things awkward.

, This is another way to show people that you’re decidedly strange. Act like you just had some sort of a dancing spasm and that you’re just trying to walk it off. If people look at you funny or ask what you’re doing, just act like you have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about.

Get the rainbow attitude.,
Learn the lingo.,
Get the look.,
Take pictures of yourself to show off your style.,
Claire's and Hot Topic are good places to visit for Bright Kids stuff.,
Listen to the right music.,
Understand the Rainbow lifestyle.,
Get a portable hand-held game console like a Nintendo DS or PSP.,
Be active in the community of Rainbows.",How to Become Rainbow (the Style)," Express your style and be yourself. Be generous, but don't let people take advantage of you. Some people need to be put in their place; so if someone messes with you, tell them to back off. Be very social and make plenty of friends.;
, It's not hard to learn how Bright Kids talk and text. Don't use abbreviations on Instant Messengers. A few exceptions include ""g2g"" or ""ttyl"", but that's about it. Don't be lazy with your typing.

, Dye your hair different colors of the rainbow. Red, purple and blue are popular. Why not venture? Green and bright orange aren't very popular, but look great, too! Wear skinny-legged jeans in creative colors (avoid blue, black or white) and neon shirts. Wear plenty of bows, write on your bookbags and send people little messages written on your hand.


You can dye you hair platinum blonde or jet black if you're not comfortable with something from the rainbow.







, That's how you can attract more people. Emo, scene, and goth are becoming dated, so we have to spring the world with a new genre!

, Plastic necklaces, rainbow socks and ripped shorts with hanging chains are cool finds. Wear funky sunglasses or Shutter Shades (worn by Kanye West).

, If you want to be a ghetto rainbow, listen to Hip-Hop, Rap, and R&B. Genres for preppy rainbows include, but are not limited to, Sugar-Pop, R&B, and Country. Alternative and Heavy Metal are popular among regular Bright Kids but can be favorites to all types.

, Basically, they listen to music, dance, and are very social. But above all things, Bright Kids love the Internet. Especially social networking sites such as Facebook, Myspace, Bebo etc. Texting, writing poetry and recording original songs to be uploaded. Going to concerts is a popular activity as well.

, Not only are they fun, but they make you look cute whilst playing them in public and they're easily decorated.

, Hang around clubs and meet other Bright Kids! Buy bracelets that are colorful and/or made of candy and trade them around; like Kandi Kids do.

Spend much time alone.,
Be very quiet.,
Wear mysterious clothing like jackets, hoodies and long sleeves, and of dark colors.,
Speak clearly.,
Never reveal your personal life to anybody, be elusive.,

Have something that sets you apart, whether an ability (a talent, being smart, or doing magic tricks) or a piece of clothing, a hair style, etc.,

Be stoic, always.,
Have charisma, and lots of it.,
Take care of yourself: this shows that you love and respect yourself.,
Cultivate your intellect in many areas.,
Find a purpose and stick to it.",How to Be Special and Mysterious," Usually thinking while leaning against a wall, but you must not look sad or depressed, not happy either, just thoughtful. The trick is to always convey the message that you are a self-sufficient individual that doesn't need attention or approval from anybody. You must learn first to live by your own and love yourself a lot. This crucial step will come off alone if you really are an individual who loves his own being.;
, You don't start anything that doesn't need to be started, you don't yell/LOL and you don't get in anybody else's problems. The point is: you don't need attention.

, Not always black though, but maroon, navy and gray are serious and formidable colors. Wear clothes that don't show too much but are comfortable.

, Never talk about irrelevant things (weather, tv shows) or about your issues or your life (trips, family problems), doing this is an attempt to build rapport with a person, which translates to a need of attention and/or approval. Just stick to what is needed to say and give your opinion only if somebody explicitly ask for it or you know it is relevant to speak up, otherwise keep your mouth shut. However, if some person tries to build rapport with you (starts talking with you), talk to them but keep your opinions to yourself, don't argue, let them talk and you just listen. This is the foundation of being mysterious: they never get to know anything about you.

, If somebody ask, deflect the questions with funny or slight-sarcastic remarks, even the infamous “guess” works here, but without looking like a jerk, you don't want the ""jerk"" reputation, you are above that. Don´t talk when it is not needed, be quiet, and participate only when asked or really necessary.

, Get lost for days that nobody knows where have you been, be super smart but never be seen studying or asking for help.

, That certain something must make you stand out but must be acceptable and natural, kinda an ""inborn"" trait (not dyeing your hair green or doing a tattoo on your face). It is important that you stress your individuality but always consistent with your ""I-don't-need-approval"" personality: avoid anything that attracts much attention.

, Never snap at people if they disagree with you. Never yell, look excited or angry while talking with somebody. Never be affected by what a person says to you (be this good or bad).

, This will make you a dominant person and people will respect you. Remember, there is power in the eyes (the soul windows) and a powerful, confident gaze makes you a magnetic person.

, Stoic means never showing too much of ANY (sad or happy) emotion and having a calming and cool disposition even in difficult or stressing situations. This may intimidate the people around you but it shows that you have your emotions under control and that nothing affects you, also, it will make you seem smart. Stoicism will give you Sprezzatura.

, This is a VERY crucial step, without charisma nothing else in this article matters. Charisma comes from the inside, feeling so good with yourself as you are that you don't need approval from the outside, it is an ineffable force that draws people in. And no, you don't need to “smile” or “be kind” to have charisma like those magazines will tell you, Hitler never smiled and he was so charismatic that many people, including generals, businessmen and socialites of all kind threw themselves to his feet. Charisma is neutral, you can be Jesus Christ or Hitler and still have thousands of people willing to be with you and even work for your cause.

, Eat healthy, take showers and wear clean clothes, but don't become vain or self-centered, in fact, be well dressed but have that careless untidy look, it will send contradictory signals which is a powerful trait for guys.

, Yes, intelligence is more powerful than muscles, but never show off, you don't need that.

, The magnetic guys ALWAYS have a purpose in their lives and nothing separates them from that path, may it be their career, being the most powerful super-villain, detective or whatever, they stick to it with all their heart and due to this they excel in it, whatever it is.

Don't reveal too much to other people.,
Don't brag.,
Speak carefully.,
Respond gently and politely when people speak to you.,
End conversations on a cliffhanger.,
Be a good listener.,
Observe people with a slightly amused but benevolent look, as if you find their behavior interesting.

,
Smile often but do not laugh at people's jokes.,
Maintain a colder, teasing expression.,
Don't gossip.,
Leave people wanting more.",How to Be Mysterious and Stand Out," People are interested in mysteries because they want to know more. One key to being mysterious is keeping a rein on your personal information. Share your thoughts only with those people closest to you; it communicates to everyone else that there's more to you than they know.


Basic information can be revealed to people you really know and trust. Even then, don't reveal too much.
Avoid talking about yourself too much. Talk about other things instead.;
, Talking yourself up too much will make you seem vacant and self-absorbed. Instead, let other people notice your accomplishments and talents. When they compliment you or bring it up, smile and say thank you. Avoid going on and on about it.

, Weigh your words. Don't always leap to say everything that comes to mind. This will not only make you seem mysterious but also thoughtful and well-spoken.

, You might be tempted to enhance your air of mysteriousness by not responding, but that will only make you seem snobby. Talking back in a quiet, considered way draws people in and makes them want to engage you more.


Where appropriate, answer questions by saying ""no"" and offering shrugs. People beyond family and intimates do not need serious answers to their questions. Unless someone asks you something like ""do you like my outfit"" etc., which is best to be handled with a less enthusiastic ""sure"". You can't let anyone think you're really into something, but you can't let them think you hate it either.

, To do this, at the end of your talk, add something like ""probably"", ""maybe"" or something like that to add suspension to your conversation, then, simply walk away. This makes the person you are talking to think about what you said. An example: ""I guess we could, but only if____. Probably.""

, Naturally, most people like to talk about themselves. Steer the conversation in that direction, and you can still interact with people without giving away too much about yourself.

,, This shows people that they need to impress you for you to appreciate their humor.

, This means no little squeals or hollering at any small thing. This also means you have to smirk at every other person you see. Not in a mean way, just a ""Nyah nyah"" way. Make it subtle and quick, so the person you smirk at will wonder if she or he really did see you smirk.

, Talking about other people makes your interests seem shallow and boring. Avoiding gossip signals that you're into deeper, more interesting topics and enhances your aura of mystery.

, When you're talking with someone or attending an event, excuse yourself just a little bit before the other person wants you to. It makes them eager to pick up where you left off last time, and leaves them wondering where you have to be.

Work on your hair.,
Pick your clothes wisely.,
Get the accessories.,
Random stuff


Buy a pack of rainbow sharpies and doodle allover everything!",How to Be Totally Funky and Stylish,"


Choppy hair is totally funky! If you're hair is short, layers and side bangs that hang in your eyes are perfect! Long hair, choppy layers around the top and middle will be awesome and accurate for your face. But if this stuff isn't your style, that's totally cool, maybe even chic!
Maybe you strive for some splashy colors in your hair! You could always dye you're whole head hot pink, but, lately, a streak of bright color near your bangs are stylish. Or, you might want natural colors. A couple thin streaks all over your head will look most natural. And if your parents won't let you put color in your hair, you could always just get clip-in colored extensions. They have some really natural looking ones out there, really!
For short haired girls, it's really cute to pull all of your hair back onto a small ponytail in the back, or some short pigtails or braids on the side. Long haired girls, messy buns and ponytails are in, as well as the occasional braid or two.
Medium haired girls, you can pretty much go with all of these styles, lucky you!
Also, good hair accessories are skinny headbands, head wraps, bow shaped hair clips, really colorful and patterned hair clips too. The ponytail holders with little balls on the end in cut colors and patterns are awesome!;
,


The main thing you want is wild colors, prints, styles, and the ability to add a little bit of your own personal style in there with it! Skinny jeans in vibrant washes like green, pink, blue, purple, or maybe black or gray are really popular right now. Also, no zip-up sweatshirts, unless it's really special to you, or looks really really really x10 good on you. Mostly just sweatshirts that are vibrant with extra long sleeves that cover 3/4 of your hand, that are either tight of only slightly loose. But don't forget--sweatshirts are supposed to be comfortable, and some can be a staple to your wardrobe. If you're normally a stylish and girly girl and one day the rest of your wardrobe is totally cool, then it's fine to add maybe a bright or a patterned zip-up sweatshirt.
Short-shorts are perfectly fine, and different colors and prints are okay, but they should be simple prints, like no polka dots or animals unless it's pajama pants.
Mini-skirts are totally hot, as long as they don't show anything they shouldn't.
semi-tight t-shirts with cutesy cartoon characters are in, popular ones being hello kitty, power-puff girls, etc. No avatar, sponge-bob, fairly odd parents, or anything stupid like that.
Anything else that you like or think is cool. Because, chances are, it is!

,


Buy a bunch of bracelets, anything that's supposed to be on your wrist, WEAR IT!!! Neal Armstrong bracelets in really cool colors, sweatbands, gummy bracelets, watches, string friendship bracelets, anything!
Funky rings are, well, funky! plastic jewels, real jewels, crazy prints, almost anything works. There isn't really a limit to how many rings you can wear, well, at least if you don't care about moving your fingers.
Hats, that's up to you. if its really cool, you can wear it, but, hats are kind of trying too hard.

, shoes, jeans, binders, notebooks, backpacks, hands, anything!
Boho scarves that you let stay long, with tights, boots, and a mini skirt are really cool!
paint your nails really bright colors, but stay away from white unless it's polka dots. Oh, and you can use a toothpick to make zebra stripes or whatever.
Don't care what people think of you. Live life to the fullest, and have tons of fun. do something unexpected, like jump into the pool with your clothes on. Be daring, and never be afraid of a challenge. Just have fun!

Acknowledge your own uniqueness.,
Find things you are passionate about.,
Have confidence in yourself.,
Try new things.,
Wear original clothing that you like.,
Experiment with new styles.,
Observe what you like in others' works.,
Develop your style.,
Think critically.",How to Be Original," You are, in a sense, already original. While there will be people who are similar to you, wear similar clothes, read similar books, have similar ideas, no one is coming at the world from exactly your point of view.


Do things because you want to do them, not because you think they make you different. A fair number of folks from the Millennial generation do things with the specific point of being ""original.""There is nothing wrong with wanting to be unique and to stand out, but being passionate about the things you are interested in is going to be noticed far more than striving constantly to be different from everyone else.
True originality is, for the most part, non-existent. Everything builds on what came before it, style, music, writing. There is nothing wrong with this. Look for things that interest you and build them into the repertoire of who you are. The end result will be entirely you.;
, Being passionate about things you love is much more important than being unique, and it will also help showcase your interests, which in turn, show how you are original.


Most importantly, don't let anyone get down on you about your interests. They make you unique and they make you interesting. Not everyone will share these interests and that's okay! Engage with the interests of others and respect what they enjoy, even if it's something you don't understand.
Try out some local music as well as listening to the big names on the radio. You might find bands you would never have thought to like and a community of people to enjoy them with. Local bands will also often be less well known and something you can share with the people you meet.
This goes for local authors and physical artists as well. Your community probably has amazing dancers, writers, potters, that aren't well known. Looking out for local talent to be interested in, helps support your community as well as giving you a unique side.
Don't hide what you're passionate about. If you like dolls, be open about that. If you like horses, comics, football, writing fanfiction talk about it, show your passion. (Of course, don't only talk about your passions. Listen to others as well. You might even uncover new things to be interested in.)

, Confidence, of course, is one of the most attractive traits a person can exhibit, but, in particular, it helps when you do something that is outside the norm. People won't always react well to what they perceive as different, so building confidence in what you are and what you do, will help that nagging voice in your head as well as those nagging voices around you.


This means not comparing yourself to others, either in terms of how much you conform or how little you conform. What you do, what you are, and what you make are things you put out in the world. Someone else is always going to be smarter, better dressed, and more ""original."" Just be you.
If people make fun of you or your interests, do your best to ignore them. Words do hurt, but often the reason they're laughing at you is that you don't conform to what they think of as ""normal."" If it's someone that you care about, making fun of you, explain to them how that makes you feel and ask them not to do it. If they continue to not understand and to hurt you, maybe that person isn't the best to have in your life.

, Seek out new experiences to try. New experiences will introduce you to new perspectives and ideas that will change and form your individuality. You may not always like them, but they are ways to uncover what you're passionate about.


Sign up for a swing dance class or an art class. Learn a new language. There are lots of free programs available through your public library that give you access language learning platforms.
Check around your communities: look for flyers for free music shows, lectures, and classes. This way you can try something new at little to no expense.
Take up useful things, like knitting or sewing or cooking. They'll give you something to pass the time, ways to make useful handmade gifts, and are fun!
If nothing else, new experiences are certain to provide you with interesting, or funny, stories to tell that are unique to you.

, Even fashion designers, who have to create constantly original and recognizable designs, utilize previous fashions and ideas in their new constructions. Figure out what it is you like to wear, what you feel comfortable in and wear that. Look at fashion blogs and the people around you. They can give you ideas for what you might like to try.


If you shop at unusual places you are more likely to find clothes that nobody else will have. Try secondhand clothing stores, vintage clothing shops, flea markets and bazaars where local people exhibit their wares.
If you like what someone's wearing, ask them about it. You don't have to copy the look to incorporate it into your own personal style.
You can also make or alter clothing to make it more unique. Either find old clothing of yours or cheap clothes to work with. Patterns for clothes can be found at craft stores, online, in antique stores and even in books stores. You will need time to get good at this.
Draw inspiration from history. Fashion has changed a ridiculous amount. Incorporate a Victorian style into a jacket, wear a 1950s inspired skirt. Just remember that cultural appropriation is never a good fashion choice; if it's an important cultural aspect don't wear it; for example a War Bonnet of the Plains Indian, or the Hindu bindi are not appropriate ""fashion"" choices as they are an integral part of the culture of their respective societies.

, Change your look around to find what really works for you. Experiment with your hair, your make-up, accessories.



Dye your hair or cut it. Dye it blue and cut it super short, or bleach it. Try bangs, try braids, try just taking really good care of it. The nice thing about hair is that it grows back, so you can do all sorts of things without being permanent about it.

Try out shades of nail polish. Paint each nail a different color that you like, or paint them bright flaming red. Experiment with different designs.

Try out different kinds of make-up, or don't wear make-up at all. Experimenting with make-up will help you find what makes you feel confident and happy and what doesn't. Sometimes, wearing no make-up at all can make you feel confident in your own face.
Try out accessories. Maybe you'd rather have a tiny purse, or carry everything in your pockets. Maybe you're one of those people that has something for every emergency. You're allowed to try different things out to see what you like best.

, Original artistic works, fashion statements, or opinions, don't arise out of nothing. They are built on a framework of ideas, writings, paintings and outfits from people who came before them. They are simply looking at the world, or at life a new way.


If you're writing a book, read widely and see what works and what doesn't work. You can take the knowledge you've learned and the ideas you've been confronted with and use it to create something that comes from a new viewpoint, yours.
You have to start somewhere. Most artists begin by mimicking the styles of the artists they admire. As you practice and become exposed to different ideas and artistic styles, you'll more and more develop your own style.
Salvador Dalí, Spanish Surrealist painter, was considered to be wildly original, and yet many of his skills and ideas come through Renaissance predecessors.It was these building blocks combined with his own unique imagination and perspective that made Dalí original.

, Practice, practice, practice. Style comes with time and also shifts over time. Constantly assess your work and your self. What can you do better, what do you do well.Mary Shelley, of Frankenstein fame, more or less, invented the science fiction genre, but she built it on the genres of Gothic literature and Romantic literature, utilizing those genre narrative types in her formation of something different and new.
Ask people you trust to help, especially people who are familiar with the artists that you admire. They'll be able to tell you where bits of your own originality are shining through and when you've drawn too heavily on the works you admire.
Work from your own experience. This doesn't mean write a story about a sixteen-year-old girl who goes to school and feels like she doesn't fit in (if that is what you are), it means no one in the world has had quite your experience of life. Draw on that when you are creating and it will help develop your work into something new.

, Pay attention to what works and what doesn't work in both others' works and in your own. You won't be perfect, even when you're old hat at things like writing, painting, and just being yourself.


Don't just accept the opinions of others without analyzing them and looking for various points of view. This also goes for your own opinions. Being original means not just thinking like you're told to.
Be respectful. Even if you disagree with someone, or are questioning their artistic or other opinion and style, be polite about it. Try to see where they're coming from, even if you continue not to agree with them.

Use non sequiturs.,
Be oddly specific with what you are saying.,
Learn very specific facts and recite them regularly.,
Avoid ""wandom"" words.,
Speak about yourself in the third person.,
Make random noises.",How to Be Random1," Non sequitur is Latin for ""does not follow"" and describes a speaker's failure to construct an argument in a logical manner. This phrase has been used since the time of the Caesars. Today, the word ""random"" is used in basically this way, referring to the use of non sequitur for comedy.


The word ""random"" really refers to a process or a decision made without a conscious or systematic choice. True randomness is unplanned, making it somewhat difficult to provide a concrete strategy for ""being random.""
Strictly speaking, a person is not random. A phrase or an action can seem spontaneous or unexpected, but one person is not more or less ""random"" than another. You can, however, learn to be wacky and spontaneous in the way that people mean when they say ""random."";
, It will sound more random, or like you've got some kind of head injury. For example, instead of saying, ""A few years ago,"" be more specific and say, ""A few years after the year before ten years ago, I was speaking to the brother of my sister's father (uncle)."" Take your figures of speech to extremes.

, Start thinking of the most obscure, inane, and spectacularly random details under the sun and committing them to memory. The more you've got rattling around in your noggin', the more random you'll be able to be.


Don't use regular colors, like ""blue,"" use ""eggshell,"" or ""dioxane violet."" Look through Liquitex paint names for ideas; my favorite of theirs is ""hookers green"" in your writing and your speech. And yes, those are real colors.
The next time someone asks you to pick a number between one and ten, answer with something like ""pi"", ""e"", or ""the square root of seven.""

, ""Wandom"" means ""wannabe random,"" and it can be extremely heartbreaking that someone would feel the need to invent this term. This is usually formerly random material that has been overused and is just not random anymore. Strictly speaking, anything that you've used for joke purposes before can only be ""random"" once.


Wandom words include pickle, chicken, monkey, dino, penguin, purple, pie, squirrel, moo, pizza, mayonnaise, pudding, pants, rawr, socks, pony, llama, unicorn, taco (or burrito), cheese, and nose. Of course, the randomness is fairly culturally specific to North American school culture, so feel free to ignore this step. Use random words as you see them.

, Third person means replacing ""I"" with your full name. This is common to the ego-obsessed and many professional wrestlers.


If you want to take it even further, when you're speaking about the group you're in by using random alternative group concepts. Instead of saying ""we,"" say ""our company,"" ""our army,"" ""the movement."" Keep switching between normal speaking and these methods, and also constantly changing the replacements themselves for maximum efficacy.

, Things like ""mwargh"" or ""oooooohh"" or even ""bwah"" and ""digee"" will work divinely. You could also laugh. A lot and randomly. People will know you for it. Sometimes, you can be the person who laughs and makes everyone else join in! Don't try for this, though. You have to kind of be in your own world first.

Dress in unusual clothing combinations.,
Form unusual obsessions.,
Make plans and change them mid-way.,
Listen.,
Add a title to your name.",How to Be Random2," Put on a very normal outfit, like jeans and T-shirt, but add something ridiculous. Like a big gorilla mask. Of course, you could also go with strange clothing all the way. You might want to invest in things like suspenders, top hats, parasols, glitter vests, canes, ribbons, army boots, hippie or (real) vintage things, neon things, glowsticks, or rainbow suspenders.


The trick is to have basic staples: plain T-shirts in varying colors and a couple pairs of blue jeans, maybe in gray, paired with freaky accessories.

, Pick a certain state, food, person, or animal. Make them very public and insane. Maybe you could be obsessed with the Hindenberg disaster, labradoodles, or the actor Charles Nelson Riley. Learn as much as possible about unusual and specific historical trivia and bring it up more or less at random. Pick something you're genuinely interested to make it worth your while.

, Just because you're buying a new coat doesn't mean you can't go to the zoo on the way there. Plans should be broken if you think of a more exciting plan. Always let spontaneity trump whatever it is you thought was more important.

, Secret to random success? Listening closely to the conversation and responding with something that'll come across as off-the-wall at an appropriate moment. It's not appropriate to interject a ""random"" gag when your girlfriend is trying to tell you about how she feels, or when your parents are scolding you about not cleaning your room. Listen to what other people say to find a good in. Then jump.


Good times for a ""random"" joke? When a conversation dies. You're in a group and everyone's being boring, talking about the same old, same old? Tell them all about Star Trek: The Next Generation, a show that ended like decades ago.

, Why be your regular old self? Only refer to yourself as ""Lord Steven"" or ""Captain Theresa."" Better yet, invent your own. If you use an adjective, make sure it doesn't usually apply to people in normal circumstances. If You use a noun, make it an uncommon one, or one in another language. Examples include John Doe the inhospitable, Dr. Doe, John Doe of Topeka, and John el Fuego.

Study the masters.,
Try to lose your inhibitions.,
Break free of conventional rules.",How to Be Random3," So-called random humor isn't the invention of the 13 year olds at your school, despite what they'll have you believe. If you want to brush up on wacky, off-the-wall, ""random"" styles of humor, explore the following unusual sources to get your fix:


Ultimate Warrior pro wrestling promos.
Monty Python's Flying Circus
Family Guy
Zach Galifianakis' stand-up routine
Dada

, Many people think of very random things through the day, but never act on them because they're too afraid of being embarrassed or seen as weird. Want to run at pigeons in the middle of a conversation? Suddenly feel like running doing a slope screaming ""Wheeee!""? Get the urge to pick roadside daffodils and walk off with a bouquet of them while you're going somewhere? Surrender to your whims.

, Finishing your sentences clearly? Holding the same opinion from hour to hour? What for? If you decide you want to buy rubber ducks whilst talking about something important — don't be afraid to end the conversation and do it! Decorum means nothing to the total random. If you're at a college library and suddenly, you just want to find Waldo, go to the desk and ask for Where's Waldo. They probably won't have it, but hey, at least you tried.

Expand your horizons.,
Question the rules.,
Form your own opinions.,
Use your freedom of expression.",How to Be Known As a Rebel in Your School1," Learning new things is the first big step in becoming a rebel.Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and have new experiences.


Try listening to different styles of music than you usually do, or try reading a book by an author that you have never read. Reading is a great way to expose yourself to new ideas.;
, Don't just accept the rules or practices at your school without thinking about them. Contemplate them and decide if they make sense or not before deciding whether you to obey them.


Use the 5 Whys interrogation technique.Ask the question ""why?"" until you understand the root of cause or problem with a rule. For example, if your teacher asks you not to chew gum in class, ask ""why?"" Likely, she will respond that is the rule. Ask ""why?"" Your teacher will then explain the reason if there is one.

, Being rebellious is a sign of normal brain development and helps develop analytical thinking as an adult.Learn not to accept what others think is right, and find out what is right for yourself. Having your own opinions will not only make you more of a rebel, but it will make you more interesting to have a conversation with as well. You might even sway others to begin seeing the world as you do.


Ignore public opinions. Be yourself. Some people may not like your attitude or the image you project, but part of being a rebel is learning that everyone has an opinion.

, Say what you think, even if it isn't popular or appropriate. Don't say what others expect you to say just to live up to their expectations.

Learn from style rebels.,
Be creative.,
Be bold.,
Buy some new sneakers, then draw on them.,
Get a leather jacket.,
Wear edgy makeup.,
Accessorize rebelliously.,
Alter your school uniform.",How to Be Known As a Rebel in Your School2," Cultivating a rebellious style today is not the same as it used to be. Style rebels like Johnny Depp, Pharrell Williams, Rebel Wilson, Madonna, Amy Winehouse, Ke$ha, Taylor Momsen, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, and Andre 3000 have become new icons for rebelling from fashion trends.


You might not think your Batman or Bart Simpson shirt is rebellious, but if you look at fashion styles by designers like Jeremy Scott you can see how easily it can be. He designs styles for celebrities that are style rebels, like Katy Perry, and many of his designs can be easily mimicked without spending too much money.

, Dressing rebelliously is more than just ripping your jeans or getting a piercing. To cultivate a rebellious style notice what everyone else in school wears. Then be brave enough to wear something different. When people can tell you are dressing differently intentionally, it will make you seem more accomplished and improve your perceived status.

Consider getting a permanent or temporary piercing if your school doesn't allow them.
Fake a tattoo.
Wear your hair messy.Instead of ripping your jeans to fit in with the style of a certain group of kids, wear some sneakers with dress slacks. Creativity in your style is the key to being a rebel.







, You don't need to go over the top, but you want a bold element to your style to make your look pop. No matter what crowd you gravitate toward, you can still keep the same social circles while dressing like you want.


For example, Young Thug is a well-known hip-hop artist and fashion rebel. His style of puffy blouses with preppy blazers goes against everything you thought hip-hop style is about., Take a page out of Pharrell William's style book and use some neon paint to write and draw on your sneakers.Purchase sneakers that are one shade to have your writing stand out. You can even write something that your support of a cause.

, Leather jackets have always been a staple of a rebellious look. Guys can wear it over a dress shirt or sweater, and girls can drape it over dresses to add a rebellious look without trying to look like James Dean throwback.

, It is not permanent like piercings or tattoos, but edgy makeup can help stand out and go against the trends. Try some metallic glitter or black nail polish., Having a couple of perfect accessories can help to polish your rebel style without spending too much on entirely new wardrobe.


Wear your sunglasses indoors. No matter what your style, a cool pair of sunglasses worn indoors is the sure sign of a rebel.
Find a unique hat. You can pick a traditional fedora, a top hat, or a baseball cap with studs or gold bling all over it. A really good hat can be like a trademark for your style and can show your individuality.

, If your school has a uniform, you alter it or add an accessory to declare your individuality without getting in trouble. You can cut off some holes in the elbows of a school jacket and add patches, or add some buttons. Depending on what the school dress code is, you can figure out a way to get around them and express your inner rebel.

Do your own thing.,
Break the rules.,
Demand change.,
Maintain your personal interests.,
Take a stand.",How to Be Known As a Rebel in Your School3," At school, many kids will stick to their different cliques or groups of friends. Skateboarders hang out together, cheerleaders hang out with other cheerleaders, athletes will hang out with their teammates. Don't restrict yourself to one group of friends. Make friends with anyone who you enjoy being around.

, Chew gum in class. Interrupt the teacher and challenge their lesson if you don't think it makes sense or see the point. You can even prank or joke around, just be aware of the consequences if you get caught pushing your freedoms too far., If you don't agree with a rule, argue it at a school meeting or see the principal. You can also start a petition and turn your rebellion into a movement.

, Most people think that being a rebel means that you have to misbehave or get into trouble. This can lead to behavior that is harmful to yourself or others. Being a rebel is about challenging the status quo, not fighting against the system. Act in a way that still benefits you and allows you to learn, without accepting whatever they tell you without question.Don't think you need to quit a team sport to be a rebel. If you like baseball, you can still play and be a rebel, too. Think about Charlie Sheen's character in the movie ""Major League."" He played baseball with a mohawk and geeky glasses and stood out from everyone else on the team.

, Stand up and help others that go against expectations. Don't tolerate or support bullying. Do not let any other students push you around. Usually, bullying is just a way that people reject someone for being different from the norm, which is what being a rebel is all about too.

Stop planning every minute your life.,
Eliminate needless responsibilities from your life.,
Try to figure out what you like, and what you are like.,
Figure out what's getting in your own way.,
Keep your free time and your work time separate.,
Make your own decisions.,
Meet new people.,
Try something you think you might not like.,
Just say ""yes"" more.,
Put your phone away.,
Change your route ever day.,
Aim for one new thing each day.,
Make sensible spontaneous decisions.",How to Be Spontaneous," Spontaneity is best achieved when you have no pre-conceived goal or ending in mind for a given experience. If you want to be more spontaneous, make it easier on yourself by giving yourself less of a script. There are no rules to living your life.Heading to the beach for a fun day with your friends? There's no need to plan it out by the minute. What will you eat? Who will drive? What will you wear? Worry about each thing as it comes. Don't worry about planning out every single detail of an experience.;
, In order to be more spontaneous, you need to have time on your hands to be able to do things on a whim. You can start my looking at your daily routine and cutting everything away from it that you don't need. People, responsibilities, and activities in your life that aren't important? Cut them out.


Try to think about everything you usually do, even if you can't cut it out of your routine. Writing it all down can help you remember and visualise your timetable, if it is very busy.
Obviously, if you have a hobby, activity or club that you really enjoy, its probably not a good idea to quit it. Use common sense to decide what can be cut away.

, Imagine your ideal day, a totally free day that you've got to do whatever you want. What would it involve? Heading to the beach and taking a dip? Playing basketball with your friends? Relaxing with a good book and a cool drink on your porch? Playing guitar on stage? Imagine your ideal life.


What brings you happiness in the world? What were the times in your life that you remember being totally happy, or totally relaxed? Try to keep those memories at the front of your mind, and make them a priority in your life.

, What's keeping you from living the spontaneous life that you might want to live? Are you scared of putting yourself out there? Do you work in a job that keeps you locked into a computer or an office, and doesn't give you the free time you desire? Are you stuck in a dead-end relationship?


When you figure out what's keeping you from living the way you want to live, Try to make a change. Whatever it is that's keeping you from being spontaneous, cut it from your life.

, If you organize your time effectively, you have and finish your work in the time you have devoted to work time. Try to remake your routine so that you have at least one day a week with no appointments or commitments. This is great for being spontaneous as you can wake up in the morning and decide on something you want to do for the day based on a whim.


Most people have to have some kind of schedule for their day. Even if you want to be spontaneous, it's important to have some idea of what you'll be doing when you wake up, or you may just suffer from indecision.

, Who is in charge of your own life? Too often, we just let our friends make the call and be the deciders. If you're always turning it over to the group to make your plans for you, that might be because your'e ""easy going,"" but it might also be because you're letting others make your decisions for you. Let yourself have opinions and grab onto them.


Try an experiment. Instead of ""going with the flow,"" voice a strong opinion next time you're trying to come to a decision as a group. Even if you don't really care where you meet friends for dinner, try picking a place and standing up for it. It might feel good.
At the same time, going with the flow is an important part of being spontaneous. Try not to get too hung up on little decisions.

, Tired of your regular old crew? If you need a change, try hanging out with lots of different kinds of people and meeting as many as possible. Don't just find one social group to associate with, but move between lots of different groups to give yourself a wide social net.If you go to school, don't just hang out with people in your classes. Try sitting new new people every day at lunch. Make friends with some jocks, some geeky kids, and some arty kids. Have lots of friends.
Every time you go out, think of it as an opportunity to meet people and make potentially life-changing friends. Don't just ""stand in line"" at the DMV, chat up your neighbors and find out what their lives are like. Reach out.

, Mystery can be intimidating. If you've never tried a particular dish, or never visited a particular place, those things can seem scary. But once you start exploring, you might even start to hunger for more and newer activities.


Try a new dish out once a week. Cook something from a cookbook that requires ingredients you've never heard of, or head to a restaurant that you've never eaten at before. Just try it.
Try an activity, hobby, book, or movie that you're not sure you're crazy about. Explore something strange or complicated for fun. You may even like it.

, Do you want to try sushi? Do you want to go to a baseball game? Do you want to take swimming lessons? Why not! Sure! Absolutely! If you're presented with an opportunity, too often we find reasons to say ""no."" If something seems like a great, or fun chance, try to figure out a way to make it work, even if you're not sure it will fit in with your schedule or your plans.


You don't have to agree to things that you don't want to do, or that you don't like, but it's a good idea to be open-minded enough to give something a try.

, Want to open yourself up to more spontaneous experiences? Pull your head out of your mobile and look around some. Too often, we're locked in on our e-mail when we're out for a walk, or are neck deep into some podcast when we're commuting. Just be where you are and be doing what you're doing. Stop multitasking and put your phone away.


If you feel like you're really attached to your phone, just try putting it on silent. You've got voicemail, and people will be able to leave you a message if there's an emergency.
Turn off all but your most important alerts. Does your phone really need to beep if someone messages you on Facebook? Or if someone retweets you?

, Do you have you life on autopilot? Switch it up. You can decide to walk or drive a different way to work or wherever else you have to go today. Even if it takes you five minutes longer one way, what's the difference? Enjoy the new route or method of travel as much as possible.


Do you usually drive? Try taking public transportation, or riding your bicycle. Explore different ways of getting where you need to be.

, You can decide on the spot what you want to have for tea. You can decide that you want to watch a new film or even go to the cinema on a worknight/schoolnight, just making sure you don't get to bed too late.Pick back up on the things that you like to develop new hobbies. Find out the you really like reading comic books? Keep up with it.

, Being spontaneous doesn't give you the license to do reckless or dangerous things. Being spontaneous isn't an excuse for abusing alcohol, drugs, or tobacco products. Make smart and informed decisions if you want to be in control of your spontaneous life.

Love music.",How to Be Indie (for Girls)," Indie people are individualists. Become aware of what you are really interested in. For example, if you like hardcore folk, Google it and try to find as many hardcore folk bands and learn about the genre. Being yourself is the main point of being Indie. It's about being yourself. If you love football, try out! Don't worry about what people say because they are not helping your pursue dreams or become independent. Being indie doesn't mean you can't join in on your school's activities. It's if you like them or not. If you don't like pep rallies, then don't cheer at them. If you like swimming, then try out for the team. Participate in hobbies that you like, not because someone else likes them. Also, read books that you don't see or think about many other people reading; things like old comics, Rolling Stones and Beatle Biographies - anything! Or, ask your local librarian if she recommends any uncommon series, and if you like it, tell your friends!;
, Indie means to an independent style. You're not copying a popular style or attempting to conform into any trend. If you see something from a store that YOU truly like, buy it! It's not a big deal if you buy brand name stores clothes, just as long as you're applying your individual style. Don't get obsessed about non-conforming. That's ignorant because no one is truly a non-conformist. By claiming you are a non-conformist, you are conforming, so stay away from that ignorance. Places that are good for clothing are thrift shops, yard sales, and hand-me-downs. Dress individually, but don't get obsessed with being individual. Be brave about what you wear. Not everyone's going to like it, but you should love it! Remember that you can find some awesome things at thrift and second-hand stores for relatively cheap!

, There are tons of accessories you can add to your outfit. You could wear little beret hat, long beaded necklaces that you can wrap around your neck a few times, or sliver bracelets rings and cute earrings. Triangle necklaces are really indie.

, Curly or wavy hair is very indie, and so are bangs. You can add headbands, or put your hair up, but leave it slightly tousled.


Work on your hair. Your hair will complete any look. If you're having a bad hair day, wear a hat. Other than that, your hair can be any length and any natural color. Having a few layers looks good but don't go overboard because that will make you look scene not indie. A side fringe suits most people, but so does a full fringe so pick whichever you prefer.

, It's hard to be considered indie without an awesome assortment of eclectic jewelry! Places like Target sell great jewelry that easily completes any indie girl wardrobe, but if you don't want to shell out the cash for your bling, try DIY-ing. Go to a bead store and get whatever unique beads you can find. Not good with beads? Try attaching small objects like an old key to a chain. Invest in gold bangles, earrings, rings and maybe a few anklets.

, Indie girls are nice and fun to be around. Because they are willing to be individual, they respect others' individuality and never make fun of it. People may object to how you dress or what you listen to, but the point of being an indie is to be brave enough to be who you want and what you are. When hanging out with people, don't be afraid to voice your opinion or join in the conversation. Joke around in a way that doesn't hurt anyone! Have fun and be fun!

, Join art classes if you don't think you're great at art. Start photography, Garden, Make ink paintings, or Read old books.

, Indie girls are smart. They pursue what they're interested in, even if it isn't popular amongst their peers. You don't have to be a genius or have a 100% average in all classes, but focus on your education and try to get at least decent grades! Don't be ignorant and act like you don't care about school to be ""cool"".

, You can draw your ideas and fashion from these people. Some indie celebrities include Christofer Drew, Zooey Deschanel and Alison Sudol.

, Wear sunscreen (tanned skin is very mainstream, therefore try not to tan), exercise and eat well.


Find an exercise you're good at and like, to help you keep in shape. A vast majority of indie girls own old or retro bikes, which are also great for the environment!

, Music is very important to indie girls. Research about your favorite genre's past, and have a wide variety of jams to listen to on your MP3 player. You don't have to like what's deemed ""indie"" music. Once again, Indie is your own independent style, so if you feel a song, listen to it, and don't be ashamed of it!

Eccentric people are generally happier, because they're living by their own standards. They don't compare themselves to others or try to live up to something that they don't really want to be.;
, An eccentric individual is always eager to learn. Their curiosity is one of the main things that keeps them unique and intelligent, as they are always learning something new. If you are eager to learn new things, you're more than likely an open minded person. Being open-minded is necessary if you're looking to embrace your eccentricity, as you must be able to let down all of your walls and be open to different things.You should ask questions, read about history, learn new languages, etc. The more open you are to learning new things, the better.

, Developing unique hobbies and interests is a great way to step into your eccentricity. Stepping into different worlds will open your eyes to different ways of life and introduce you to many different kinds of people.


Some unique hobbies can include collecting crystals, joining a chess club, or making jewelry. Do whatever hobby you've been dying to try, even if it might seem ""lame"" or uncool to others.Unique interests can vary from loving world music to studying astrology. Again, you're allowed to be interested in anything you want. Embrace whatever it is that you're interested in!
If you're unsure of what you're interested in, try things out! Take classes, read books, go to concerts, etc. If a friend asks you to accompany them to an event, you should always go. Being open to trying new things is a great way to discover the eccentricity inside of you. You could also try journaling ideas or meditating to help you narrow down the things you're interested in.
Having unique hobbies and interests will introduce you to many different kinds of people, and interacting with different types of people is the best way to expand your views and open up your mind to different ideas.

, It's often said that ""You are the company you keep."" So keep interesting company! Surround yourself with people who inspire intelligent conversations, people who share their life stories, and people from entirely different backgrounds. You can learn so much from the people you are around, so take advantage of that. Having eccentric friends can ignite your eccentricities and bring out the best in you.


You can meet interesting people by trying new hobbies, going to unique events, taking fun classes, or joining a club. Spark up conversations with people everywhere you go and be open to making new friends.

, Most eccentric people are creative in some capacity. Whether it's drawing, painting, creating music, writing, or even sculpting, use your creativity to it's furthest extent. You don't have to be a professional artist, but you should embrace whatever create endeavor you enjoy doing.Don't be afraid to try new things, such as performing at an open mic. Eccentric people don't care what others think of them anyways, so try out new experiences whenever you get the chance.

Follow your own trends.,
Have a signature accessory or item of clothing – the wilder the better.,
Wear your hair and makeup however you please.,
Decorate your living space eccentrically.",How to Be Eccentric2," Wear what you love, not what's popular or trendy at the time. Dressing eccentrically is all about being bold with your fashion choices, and not worrying what others will think. Don't be afraid to embrace crazy patterns, mix and match colors, and wear clothing from all different eras.


Trends come and go, but your personal style is forever. If you love flared jeans, don't let the skinny leg trend stop you from wearing those bellbottoms.
You can also make your own clothing. This way, you'll have one-of-a-kind garments that are completely true to you., A mark of eccentricity is having a signature look. Whether it's your top hat, your bright costume jewelry, or always wearing something in leopard print, your signature item should be true to you.


You will start to become known for your signature look. Once you make it part of who you are, it will become a permanent part of your eccentricity., Getting wild and fun with your hair and makeup is a great way to show your eccentricity. Bright eyeshadows and lipsticks, heavy eyeliner, and rosy blush all add pops of color to your face. Experimenting with different hairstyles that you like is another way to express yourself; dye it different colors, put it in crazy up-dos, buzz it off, or grow it as long as possible. Wear whatever hairstyle you like, no matter how weird it may be considered.


If you don't care about your hair or makeup, then don't do anything! Going completely natural in a society that forces perfect hair and makeup is an eccentric move in itself.

, Whether you have your own apartment, share a place with roommates, or still live with your parents, there are many ways to express your eccentric style in your decorations. Turn whatever personal space you have into your own personal sanctuary. Fill it with your favorite art, books, fabrics, furniture, etc. Don't worry about having everything match or go together, be as eccentric as you want. Remember, this is your space, so decorate it however you please.


A few ways to create an eccentric environment can include shopping at thrift stores to find affordable and unique furniture and decorations, hanging up art by you and your friends, and giving yourself a creative space – like a desk – that is designated for your creative process.
If you're sharing a space with others, be sure to respect their boundaries. Keep your decorations to your personal space."

Sound eccentric in conversation.,
Explain your eccentricities to others.,
Don't offend others.",How to Be Eccentric3," You can sound eccentric by expanding your vocabulary and by bringing up interesting topics of conversation. Instead of making small talk, discuss topics of substance like literature, music, film, or travel.


Expand your vocabulary to appear more eccentric within conversation. People who use bigger, impressive words in conversation come off as being more intelligent and knowledgable. Learning about topics like literature, music, film, or travel make for great, insightful conversation. Stick with topics that allow people to express opinions as opposed to small talk that results in one word answers. Be open to new topics of conversation as well – it's perfectly fine to ask questions if you're unfamiliar with a topic

, If others are confused by you, simply explain yourself. Although you shouldn't care about being judged, you should never miss an opportunity to interact with someone who is different from you. Explaining your eccentricities to others may open up their minds to new ways of thinking and could result in you making new friends.

, If someone expresses to you that you're making them uncomfortable, it's best to back off. When you're eccentric, not everyone is going to like or understand you, and there's nothing wring with that. It's perfectly fine if some people don't like you, so don't force yourself on them.

Quirks and Hobbies.,
Develop the attitude that if everyone else is doing it, you will most likely back away.Don't follow fads or trends of any kind.,
Be confident.",How to Be Eccentric or Eclectic as a Teen," ""Eccentric"" literally means off center. Most eccentrics know very early on that they are somehow different from other people. If you are not an eccentric person naturally, trying to follow these might make you come off as a poser. Eccentrics do their own thing, think their own way and don't give a crap about the criticism or flattery of others.;
, Develop your own code of ethics and values for yourself. Seek the truth and no matter what the world tells you, you will find it.

, Think of things from the perspective of others. Most eccentrics are viewed as such because of their offbeat perspective of life.

, Who cares what other people think? If you think that bright purple top hat is beautiful, WEAR IT. Avoid malls and the more ""consumer"" ways of dressing. Take risks and develop a tough skin because people will question it.

,, Wonder about things. If you think to yourself, ""Why IS the sky blue?"" Go look it up! Find out about the things you don't understand. There are no stupid questions or ideas.

, Express your ideas. Always remain comfortable about being yourself.

, Don't worry too much about this step. Honestly, just be yourself... If you're a man who enjoys the color pink, that's awesome! Go for it! If you're a woman who wants to wear a tie with your dress, that's awesome too! Simply: do what you want. Enjoy your sense of style and self.

, These are universal among eccentrics. Quirks you cannot fake. Everyone has them, but some are weirder or more noticeable than others. Hobbies should be sought with intensity and passion seeking perfection in your field. Do the things you love! And share them with others!

, Have your own quirky sense of humor and language. *See warnings*

, Individuality without confidence is a sad thing to behold.

Keep it simple.,
Mould your clothing to your personality and mood.",How to Be Bohemian," If that means quitting your day job and moving into a tiny studio apartment filled with paints, do that. Bohemians hold the creation of art above all other pursuits. But, use good judgement. Don't go quitting your job if you have no other means of financial stability.;
, that you like. Do the following without shame. What you like and don't is part of your individual personality, why hide that? Bohemianism is all about rejecting conventions if they go against what personally inspires you.

, If you have grown up with a certain belief system (religion, political view, etc.) ask yourself why you believe this. Do you really believe this or is it just a habit?

, If there is an aspect you admire, incorporate it into your own life. This is called 'shop cart views'. You don't have to agree with everything from a particular ideology.

, This may not naturally be your forte but everybody has some creativity. Art, music, writing, etc. whatever works. Don't worry if you aren't a prodigy in your chosen artistic outlet. Every master started somewhere and nobody has to see your genius if you don't want them to. What one person calls smears of paint another calls art, so it's all what you think.

, Ask yourself: what are they really asking of you, what are their motives, reasons, is there any value in their request? The answer to these should tell you whether you should even pay attention. However, with authority figures, you should always be respectful and use logic when you are questioning them.

, Also remember that if something goes wrong, don't stress and freak out. Just let it flow and calmly try to solve the problem. Try to live without regrets, and if you are thinking that you really have to do something like reaching out to a person, do it!


Take time for yourself. Pick flowers, keep a journal, go for walks, garden, etc. Have some alone time, just you and the world.

, The Bohemian style is as much about comfort as self-expression. Generally, clothing should not be tight and the fabrics used must allow your skin to ""breathe"". Your clothes should be moulded to your lifestyle, not vice versa: in other words, do not wear anything that hinders movement and that you find to be uncomfortable. The only exception to this rule is evening dress.


Wear what you want! Bohemians don't care about popularity or style: they care about expressing themselves. So wear what makes you feel good.

, Fabric is the single most important element of Bohemian clothing. Choose natural materials such as cotton, gauze, wool and leather. Coarse furs, such as raccoon fur, are beautiful additions to a Bohemian look. However, a detail in synthetics or patent leather can add an interesting dash of irony and originality to an outfit.

, Bohemian dressers enjoy decoration. Look for embroidered pieces--especially peasant blouses--fringing and beading. Do not be afraid to pile on the jewellery. Keep in mind, however, how each piece relates to the others; is each piece strictly necessary? If jewellery is not your thing, fresh flowers are lovely accessories. If you want piercings or tattoos -- go for it. But with tattoos, don't rush too much into getting one because it will be with you for the rest of your life.

, The movement of a bohemian outfit--especially a Bohemian dress--should be fluid and graceful. There should be a sense of freedom. Also take time to note how you 'sound': what noise does your jewellery make when you move?

, However, while these most certainly add a gypsy air, a simpler Bohemian look can be achieved by using dramatic one-tone items. It is the cut and fabric that, above all, create a Bohemian feel.

, Bohemian style does not mean over-doing it. As with any other styles, edit your look ruthlessly. Never wear any piece that is not perfectly necessary to the look you are trying to project. Often the most successful Bohemian styles are, in their way, the cleanest and most simple.

, Do not let anyone, not even me, dictate your own personal dress code. If your style means being Bohemian one day and Minimalist the next--do it! Only be true to yourself and unafraid of expressing what is inside you. It is that element of sincerity that makes the Bohemian look so delightful.

, Suggest a green theme. Energy efficient light bulbs for your lamps, recycled notebooks/stationary, sponsor a green charity in your name, solar powered chargers. There are lots of things you can buy that will be useful and enjoyable. Plus there will be an added warm feeling on your birthday.

, When you turn something off - really turn it off!

, Think twice before you throw away that old sheet of scratch or note paper. See if you can still use it for something.

, When taking a shower, try to keep it below 10 minutes. Don't turn the heat all the way up, either. Make it a kind of game, trying to beat your old 'score' every time you take a shower.

Listen to indie music.,
Watch independent films.,
Follow and appreciate indie art and design.",How to Be Indie (for Guys)1," One of the most critical aspects to being indie is not adopting other people’s views without evaluating the situation yourself. Going with the crowd is never something that an indie person would do, so make sure that you are making independent decisions when it comes to music, clothing, and your opinions.Do your research on different topics to help inform your opinions.


If you like a band or musician, but everyone else thinks they are bad or weird, then you should stand up for your views.
Don’t watch reality TV or get involved with celebrity gossip. Concentrate on other things like finding new music or watching movies from independent filmmakers.;
, Contrary to popular belief, being indie does not mean being a member of an exclusive club. The entire purpose of being indie is to be yourself, regardless of what is popular in society. Being around other indie people will most likely mean that you will interact with people who are vastly different than you.

Posers will often ridicule other people who don’t conform to their belief systems. This is not being indie.
You don’t have to like everyone, but you need to give everyone a chance. Allow people time to show you that they are good people.

Don’t listen to top 10 lists or watch MTV, as these are the most popular artists in the world.

, Independent films is a somewhat vague term that could have multiple definitions. Some people consider any film that's not made by a big movie studio like 20th Century Fox, Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, or Universal Pictures an independent film.Others argue that the term ""indie film"" relates more to the substance and conventions that the writers, director, editors, and producers take when creating it.Look at the subject matter of the film and read reviews to see if it's different or innovative. If it fits this criterion and a major studio didn't produce it, there's a chance it could be an indie film.


Some popular indie films include Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, and Thirteen., Much like indie music and indie movies, indie artists and designers are those that don't follow mainstream trends or traditional fashion. Some of this includes installation art or art that uses unique, non-traditional materials. Try to find local indie artists and designers by visiting art galleries in your area.

If you find someone pretentious or annoying, you don’t have to be their friend.

, Going to an indie film festival will not only help you find critically acclaimed indie films but will also surround you with people in the indie scene.

, Vegetarianism isn't for everyone, but a lot of hippies are vegetarian. Hippies go vegetarian because of their love for animals and their stance against violence.

Brush your teeth at least twice a day with whitening toothpaste for clean pearly whites. Clean hair, skin, teeth and nails are a must.;
, It is important to wear as little makeup as possible while still maintaining a feminine look. The best way to do this is the ""no makeup"" makeup look. Apply brown gel eyeliner to the upper lash line following your eyes' natural wing. Next, apply one coat of brown or soft black mascara. Swirl a bit of light pink powder blush on the apples of your cheeks. Using a translucent powder, brighten under your eyes by applying a small amount on your dark circles. Still using the same powder, highlight your cheekbones and the bridge of your nose to give a healthy glow. Finish with some lip balm or natural pink lipstick.

, Your hair should always be clean, shiny, and cut in a stylish way. Choose a low maintenance hairstyle that does not require hairspray or gel. Natural hair color is best but subtle highlights can be refreshing.

, Think fun and functional, clothes you could run around town in and still look put together for school or a semi formal occasion.

You want to look like a girl who is ready to have sensible fun.

, It is a big part of being wholesome. Partners want a girlfriend who can keep up physically - someone to work and play with. Find a sport or a solo activity that gives you the exercise you need.

, Smart about school, work, whatever. You have a brain, and this shouldn't be something that people wonder about so don't play dumb. Do your schoolwork and offer to help others with theirs. Think before you speak, and take time to consider your decisions. Don't be a brainless droid following the trends of society! The American spirit is one of independence, adventure, and intelligence! So study hard.

, Refrain from having sex. If you get really drunk you might say or do something embarrassing or harmful to yourself or others - not a desirable characteristic of a wholesome person. Same rule goes for drugs; do your research on the effects of drugs and see if the benefits are worth the risks. Avoid smoking. Wholesome girls smell clean and don't have black lungs or brown teeth, all of which are adverse effects of cigarettes.

, If you want to make good friends, or date a guy that is worth your time, try to cultivate healthy relationships with real people who share your interests and goals. People, for example, that don't stop to inspect their butts one hundred times a day, or try to start fights with chicks in the hall. Stay away from the chronic Myspace drama queens too - what you do online will inevitably come back to haunt your real life. Try getting a Facebook and befriend some college kids. That will help you seem cool and more mature.

If you have tendencies of being stressed out, begin practicing transcendental meditation.Transcendental meditation was popular in the 1960s and currently it is becoming a well-respected practice that holds many health benefits.Seek out a meditation center that specializes in transcendental meditation.
Another combatant to stressors is to practice yoga and philosophies of yogis.

, Are you again the prison industry underpaying inmates for mass goods? Let your voice be heard. Against the war? Share your opinions! Hippies in the 60s to 70s protested the Vietnam war. Engage with contemporary struggles against social justice. Don’t feel limited to “hippie” issues. There are plenty of communities that need to be fought for.


Become involved with Amnesty International to become informed on events and contemporary issues that you can get involved with.
Amnesty International campaigns against issues like arms control, corporate accountability, discrimination, freedom of expression, refugees, LGBTQ rights, and much more., Get some fresh air and feel the sun on your skin. Old school hippies believed that nature itself contains the answers to life’s most important questions. The old mentality was to show respect to mother nature and be in contact with our natural animal essence that is repressed through culture.Take time off to go on hikes.


Try your hand at backpacking. Go for days or weeks living off a limited amount of supplies and the wilderness.

, Know that you don’t need to get into drugs because you want to be a hippie. Hippies have always been known for experimenting with drugs. Today we know more about the dangers, long-term effects, and the costs of addiction from practicing recreational drugs. Don't start just because you want to look more like a hippie. Many modern hippies are focused on getting a ""natural high"" through meditation and spirituality.


Many hippies from the past and today connect strongly to eastern religions like Buddhism and Taoism.

, Accept other people's beliefs and accept that not everyone is going to have the same view on an issue that you do. If someone is bothering you with their opinion, try to see the argument from their point of view. There are two sides to every opinion and you should try to listen to everyone without becoming angry.

, Read as much as you possibly can. If you’re still in school, pay attention in class and strive for good grades. True hippies are very intelligent and aren't ignorant about issues going around them. Branch out to subjects like philosophy and environmental science. Here is a quick list of books you should read:


Howl by Allen Ginsberg
Be Here Now by Ram Dass
On the Road by Jack Kerouac
The Bhagavad Gita
The Stranger by Albert Camus
Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth by R. Buckminster Fuller
Siddhartha by Herman Hesse
I Ching
Back to Eden by Jethro Kloss, Recycle as much as possible. Never throw trash onto the ground. As a modern hippie, or a granola, your mentality is to save the planet, not to pollute it. Plant flowers and trees instead of cutting them down. Reduce on your water and paper consumption. Practice the three R’s of environmentalism:


Recycle
Reduce
Reuse"

Listen to the oldies.,
Get into electronic music.,
Respect jam bands.,
Attend music festivals.",How to Be a Modern Hippie4," Classic hippie music is older music, typically rock n' roll, from the 1960s and 1970s. This time period was when hippie counterculture was skyrocketing. You shouldn’t force yourself to listen to oldies if you don't like it. There are plenty of other music styles that are deemed modern hippie. Give these classic albums a chance before you dismiss it:


The Doors by The Doors
Forever Changes by Love
Surrealistic Pillow by Jefferson Airplane
Deja Vu by CSNY
Are You Experienced by Jimi Hendrix
Blond on Blond by Bob Dylan
IV by Led Zeppelin
Anthem of the Sun by Grateful Dead
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles
If You can Believe Your Eyes and Ears by The Mamas and the Papas, One large distinction of modern hippies compared to the older generation is the newer strides in electronic music. Many young people who identify as being a hippie also prefer newer styles of psychedelic electronic music. Bands like Shpongle or Infected Mushroom make up examples of the genre, psytrance, which has become very popular with modern hippies.A large connotation with this type of music and concert experience is with drug experimentation.
Electronic hippie music is also rooted deeply in jam band music.

, A staple of the hippie movement is in centered around jam bands. They’ve been a staple since The Grateful Dead and Allman Brothers and have since evolved throughout the decades. It is not necessary to like jam bands, but most connotations of a hippie imply an appreciation or knowledge of jam bands.Newer offshoots from the first generation of jam bands are:


Phish
Widespread Panic
The String Cheese Incident
moe.
There are also many genre offshoots that cross into other genres like bluegrass, Yonder Mountain String Band, and dance music, Disco Biscuits.

, Since Woodstock and Monterey Pop festival, more and more music festivals have popped up around the world. One of the biggest festivals for modern hippies is Burning Man, in which the regular festival attendees are called “burners.”


Another traveling large festival for hippies is called Rainbow Gathering.
There are tons of music festivals year round and almost all of them feature a ""hippie band"".

Have a conversation with your parents about making healthier food choices, and explain how natural and healthy eating is important to you.
You can join a local food co-op if you are struggling to find healthy food in your area, or your parents refuse to buy healthy foods.
Growing fresh herbs or vegetables in a garden is a good idea if you want to regularly eat like a hippie.
Pack your lunch instead of buying processed food at the school cafeteria.

, Hippies originated the pro-earth movement, and created Earth Day in 1970.Try volunteering at a local environmental activism nonprofit in your area, or donate to an environmental cause if you have extra money.


On the first Earth Day, 20 million Americans participated in peaceful demonstrations across the U.S.Your local community center will probably have opportunities to volunteer in a garden.

, Hippies aren’t bothered by everyday problems like other people are. Instead of ruminating on the negative, hippies always try to see the positive in every situation.


Being a pacifist and practicing non-violence is also another hippie belief.
If you’re the type to get worked up emotionally during conflict, practice meditating or doing yoga.

, Take every opportunity to attend outdoor festivals and talk to other hippies. Search the web for festivals happening around you, and ask your parents if you can attend. See if any of your friends want to go with you, so you don’t have to go alone.


There are different kinds of outdoor festivals including music festivals, outdoor film festivals, and art festivals.Make sure to check if the festival is for your age. Many of them are 18 or 21 and over.

Popular hippie musicians include The Beatles, Mamas & Papas, Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Neil Young.
Modern hippies will often listen to electronic dance music at outdoor festivals.

Watch movies like Woodstock (1970), Festival Express (2003), Revolution (1968), Magical Mystery Tour (1967), Alice's Restaurant (1969), and Magic Trip (2011).",How to Be a Hippie," Start with the music that rocked a generation. Hitchhike down to your local record store (or truck on over to eBay) and pick up the record of three days of love and music that defined the high point of hippiedom: Woodstock.


Listen to Jimi Hendrix and his inimitable rendition of Star Spangled Banner, Joe Cocker getting by with a little help from his friends, and the ever-popular Fish Cheer from Country Joe and the Fish.
For a truly authentic Woodstock experience, listen to it in the rain. In the mud. Naked, with friends.
While Woodstock has some of the best acts and most memorable songs of the sixties, don't neglect other music of the era as you build your hippie cred. (Actually, hippies never used the word ""cred."") Groove to some of these other great artist that tapped the toes of the Biggest Generation:
Bob Dylan. There's a dichotomy here, one you must resolve for yourself. Do you go with Acoustic Bob, or Electric Bob? Either way, Mr. Dylan is one of the key ingredients in any hippie repertoire.
The Beatles. Especially during their psychedelic period, when they'd moved from ""She Loves You (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)"" to ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.""
Jefferson Airplane. Before the watered-down, glitzed-up popsters that were Jefferson Starship, Jefferson Airplane took us down a rabbit hole, and gave us somebody to love.
The Grateful Dead. If you don't know the Dead, then you just don't know the meaning of the word ""hippie."" These guys gave birth to an entire genre known as the ""jam band,"" exemplified by bands like Phish, String Cheese Incident, and Widespread Panic (actually, The Allman Brothers Band gave birth to Panic). They also gave birth to an entire volume of jam band jokes, like ""Why do Deadheads wave their hands in front of their face when they dance? So the music doesn't get in their eyes!""
Janis Joplin. If there is an archetypal ""hippie chick,"" it would have to be Janis. Of course, she had her hair, her beads, and her wild-abandon ways, and she also had a voice that could sear, soar, cajole, seduce, and stun with its power.
While there are far too many excellent hippie bands to list individually, you must become familiar with Crosby, Stills, and Nash (with and without Neil Young); Joni Mitchell; Judy Collins; Sly and the Family Stone; The Doors; Donovan; The Who; The Stones; The Byrds; Buffalo Springfield, and, arguably, Frank Zappa.;
, The music then was exactly what a generation needed. But time marches on, and there is awesome music being produced today that fits the ethos of peace, love, and understanding. Enjoy it. Being a hippie is all about openness and embracing what's good. As long as you can dance to it.

, Understand fully the many aspects of the 1960s and 1970s that formed the hippie subculture. Learn how many of these people got together, what their general morals and beliefs were, and where they came from.


So much of the history of hippie subculture can be found on the internet today; possibly more than any other subculture. You can gain much insight into the Hippie subculture from watching the original Woodstock movie, ""Celebration at Big Sur"", ""Monterey Pop"", and so on. These are shown on Sundance and the Independent Film Channel, or you might be able to rent them from Netflix.
Don't just glue yourself to the History Channel (like wow, how to make a hippie feel old, man!). Read the words of the poets and authors and other cultural touchstones that defined hippiedom:

Electric Kool Aid Acid Test by Tom Wolfe about Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters is required reading, and when you're done, you will know if you're on the bus, or off the bus.
Learn to howl, and read the poetry of Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. While they themselves preceded the hippie culture, their works sparked the creative spirit in such icons as Hunter S. Thompson, and Bob Dylan (among many others).
Don't forget to laugh at the comics, and yourself. One of the greatest comedians to come from that era was the guy who gave us the ""hippie dippy weatherman with your hippie dippy weather, man."": George Carlin. Unlike many hippies of the era, Mr. Carlin stuck to his beliefs throughout his life.

, Understand that being a hippie today is a bit different than being a hippie in the 60's and 70's. Hippies have new ideas on different topics that deal with the changing times. The hippie generation forming today is doing living by many of the same ideals that formed then, but the Vietnam war is over, and Martin Luther King, Jr., was more or less victorious in his struggle for civil rights.



Ask your parents what it was like while growing up in those days. You may be surprised—and, at turns, appalled—learning about your parent's bag was. They might surprise you, as they were once young and wild, too, and experienced many of the same things you are experiencing today, including love, war, a divided country, and a persistent existential threat.

, Contribute as little to pollution as possible. Hippies love mother earth, and do all they can to keep it well. Buy clothing and products that are recyclable and are good for the environment.


Do volunteer work and learn about barter. Hippies in the 60s believed in trade or barter rather than money.

, In the day, hippies had their own lexicon, as does every generation. Here are just some of the words that were part of the hippie's vocabulary:


1-A, closely related to Draft Card: This would determine whether you would have to go to Vietnam, unless you could get into the National Guard (hard), get CO status (harder), or move to Canada.
Babe, baby, chick, old lady: These were affectionate terms for women and wives or girlfriends.
Bag: Your thing. What you were or weren't into. ""Like wow, you know, needlepoint just isn't my bag.""
Blow your mind: Be really impressed by something almost unbelievable. ""Man, it blows my mind that your old lady used to be my wife!""
Bogart: Not sharing a joint.
Bummer: A very bad thing. ""Oh, bummer, man. I'm out of bread.""
Bread: Money
Cat: A hip hippie.
Cop out: Bagging responsibility and taking the easy way out. ""He loves the war, but joined the National Guard. What a cop out.""
Dig: To grok; to understand, or to like. ""I like really dig Sgt. Pepper, man, you dig?
Your thing. What you do. Your bag. You dig?
Far out: Like totally cool.
Gone: Really, really far out.
Flashback: An unexpected replay of a drug experience, without the drugs.
Freak flag: Long hair.
Fuzz: Police. Also, pigs, cops, and ""the man.""
Grok: To dig. Coined by Robert Heinlein in Strangers in a Strange Land.
Grooving: really enjoying something. ""Man, I'm grooving on these new tunes by Dylan""
Groovy: Very cool. It's a good thing.
Head: Somebody who enjoys drugs.
High: What a head usually is.
If it feels good, do it; Make love, not war; Give peace chance; : Hippie mantras
Joint: A marijuana cigarette.
Killer: Really good. ""That was some killer weed in that joint. Acapulco gold?""
Rap: To converse.
Split: To leave. ""Man, it's been great rapping with you, but I gotta split now, gotta get ready for my gig at the Fillmore.""
Wow: An expression that shows excitement. ""Wow, man, bummer you have to leave. Me and my old lady have some killer weed that will really blow your mind, you dig?""

, Or don't. Clothing is optional for hippies, and even when it's required, the key to being a hippie is to not care about the material stuff. It's about the attitude, not the fashion. So no need rummaging through eBay finding the right round-rimmed rose-colored glasses, bell bottoms, or tie-dyed shirts. It's just as credible to visit the bargain bins at Goodwill. As long as you're comfortable and colorful, you're cool.


Wear clothes made of natural materials, especially hemp. Hemp is the plant that releases the most pollution-preventing oxygen. Colorful ponchos and the Baja Jacket are a great hippie clothing staples, too.
Look into second-hand stores, thrift shops, garage sales, and making your own clothes and jewelry.
Hippies are known for their tie-dye attire, Native American jewelry, peasant skirts, and bell bottom pants. Men grew out their hair and facial hair, such as goatees and mustaches.
Women usually went places without a bra and no makeup. The image of the barefoot hippie is real, but they also wore sandals, soft boots or moccasins, even tennis shoes. Hippies were not immune to the weather.

, Stand against anti-life things such as wars, and help to campaign for a more liberal society with issues such as gay rights and drug laws. Take a stand for the environment and give animals a voice.


Most hippies think that drug prohibition hurts more than drug use. Google LEAP (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition), or NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).

, Grow your hair and go to the hair salon as little as possible. Keep clean, but use natural soaps and deodorants and herbal products. Dr. Bronner's has long been a favorite maker of cleansing products for hippies. Make your own, if possible. Dreadlocks are a popular hippie hair-do too.

, Some hippies are into smoking pot, and the use of psychedelic drugs such as mushrooms and LSD. More recently, ecstasy is also making a scene in hippie culture. Is it legal? Not at all. Is it dangerous? There's no consensus on that one. Ultimately, it's a choice for you to make, given what we know in the 21st century, but it was most definitely part of the hippie culture of the 60's. One can only wonder what would have become of bands like The Beatles or The Grateful Dead without their experimenting with hallucinogens.


Given that, you don't have to take drugs to be a hippie! Remember, many hippies—Frank Zappa, notably—avoided drugs and preferred the ""natural high"", which they sought through meditation, listening to music, colored lights, dancing, backpacking, and other healthy activities. Also, recreational drug use (barring alcohol) is illegal in many countries, so do be careful.

, Some hippies eat only organic vegetarian and vegan food, though keep in mind that in the 60s, ""organic"" was not a food category, and veganism was rarely practiced. Most hippies were too poor to be too picky about what they ate.


Today's organic foods, free-range and health food stores are a legacy of the hippie movement; you might find hippies at your local one.

, Stay away from foods with more than 10 ingredients on them. If they look confusing to your eyes, then they're NOT healthy!

, Support your local farms and buy produce from them!

, This includes taking cow's milk (a cow's milk is best for its young child), Bee's honey, (they create it themselves, therefore it's a by product of an animal), and eggs (in the case of chickens, they are basically a ""period"" of a chicken; an unfertilized egg doesn't turn into anything, but fertilized by a rooster, it turns into a chick) out of your diet.

, Study chakras and meditate.

, These films capture the hippie counterculture pretty well.

Stay safe.",How to Be a Cholo," Buy some plain tee's, striped polo's, and some plaid short sleeved button shirts. Proclub, Dickies, and Sunwear are the right brands for plain tees. Shirts shouldn't be tight or small; wear Tall Tees and make sure they're oversized. The best colors for your crisp tees are black, white, dark blue, dark green, grey, brown, and beige. Shirts with Catholic imagery, lowriders, smile now... cry later, Aztec imagery, or Los Angeles can also be worn.


Get any of your clothes from Dickies, Dyse One, Ben Davis, Joker, Lowrider, Bighouse, Felon, Crime Inc. Mafioso, Convicted, OG Abel, Outlaw Apparel, Rebel8, Solo, Streetwise, Sucios, Sullen, Southpole.;
, Wear flannel shirts and plaid button downs. Get yourself a flannel pendleton shirt and wear it over a plain tee shirt. Button it all the way up or just on the top button. Another way to wear a button shirt is to button only the first and/or second buttons at the very bottom; you can wear the shirt open with the neck collar flattened, kind of like a blazer. Make sure your shirt is creased, crisp and fresh at all times. Make sure it matches your Dickies and your shoes. In the winter, wear plaid flannel jackets instead. You can also wear a poncho for the winter.

, Buy Dickies 874 original cut, dickies Double Knee, Ben Davis Gorilla Cut, Dyse One, Or Levis loose fit or 501s. Always keep your pants pressed and creased up. Either get them 1-2 sizes larger than you would usually wear to achieve the ""baggy"" look or buy a looser fitting pant; you don't have to wear them so loose that they're falling down to your knees. For example, if you wear 30x30 pants get your pants 32x30 or 34x30.


Get Dickies, or the other brands mentioned above. Pants colors should be: khaki, black, blue, navy, grey, or brown.
You can sag your pants a bit, or keep them up with a simple black military belt.

, Get some tight shoes like Nike Cortezes, Chuck Taylor's, Lugz, or Nike Air Force 1s. You can also wear plain black or white Jordan's. Wear them with knee high socks, or don't let your socks be seen at all. Make sure that your shoes do not slip off easily; you should be able to run without worrying about them slipping off. Make sure you get a wide variety of colors to go with your clothes. Usually a white pair of Cortezes and a black pair of Lugz works well. You can also get your shoes from Stacy Adams.

, Many cholos like to shave their heads while others get fades. Whatever look you have, make sure you keep it fresh instead of having a head covered in stubble. You can have a goatee but only if you can really pull it off. Mustaches and soul patches are also pretty common with cholos. If you want, you can put a bandana on, but make sure you know how to wear one instead of fussing with it and looking like a poser the whole time. New era hats like snapbacks and fitted hats are cool as long as they have something like the raiders or Dodgers on them, make sure you can pull the look off and they match your outfit before wearing a hat though. If you have longer hair and don’t want to wear a bandana or hat, you can also just slick it back.

, Wear knee-high white socks. Military belts are a must. Buy a black beanie. Pull it down low almost over your eyes. Wear black sunglasses (you can get a pair of locs at the 99 cent store). Wear a rosary, cross or a plain silver or gold chain around your neck. Don't overdo it. Just having one or two accessories you're always seen with is enough.

, Cholos are known for their tattoos, whether they are religious or have the name of a hyna on them. You should put a lot of thought into this before getting one. Lots of cholos have their last names on their arms or torso, A good place to get tattoos is on your stomach, back, or biceps. Another popular tattoo to get is a tear drop (only do this if you know what it means) near your eye, 3 dots in your hand (please note that if you bear 3 dots on your hand, you are showing your affiliation to the Sureños) or under your eye or initials on your hand.

, Cholos are always keeping it fresh, whether you're talking about their hair, their clothes, their smell, or their bling. If you want to have the right look, then you can't just show up like you rolled out of bed. Care about your appearance without obsessing over it and you'll get respect from cholos and hynas.

, Cholos always know how to boogie to their music no matter what it is, if you can't really dance, you can always Lean Like A Cholo. The idea of leaning like a cholo was popularized by Down AKA kilo's 2007 hit song, ""Lean Like a Cholo."" Though the song is meant to be fun, it does talk about the idea of leaning like a cholo, which is a stance you can take when you're at the club, trying to get girls, or just hanging out. To lean like a cholo, you've got to put your fists together, put your elbows out, and tilt your body back and forth from side to side. Check out the video to get more tips (while remembering that it's not 100% meant to be taken seriously)., Be respectful to those who deserve it, Keep your chin up and stare everyone down. Don't move out of the way for anyone while you're walking, unless it's a lady or a homie, shove them out of the way. Don't take shit from anyone. Be aggressive to those you don't like. But most important thing is never back down to anyone! To do this you need to know how to fight of course.

, This means speak in Spanglish (mixing Spanish and English words in sentences). Say a few words in English, then a few words in Spanish or vice versa, finding a good, natural mix when you talk. This is where being cholo might get tough for those of you who aren't chicano or Hispanic, it might not come natural so the best thing you can do is practice or keep quiet, If you try too hard to say ese as every other word, or naturally flow your Spanglish, then yeah, people will be on to your act. Here are some key words you should know:


Add ""vato"" or ""bro"" and ""Güey"" ""homie"" or ""ese"" ""foo"" to the end of your sentences; just don't make it annoying. Vato is just a way to say ""bro"" in Spanish, and ese really means ""this guy"" or the guy you're talking to. Just know that you have to be a real cholo to say most of these or people might think you're a racist poser.
When speaking English use a Chicano accent. Also don't say some words completely.
When you're shouting out to your homies, say ""q vole carnal"", ""orale vato"", ""simon ese"", ""what up homes"", ""this is firme homie"", and ""simon que si"".
To challenge someone, yell out ""Que chingau foo? Wanna fight or what?""
If you have a girl, call her your hyna or your sancha. Call other girls mija. These don't really mean anything specific, but be sure to use your Chicano accent.

, Cholos love being on the creep and are always looking out for more hynas. If you see one on the street, at the club, or wherever, then you should holler at her to let her know she's looking fine, ask where she's going later, and get her number or just let her see you're into her. Don't be shy, awkward, or weird around hynas; be bold and confident, if you act like a cholo who knows what's up, they'll come to you like flies to honey.


The best way to hook up with a hyna is to do it the chicano way. Say,"" Wassup, que paso, you wanna go for a cruise in my low low"" or simply ""que pasa mija?"" Any other race will take it wrong, but if you ask a Latina that, she'll take it as a compliment.

, If you're too young to have a car of your own, then get a friend with a lowrider and take it around the block. Pump up the music, rock the car up and down, and get some good lookin' hynas sitting in the back. Cruise around town in it, you're just out to have a good time, and don't worry about being a little bit annoying. If you want to be a cholo, you need hynas. And if you want hynas, you need a car.

, Cholos aren't known for following the rules. If you really want to be a cholo, then you're not going to be that straight A student in your class who everyone laughs at. You're going to question authority a bit. You're not going to do something you don't believe in. And if you see someone disrespecting someone else, you're going to do something about it instead of knowing your role. Of course, if you take this too far, you can drop out of school, end up in jail, or just get in real serious trouble, so know that everything has its limits.

, Each cholo is a unique snowflake and all that, they're all into their own stuff but if you want to be a true cholo, then you have to be familiar with the things that cholos like so you don't look like a fool when you don't know what the cholos around you are talking about. Here are some of the things that cholos are known to like:


The Raiders. No matter how many times they lose.
The Dodgers.
The Los Angeles Lakers
Lowriders.
Pitbulls. The more fierce your pitbull is, the better.

Scarface. Watch this gangster film until you've got the lines memorized.
Coronas. If you're old enough to drink, then this should be your beverage of choice. Just remember to pour some out for your homies.

, Cholos love Oldies, as long as they are in English. But they also like funk music like Zapp and Roger, and a bunch of chicano artists like Big Oso Loc, Homeboy Rap, Duende, Juan Gotti, Mr Yosie, Hi-Power Soldiers, Mr Capone-e, Mr Criminal, Soldier Ink, Low Profile, Brownside, Chino Grande, Ms Krazie, Lil Cuete, Lil Rob, Akwid, JaeP, Kinto Sol, or South Park Mexican A.K.A. . Sancho, Knightowl, Psycho Realm, Cypress Hill, and Kid Frost. Listen to this music so you don't look like a poser when it's playing.

, Though cholos have love for other cholos and their hynas, they never forget where they came from. Don't fight with your mom even if she kicks you out of the house. You got to remember that she raised you. The same goes with your dad and other family members. Be nice to your cousins, your siblings, or even family you barely know. They may be all you’ve got in the end.

, If you're a true cholo, then you may find yourself in the wrong neighborhood and need to know what to do. Keep trucha (Be watchful), keep an eye on your surroundings and watch your back and your homies' backs. You should never walk alone. Always have homies to back you up in case you get jumped out of nowhere. And here are some other things to keep in mind:


Be careful about the colors you wear. For example, if you live in an area where there are a lot of Sureños and Norteños, it is best to avoid wearing blue or red or any other color that they might not like.
If you choose to throw up up gang signs (which I don't recommend unless you bang or are surrounded by homies who do), make sure that you know what you’re doing, 'cause if you hit the wrong people, prepare for a fight.
Learn street fighting. That way if you run into trouble, you'll have to defend yourself.

If you do, you will get laughed at. It's better to stay quiet and see how people around you act than to be a huge poser. Real ballers will be on to your act in seconds and they will kick you out of their social circle faster than you can try to imitate the Crip Walk.;
, Real ballers know they're lucky to have what they've got and don't spend all of their time bragging, counting their money, or talking about all the money they spent. They know better than that. They let their products and lifestyle speak for themselves and don't have the need of making other people feel jealous or tired of their games. Be grateful for what you've got and spend your money wisely instead of buying a bunch of flashy, ugly clothes just so you can look rich.


Real ballers never mention their money. Their wealth is understood.

, Fake ballers are always trying to get drunk, talking about how drunk they were, or just ordering way too much liquor for one -- or ten -- humans to consume. You may think that this act will make you look like a true baller, but really, you'll just look like you're trying a little too hard. Real ballers like to knock one back now and then, but when they do, they don't make a big deal out of it. Ordering one expensive bottle of vodka or rosé is much more classy and impressive than ordering five and then trying to drink them all.


Real ballers know that they don't have to get drunk to have a good time.

, Fake ballers talk about how many women they got with or how many ladies they're going to hit up at the club later that night. Real ballers are confident enough that the ladies just come to them -- they don't have to talk about it. They have a natural confidence that makes the ladies see that they are worth spending time with, and they don't need to talk about all their girls because they're too busy partying with them and treating them right.


Be a gentleman. Hold doors open for girls, hang up their coats, and let them walk in front of you. It's not classy or cool to disrespect women.

, Real ballers are so cool that they don't need to brag about how they spent their weekends or who is on their speed dial. Fake ballers feel the need to mention the pseudo-celebrity they saw once in the bathroom at the club, even if they never actually spoke. If you're a true baller then you can have sick connections that you never have to mention, because people just know that you hang with the right people.


Name dropping shows a lack of confidence. If you're cool with yourself, then you don't need to let the people you hang with up your status.

, Real ballers don't have to fake cool because they just are. They don't talk louder than everyone, strut more than everyone, and to try have two girls chasing after them every five minutes because they know they already have what everyone wants. So sit back, relax, and enjoy your life. If you're trying to prove yourself to everybody, then you're not a real baller, no matter how sick your lifestyle is or how fat your wallet be.


Let other people talk. Talk when you have something to say, but don't kill yourself trying to outdo everybody.

, Real ballers are proud of who they are and everyone knows it. They make eye contact when they talk. They smile. They keep things chill and positive and make people want to be around them. They take care of their health so they feel good inside. They love what they do, where they are, and who they surround themselves with. If you want to be a real baller, then you've gotta remember all that.


You can't become confident overnight, even if you become an overnight success. It takes time to build up to it.

, You don't earn respect by shelling out cash to everyone in sight. You earn respect by earning that cash, working hard, and showing results. It doesn't matter what you do, from playing ball to running your own business. The important thing is that you've done something worthy of respect and that you stay humble throughout the process. Don't talk down to people because you think they are unworthy. Instead, make an extra effort to help the people below you, and you'll be even more respected for it.


Everyone makes mistakes. If you screwed up big time, then apologize and start over again. You don't have to be perfect to be respected. Just work for it all over again.

, Real ballers don't make a big deal about being at the top of the food chain. They recognize when others are in need and they help them out, either financially, morally, or spiritually. They do what they can to make other people happy because they know they are blessed and that not everyone has the luck that they do. They help out family, friends, or even people on the street because they know they can, and they are not selfish with their money.


True ballers are generous. And that doesn't mean paying for bottle service for your thirty closest friends. It means helping out people who really need it.

, Your pants can be baggy basketball or warm up pants, and they'll look good as long as they aren't sweatpants. Keep your pants looking casual and baggy, but make sure to keep 'em clean too. Don't wear them so baggy that you drown in them, either. Just baggy enough to make you look good.


You can decide whether you want to sag your pants or not. Some ballers think this look is overdone. Instead, you can keep your pants up with a nice-looking belt.

, Put on one, two, or three shirts, preferably white tees under another label brand shirt. Make sure the shirt fits well. If you get a pack of 3 shirts, you can just throw them out after a few uses so your look stays fresh. You don't have to show off the labels of your shirts, though. The quality of the shirts will speak for itself.


You can also wear a tank top as one of your layers.

, Wear jewelry like long chains, watches, earrings, or grillz. If you can afford it, you can wear a designer belt, such as Gucci, Fendi, Hermes, or Louis Vuitton. You can also wear some dog tags or chains, but don't overdo it. The right gold watch makes a stronger statement than a million chains.


Any gold or silver jewelry will look good if it's high quality.

, Keep your hair short, or wear it in cornrows braids or a 'fro. Blowouts usually work very good. Fauxhawks are now becoming very popular too. You can also consider a fade. Find a look that makes you look good and don't be afraid to mix it up if you get bored with it. Ballers are always surprising people with their ability to do something completely new and different.

, Wear anything name brand that looks good, preferably basketball shoes. Any of these brands will do: Jordans, Penny Hardaways, Scottie Pippins, Kevin Garnettes, Nike Foamposites and Flightposites. Wearing black socks with these shoes will do the trick.


You can take out the laces from your sneakers, reverse lace them, or find new laces of a loud color.

, Wear a New Era baseball Team Hat and keep the sticker on without keeping the end straight. You can also wear any snapbacks made by Mitchell and Ness, American Needle, and Last Kings.


You can also wear a hat that reps your favorite teams, like a Lakers or a Raiders cap.

, Walk slowly, like you know where you're going but you don't have to rush to get there. Keep your head up, your arms at your sides, and look around you instead of down at the floor or at your phone. Make people notice you, and walk like you own the place and like there's a seat waiting for you at every party. Have decent posture instead of slouching so you look taller and more with it.

, If you have the money, put some nice wheels on it as well. Get a good stereo system for your car too. Don't go on bragging about your car. Let people see it for themselves.

, Ballers are in no rush to get anywhere. A real baller may even drive five miles under the speed limit just because he can. Put your seatbelt on and don't be reckless or risk your life because your life is too important for that.

, When wearing shorts, make sure they go past knee level. Wear Nike elite socks to show off some athleticism. Just don't get socks that match the shoes too much or you'll look like a poser.

, If you want to be a baller, you don't have to go around flaunting all of the labels on your clothes. You should get a nice suit that fits you well and that's from a brand like Hickey Freeman, Brioni, or Robert Talbott. For a more casual suit you can wear Louis, Prada, YSL, and Dior Homme.


Don't pick something too flashy like D&G or Sean John, or you'll look like a label whore.
Remember that your shirt and tie shouldn't match, either.

Don't be afraid of becoming a kid environmentalist.,
Stop the junk mail for your parents.,
Ask friends to reduce junk mail in their houses too.,
Donate.,
Turn off electrical appliances.,
Recycle.,
Save water.,
Do some eco-work.,
Do not litter.,
Start planting.,
Take part in school energy programs.,
Look for other people's ideas to help with green living.",How to Be a Kid Environmentalist," Some people don't understand or they have misunderstandings about the worth of doing our bit for the environment. They may try to make fun of you. If this happens, just stand your ground and tell them firmly but politely that you care about the planet and that you want to make sure that we have a safe and healthy environment to live in. Also remember that some people will never be convinced, so just smile and accept that they cannot move from their notions but this does not mean that you have to give up. Set examples through doing and you may just convince them another way.;
, Junk mail causes extra trash to be produced and you can reduce this. Each day, ask them for one piece of junk mail from the daily mail. Call or email the company which sent the mail, and ask them to remove your house from their mailing list. Explain to your parents that they can use online catalogs or perhaps even consider buying less stuff.

, The easiest way to do this is to create a signature for your emails which reads:


Save the Earth through Junk Mail Reduction. Each day, when you collect your mail, call or email one junk mailer and ask to be deleted from their mailing list. Affix this note to the bottom of each email you send and become a part of the movement!

, Donate some money to environmental causes and to charities that help poverty. Poverty is a major cause of environmental problems also and if you help to stop people living in poverty, you will also be helping to protect the environment. Consider helping a charity that encourages those in poverty to grow their own organic garden. This provides food that is nutritious, budget-wise and also is an enjoyable activity.

, When not in use, turn off or unplug electrical appliances.

, Make sure to recycle things that can be recycled. Learn the recycling numbers on the base of many things such as bottles, boxes, and cans. This will help you to know if your item can be recycled or not. If it cannot be, contact your municipality and ask why they are not recycling some items. Set up a neighborhood petition to get the municipality to change its mind if it will not recycle some things.

, Water can be saved by using water efficient shower heads and sink heads. Ask your parents to replace old faucets, shower heads and sink heads. Again, you can help by doing the research online for them.

, Pick up litter and trash on the ground and recycle what can be recycled. Always wear gloves and use a stick to pick up items rather than putting your hands into holes etc.

, Instead of littering, it is important to recycle items that are recyclable and to properly dispose of other items. Littering is not only unpleasant to look at but it attracts vermin, it makes a mess of animal homes and it is a waste of products that can be reused.

, Plant some native species trees, bushes, and other plants which will provide food and cover for the animals living in your area. Ask your parents to reconsider their lawn and to have native grasses or some other decorative feature that doesn't need a lot of watering or mowing.

, Ask your school to have either a water wise, living wise, or Energy Wise presentation. In the USA, these presentations come with a kit which supplies free items, the water wise kit comes with a water efficient shower head, sink and kitchen aerators, and other items. Ask your school about buying a road. If they do this they have to clean up all the litter.

, You may think that no one cares about the planet but a small group of people, but you are wrong!! A great site for videos that help with eco living is youtube.com, but remember to keep searching and searching. You might end up making a bag made out of t-shirts, for all I know!!

"
"
Look at your friend's music collection, ask them (because you won't know yourself) which is the heaviest and then buy several T-shirts of those bands.,
Join Facebook and Bebo, every time your metal friend suggests a metal/rock/punk band or group, accept the suggestion even though you've never heard of half of them.,
Think that wearing the most outrageous T-shirts and getting noticed is what it is all about.,
Make sure you have a local pub.,
If you are in your local and your real metal friends come to visit you for a few pints, don't draw your usual amount of attention to yourself in case you have to prove yourself metal, you won't be able to and will look more of a fool to your metal friends who think you are a fool anyway.,
Wear your clothes like a uniform.,
DO NOT LEARN HOW TO HEADBANG!,
Take an interest (but don't actually start to study these things and know about their symbolism, just the look is needed) in the symbols you associate with being a metaller, but in reality, they aren't really.,
Try not to care, you do care but at every opportunity say that you don't.,
Wear lots of jewelry.,
Decorate your house like a teenager would decorate his/her bedroom.,
Think that being a biker is the same as being a metaller, but it's not!,
Make sure to neglect to tell anyone that does think you are a metaller that you are in fact a dance head, raver, mix master supreme, disco freak.",How to Be a Fake Metaller," You only need the shirts, you can pretend you listen to the music. NOTE: Pretending is a big part of this so be prepared.;
, Then, when questioned about liking them, act very defensively, almost aggressive. Make ridiculous comments that show your ignorance and lack of knowledge on the subject, i.e.; when someone describes a certain band as dross, reply with, ""I like all kinds of music, even dross"", thinking that dross is the name of a band.

, Get tattoos that have no meaning to you but will look so cool when ""ordinary folk"" see them, they will think you are really hard, but what do they know?

, Make sure that whenever a band is playing you call out only the names of the bands you know your friends listen to because you do not know the names of songs worth listening to. If there is a jukebox, only play Metallica ""because every metaller likes them"".

, The truth is, they are too kind to say something and you are too stubborn or stupid to notice that they know!

, Always dress ""rough, scumbag like, hard as nails, ridiculous"", even when going to weddings, christenings or funerals. Never deviate from this because people will think you are not a metaller. Try to draw as much attention to your clothes as possible as often as possible. Say things like ""Is no one gonna say anything about my T-shirt lads?"" or ""Look at this. Don't you think it's cool?"".

, To be a fake metaller, you must be awkward while headbanging. You must not be able to let the music reach inside you and rattle your bones. To be a FAKER, it cannot move you. Only you must move your body stiffly and think you look like your metal friends who are thrashing the shit out of the dance floor. In fact, when they are up there doing their thing, just stand around trying to look hard and drinking.

, Skulls. The Grim Reaper. Monsters. Bad language. Death. Destruction. Etc etc. If possible, try all of these.

, Metallers ARE people so they do in fact care about things. Some things more than others and some people care about somethings more than other people care about them. It doesn't matter for you though because you are only PRETENDING to not care.

, Rings, chains, badges and such. The more the better. If you don't wear these things, nobody will think you are a metaller.

, Basically, lots of posters and flags depicting Death and/or monsters and so on should adorn every room in your house. Especially the main room visitors will see. You want them to think that you are ""so cool and definitely a metaller"".

, It never will be either.

, That you were for a while the same as everyone else. A clone. A sheep. You ""fitted in"". You had a skinned head and no facial hair. You had a gold chain and tight fitting shirt, smart jeans and smart shoes. You ate healthy food to keep your body looking nice for the ladies.

Live by a bro code.,
Find your neighbors and build up a brommunity.,
Learn the proper bro-shake.,
Be reliable.,
Say what you mean.,
Always be rallying.,
Find bro inspirations.,
Try to make every day epic.",How to Be a Bro1," Every bro's gotta have a code. It's the thing that unites and binds and solidifies the concept of the bro, separating bro from the common beasts and squirrels of the world. Your bro code is up to you and your bros, as well as the punishments for transgressing, but a few rules are generally universal when it comes to bros.


Never mess with your bro's date, sister, or mother
Always have a bro's back
Always take wingman responsibilities seriously
Bros won't make other bros look bad in front of girls
Bros don't let bros drive drunk;
, Bros gotta stick together. The number one requirement for being a bro? Surround yourself with other brosephs, brahs, and brosiehs. Get a close-knit community of friends to hang out with and support each other. Leave no bro behind.


Lots of bros join fraternities in college, but it's not a requirement. Wherever you can, find like-minded male friends that you can bond with on a deep level. That might mean joining a fraternal organization of some kind, but you can also find male friends at work, church, the garage, or school.
Intramural sports are great for meeting guys with similar interests. Likewise, if you're a gym rat, hang around the weight room to meet up with lifting buddies. You can have some school bros, some gym bros, a different set for every situation.

, When two bros meet, they don't shake hands like a couple of preachers. And they certainly don't hug. They bro-shake. It's like a combination hug, high-five, and arm-wrestling match. In other words, perfect for bros.


To execute the bro shake, high-five your friend about chest high, at a 45 degree angle, grasping his hand as if you were about to arm-wrestle. Don't let go. Flex your guns. Think of the bicep-bulging scene in Predator where Schwarzenegger meets Carl Weathers.
Next, keeping your hands grasped, use your other hand to pat your bro's back one time, hard, in a half-embrace. Your arm-wreslte hand-shake will still be between you, so it won't be a full on hug. A bro-hug, a bro-shake, whatever you want to call it, it's cool.

, You get a call from your good buddies across town, stranded and beaten up after getting in a bar fight? Your date night is over, bro. You need to get in your car and go help out. A good bro is always reliable to be there for his good friends, coming through in a pinch with a helping hand, advice, or the right socket wrench.

, The world is full of too many complicated things. Conversing with your bros shouldn't be one of them. Communicate openly with your other bros and don't make talking a challenge, full of codes and misconceptions. If you're pissed that your bro borrowed your car and didn't fill it up with gas, say, ""Dude, next time fill it up."" If your bro's personal hygiene habits are falling off a bit, all you need to do is say, ""Dude, it's called a shower. Take one."" Get to the point, cut to the chase, speak from the heart.


Don't get offended when other bros cut you the same courtesy. Be thankful you can have friends who'll tell you what you need to hear without sugar-coating it. Think of it as a BS-free zone, not like your other bros are trying to be rude. Don't take it personally if it's the truth.

, Just like Joe Montana in the Super Bowl, Andretti at the Indy 500, or Michael Jordan in the playoffs, good bros can't stop and won't stop. Whether you're partying, working out, or plugging through another round of Madden on Xbox, a bro is always coming from behind and charging through the finish line. Work hard to improve your stamina so you can be full of energy, regardless of the situation.


Partied a little hard last night, but it's your buddy's birthday tonight? Probably best to make it a nice quiet night in and watch Dancing With the Stars. Kidding. Get off the couch, dude. Pop a Red Bull, take a shower, and get ready to celebrate your bro's most recent trip around the sun.
Feeling lazy at the gym? Pump your headphones full of Guns 'n Roses, Eminem, Led Zeppelin, and whatever tunes will get you pumped to work out to your fullest. Don't waste time in the gym. Sweat is just weakness leaving your body.

, Every bro should have some famous bros to look up to, swipe lingo from, and in general idolize as the pinnacles of brodom.Some classics bros include:


Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps
Tim Tebow, Johnny Manziel, Derek Jeter, and Chad Johnson
Will Smith, Channing Tatum, Matthew McConaughey
The bros from Epic Meal Time
Dane Cook, Jim Belushi, and Joe Rogan

, A bro is just like a regular dude, except more exciting. You've got to be in constant search of that next epic moment, tweaking every situation to make it just a little more perfect.


Don't ""go out for dinner"" with your bros, but make epic eating occasions. Seek out 72 oz. steak-eating challenges, or spicy-food eating challenges to make it competitive. Never let the loser live it down.
Don't ""go to class,"" seek out epic new ways of integrating information. Research optimum workout routines to maximize your learning retention and record lectures on your iPod while you multi-task in the lecture hall. Make your presence in class epic by answering questions, arguing with the prof, and making your presence known.
Don't ""go on dates,"" go on adventures. Dinner and a movie? That's for regular dudes. Take the cutie from econ white water rafting, or ask the hot barista at your favorite coffee shop to go to a metal concert. Tonight. Take your semi-serious date to the racket-ball court and see what you're made of.

"
"
Get in shape.,
Always find a good reason to wear athletic gear.,
Go for the gentleman bro look.,
Try out the motocross bro.,
Try out the country-cowbro look.",How to Be a Bro2," Bros take fitness and health seriously. Proper fitness allows you to defend yourself, compete regularly, and show off your lean physique when you wear those muscle-shirts. Focus on strength training, cardio, and endurance training to lose pounds and get cut. Buy a couple tickets to the gun show, baby.



Develop a workout routine and stick to it a couple times a week. Your energy will improve, and you'll be the best possible version of yourself.
You don't have to be a buff guy to be a bro. If you're small or big, you can find similar bros and bro-down together. You might not be able to make friends at the gym like some other bros, but you can use your other bro traits to make up for it.

, It's easy, it's cool, and it's versatile. Athletic gear is the uniform on the field and the uniform off the field, for most bros. That means basketball shorts, jerseys, Nike shoes, and gym sandals. If it's comfortable and made for the locker room, then it's made for the streets. The athletic bro will usually be spotted in:


Training pants, with buttons up the side
Jerseys, team shirts, tank-tops with Greek letters
Backwards baseball cap

, Bros from more cosmopolitan origins will often have a slightly different vibe. Think less Dave Matthews Band concert parking lot and more Martha's Vineyard sailboat club. Different vibe, same bro-ness. This bro will typically be wearing:


White polo shirts
Ralph Lauren cargo shorts
Sperry shoes
Lacrosse gear
Ray Bans

, Gear-head, metal-listening, So-Cal bros have their own style and vibe altogether. You can see these sorts of bros at the Van's Warped Tour or at the skatepark. Typically, they'll be decked in the following attire:


Long Dickie's shorts
Skate shoes, like Van's or Airwalk
Flat-brim hats
Black socks, pulled all the way up

, City bros are different than country bros. If you've grown up listening to George Jones in the back of your dad's F-150, it's unlikely you'll be running around wearing all the Greek-letter gear. Get real. The cowbro can typically be seen wearing:


Wranglers, loose-fit
John Deere caps and shirts, tucked in
Cowboy boots

"
"
Drink responsibly.,
Treat women respectfully.,
Eat a well-balanced diet.,
Drive responsibly.",How to Be a Bro3," Being able to drink yourself into a blackout isn't a sign that you're a good bro, it's a sign that you've got a drinking problem. While it may be true that bros tend to enjoy a few brews when they get together, it's important to know your limits and stay on the right side of them. Limit your drinking, never drive after drinking, and stay responsible.


Aside from all the legal and responsibility problems over-drinking can get you into, it's also just a bad idea for your health. All those beers are full of empty calories, meaning that you'll develop an unbecoming bro-belly from all those empties and late night Taco Bell runs when you get the drunk munchies. Try to cut back.

, This is a big one, bros. If there's one thing that gives you a bad name, it'll be treating women poorly, talking down to them, objectifying them, and being rude in general. Learn to talk to women one-on-one, calmly and with courtesy.


Showing off is a turn off. You don't have to beat on your chest like an ape or an idiot to attract women. Let your natural masculinity and your charm do the work, not your goofy machismo.
Don't assign numbers to girls. It's disrespectful, crude, and will work against you.

, Bros love dude-food, it's true. Bacon, french fries, pizza. What more could a bro need? The answer is fiber, green vegetables, and vitamins. While eating a diet rich in red meats and potatoes sounds great for building muscle and throwing barbecues, it's also a shortcut to bowel and prostate cancer. Bummers for any bro.



Try and introduce cooking into your routine. Bros should be good cooks! Experiment with making your own food and eating as healthily as possible. Avoid frozen dinners, fast food, and other junk food.

, Peeling out at stoplights, cutting off cars in traffic, or honking your horn at hotties you see on the sidewalk doesn't make you cool bro, it makes you a dork. A bro shouldn't have to compensate for feelings of inadequacy by revving his car engine. Work on your self-confidence instead of messing around in your car.

Be prepared for critics.",How to Be a Hipster," Fashion is just as important as your taste in music. While shopping at vintage stores remains a staple for many hipsters, this is not a given, nor does it need to be a part of the hipster wardrobe.


Avoid buying labeled gear from stores run by the label itself (so very not nice consumerism). Instead, look for independent retailers because supporting obscure retailers is ""totally deck"". For example, buy from local mixed fashion stores near you.
Be sure to assess what you're wearing. Are you layering? Are you buying local? What's the color or specific style this season? Are you advertising something on your shirt that hipsters identify with?;
, These can be for anyone of any gender identity. Hipster men tend to be as skinny as the women.


Note that guy hipsters actually probably wear skinny jeans more than the girls (girls prefer leggings).
Alternatively, for women, high-waisted pants (a.k.a. ""mom jeans"") may also be worn.

, Hipsters love ironic eye-wear such as shutter shades, over-sized plastic framed glasses, Buddy Holly glasses, and most commonly authentic Ray Ban Wayfarers in all the colors of the rainbow.


Some hipsters wear eyeglasses even though they have 20/20 vision! In this case, pop out the lenses or make sure they're just regular glass.

, For tops, the following are good picks: band shirts such as Pink Floyd, Metallica, Van Halen, etc, plaid shirts, cowboy shirts, flannels, and anything in gingham, plaid, checkers, paisley, vintage florals.


Many hipsters sport tops with appliques, images of animals or forests, other images, characters from children's TV, and ironic sayings or even book covers.
Fitted hoodies are perfect, too.

, Consider a vintage floral or lace dress. Granny's closet is definitely a good source; however, you should know how to sew and restyle vintage clothing to fit you.

, Hipster shoes include cowboy boots, combat boots, vintage shoes, unusual shoes, and a range of flats.


Converse are no longer hipster. They look great and you can wear them pretty much anywhere, but since everyone wears them, they aren't hipster.
If it's trainers you're after, see Classic Reebok.
High heels should be at least 5 inches (12.7 cm) in height, and ankle booties are popular too. Cute sandals, Keds (tennis/sand shoes), boots, and granny boots are not only more practical but also show how little effort you've put forth (even if it took you ages to find the perfect pair).

, There is a wide range of accessories, including large flower headbands, neon nail polish, pins, bright belts, black nail polish, bird necklaces, patterned and colorful leggings, etc.


Don't forget your plugs, piercings, and random scars supposedly acquired through woodwork and other carpentry-like endeavors.
Appropriately ironic accessories are mandatory, such as things kids would take to school, like an animal image on a lunchbox.
Essentials include a courier bag (not a backpack), preferably something from Freitag, that can fit your MacBook, iPhone, and vinyl LPs (never CDs) of your current favorite band.

, Layering or wearing things that don't match together is very hipster. It's that ""I can't be bothered"" look that actually takes some planning until you get into the habit.


Remember that a hipster's outfit never needs adjustment should you decide to go to the beach—keep all of your urban accompaniments for the sand and surf to ironically stick out of your element.

, Some people associate hipsters with hippies and assume that they don’t shower regularly or otherwise don’t practice proper hygiene. This is a misconception. Though some hipsters participate in the no shampoo movement (which is still very clean), most practice normal hygiene (with bonus artisanal and environmentally-friendly soaps!).


While hipsters do shower regularly and clean their teeth, they're just less interested in forking out money for hairstyling, spa sessions, pedicures/manicures, and large make-up kits because these are signs of conforming to cultural ideals of beauty.
Arguably, hipsters aren't so interested in ""making the most of their assets"" because they see their entire self as an asset; from a self-esteem point of view, this is actually a rather healthy outlook.


, Messy hairdos are just fine. The ""bed look"", long unkempt hair, and hair that resists any attempts to stay flat without chemicals are acceptable looks.


Blurring gender lines with haircuts and styles is part of the hipster culture.
Greasy hair is considered okay by some in the hipster culture. That doesn't mean you need to concur and a squeaky clean but uncombed do might be more your thing.
For men, large beards and/or waxed mustaches are not a must but are preferred if one can grow them.
Some hipsters like to dye their hair in an obvious way.


, Consider growing your own food or turning vegetarian. Use compost if possible. Eating meat isn't always popular with the hipster culture, and many hipsters tend to be vegetarian or vegan. If you do eat meat, you must assert that choice as a cynical transcendence of vegetarians' futile attempts to save the world.


Fruit, coffee, Asian food, etc., are all hip foods.
If you have absolutely no space to grow your own produce (not even a balcony or a windowsill), go to a natural foods market instead.
Often, hipsters are foodies and love making gourmet meals. If you can't cook, consider getting some good cookbooks today.

, This takes a mixture of frugality, respect for some of the past, and a desire to demonstrate that new things don't define you. Naturally, you'll need to wrestle with the inconsistency of this step with the fact that loving shiny new Apple products and brand new clothes from certain labels is also a side of a true hipster, but since we're all contradictory deep down, the sooner we grasp these contradictions and accept them, the more whole a person we'll be.


Commonly known old things associated with hipsters include Parliament cigarettes (and a devil-may-care attitude about smoking laws), Pabst beer, grandparent's clothing (or thrift store finds), bicycles with fixed gears (often ridden to the night clubs), analog cameras, and recycling and reusing almost anything (ingenuity, common sense, and fun comes into this).
Learn to play a musical instrument, the more obscure, the better. Example: ukulele > guitar and mandolin > piano. Act like it's no big deal that you can play when others are amazed.

, Hipsters are into ""niche consumerism"". If your purchase helps local retailers, the environment, the mom and pop retailer, and the craft sellers down the road, then it's hipster.

, Hipsters tend to be in their teens through to their 30s. This is part of today's ""extended adolescent"" era, consisting of existential angst, searching for purpose and inner worth, and asking the meaning of everything.


Of course, this doesn't mean you can't be a hipster at an older age, but the fact that as you age you get less bothered and upset about the way the world works, or doesn't work, probably means you're a) not so keen to be labeled anything, b) not in need of belonging to any sub-culture, and/or c) less angry than you used to be. It's quite possible you're also very discreetly steering the rudder of your own teens going through ""issues"" and you're less than keen to adopt more of the same for yourself.

, Hipsters tend to congregate in very urban settings and they're connected globally thanks to the Internet. In the USA, you'll tend to find hipsters in major metropolitan centers where ""anything goes"". Be where there are independent art galleries, movie houses, bands, and people.


Think New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, and especially the Brooklyn, N.Y. suburb of Williamsburg (known as the unofficial hipster capital of the world). Places like Glasslands and Pianos will be right up your alley. Los Angeles is also acceptable but be careful not to get sucked into the California culture.
For less urban USA, try to find any moderately large college town; and in some states, a college town might be the only liberal part of the state such as Austin, TX, or Lawrence, KS.
In the UK, London is your spot, in Canada, try Montreal, in Australia, try Melbourne and in New Zealand, try Wellington.Do not force yourself to live or go to these places or countries for the sake of being a hipster. Besides from being too uneconomical (especially if you live on the other side of the world), you can actually begin being a hipster in your place. One of the advantages is if your place knows less about hipsters, the fewer the people who will be discriminating or criticizing you. Take note that the Internet will always be your best friend.


, Aim to go to college, as hipsters tend to be well educated in such areas as liberal arts, graphic art, or math and science.


Do a lot of reading, even if it means sitting in the local bookstore using their space and not actually purchasing the books you're siphoning up knowledge from. Seek to go to higher level education if you're in your element at college.
Going to the library (especially small, local libraries) is a good option because you don't have to pay and you can bring books back when you are finished. Also, they don't mind you just sitting reading without even taking a book out- this is normal in libraries.
Hipsters are a subculture that uses more of their right brain than the rest of the society, thus, many hipsters base their career choices around music, art, or fashion. While these areas of work aren't essential choices, they are probably a natural outlet for a hipster's creativity.
Education is what helps a hipster to be dismissive about the hue and cry of others; they know it's just history repeating itself, or it's all much ado about nothing.

, Hipsters tend to sense what's worthwhile before the trend or item becomes more popular. Many bands become famous only after hipsters first flock to their unknown performances. Many clothing trends were started by hipsters, only to be hijacked later by mainstream fashion houses. Many technical gadgets are taken up by hipsters first, only to become mainstream goodies later.


Of course, the irony of being an early adopter hipster is that once the trend or item becomes mainstream, it's time to move on to something else obscure and unrecognized. That's the trouble with being such an independent spirit; you trail blaze but you also have to keep moving on.
If you're really good at something like math, physics, medicine, psychology, political analysis, eco-awareness, etc., you might find yourself making amazing discoveries that are light years ahead of everyone else's thinking. You know deep down that you've cottoned onto something that really matters and that it makes sense but others are not convinced because it's the ""great unknown"". Rest easy and be determined in your knowledge that some day, others will come round to your discovery.

, One of the key elements of being hipster has been to avoid the label. Don't go around proclaiming your allegiance; to do so would be to start allying with those who like neatly tied-up boxes denoting who is what, when, and where.


The moment you define yourself too clearly is the moment you begin to stagnate and risk being captured by the status quo. Many a hipster will therefore deny their ""hipster-ness"" whenever possible.
To preemptively ward off the mockers, some hipsters have taken to extending their sense of irony to include even themselves by acknowledging and mocking their own hipsterdom (for example, wearing a tee that says ""I hate hipsters""); that way, by mocking themselves first, no one else can effectively do it (reclaiming the negative).

, There is a strong community aspect to hipster culture. If you want to find out about the best new bands or a great local coffee shop, make sure to stay active in the community to get good recommendations and stay ahead of the trends.


When some new, obscure band is on Pitchfork (preferably before), you should know about it.
Check out Brooklyn Vegan (even if you don't live there), Stereogum, Gorilla vs. Bear, and the Hype Machine as often as possible, but don't make it obvious that you check them every five seconds.

, Your reading sources are important because what you read connects you with other hipsters, informs you about cultural issues, and keeps you knowledgeable. There's a lot to be read out there, so sort the wheat from the chaff and get into the things that matter most. Things to read include:


Hipster magazines, such as Vice, Another Magazine, and Wallpaper. Foreign magazines are good too.
Great books and poetry by people like Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Norman Mailer. Any other books you think are great. Any books, period; reading books sets hipsters apart from a lot of people. Visit the political science, anthropology, and sociology sections of the bookstores and local library frequently.
Blogs by other hipsters. You might also be inspired enough to write your own blog frequently.

, Watch independent and foreign films, as well as attending independent theater productions, such as shows by Ann Liv Young. Watch Wes Anderson, Hal Hartley and Jim Jarmusch movies.

, Indie music is a big part of what being a hipster is all about. Turn to the endless and ever-renewing list of independent artists in the music scene, especially in the areas of nu-rave, minimalist techno, independent rap, nerdcore, Elephant 6, garage rock, classic rock (Beatles usually), and punk rock. Also, remember, they don't have to be famous to be good. Browse amateur videos on YouTube, and you may find your style.


Hipster artists of note include Lana Del Rey, Grizzly Bear, Marina & The Diamonds, Pink Floyd, Stray Kites,The Xx , Nirvana, La Roux, M83, Neon Indian, Neon Neon, King Khan, and the Shrines. Imagine Dragons, and Bastille are great examples of non-hipster bands, because the main part of being hipster is listening to bands that no one has ever heard of. Try Days n Daze, King Krule, Mitski, ikea graveyard, Waxahatchee, Dollar Signs, spoonboy, Not Half Bad, or Pope instead.
Music blogs like Gorilla vs. Bear, Indiehere, /mu/, and Stereogum may help you with choosing suitable bands to listen to. Meeting people who are already into these bands will help you as well.
Perhaps the most popular hipster music website is Pitchfork Media. If they give an album a good rating, it must be quite hip.
One good way to decipher whether or not an artist is hipster is if your non-hipster friends to have never heard of them.
Feel free to listen to the music of other countries as well, since most mainstream songs of this decade came out of America, Britain and South Korea.

, Hipsters love to use Blogspot, Tumblr, Instagram and WordPress, Ello, as well as taking photos with their Holga cameras and making cross-processed and ""dream-like"" pictures. Social media can also be a great way to find new things to enjoy, before they become mainstream.

, The reason to ""hook up"" with other hipsters is that you're much more likely to connect and see eye-to-eye on a range of issues. The all-American muscle guy or sorority-style tanned blond are not likely to be your type, so a fellow hipster is the answer.


Note that if you are already in a relationship with someone, there is no need to end it on account of them not being hipster, obviously. But if you're looking for a relationship, always consider that you're probably going to have a lot of intimate discussions with them, so having the same hipster ideology could be a point of shared interest.

, If you want to spot a hipster, just turn around the next time you're at a show and see them standing in the back discussing Stella or Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR) in a can. Sometimes, if the music and setting is right, you will witness hipsters engaging in dance movements.


Hipster dancing, if done correctly, does not use so much of the hips as it does the upper body and arms. Lots of swinging your head back and forth but only do this if you're not humiliated easily (and as a hipster, you really shouldn't care).
Although you'll rarely see hipsters dancing at shows, they tend to enjoy separate dance parties where they can dance to an array of more upbeat hipster dance music.


, While there will be many variations—part of the reality of hipster culture is that things change constantly—there are some things that are useful to know:


Remember to use perhaps the most important hipster line: ""I liked them before they were cool."" Another good line given the recent spate of disasters is to say something like: ""I donated to Haiti... before the disaster.""

Namedrop often. Talk about all the obscure bands you like that nobody you know has heard of. When your friends talk about a band you're unfamiliar with, just say you've heard of them but not actually heard them. Look them up the next time you have a chance to. It'll give you more cred.
Insult a lot of bands. If you love everything you'll seem like a fanatic. Make sure to give off a vibe that you're too cool and elite for a lot of bands.
If you would like to seem more educated and elite there is the key phrase "" I liked their first EP, but pretty much after that I never got into them.""
Use made-up words as often as possible. Or use real words that no one really knows the meaning of unless they look them up (for example, pulchritudinous, cordiform, and petrichor).

, A hipster is known for their strong sense of irony and sarcasm. When asked a question, refuse to answer directly; instead, obfuscate, ask a question in return, or just be plain sarcastic.


Be sure to layer on the smirk to indicate your lack of seriousness, because it's possible for the other person to mistake your sarcasm for sincerity.
For example: When in a theater watching a movie, and the person next to you turns to say, ""Oh, my God, that was so cool! Did you see that?"", in a dry tone, reply something along the lines of, ""No, I paid $12.50 to stare at the ceiling.""
Watch British comedies for examples of good uses of sarcasm you can borrow. Unless you're already British, in which case you should be just fine.
Have a sense of humorous perspective and don't take yourself too seriously. Hipsters are often parodied, so knowing how to laugh at derision will help a lot.

, Be aware that hipsterism is frequently parodied or derided because hipsters bother some people. You're going to need to get used to disdainful attitudes and to work out the ways in which you're most comfortable responding.


There will often be an insistence that your sub-culture is ""less than"" whatever it is the hater ""believes"" in.
Given the tendency for hipsters to follow progressive politics, it's likely you'll encounter occasional conservative disdain, so it's probably a good idea to brush up on your responses to any standard ridicule.
As for people who poke fun at your fashion sense, remind the so-called trendy mass that their worn and torn jeans fashion was created by children who are little more than slaves in some sweatshop and if they want to contribute to that, they’re welcome to. If they point out the fact that your Apple products were also produced in sweatshops, change the subject to an obscure band they've never heard of.
Recognize the root of the problem. Realize that a lot of people who attack you may have deep insecurities about their own place in society and have very mixed ideas of what culture is, or how they reconcile the variant elements of culture with their own lifestyle and preferences. Practice a little compassion.
Know that geeks have an odd relationship with hipsters. While some are disdainful, other geeks recognize the overlap of the cultures."
"
Be direct and assertive.,
Dress appropriately.,
Pay attention to your footwear.,
Avoid the tourist traps.,
Know how places are pronounced.,
Be a baseball fan.,

Treat sidewalks like freeways.,

Don't panic about the vermin.,
Don't make eye contact and smile at everyone.,

Don't pull out a map.,
Remember Manhattan is safe.",How to Act Like a New Yorker," More than anything else, New Yorkers know what they want. When you're standing in line to order food, have your order finalized before you reach the counter. Don't be shy about ordering a taxi, crossing the street or getting onto the subway. All these things might require a bit of jostling, but if you want it done, you'll push through.


Don't set out to do things with a stormy attitude, but do set out to get them done, no matter what.
Know that assertive doesn't equal rude.;
, Most New Yorkers wouldn't be caught dead wearing an ""I <3 NY"" T-shirt, or any item of clothing purchased on vacation (such as clothes from Disneyland). Your safest bet is to wear black, dark blue or some shade of grey. When the weather is warmer, white and beige are good choices, but don't be afraid to show off your style in flattering colors or prints.

, Particularly in Manhattan, you won't see people wearing sneakers (too casual) or flip-flops (because they bring your feet too close to the dirty sidewalk). Loafers, heels, boots, and heeled sandals are common.

, Visiting certain places will automatically label you a tourist. If you’re okay with that, then go, take a selfie and a quick look around. Otherwise, steer clear of the following:Times Square
Southeast corner of Central Park
Theme restaurants, such as Jekyll and Hyde or Bubba Gump Shrimp, or restaurants with lines of obvious tourists like Shake Shack.
Top of the Empire State Building. Go to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade instead.
The bull statue on Wall Street
Certain Broadway shows, such as Wicked or The Phantom of the Opera
Little Italy in lower Manhattan. Little Italy in the Bronx will not label you a tourist and is known for real Italian food.
Rockefeller Plaza

, There’s not many of these rules, but they're important to keep in mind. The correct pronunciation makes it less obvious you’re not a native New Yorker.


SoHo, or south of Houston Street, is pronounced ""SO-hoe,"" and no-no rhymes with it.
Know how to refer to the boroughs. There are five parts of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx. Only the Bronx should be preceded by ""the""; you would never say ""the Staten Island,"" for instance.
""Staten"" is pronounced ""STA-ten,"" not ""STATE-en.""

, In the 1950's, when New York had 3 baseball teams, fans of each were generally based on demographics. For example, Yankee fans were white, Catholic, and from the Bronx, Manhattan, or Staten Island. Now, the city has two teams, but some New Yorkers are still fans of the Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers, even though they have since moved to other cities. Other displaced fans swore allegiance to the Mets.Even if you don't actually like baseball, be prepared to talk about it. It's a common topic of conversation between strangers or acquaintances.
If you do, don’t broadcast that you root for the Boston Red Sox, the Chicago Cubs or the Philadelphia Phillies.

, Not only does the lack of traffic spaces make driving a car in New York impractical, but traffic sits in gridlock more often than not. Call a taxi as a last resort; otherwise, walk or take the subway. It will save you time and hassle in the end.

, Because there are so many people on New York sidewalks during the day, the only way to keep some sort of order is to treat it like a freeway. In general, stay to the right side and don’t stop suddenly.If you're walking slowly, move further to the right so that people in a hurry can pass you.
If stopping altogether, find a place to ""pull over"" near a streetlight or awning.
Walk side-by-side with no more than two people, if you're with a large group.
When you walk out of a building, don't just step directly into traffic. Look for an opening.

, Don't just call a phone number for a cab - by the time it finds you, you probably could have walked to your destination and back. Instead, hail one off the street. Flag one down by stepping off the curb, making eye contact with the driver, and raising your hand slightly (you don't have to have your arm totally flapping out). When the cab stops, get in quickly.

, Taxis have a row of lights on top of their cabs. No lights means the taxi is currently engaged. If the two outer lights are lit, the taxi is off duty. If the center light is lit, highlighting a number, the cab is available for service., Taxis will line up in popular areas. Do not just grab any taxi in the middle of the line - walk to the front of the queue and hire that taxi. The drivers are all waiting their turn, and it's your job to pick whoever's next., New Yorkers don't give exact addresses when they get into a cab. Instead, tell the driver which street you want, as well as the two cross streets you'd like to be between. For example, you could say ""51st Street between 7th and 8th."" The cabbie will know exactly what you mean.

, Many times it’s easier to grab a cab or take the subway in NYC, but you can easily request a ride from your smartphone. Load your credit card information with the ride sharing app of your choice and get picked up with a tap of your touchscreen. Because of their popularity, drivers are normally close by., The NYC subway system is the most extensive in America, making it quick and easy to use. Most stations will have maps posted, but you can always ask a fellow traveler for directions. Buy a Metrocard from vending machines at the entrance, keep it loaded in your pocket, and master the art of swiping it smoothly through the turnstile., New York is significantly safer than it was in the '70s and '80s. However, there are still places you probably want to avoid. Brooklyn has the most neighborhoods with high violent crime cases with the Bronx coming in a close second. Here are a few places to steer clear of:Hunts Point
Vinegar Hill
Fordham
Greenwood Heights

, In general, it's safe to assume that everyone you meet is in a hurry. If you need directions, most New Yorkers will probably help you. However, keep your question short and to the point.

, There's an old saying that says you'll be within 5 feet (1.5 m) of a rat no matter where you go in New York. While the rat problem might not be that extreme, you will occasionally see rats and cockroaches in places such as subway platforms. In general, respond with nonchalance. Most cities have rats, because large populations of them like to set up house for entire blocks.The only exception to this rule is if the rat or cockroach is on you or near your food. In that case, make an enormous fuss (as you might be naturally inclined to do) and demand that someone help you get rid of it immediately.

, You're going to pass a lot of people on the street, and friendliness will get tiring. Besides, it’s important to not open yourself up to salespeople, beggars or pick pockets. Stay focused on what you need to do and where you need to go.

, If someone catcalls or whistles at you, try to act like it didn't even register with you. Above all, don't look at your harassers. This can only make matters worse. Don't cheer for the subway buskers. Don't give beggars money. Ignore people handing out fliers. You won’t have time to do the things you need to do if you give attention to everyone who wants it.

, If you need directions, look them up discreetly on your phone or ask a somewhat friendly looking New Yorker. Don't pull out an enormous map, because this will only make it obvious you don’t know much about New York City.

, You might see a lot of intimidating things in the East Village of Manhattan, such as prostitutes, drug addicts or graffiti, but you're probably fine. Manhattan in general is well-policed. Most of the crime coming from neighborhoods has to do with late night revelers in Soho and the Meatpacking district.

"
Go for an unkempt look.,
Go shopping at a thrift store.,
Invest in flannel.,
Wear ripped denim.,
Represent your favorite punk bands.,
Layer your clothes.",How to Dress Grunge1," Grunge is defined by a messy, I-don’t-care look that combines punk styles with working-class clothing. If you want to dress grunge, you will have to give up any value you might put into matching or looking too clean.Search the internet for pictures of some of the most famous grungers and grunge band members--Kurt Cobain, Courtney Love, Eddie Vedder, Chris Cornell, William DuVall (of Alice in Chains) etc.;
, Grunge style is all about cheap clothing worn in a careless way. Thrift stores like Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Crossroads are great places to get second-hand clothes that are comfortable and just the right amount of faded. Look for clothes that are a little big on you. Also H&M has some great stuff, just look for clothing from the Divided brand. Avoid brightly colored items of clothing--stick with muted colors and black clothing.


Thrift stores are especially good places to find jeans that can be ripped easily (see Step 4 for more on denim.) Jeans found at a thrift store are generally a little more worn and faded in color--both characteristics of a grungy vibe.

, One of the key pieces in any grunge wardrobe is a flannel shirt. Flannel, which is generally pretty cheap, was incorporated into the grunge look in the 90’s and continues to be reigning king of the grunge style. Look for flannels in muted, slightly faded colors. Both girls and guys can wear an over-sized flannel over a t-shirt or long-sleeved undershirt.A girl-grunge classic look is large, baggy flannel worn over a black t-shirt and a baby doll skirt with big, chunky Doc Marten boots.

, Better yet, make your own ripped denim and wear that. Rip jeans are another staple of the grunge style. Keep in mind that store-bought distressed jeans look different than jeans you are ripped yourself. For a more authentic grunge look, rip your own jeans. Other good grunge-jean qualities to look for are jeans that are faded, a little loose, and acid-washed denim.


In the summer, look for (or make your own) ripped up denim shorts.







, Grunge was born out of a marriage between punk style and working class clothing. Because of this pairing, another grunge staple is the favorite-band-t-shirt. Think grunge groups like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Mudhoney, Sound Garden, PAW, Hole, as well as bands who influenced them (Sonic Youth, Pixies, etc.).One key thing to keep in mind--if you are going to rep grunge bands (and dress like a grunger) you’re going to need to actually listen to the grunge music you are representing. Listen to the classic grunge bands of the late 80’s and early 90’s--but also look into the grunge scene in your area. Start following a local grunge band, or start your own.


, As stated above, grunge is mostly about being comfortable and not caring how you look. A good way to get into the grunge look is by layering your clothing. Wear a big flannel or sweater over a grunge band t-shirt over a long-sleeved thermal (and so on and so forth.) Another good tip to keep in mind--your clothes don’t particularly need to match.

Think about your clothing.,
Wear the shirts that you get for volunteering for things like Green Peace, Habitat for Humanity and other eco volunteer projects.,
Bring a glass or plastic bottle to reuse at school and everywhere else you may go.,
Food is important, also.,
Using what you already have in your closet, you can make a lot for unique, original clothing.,
Make recycling look easy and simple by casually dropping your plastic into the school's recycling bin.

,
Use organic hair products.,
Use non animal tested, mineral makeup.,
Try to use recycled paper as much as possible.",How to Be a Fashionable Eco Girl," Victoria's Secret, Nordstrom, and other popular clothing stores carry an organic line. A lot of times they are made with organic fibers. Pick up some with a cute saying. Mandee's has one that says ""Don't be trashy, recycle"". It's cute, stylish, and environmentally friendly. There's a bunch of tote bags and scarves that are like this.;
, This will show that you are not only in style, but that you really do care about the environment and act on it.

, Decorate it with stickers and rhinestones. You will start a trend and not waste plastic.

, You can eat delicious, organic foods that were grown locally without pesticides. People will wonder where you got such good food. Offer your friends a bite and be hooked.

, This way you're not wasting clothes, and you're get the original look.

,, They will not only make your hair look great but it will also be helping the environment. Mention the ""new shampoo"" that makes your hair ""shiny and great"". Tell them the name and that it is also organic. Some good brands are Organix and Miessence.

, Using them is good for your skin and the Earth.

, You can find recycled notebooks, stationary and even art supplies like pencils made out of old newspaper.

"
"
Have pale skin.,
Use dark eyeliner.,
Make your lips blood red.",How to Look Like a Vampire1," Vampires are supposedly undead and only come out at night. This means their skin is usually paler than the average color of human skin. For a paler complexion, apply a foundation that is lighter than your skin tone. Use a foundation that is one or two shades paler than your skin.Foundation makeup typically comes in a variety of thicknesses and styles, including powder or cream. For vampire purposes use the thicker foundation.
Apply foundation in the center of your face and work toward your jawline. Blend using your fingers or a brush, according to the foundation you're using.
If you have a dark complexion, don't worry! Vampires can have all different sorts of skin tones. Just remember that you're supposed to keep out of the sun, so you want to avoid looking like you have a dark tan.;
, Vampires are dramatic and nocturnal looking. They also can be hundreds of years old. You want to look like you might have seen things nobody could possibly have seen. To pull this off, use dark eyeliner and possibly shadow to pull off the right look.



Apply eyeliner and use a small amount of dark purple eye shadow with black mascara. This will help your eyes ""pop"" a little more than normal, giving you a dramatic look.
Light red eye shadow around the eyes is also good. This hints at the connotations of you looking undead or bloody.
For a more dramatic look, use darker eye shadow on the top of your eyes, and lighter eye shadow underneath your eyes., The lips are usually the most vibrant part of vampire makeup. Depending on your complexion and intended look, use somewhere between a bright red and blood red.


Go for a basic matte style. If preferred, use lip gloss instead of lipstick.

"
"
Scuff up those combat boots.,
Invest in some high-tops.,
Consider wearing stockings with holes in them.,
Wear a beanie (if you feel like it.),
Don’t wear too much jewelry.",How to Dress Grunge2," Grungers generally stick to boots and sneakers that can be laced up (all the better to dance in at grunge shows m’dear.) In particular, combat boots such as Doc Martens (or knock-off Docs) are a big part of the grunge look. If you can find a pair of Docs at a thrift store, you’ve hit the jackpot., Other grungy shoes included beat up high-tops (such as Converse) and other types of shoes that sort of look like Converse but are cheaper. Again, head to a thrift store to see what kind of scuffed up kicks you can find.

, While they definitely won’t keep you warm, ripped up stockings are an essential part of any grunger’s wardrobe. Pair them with a black baby doll dress, some big old boots, and devil red lipstick and you’ll be good to go.

, Grungers aren’t really known for wearing hats, but beanies are sometimes seen gracing the heads of grungy guys and gals. Avoid beanies in bright colors (never, ever choose a neon-pink beanie.)


Not feeling a beanie? Pull out a faded bandana and wrap it around your head, neck, hair, whatever.







, If anything, invest in a cool leather bracelet. If you have your ears pierced, wear simple earrings that aren’t too shiny. Also buy a choker, not those big diamond ones just the basic ones with a little charm if you like. Tattoo chokers are really great. Dressing grunge is not about dressing to impress. You could also consider getting gauges.

Think limp and messy when it comes to hair.,
Grow your hair out.,
Bleach or dye your hair.,
Go heavy on the eyeliner.",How to Dress Grunge3," Like the clothing style, your hair doesn’t need to be anything fancy. Most grungers are known for their long, tangled locks that may or may not be a bit greasy (another part of the grunge style is not caring too much about hygiene.) Let your hair do whatever it wants., As stated above, many grungers let their hair do what it wants. This means not getting it cut and letting curl or fall straight, depending on what’s natural for your head. Go to any grunge show and you’ll be sure to notice that both guys and girls have long hair.

, Some grungers prefer a bleached or dyed look. Go wild and try new colors, or leave your hair bleached blonde-ish white. When your natural color starts growing out, you don’t need to rush to redye your roots. Believe it or not, grown-out dyed hair is a definite characteristic of the grunge scene.



Consider dyeing your hair with Kool-Aid for a grungier look. Doing this will also save you money on fancier hair dyes.

, If you decide you want to wear makeup, go for black eyeliner and mascara. Smudge your makeup after you’ve applied it. You should be going for a I-spend-all-night-at-an-underground-grunge-show-dancing-my-face-off sort of look. This means smudging that eyeliner and eyeshadow.


Some grungers like to rock bright red or dark maroon lipstick.

Wear dark clothes.,
Dress up.,
Have some ""everyday"" vampire clothes.,
Wear the right shoes.,
Dress practically.,
Use some vampire accessories.",How to Look Like a Vampire2," Dark colors are the clothes of vampires. When you look in your closet, try to avoid things with bright, shiny, or pastel colors. Instead lean in favor of things that are solid and dark. You want to look like a creature of the night, not an outlet store model.


Avoid conspicuous brand names and shirts with lots of prints on them. A black t-shirt and black jeans is a great everyday vampire look.
You don't have to wear only black. A little bit of color can work as well. Dark purples and navy blues are just as appropriate as black., Another vampire look is the old, formal, Victorian style. Dress like you're ready to go out for a night on the town. Wearing elaborate, dark toned clothes that might seem out-of-date to give off the impression of the undead. For women, fancy black skirts, black or red tops with bell sleeves, corset tops, and black dresses are great for a vampire style.
For men, try a dark suit jacket or overcoat with antique buttons. Wear dark pants with a white button up shirt for the perfect vampire style.

, You probably don't want to have to dress up like you're headed to a funeral every day. Black skinny jeans with a red, purple, or black top will help to create a more comfortable and contemporary vampire look.


For girls, black skirts with ruby studded designs look awesome, but avoid clothes from the mall that are branded to be ""vampire"" theme. Wearing a Twilight t-shirt won't make you look like a vampire, it'll just make you look like a fan.

, Generally, vampires don't run around in tennis shoes or sneakers. They need the right kind of formal shoes to pull off the right look.


For boys, chunky boots are always the best bet. You can wear dark leather dress shoes, or big black work boots for the right look. Doc Martens will work fine.
For girls, shoes should be dark and dressy. Spiked flats or small heels will work, as well as Black Doc Martens.

, Just because you want to look like a vampire doesn't mean you get to ignore the concerns of weather and dress code at your school. It'd be impractical to dress like you're going to an 18th century ball when it's 90 degrees out.In cold weather, vampires usually wear long velvet cloaks in black or red, or a leather jacket or black trench coat.
When it's hot, you'll probably have to ease up on the heavy makeup and thick layers, but try to stick to wearing black clothes and stay inside.

, A couple of old accessories can help pull together a vampire look and make you look like you've been stalking the back alleys of London since the 1700s. Hit up swap meets, flea markets, and antique stores to find cheap old accessories. Any of the following will be perfect:


Pocket watches
Canes
Antique brooches or pins
Old necklaces
Silver bangles and bracelets
Amulets"

Consider wearing fangs.,
Wear a cape.,
Put on elegant clothing.,
Consider make up.,
Consider wearing contacts.",How to Look Like a Vampire3," Fangs are the hallmark of a vampire. If you’re dressing up like a vampire and you want people to understand what you’re dressing up as immediately, fangs will do the trick. If you do wear fangs, find small ones that don't look tacky. Plastic fangs from the coin machine at the grocery store will just look silly. Tooth caps are much easier to speak with than a full mouthpiece, and they look more natural.
You can also make fangs with acrylic, bits of straw, or even pieces of a fork.
Apply lip stick after fitting your fangs to avoid a mess.

, You want your cape to be either dark colors or red if you would like to stand out a little bit. Capes are another very recognizable component of vampire style. You can make your own cape out of fabric or drape, or buy one at a local party shop. , If you want to really take your costume to the next level you should try wearing elegant and slightly outdated clothing. For men, a ruffled tuxedo shirt, black pants, and black shoes are the perfect costume. You can even wear a cummerbund if it appeals to you. For women, an elegant top and a long flowing skirt will perfectly compliment your fangs and cape. Remember to wear dark colors. , Using eye shadow to darken your eyes and white face paint to make your face look paler will add a huge boost to your vampire costume. You also can paint your nails purple or red. Male or female this will make you look even more haunting.

, The eyes of a vampire are used to hypnotize others, so it's good to give your eyes an extra little something. Sparkly or shiny contacts can be a nice touch for a vampire costume or look. Be as creative as you want with them, and explore different colors and options.


Gold colored contacts will give you the look of a Twilight vampire. If you wish to be a bit more extreme, try blood red, black, or even ""cat eyes.""
Be as unusual and creative as you wish.
Many vampires wear sunglasses during the day, so that the bright sunlight doesn't hurt their eyes.

"

Darken your hair.,
Straighten your hair.,
Consider a nontraditional cut.,
Take care of your hair.",How to Look Like a Vampire4," Black hair is usually the best bet for vampires. It creates a dramatic look contrasting with your lightened face. Consider dyeing your hair a darker shade, or going all the way to jet black.


In some cases, a streak of white, purple, or red can be great for getting a vampire style in your hair. Consider darkening your hair, and include a single streak of color, as though you had your wits scared out of you at some point.
Blondes, redheads, and people with any style and color of hair can achieve good vampire looks. Any color will work, as long as it works well with your complexion., Vampire hair is usually flat, straight, and dramatic looking. Use a hair straightener after you wash and dry your hair if you have curly hair, to pull off that lank hanging look.


All kinds of cuts can look like vampire cuts, although a mysterious, full bodied cut usually has the best effect for women. Loose curls or waves can help create a sultry, mysterious appearance, depending on what you're going for.
Men can pull off long or short styles, but a slicked back medium length cut that's short on the sides will always look dramatic and ominous for a vampire. It's the classic Bela Lugosi look.

, Try having your hair long on one side and shaved near bald on the other, like a punk or techno vampire. You could also try a mohawk or dreadlocks. The vampire look is flexible and can be accepted with anything you're comfortable with. Consider nontraditional styles and cuts for pulling off your own unique look., Vampires are elegant creatures, proud of their appearance and style. However you choose to style your hair, keep it well trimmed, free of split ends, and in a shiny, lustrous condition.


Wash your hair regularly and aim to get cuts at least every couple of weeks.

Raid your parents’ and grandparents’ closets for outfit ideas.,
Look at old pictures for fashion inspiration.,
Mix and match styles and eras.One of the easiest ways to start working retro fashion into your wardrobe is by mixing vintage pieces with modern ones.,
Choose statement pieces.Find a few items that are timeless and classic for a particular era, then build your outfits on top of them.,
Add flair with retro accessories.,
Keep your hairstyle and makeup modern.",How to Dress Retro and Unique1," Older family members can be great sources of inspiration for retro clothing. Even if the sizing of their clothing isn’t right for you, you can still get a lot of ideas about outfit combinations by looking through their wardrobes.


As you go through their items, pay attention to details, like patterns and cuts, that appear often and seem to represent certain eras.
This knowledge can be helpful as you search thrift stores and vintage shops for retro clothing.;
, Ask to see old pictures of your parents or grandparents and evaluate the styles you see. Even better, look through their school yearbooks. These will give you accurate examples of what young people of that particular era really wore.


Look for archived fashion photography online for additional inspiration.
Explore a variety of eras and get a feel for how to capture them accurately.

, For example, you could pair a retro 50s top with jeans you already own and a pair of 60s-era ballet flats or vintage sneakers from the 70s. Experiment with different combinations, but try to choose an element that will unify the ensemble in some way. For instance, the repetition of a particular color or pattern can make an outfit look cohesive.


Sometimes an outfit that doesn’t seem like it would make sense at all can end up looking fantastic once you have it on.
Head-to-toe retro or wearing too much of a particular decade can sometimes make you look like you’re wearing a costume. Mixing and matching eras can help you avoid that.

, When choosing staple pieces, pick items that you fit you well and look natural on you. Since you’ll be wearing them often, choose quality garments that can withstand a bit of extra wear.


Good examples of classic staple pieces are a 50s beaded cardigan, a 60s little black dress, 70s polyester trousers, vintage sneakers from the 80s and so on.
Select timeless pieces that reflect your own personal style.

, Look for retro or retro-inspired jewelry to accent your outfits. As with the clothing, don’t be afraid to mix and match accessories. Look for colorful bangles, headbands, pearls, vintage looking necklaces and dangly earrings. Depending on what era you want to reflect, you could also try feather boas, anything with fringe, lace shawls, cat-eye sunglasses, faux fur, gloves, beaded jewelry, large rings, gypsy scarves and a lot more.


Thrift shops will offer many options to choose from. Experiment with different combinations and find what suits you.
If you’re trying to ease your way into the retro style, accessories are a great place to start.

, Unfortunately, wearing head-to-toe vintage and topping that off with a retro haircut and makeup can sometimes make you look like you're wearing a Halloween costume. If you're concerned about your retro outfits looking too much like costumes, you can prevent this by keeping your hairstyle and makeup modern.


Your unique style is also better preserved when you keep these elements up-to-date.

Choose pieces that flatter your body shape.Some retro items are going to look better on you than others.,
Add vintage embellishments to your modern pieces.",How to Dress Retro and Unique2," Have you always gravitated toward simple pieces or do you prefer to be avant-garde with your style? Do you tend to wear dressy or casual items? Do you like sharp, clean lines or loose and flowing ones? Patterns or solids? Every era has a vast array of styles – there is no “one” look for any decade. You can find something that represents your personality in any of them!


Stay true to what feels natural to you. You should feel like yourself in whatever you’re wearing, not like someone playing dress up.
Choose items that appeal to you rather than selecting pieces just because they ""look retro.""

, Experiment with anything that catches your eye, but whenever you find something that works really well for you, look for other items similar to it. For example, if you discover that loose and flowing 60s blouses look great on you, you could search for similar styles in different colors and other cuts.


As you discover additional pieces that are flattering, continue to add to your retro wardrobe and develop your own unique style.
Select vintage pieces that fit you well and highlight your best features.Whenever possible, try on a garment before buying it. Don’t be afraid to alter pieces that you really like so that they fit you perfectly., Instead of revamping your entire style and replacing your entire wardrobe, think about adding retro touches to clothing you already own. Try adding patches to your jeans, changing the buttons on a shirt, embellishing a jacket with fringe and so on. Get creative!


Try repurposing some of your current clothing with retro elements bought from a thrift store. For instance, you could sew a 60s style shirt collar onto a top you already own.

Check out thrift stores and charity shops.,
Shop at dedicated boutiques and antique shops.Boutiques that specialize in retro and vintage clothing can be excellent resources for building your wardrobe.,
Assess the condition of used clothing.Always run your hand over the fabrics to check their condition before you make a purchase.,
Shop for vintage items online.Local thrift shops can only offer so much in the form of quality retro pieces.,
Be aware of sizing differences.The sizing systems for vintage clothing are generally not identical to modern sizing systems.",How to Dress Retro and Unique3," The best local resources for retro clothing are thrift shops, Salvation Army stores and resale shops.These places also have the lowest prices, but a little digging is usually required to unearth quality items. Don’t be overwhelmed by the massive selection, but be prepared to really dig in. Move boxes around, look under things and pull out clothing from the bottom of the bins. You never know what you might find!


Check the glass cabinets near the registers, as well. These are generally locked, and for good reason – the best things are often in them.
Find out from store management how often they replenish their stock and check back frequently., The same is true for antique shops. The selection is often much better and less digging is required to find the good stuff. Unfortunately, you can also expect the price tags to be higher than what you’d find at a thrift shop. If you’re considering making a significant purchase at a boutique, ask the shop assistant to go over the details of the piece with you.


If a garment is very expensive, look for designer tags. If it’s not a designer piece, ask about the price.
Don’t make a purchase unless you are completely satisfied with what they have to say.

, Look for holes and stains. You can’t expect perfection from used items and signs of wear should be expected. However, don’t let a minor defect stop you from buying a piece you really love. Evaluate any flaws you find realistically. Sometimes garments can be dry cleaned or repaired, but not always.


Think about the size of the defect, where it’s located on the item, and whether or not it’s still wearable if you can’t fix it.
In general, the older a garment is, the more fragile the material will be.
Moth damage is a risk, especially with natural fibers. Hold pieces up to the light to look for threadbare fabric and holes.

, Websites like eBay and Etsy can provide a vast selection of additional items that would be difficult to find in a resale shop. The downside is that you can’t touch the fabric or evaluate the size before you buy something online. Inspect the images closely. If you aren’t satisfied with the provided images, request additional ones from the seller.


Online retailers should provide measurements. Don’t rely on the size identified on the tag.Make sure details are provided about any damages or irregularities.
Find out the seller’s return policy and keep that in mind when making decisions. Often, sales are final., Sizes can vary from decade to decade, and also by manufacturer.Because of this, it can be difficult to figure out if something will fit you just by looking at it. Do a little research on basic sizing systems for the eras you’re interested in.


When in doubt, go for pieces that appear slightly too large. These can always be tailored to fit you just right, but there isn’t much you can do with a garment that is too small for you."

You can store a little stuffed animal in your locker, too. Nice magnets add a great touch. Just make sure that you are following the school rules! Here are more things you can decorate:


Your closet. Hang up posters, photos, or pictures you drew.
Your school supplies. Get colorful pens, notebooks, and binders.
Your backpack. Make key chains with string, or add already made ones.

Wear your hair long.,

Treat your skin kindly.",How to Dress Like a California Girl," Linen, cotton, and chiffon are all thin, lightweight fabrics that create a breezy, effortless vibe central to the California girl look. While some of these fabrics are common because of their ability to breathe in California heat, they are all extremely low maintenance and easy to care for, lending to the laid-back vibe essential to California living.Linen and cotton tend to shrink, so you may have to size up. If you size up and your clothes don’t shrink, don’t worry! A slouchy silhouette is a hallmark of California style.;
, California girls are known for their denim bottoms, whether that means a pair of distressed denim jeans, a pair of cut off shorts, or a short denim skirt tossed on over the day’s swim suit.Dark jeans are better for more formal occasions, particularly if they are paired with a nice heel.
Distressed jeans are popular for California girl style, and can help create a breeze in hotter weather.

, California is known for two things: heat and sunshine. To play up the sunny atmosphere of California, California girls are known to wear bright, happy colors, ranging from bright fuchsia to a sunny butter yellow. You can wear colors in large spaces, like a brightly-patterned sundress, or add a pop of color with a bright scarf or pair of shoes.If you are nervous about adding bright colors to your wardrobe, start with a purse or a hair scarf.
Using several different colors in a single outfit is one way to immediately stand out with Californian style.

, One of the best and simplest elements of California girl style is the laidback approach to footwear. Tennis shoes are seen on everyone, everywhere. Instead of being used primarily with pants and a tee, sneakers are considered great footwear for pants, shorts, skirts, and dresses, and are the perfect way to dress down a dress or skirt.Sneakers look great with a pencil skirt and a tee tucked in halfway for a simple, but put-together look.
Clean white sneakers are great when paired with a pair of sleek, dark jeans and a bright peplum top.

, Beachy hair is usually achieved through the combination of sun and the salty ocean spray. If you don’t have access to a beach, you can fake your way to California girl hair by using a leave-in salt spray, which will create a thick, wavy texture to hair of all colors, lengths, and textures.You can make your own salt spray using water and dissolved table salt, or you can purchase a sea salt spray from your local salon.
If you do use a sea salt spray regularly, be sure to condition your hair, as well, as salt can be extremely drying.

, Because California is known for its sunshine, it comes as no surprise that the quintessential California girl has sun-bleached hair. To mimic the fresh, youthful appearance of beachy hair, you can have your hair highlighted or balayaged in a salon, or you can do it yourself by applying some lemon juice to your hair and sitting in the sun over the course of a few days., Typically, California girl hair is associated with hair that is at least a little bit wavy, rather than hair that has been straightened or relaxed. Because Californian style is focused on looking effortless and relaxed, allowing your hair to embrace its own natural texture, whether that means a tight curl or a barely-there wave.If you do not have wavy hair, you can tease it, add a salt spray, or even create uneven and messy curls with a curling iron.

, Although long hair is not a strict requirement, the California girl style is usually embodied by long, flowing hair. If you are able, opt for long, let-down hair in a natural texture.If you do have short hair, make sure you play it up by making it as messy and wavy as you can.

, Not everyone can achieve this through sunbathing, and constant sun exposure is not healthy for your skin, anyway. To create the appearance of a healthy, beachy glow, you can use a high-quality tan cream or spray and rub it into any areas that will be exposed--particularly the legs, arms, and shoulders.If you feel comfortable tanning, you can go the old-fashioned route of tanning in the sun. Just be sure to practice safe habits when out in the sun.

, One of the hallmarks of California style is youth. To make sure you appear as youthful as possible, keep your skin full, healthy, and moisturized. Invest in a good-quality skincare routine that wards off pimples and dry skin, while optimizing plump and smooth skin.One of the best way to moisturize is to use various oils. Experiment with different oils (starting with apricot kernel oil or coconut oil) to see which works best for your skin.

, In keeping with the notion of youth, California style usually relies more on good skin than a lot of makeup to look great. Rather than focusing on careful, meticulous makeup application, place your focus on making your bare skin look its absolute best.


If you love wearing makeup, opt for a natural look, focusing on either your eyes or your lips, but not both.

, To make sure you skin is always at its best, treat it like a treasured friend. Always remove your makeup at the end of the day, apply moisturizer each morning and night after washing and toning, and wear SPF any time you know you’ll be in the sun. All of these together will make sure your skin looks its best at any given moment.

Stick to the basics.,
Curate your wardrobe to include staple items.,
Have a signature piece.,
Mix masculine and feminine.,
Match your undergarments.",How to Be More Like a French Woman1," One of the most easily observable aspects of French fashion is the pared-down aesthetic so common to Parisian streets. Rather than bathing in bright colors, or rushing out to buy the latest fast-fashion trend, French women stick to the basics, both in cut and color.A flattering cut will outshine a trendy item. When purchasing clothing, make sure it fits your frame well.
When in doubt, opt for neutrals. Neutrals are universally flattering, pair well with each other, and constitute wardrobe classics.;
, Although you want to wear basics, you should curate your closet so that each item you own matches or works well with at least two other items. This will make getting dressed in the morning easier and will give you a uniform, of sorts, to work from.Staple items typically include a well-fitting pair of jeans, a classic-cut coat, a pair of black flats, and a well-fitting button-down shirt.
Your staple items should reflect your lifestyle. If you need office wear, for instance, tailor your closet to accommodate office wear.

, Whether you have a ring you wear every day, or you place a pin on your lapel every morning, French women use a single item to draw interest. You could also use color for your signature piece, such as a bright yellow scarf, or a red nail.Your signature piece should be one you love, and that makes you feel great. Use your personality and likes to determine what you’d like your signature to be.

, One of the greatest ways French women achieve the effortless effect so commonly attributed to France is through pairing feminine and masculine items. A lace cocktail dress can be paired with a pair of moto boots and a leather jacket. A nice blouse could work alongside a pair of men's slacks. The mix of masculine and feminine keeps your outfit interesting.This takes some practice, so don’t be worried if you feel a bit silly at first. Pairing male and female items can have a learning curve.
Try pairing an oversized men's tee with a pair of skinny jeans and heels, or some oxford flats with a miniskirt and blazer.

, Although they’ll likely go unseen, you should never settle for ratty, unmatched undergarments. You can keep it simple, sticking to a color palette of white and black, or you can branch out and get some color into your wardrobe in the form of your lingerie.When your undergarments have become worn, get a new set--no exceptions.
Opt for quality over quantity. A quality bra and panty set will boost your confidence and improve the fit of your clothing.

Don’t wash your hair every day.,
Embrace your natural texture.,
Don’t look too coiffed.,
Wear a messy bun.,
Avoid obviously dyed hair.",How to Be More Like a French Woman2," Washing your hair every day strips it of its natural oils, which can cause dry, brittle, flyaway hair. Instead, stick to a schedule of once every other day, or even once per week (if your hair permits). Use dry shampoo in the meantime, if necessary.


Ideally, your hair should have a smooth shaft. If your hair has a lot of split ends, cut off as much as needed to rid yourself of them., Whether your hair is curly, straight, wavy, or somewhere in between, embrace your natural texture. Instead of spending countless hours with curling irons or flat irons, play up your natural texture as much as possible.For curly hair, this might mean foregoing a routine of gel, blow drying with a diffuser, and styling.
Straight-haired girls can leave their hair down and let it sit straight, rather than faking waves or curls.
For natural hair, embrace your texture by avoiding the blow dryer and allowing your hair to air dry and fall where it naturally prefers.

, French women are not known for sleek, slicked-back hairstyles. Instead, they are usually associated with hair that looks a bit undone. Although this does not mean you can’t put your hair into a specific style, let some strands fall out of an elegant French twist, or embrace flyaways you might find in a low ponytail., Parisian cafes are filled with messy buns piled atop the heads of French women. The key to a messy bun is in its structure: rather than opting for a slick, ballerina-style bun, loosely coil your hair in a bun, pin it in place with some bobby pins, and you’re good to go.This particular style can be worn with shoulder-length and longer hair. Shorter hair is not likely to stay in.

, Although many countries boast young people with neon-colored strands, French women opt for either natural hair, or naturally colored hair, sticking in the neighborhood of blacks, browns, reds, and blondes. Highlights and ombre styles do make appearances, but are typically more subdued in appearance."

Do not overindulge.,
Limit red meats.,
Sip wine with dinner.,
Choose high-quality food items.,
Sit down for meals.",How to Be More Like a French Woman3," French women are known for indulging in the good things: cheese, butter, bread, chocolate, and wine. The difference between French women and women in other countries, however, is the way in which they indulge. Rich foods are eaten in small portions, and accompanied by healthy foods.An indulgence in chocolate, for instance, might be a square of chocolate at the close of each meal.
Butter may be used in a vegetable dish to add flavor.

, While French people do not eschew red meat entirely, it is far more common to witness a plate of fish or poultry than a large steak. When tailoring your diet to mimic French women’s diets, trim the red meat, and opt instead for healthier, leaner options.Leaner meats have the added benefit of being associated with lower body fat percentages.

, Red wine has long been discussed for its potential health benefits when accompanied by dinner each night, and French women take heed. Once again, however, an integral part of drinking red wine is making sure you are not bingeing on an entire bottle, but sipping eight or ten ounces with meals.The type of wine matters, as well; a cheap bottle of fruit-flavored wine from the local grocery store is not the same as a good bottle of red wine or rosé.

, Instead of looking for a budget version of your favorite treat, purchase the highest-quality food you can. For some, that will mean all-organic produce and meat products, while for others, that will mean sourcing grass-fed cheese and butter.Not all places will have high-quality foods readily available, but many do have farmer’s markets from which to purchase fresh produce. Take advantage of these offerings.

, French women do not plop down in front of the television or computer with dinner in hand. Instead, they sit at the table and eat their meals carefully and mindfully.This particular style of eating has also been linked to smaller waist sizes and greater health, while studies have shown that eating while distracted can result in weight gain and overeating.

Nourish your skin.,
Put your needs first.,
Learn to relax.,
Work with your body, not against it.,
Make walking a habit.",How to Be More Like a French Woman4," Because most French women prefer a more natural makeup look, having clear skin is an absolute must. Use only high-quality facial care items, and keep your skin full and supple through the use of skin oils, healthy dietary choices, and getting plenty of rest.To encourage glowing skin, remember to exfoliate once or twice per week, and avoid harsh chemical cleansers.

, French women do not stretch themselves thin, working to please everyone around them. They put themselves first, even with close friends, to make sure their needs are met before moving on to the needs of others. This is true of family relationships, friendships, and even partnerships.Note that putting your needs first is not the same as being selfish. French women are not selfish, but recognize the importance of being strong and healthy first.

, French women do not pressure themselves with a strict, intense workout regimen, nor do they push themselves at work until they are exhausted. French women relax physically and mentally to ensure they are always at their absolute best.This can be a particularly difficult shift, as many countries encourage women to constantly push themselves to achieve greater gains. Practice relaxing for five minute each day, and go from there.
Creating a daily routine is a great way to relax. You can set aside a few moments each morning to read the paper, or have a standing afternoon coffee date with yourself.

, Your body has certain angles, quirks, and tendencies that cannot be altered quickly or easily. Instead of constantly trying to suppress your body’s natural tendencies or eliminate your natural shape, work with what you have.If you have a long, lanky frame, play it up with loose cuts and show your legs.
If you are curvy, make your curves work for you with cinched waists and feminine cuts.

, Instead of driving everywhere, make use of your legs. Whenever possible, walk to your destination. Walking is less expensive than virtually any other form of transportation, will keep your body in good working condition, and will give you an air of independence.Not all cities have public transit systems or are easy to walk around in. Do what you can where you are. Walk to your favorite coffee shop, or take a quick walk around the block.

You can research corsetry, research infamous Victorian lunatic asylums, find out about the importance of tea in Victorian times and, if they appeal, start loving rats.;
, You don't have to listen to just strictly industrial music. If anything themes are more important. Try Emilie Autumn, Hannah Fury, Rasputina, Rammstein, Abney park, Skinny Puppy, Nine Inch Nails, Oomph, and the Dresden Dolls. Try Victorian classic composers too if you want such as Edward Elgar.

, Charles Dickens stories are very readable and portray the lives of both rich and poor Victorians. The works of George Eliot illustrate Victorian ideas about love and romance. Gothic fantasy novels include the works of Anne Rice and Bram Stoker, among many, many others. You shouldn't struggle to find books you enjoy that have a Victoriandustrial aspect in this category. There are books which are considered by many to define Steampunk, such as Morlock Night and Homunculus. Read these and others like them if you wish.

, Corsets are recommended by many. Most respectable Victorian women and girls wore corsets or stays but they are not compulsory for anyone wanting to be Victoriandustrial. If you like, try out wearing bustle skirts, crinolines, shorter deconstructed skirts, kilts, bloomers, ribbon decorated clothes, clothing decorated with realistic floral trimmings and small hats worn at the front of the head. You can also wear older than Victorian style dresses and frocks if you like since lots of poor Victorians would of had hand-me-downs from when William IV and George IV ruled.

, You can buy things that you feel are Victoriandustrial, or get ideas for things you can make yourself or adapt from other clothes. Remember, you can incorporate industrial elements too, such as metal cuffs, heavy leather jackets, trench coats and heavy, Dr Marten type boots.

, Choose black, deep red, purple, light pink, white, gray, navy blue and any other colours you like. Experiment with lots of colours, or base your look on one main colour.

, Wear crosses on necklaces, dresses, or bracelets. Try wearing velvet belts, pendants, lace trims, pearls, lockets, chokers, skulls, patches, brooches, fingerless gloves and garters.

, Choose striped or fishnet, lacy effect, or wollen, and wear with stumpy goth boots, stiletto boots or Mary-Jane heels or other footwear.

, You can wear a dark eyeliner or eyeshadow, or a dark lipstick like plum, deep red or deep red with gold undertones. Remember, less is more, and it's best when you don't overdo the makeup. Victorians were generally modest, but Victoriandustrial artists are quite bold with their make-up so you can pretty much what you like.

Embrace your natural beauty.,
Grow out your hair.,
Time To Accessorise.,
Jewelry.,
Makeup.,
Find a good looking swimsuit.,
Fashion.,
Get In The Water.,
Lastly you need confidence.",How to Create a Mermaid Inspired Look," Mermaids are known to be naturally beautiful in their own usual settings whether it may be in and out of the water, sitting on rocks, watching the sunset, or enjoying the nice warm sand on the shore. This is especially true when it comes to their skin which is crucial to achieving this look.


Mermaids have never been seen with bad skin or any other imperfections on them. However, nobody is perfect in reality and we all have something that needs a little extra care or something to cover up. So that being said, take special care of your skin. Know your skin type and find the right products for it (cleanser, toner, moisturizer, eye cream, acne medication, etc..).
Exfoliate the whole body including your face at least 2-3 times a week with a good scrub or an exfoliating scrub brush. Pay close attention to your feet too, because they can get really dry and chapped quickly, so be sure to use a pumice stone regularly to smooth out dry chapped heels and prevent calluses, and moisturize twice a day with a good foot cream. Petroleum Jelly works well too, for those who are on a tight budget.
Never leave the house without a sunscreen. Find one with at least an spf of 15 or higher with UVA/UVB protection. Don t use the same kind on your face, it can clog your pores and cause your skin to break out.
Instead, find a separate one that is specially formulated for your face. If you tan regularly, don t rely on the sun or tanning beds to do the job for you. Baking yourself in the sun causes a lot of damage, skin cancer, and ugly wrinkles. If you feel like you must have a tan, there are plenty of self-tanners on the market.;
, And that's exactly how you should treat your own hair. Long beautiful hair is a must for the fable marine creature. There's no need for making any major changes to the tresses that you have.


However, it is optional but not mandatory. Think length, strength, and manageability. Grow out your hair as long as you can unless you have some damage that needs to be trimmed off. Otherwise, don t hesitate to go to the salon and get it cut because shorter healthy hair is a lot better and more attractive than having hair that is long but fried.
Try not to wash your hair every day because it robs it of the natural oils in the scalp which are essential to keep the hair healthy and give it its natural shine. Instead, try to cut it down to 2-3 times a week.
Use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and rinse with cold water right before you step out of the shower to close the hair cuticle, also making it shiny. Stay away from heat stylers such as blow dryers, flat-irons, and curlers to save your tresses a lot of damage. Instead, save them for special occasions.
Mermaids have many different textures of hair so just work with what you've got and own it. Hot oil treatments also do wonders (2-3 times weekly). Go for a quick trim every two months or so to maintain its health.
Hair color doesn't matter but if you desire a change or to enhance the shade you were born with then go for it. You could go for a vibrant or golden blonde, a fierce brunette, blue black, blue or green streaks, highlights, or an intense red just like Ariel from The Little Mermaid.

, Wear some sea accessories in your hair and have fun experimenting with different looks. For example, you can try a starfish headband or barrette. Or just find a plain one and glue some sea shells on it. Green ribbons imitate the look of seaweed. A scarf in light or sparkly colors can be wrapped around the head. Braids, such as french or fishtail can also be a cute look. And if you want to really take it to the next level and glam it up a bit, a pearl tiara will really make you stand out.

, Like the accessories for your hair, wear jewelry that reminds you of the ocean. Pearls are the ultimate mermaid jewelry whether they are real or fake. After all, they don't call them "" diamonds of the ocean "", for nothing.

Be sure to at least have one piece of jewelry with pearls on it. It may be a pair of small stud pearl earrings, a multi chain pearl necklace, a simple yet elegant pearl bracelet, or a pearl headband. If you want you can invest in something with the gemstone Aquamarine on it. Anything with shells or a lot of sequins will work too.







, Mermaid makeup can be achieved in many different ways. You could go from light to totally dramatic effects. You don't need to be a pro makeup artist to do this. All you will need is a clean, toned, and moisturized face to start with along with a liquid foundation for a more dewy look, an assortment of shimmery eyeshadows in light and jeweled tones, a good mascara, a tinted lipbalm or lipgloss.

Aquas, turquoise, and greens make very inspirational shades. However, you can mix and match with different colors as well such as a pearly white, silver, gold, pink, intense violets, or maybe a nice coral. If you want you could use liquid eyeliner in any color to create thin cat eyes or tiny dots on the outer eye corners.
Are you more into lips? Try shades like coral, sandy pink, hot pink, or ruby red. Do you want to go for a more natural approach yet still show a hint of mermaid? A a bit of light but very shimmery eyeshadow on the lids, inner corners, and underneath the lash line should do the trick. Follow with a light touch of natural pink or coral blush and lots of mascara in back and forth strokes on both the top and bottom lashes.
Don't worry about them coming out a bit clumpy because with this look, we are really trying to bring out our eyes as much as possible. Top it all of with lipgloss for an even more wet look. If you're not much of a fan of color and are more on the dark side, you can be a dark mermaid. The possibilities are endless and the choice is yours. But the most important part of this step is to have fun.







, Mermaids are majestic in or out of the water. So, the next time you go out for a swim, wear something that is sexy and flatters your figure.


There are many different cuts and styles to choose from. You should be looking for anything with lots of sequins, ruffles, bright or neon colors. Bikinis are a good to come by but don't be afraid to look for something less revealing if you are not comfortable wearing one.
One pieces (also called monokinis) and swim dresses are also becoming more popular and come in many different types of sexy, beautifully detailed, or cut styles. Wear something that you are comfortable with. You don't ever see a mermaid with an awkward look on her face while hanging around with fellow merfolk. If you really want to get into it, you could also wear a shell bra.

, Wear a lot of colorful clothes unless you are going for the dark mermaid look. Anything sparkly is good too. If you want, you can wear a graphic tee with a mermaid on it.

, Go for a refreshing swim in your community pool, take a long relaxing bath, get a few friends together to join you in the hot tub, go to a waterpark, kick back and relax at the beach, or take a canoe for a ride on the lake, if you are in high school then try out for the swim team. As long as you spend some time in the water. Make it look like that you practically live in water and people will start to wonder why you really are a mermaid.

, You can be shy or outgoing, but Mermaids are supposed to get noticed, and no one can do that if they aren't confident.

Maintain your nails.",How to Be Old Fashioned (for Girls)1," Nancy Drew went with the 1940s innocent look, you can go for a 1970s style, but keep in mind you could be labeled ""hippie"" or ""flower child"". But if that was the look you were going for, then fine.;
, If you put your hair in a braid, ponytail, or up in any way, wear a ribbon. A ponytail is perfect for keeping longer hair controlled in your active life (they were very popular in the 1950's and 60's). Bangs are okay. Part your hair to the side and wear a headband, if you like and your hair is down. You can dye it strawberry blonde or red, if you want and get colored contacts for blue eyes.

, Take a shower at least once a day. Brush your teeth and wash your face twice a day == very drying, so moisturize your face and hands after washing. No old-fashioned girl would go out on the town with an unpleasant smell.

, Be modest and wear preppy clothes from stores like J. Crew, Lacoste, Ralph Lauren, Banana Republic, etc. If you want more high end clothing try Burberry, who are known for their plaid. Be original too. An interesting option is pleated or pencil skirts. Also, trench coats seem to always give an old fashioned glow. They add to the timeless sincerity of the outfit.

, Good posture will give the impression of self confidence (even if you don't feel that way on the inside). While walking, maintain a relaxed yet definitive upright posture: spine long, shoulders back, head level with the ground. This may feel awkward or overpowering to you when you first practice it, but keep on trying.

, Use clear coat on your fingernails; color or French pedicure on your toes. Don't let the skin around them get dry to the point that they crack, but push cuticles back -- and no biting your nails. If you polish them, go for a natural French manicure, clear polish, or even neutral, solid-colored polish (not bold, like red or blue or black). Don't let the polish chip off, and don't let your nails get too long. Nails should be in neutral colors and medium short in length.

Read.,
Increase your vocabulary, and stay away from slang terms.,
Dress up the house, or at least your room.,
Stop swearing.,
Always be nice, clean, and generous.,
Be graceful.,
At home, try your best to cooperate with your family.",How to Be Old Fashioned (for Girls)2," Make reading and history your favorite subjects, classic novels, and pretty much anything traditional that you can get your hands on!

, Never swear or say racist comments. This makes you ugly on inside and out, so rude.

, Do some research on how old-fashioned bedrooms/homes where decorated. World Market has amazing old-world pieces, try other stores also.

, It may be hard to cut out, but swearing is one of the worst things you could do, if you're trying to be ladylike. Try making a deal with your friends about not swearing for a day. Just think about proving to everyone you have the willpower and self-control to actually control and think about what comes out of your mouth. Definitely avoid calling names such as: ""moron"" or ""idiot."" Try to make very calm, civil opinions and comebacks, not the regular irritating stuff. It'll take practice, but it's a huge step towards being innocent and old-fashioned.

, Having a selfish and nasty attitude toward others will drag you very far away from being lady-like. Have a real smile on your face. Be willing to let people borrow things from you. Don't forget to take a classic shower with a scented soap! Soaps with sandal-wood is a great choice.

, This is a difficult step, but also a crucial one. Being graceful doesn't mean you have to hate sports and walk on tiptoe, just make sure you walk with your head up, shoulders rolled back, maintaining good posture. Don't swagger or swing your hips. It looks exaggerated and weird. Don't swing your arms either: Keep them by your side.

, Go to bed on time, offer to wash the dishes, bring in the groceries, teach your little brother how to tie his shoes, or whatever you can think of that could benefit your family in some way. No matter how tempting it is, if you know there's something you should be doing, (no matter how badly you don't want to do it), do it!

Raid mom's closet for vintage tees.,
Keep your neck warm and your hip-stardom intact with a scarf.,
Get flowery with dresses.,
Throw out all your boot cut or flared jeans.,
Pile on the accessories.,
Mix up your past looks.,
Stick to anything but flip flops and heels.",How to Dress Like a Hipster1," Ha, that's a funny way of saying ""Go to any store that sells clothes for young adults."" Never shop at ""mainstream"" stores (like Hollister, American Eagle, Aeropostale...) Have you not noticed the prevalence of pseudo-vintage tees everywhere? To be more, what's the word, authentic, shop at vintage stores, second-hand shops, or go around begging relatives. (Goodwill, Urban Outfitters, Miracle Hill) Surely one of them has an old Reading Rainbow tee in a box somewhere from when they were 12.


You want your tee to be either too small- chop off the bottom and make it a crop top, then throw it over that tank top/cami you hate- or too large,- tuck it into those high waisted pants you found at a garage sale- if at all possible. But if you found a gem of a Davy Jones tee from your favorite aunt that fits you just right, by all means. Davy's worth it.;
, The great news here is that scarves go with everything. EVERYTHING. Wearing a tank top? Scarf. Wearing a wedding dress? Scarf. Is it 95º out? Scarf.


Familiarize yourself with at least a dozen ways to tie your scarf. If in doubt, just drape it nonchalantly around your neck, wrapped around once. You don't care what it looks like. You just love the comfy neck feeling, right? (Hipsters don't give a flip about anyone or anythings' opinion.)

, Sometimes you like a healthy breeze down there, don't you? Dresses can be straight up more comfortable. But just like a good tee, your dresses should evoke a feeling from a different era. Flowery, vintage, and old-school is a safe bet. The flowery, the better.


Did you find the perfect dress somewhere that's just a bit too big to be legal? Or maybe you found a dress that's too conservative and the sleeves need to be chopped off. This is the exact purpose neon bras and bandeaus were invented. Not kidding. Look it up.
Too cold for a dress? Ha, good one! Have you not heard of wool tights? Wool, patterned, neon tights? If that doesn't solve all your problems, nothing will. Plain black tights under thick hiking socks is another great look, too.

, We know you have several pairs. You've been buying them since you were 10, apart from that one time around 2006 when skinnies made a brief appearance on the scene, only to slingshot to the other side of the spectrum with disco-esque flares. After that really confusing year, you just gravitated back to the safe boot cut. We all did. It's fine. But now you've gotta throw those out. It's skinnies all the way. Nothing else. Your ankles don't need to breathe!


Have some jeans you like that don't make the cut (haha, puns)? Turn 'em into shorts. The higher-waisted and more mom-ish, the better. And when we say short, we mean short. Show off those gams of yours. Cuffs? Great. White wash? Great. Holes? Great. As long as it's denim, you're in the clear.

, Literally. Grab a pile and put them on. Play it like the claw game at the arcade (only you'll win every time). Did you end up with a wooden tribal bracelet, your grandma's ruby necklace, and a lace choker? Great. That works. It's all about haphazard combos.


What may be outrageous to others is probably standard to you. A giant flower chilling on top of your head? Sure. A totally distracting enormous neon yellow hair clip? ...Why not?

, Since you were twelve, you've gone through (in order) a Hello Kitty phase, an N*SYNC phase, an emo phase, a prep phase, a flannel phase, a grunge phase, and now you're here. Wonderful -- now grab a piece from each look and combine them. Tada! Instant hipster. As easy as cheese in a can.


Seriously. Hipster fashion is about a mismatch and clash of cultures all rendered meaningless if you really want to put a label on it. The main way hipster goes wrong is when people put thought into it -- so if you haphazardly go about your closet, bullet dodged.

, That's about the only rule for footwear. If it's not a flip flop and not a heel, you're golden. Loafers, cowboy boots, sneakers, it's all good. Flats are adequately hipster, too! Who knew something so harmless could be hipster-y?


Make sure it doesn't look super new, too. If you just went out and bought a brand new pair of Chuck Taylors (you unique little snowflake, you), scuff 'em up. Those babies gotta be loved before they can set foot into Cafe Foucault.

Wear comfortable clothing while you work.,
Protect your clothing.,
Avoid working in clothes that you mind ruining.,
Work with what you have.,
Shop at thrift stores.,
Stop paying attention to brands.,
Do your own thing.",How to Dress Like an Artist1," As an artist, you will be spending long hours honing your craft. Whether you're working at an easel or on a computer, you want to make sure you're as comfortable as possible.


If you work with a messy medium like paint, avoid clothing that is too baggy, especially if it has sleeves. Even if you aren't worried about getting your work clothes dirty, too-loose clothing may end up smearing your work.;
, If you work with anything that can stain, such as paint or ink, you should take precautions to keep media away from your clothes. Cover up with an apron or a painting smock. Make sure it's made of a thick enough material that your media won't soak through quickly.

, Even with taking care and wearing an apron, you are likely to still get the odd splash of paint here or there. Washing immediately may take care of most media on various fabrics, but you are bound to get the occasional permanent stain. Don't wear your best slacks in the studio.

, As a young artist, you probably don't have a lot of money. Instead of pining for designer jeans way out of your price range, learn to build a stylish wardrobe without breaking the bank.


Keep your clothes in good condition. Clothes that last longer will save you money.
T-shirts and jeans may sound like a mundane combo, but you can use your own personal style to stand out. Wear T-shirts of your own design or that are otherwise unique. Wear jeans that are other colors besides the typical denim blue.
A simple, creative way to stretch your wardrobe is to ""mix and match"" different pieces to create unique looks. Simply switching jackets between two suits will give you two ""new"" outfits., Second hand shops are the best way to stretch your clothing budget. In addition to basics and run-of-the-mill pieces, you'll be able to find unique styles at an affordable price. Look for quirky, odd ""signature"" pieces that fit your personality and will make you stand out.


You can find retro and modern styles and then easily mix and match them.
Most thrift shops have one or more glass cases in the front where they display nicer items, often jewelry. These items may be more expensive than typical thrift shop wares, but will still cost significantly less than retail. It's a great place to look for interesting pieces.

, While brand names sometimes mean quality, more often than not you end up paying for the name. As an artist, that's a luxury you are not likely to afford. Besides, how creative can you look when you're dressed just like everyone else?


An exception is to remember which brands actually do make quality clothing that lasts. This type of brand may be a little more expensive but will save you money over time. Keep your eyes peeled for them when thrifting or browsing auction websites.

, Above all, to look like an artist you should dress how you want to. This could mean bright, attention-grabbing getup's that ""push the boundaries."" Or you may want to keep things casual and monochrome. You may even decide to do both on different days of the week. The choice is yours.

"
"
Wear your sister's jeans.,
You want them to fit snug on your waist all the way down.,
Get nostalgic.,
Fake bad vision.,
Be half business, half party.,
Go for layers.,
Think about your converse.,
Grab a messenger bag.",How to Dress Like a Hipster2," But no, seriously. If you can, do it. The skinnier the better. You want grip from groin to toe. And don't worry about ""not pulling it off."" That's part of the idea. In not pulling it off, you will be pulling it off. It's like opposite day back in sixth grade.

, In other words, tighty whities it is!, Anything that reminds you of when you were 5 should be part of your closet. Or anything that reminds your dad of when he was 5, too. If it's vintage, it meets the cut. The only, only logos in your closet should be ones of brands or industries that no longer exist. Excluding American Apparel, of course.


It doesn't have to fit well. More on this later, but if it's too tight or too loose, cool. Size should be just about the last thing on your mind.

, If you want everyone's hipster-dar (hipsdar?) to go off, wear thick, black-rimmed glasses. If you want everyone's hipster to reach decibels only dogs can hear, wear thick, black-rimmed glasses with the lenses popped out. Hey, you just like the added comfort of knowing your ears are still there. Nothing wrong with that.


This style of glasses is reaching levels of overkill, so to be a bit more unique, opt for a different vintage-y style or a pair of outrageously colored Ray Bans. You can hardly go wrong with Ray Bans.

, If you read the girl section above, you'll know that mismatching trends is part of the hipster look. In the same manner that you would mix up decades and styles, mix up levels of, for lack of a better word, swag. Under that Armani blazer of yours, throw on a TMNT tee (that makes the Armani okay somehow) with a knitted, plaid scarf, skinny jeans, and a pair of old, worn out penny loafers. Is he going to an interview? Is he going on a Pabst beer run on his bicycle right now? No one will know.


Don't shy away from outrageously loud prints. Plaids, gingham, checkered, paisley -- anything that would make a girl reading Cosmo scream is a solid decision. You have a plaid tweed jacket and a striped cowboy shirt? Obviously those two go together.

, If the weather allows it, layers are a good way to work in combinations, as discussed above. Cardigans can go on top of anything, for the record. Sweaters, long sleeves, it all gives more options to be ironic. A scarf on top of a tee under a trench coat? Sure, why not?

, Alright, folks, let's get real here: Everyone and their brother wears converse. It's not ironic, hipster, or making any statement anymore. All it says is, ""Hey, I went to the Converse store and spent $40 on my shoes all while not caring about my image."" So unless they're 15 years old and have molded to the shape of your foot, consider branching out into different realms of footwear.


Doc Martens are a good place to start. Cowboy boots, old school Reeboks, Keds, and vintage-y loafers are decent, too. Just say no to flip flops.

, Do a quick Google search for ""Hipster messenger bags"" and you'll be amazed. The freakin' things are CALLED hipster bags.That's just society not being creative (as usual), but take it for what it's worth: To carry around your gear, you need a messenger bag.


You might run into a few people that ask you about your ""murse."" That's a man-purse, by the way. That's fine. Let them. Your hands are free thanks to your bag to poke them in the eye. They deserve it for being so close-minded and ignorant.

"
"
Avoid all things ""mainstream."",
Get a T-shirt that fits well.,
Leave no denim behind.,
Zip it up.,
Reuse old clothes.,
Prepare for the winter.,
Utilize color.,
Accessorize.,
Get inspired by how other hipsters dress.",How to Dress Like a Hipster3," This means that big-name clothing brands like Hollister, Abercrombie, Aeropostale, etc. are off limits. This is important for two reasons: it emphasizes your individuality and shows that you are ""anti big-business"". To buy clothes, check out stores like Buffalo Exchange. If you don't want to buy second-hand items, look for a store that sells new clothes with a worn or vintage look. American Apparel, however, is acceptable due to the fact that it is sweatshop-free .


Alright, so you live in a small-ish town where the only second-hand shop is Good Will? If you're caught in Urban Outfitters or H&M, you may not be proud, but you certainly won't be the only hipster in there.

, Note that ""fits well"" for hipsters is not the same as it is for non-hipsters. Mens' shirts should be somewhat tight-fitting with sleeves a hair shorter than a regular mens' shirt. Women's shirts, on the other hand, often mimic the ""boyfriend"" look. While women don't have to buy their clothes from the mens' section, consider investing in some shirts that are one or two sizes bigger than you'd normally wear.


Sexy here is in not being sexy. Especially for women, conforming to the is-it-so-tight-I-can't-breathe look is not in the hipster repertoire (men's skinnies notwithstanding). Baggy and loose is just fine, if not preferred. It's about irony, not silhouette.

, Except for denim skirts, that is. Tight-fit jeans are a must for both boys and girls. Pants can be any color or pattern, including floral print or neon green. If pants aren't really your thing, consider some denim cutoffs. These can be any length for women, but all mens' shorts should hit just above the knee.


Girls can also get away with the boyfriend look for jeans. If they're too long, cuff the hems once or twice.
Denim jackets and shirts are also great additions to your hipster wardrobe. Don't be afraid to take a pair of scissors to them, either. Denim vests are just as cool as denim jackets (if not more so)!

, It zips, right? It probably does. If you're hipster chic, you probably have a few hoodies hanging up in your closet right now. These go with everything. Literally, everything. The hoodie should be one of your best friends.


Bonus points if you can pair it with a Fedora or a blazer or a printed, feminine dress.

, There's no point in going green for the environment and being vegetarian if you can't follow suit with your wardrobe. When in doubt, before you throw it out, see if you can ""recycle"" it. How could you turn it into something totally wearable?


You don't have to keep them as is! A sweater could be turned into a pair of gloves (or a lampshade, book cover, pillowcase) for Pete's sake! You want original? Making it yourself is a pretty good way to start.

, While the intensity of your outerwear will depend on the season and where you live, it's important to be able to bundle up without losing your hipster look. Here are a few ideas:


Pick up some flannel. Large, button up flannel shirts are a perfect addition to any hipster outfit, regardless of the color. Ideally, these should not be matched with the rest of your outfit.
Invest in a cardigan or two. These can be found anywhere, even the more mainstream stores such as Gap. Choose a button-up cardigan with a deep V and large buttons. If possible, buy it one or two sizes too big.
Get an ironic crew neck sweatshirt or pullover sweater. Look for ""grandma patterns"" such as old flowers, kittens, or Christmas trees. Alternatively, look for a particularly ""hideous"" (read: awesome) pattern.
Keep your head warm with a grungy grey beanie. This can also be swapped out for a neon orange color.

, Because you're free to mismatch as much as you damn well please, you could be a veritable human Skittle if you liked. The more colors of the rainbow, the better. And if they're vivid or patterned, all the more reason to don them while taking photos with your analog camera at Brooklyn's Union Hall.


Neon, neon, neon. Neon pants, neon shoes, neon accessories, neon Ray Bans -- just because you're not ""in style"" doesn't mean you won't be eye-catching! Normal colors go too well together (damn color wheel), so spruce up your closet with neons, patterns, and anything else that clashes.

, Do not worry about matching here. Throw on anything you have; pair chunky and plastic with dainty and metal. Pendants of unexpected objects (such as owls or octopi), headbands with big bows on them, huge flower clips, chunky earrings, or anything that will draw attention. Anything with feathers is also a safe bet.


Leather accessories are also big. Try leather satchels or backpacks, leather vests, and leather belts.
Invest in some cotton/linen scarves to throw over any outfit. Patterned is best. Keffiyeh scarves are definitely popular, although they are also somewhat controversial due to their religious implications . For something a little safer, try a small checkered pattern.
Decorate your head. If it's too hot for a beanie, straw fedoras or fedoras with feathers are great hat options. Hats always put the icing on the hipster cake.

, Now that you know what makes a hipster on the outside, you'll be able to spot one from a mile away. In case you haven't noticed, they're everywhere (and some of them don't even know they're hipsters). If your local town doesn't have enough clues, here are some veritable cultural icons to turn to:


thesatorialist.com, stockholmstreetstyle.feber.se, lookbook.nu, and cobrasnake.com are all good places to scout out your look. Hopefully you'll be first in line!
Check out TV shows like ""Girls,"" ""Bored to Death,"" or ""Portlandia"" for inspiration. The fashion of your favorite musician works, too!
Try to search Google images for ""hipster clothes"". This may give you good ideas of outfits to try.

"
"
Sew your own clothes.,
Screen print your own T-shirts.,
Create unique accessories.",How to Dress Like an Artist2," You don't have to be a fashion designer to make your own clothing. Working from a pattern makes sewing your own wardrobe relatively simple. Check out your local fabric store for some wild, off-beat patterns you wouldn't find on store-bought clothes. As your skill-level increases, you may even decide to design pieces from scratch without an existing sewing pattern.

, Are you tired of seeing the same old T-shirt designs? Make custom shirts that nobody else in the world can wear.


If you have a business or studio, design T-shirts with its name and logo. If the shirts are eye-catching, wearing them can get complete strangers interested in your art.

, Find original buttons or add faux jewels to your clothes. Try your hand at basic jewelry crafts to make accessories that are both different and fit perfectly into your personal style. Upcycle any odd knickknack that can be incorporated into your clothes and accessories.

"
"
Wear uncommon but not outlandish colors.,
Add a belt.,
Look for unique jewelry that ties your look together.,
Dress down.",How to Dress Like an Artist3," When attending semi-formal business and social events, you will want to look both creative and sophisticated. These are prime networking environments, and you never know who may want to buy an expensive piece or give you your next job. Look sharp while standing out with a dark green or brown suitor dress.

, Belts enhance the style of any outfit they're worn with. When sporting an otherwise plain ensemble, a decorative belt and/or an interesting buckle can help you stand out from the crowd.Let others know more about your personal style and artistic interests with this small detail.


Tooled leather is fairly uncommon in modern belts, and wearing a tooled leather belt is a simple way of looking unique.
You can pick a belt buckle that holds some significance to either you or your art. For example, if your art frequently has an ocean theme, a buckle with a jellyfish or shark is a good choice.
If you work with metal or leather, your belt is a great place to display your talents.

, Look for pieces that are funky, foreign, expensive or well-made. Jewelry with intricate details or pieces that hearken back to the 80s are also good artistic choices. If a piece is particularly large or wild-looking, it may be best to save it for casual outfits, rather than wear it to something dressier like an art opening.Just like your belt buckle, your jewelry can reflect your interests and art. For example, if you're interested in astronomy and/or frequently incorporate spacescapes, try finding jewelry that features planets or supernovae.
Avoid pieces that look too expensive or ostentatious, even if you didn't pay much for them. It may be harder to sell your work if a potential buyer sees you decked out in gold and diamonds.

, Artists are famously known to dress more casually than average. However, you want to make sure you don't come off as sloppy or unstylish. If you don't take the time to put creativity into your outfit, some people may doubt the level of creativity you put into your art. Instead, dress down in a deliberate fashion rather than randomly throwing on jeans and a T-shirt. Make sure your clothing is clean and fits well."

Change your hairstyle.,
Get piercings.,
Consider tattoos.,
Stop shaving.,
Wear stylish jeans.,
Wear a lot of black.,
Wear a beret.",How to Dress Like an Artist4," Choose a look that will make you stand out in a crowd. Consider these ideas for creating a wild look:


Get a blunt cut from your stylist and ask him or her to add bangs.
Arrange your hair into dreadlocks if that works for your hair type.
Dye or streak your hair with a unique color. If you're wary of making a major change to your hair color that you can't undo, then use a temporary dye. If your hair is braided or dreadlocked, one or two strands dyed a bright color will really pop. When adding a streak to your hair, having it closer to your face will have the biggest impact.

Back comb or ""tease"" your hair with a brush and some hairspray to give it volume. While most people who tease their hair today hide the knots with unteased hair, a popular ""artsy"" look is to make your back combing look obvious.
Stop straightening or curling your hair. Let it return to its natural state.
Choose a style that defies gender stereotypes. If you're a girl, go with extremely short hair. If you're a guy, grow your hair long.

, You can pierce your eyebrow, your lip or your nose for dramatic effect. Gauged earlobes are another popular piercing choice. Just remember that, unlike most other types of piercings, earlobe stretching is likely to be permanent.If you want something more subtle, pierce your ear cartilage.

, Tattoos themselves are an art form, and having a few may show off your creative side. If you consider your body a canvas, you might want to get tattooed in a way you find meaningful. Don't be thoughtless about it, though; you don't want to get a tattoo you'll regret.


If you are a visual artist, consider drawing your own design for your tattoo artist to use.
The modern artist stereotype often includes full sleeves and/or neck tattoos.
If you don't want to commit to the artist look for life, try temporary tattoos instead.

, You may want to grow out your facial hair or change your other shaving habits. Do what you want, and don't conform to social pressure. Shaving is a personal choice. Some artists shave, and some don't. However, the popular image of an artist usually has a beard or at least some stubble.

, While skinny jeans may be the fashion, remember that as an artist you want to set yourself apart from the crowd. Your jeans can also be ripped and faded. However, artsy guys should never wear ill-fitting or ruined dress pants.

, Artists dressing all in black is a stereotype for good reason. In addition to flattering any figure, black also shows dirt and stains much less compared with other colors. When you're an artist with a limited budget, black clothes will save you cleaning and replacement costs. Artists also often wear black to events where they showcase their art. The monochromatic look draws attention away from them and onto their work., A black beret is the ultimate artist fashion cliché.Fortunately, it also happens to be stylish. Berets look good on both guys and girls and can be worn a variety of ways. Get one for yourself to really sell the artistic look you're going for.

Chill people don't look for reasons or opportunities to hate on others just for being different. There's no reason to bully or tread on other people's territory. Try to be happy with yourself and encourage self-love in others, too and remember be yourself.;
, Unless someone is rude to you, your day should go by smoothly by being polite, considerate, and nice. Chill people don't antagonize for the sake of it or stir up a bunch of negative emotions by being jerks; chill people are generally kind and get along well with others. However, try to avoid going overboard so you don't become a people-pleaser or pushover.

, Take your life in stride. Roll with the punches and be accepting of the little things life throws your way, reserving your passion for what matters to you most. This is pretty much the defining feature of a chill person.

, Don't be someone who is really boring and afraid to try new things. Go out and do stuff you consider fun and be someone that other people want to spend time with. Talk with people, go see movies, play games, go on hikes or go camping: it's all good!

, Be unique. A chill person doesn't feel the need to follow all the trends set by others, they just do what they want and what makes them happy. This laid back attitude inspires others to be more laid back and people will want to be around you more often.

, Some things in life are bound to upset or anger you, and while it's okay to have those feelings, it's best not to nosedive into every argument that presents itself. Stop, take a deep breath, and decide whether an unpleasant situation is worth getting into. Catch yourself before you get stuck in a pointless argument or a big scene. From here, you can redirect the situation to be in your favor.

, Distract yourself from your immediate feelings by redirecting your thoughts. There are lots of ways you can do this. You can count your breaths. You can even sing a song (inside your head is probably better than out loud). , Studies have show that we can reduce a significant amount of stress by chewing gum. Pop a stick of that winter fresh if you’re just not feeling calm in the moment. , Think about how much your problem matters in the grand scheme of things. Will it still affect you a year from now? Does it even help to be so hard on yourself? If you made it out alive, chances are you’ll find a way to get through it and move on to more happiness and hardships.

, By the time we’re much older, we usually don’t get so worried when things don’t go our way, because we get used to it. Think of how your grandma would react in a situation and do that. She’d probably say something funny and then move on to the next thing, which is really the best thing to do if you want to stay sane.

, If you just can’t handle the situation, take yourself out of it. No reason to stick around if you’re going to lose your cool and make some mistakes. Remove yourself from the room for a few minutes and then try again once you’ve managed to work through the initial anger or fear (or whatever you’re feeling).

, Avoiding such things is the best way to be chill in life. Just say no to all the bullies, liars, and trash-talkers. You don’t need that in your life! Cut toxic people out of your life and don’t go around causing trouble yourself. Don’t start none, ain’t gonna be none.

, There's a difference between being chill and being passive. Instead of sitting around thinking your problems could be worse, always try to make things better for yourself. It'll be a lot easier to be genuinely laid-back when you're satisfied with your life as opposed to settling for less.

, When you have lots of self confidence and comfort with who you are, you will have a much easier time being chill. You will know that it’s okay if you make a mistake, that it doesn’t make you worthless or something like that. You will know you can handle whatever crazy life manages to throw at you.

, Do things in life that make you happy. Don’t do things that stress you out just to accommodate others and not yourself. Doing things that make you happy will make you more calm and relaxed, helping you deal with all your problems in a better way.

, Not caring what others think will make many situations in your life less stressful, like arguments and rumors.

, You’ve got to laugh about stuff in life, especially the stuff that doesn’t go your way, or you’re going to spend life grumpy and stressed out. When someone is a jerk to you, relieve your anger through humor. Just laugh at them because they are clearly very boring and miserable.

, Always be quick about getting things done instead of procrastinating and leaving them until the last minute. This will give you fewer things to stress about and let you take a laid-back approach to life.

, Listen to some music that will calm you down. Different music works for different people, of course, but generally soothing music will make you more chill then some hard-core rock. Look for music with low, calming sounds. You will know that music is calming when you notice that your pulse is lower. , When you notice that you’re getting too tense and worked up, try chilling out by playing with some cute little kids or animals. Kids especially have such a happy view of the world and themselves, and their outlook can often change how you view your own life. If you don’t have little kids in your life, think about volunteering with Big Brothers, Big Sisters (or a similar organization).

, Physically getting up and moving, and proper exercise especially, can have a really big impact on how you feel emotionally. If you feel like you’re having problems being chill, go out for a run and see how you feel when you get back. You might be surprised!

, A funny movie is a great way to relax and get into a chill mindset. You can watch cartoon movies that you loved as a kid or you can watch some more grown-up movies that make you laugh instead. Movies like Dodgeball are usually good for a laugh, Bridesmaids is a great movie, and Office Space will be sure to have you laughing at your own life in no time.

, Another great way to chill is to play a game. You can play video games, board games, card games, or whatever you like. You can play alone or with other people. Games are a great way to exercise your brain and get your mind off of the problems and stresses in your life. It can also be a great way to bond with people that you love, which can really make your life more chill.

Clean out your wardrobe.,
Invest in some clothes.,
Have a signature jewelry piece.,
Smell great.,
Go for a relatively natural look.,
Style your hair like a doll.,
Have a good attitude.,
Try some girly activities, even if it isn't your thing.,
Read girly magazines.,
Be both charming and classy.",How to Be Doll Like," Before beginning, go through your wardrobe and get rid of anything not ""doll-like."" Lose the cargo pants, baggy jeans and tomboy shirts. Only keep fun, flirty, or girly clothes.;
, If you don't have anything that will work, go shopping. Look for pastel colors, lace, or ruffles. Baby doll tops are a must-have. On cold days, wear skinny jeans, but try to mostly wear skirts and dresses. If you aren't a big fan of pastels, black will bring some sophistication to your wardrobe and mute the pastels, just remember not to overload!
, It can be a silver charm bracelet, an engraved ID chain bracelet, etc - as long as it doesn't look cheap (avoid plastic), it'll be classy. Always wear it.

, People will be more drawn to you if you smell awesome, and you will stand out more if you have a signature (good) smell. Don't drown yourself in perfume though, just spritz a little here and there ( behind your neck, behind your knees and wrists).

, The idea is to look elegant and clean, not masked. Put on a small amount of mascara, blush, maybe a little eyeshadow. The most important thing is to use a thick layer of foundation or tinted moisturizer to have an even, glowing skin tone like a doll.
, Don't wash your hair daily. When you wash your hair, wash it with cold water as this keeps hair shiny and strong. After washing your hair put in some leave-in conditioner. With curly hair, you can wear it down or in a messy bun. With straight hair, wear it in a ponytail or with a cute headband (like one with pearls).

, Restrain from backstabbing and gossiping. Do your best to embrace kindness and happiness. Fill your life with the things you enjoy. Smile whenever you can, even at strangers—they'll appreciate it. Be bubbly, happy go lucky, and a bit optimistic! Other people like having a ray of sunshine around them.

Always be there for your friends when they're sad. Be on their side no matter what. Bring them soup when they're sick or chocolate when they're sad. People will love it that you care.

, Have a spa day with some friends, paint your nails, do something new with your hair.

, These will give you ideas and a better sense of style. Good magazines are: Teen Vogue, Elle, Cosmo Girl and Seventeen!

, First of all, be classy with your personality. Once people know how nice you are, keep pushing forward! Stay above petty rumors. If you don't have something nice to say, don't say it. Secondly, be classy with your dress: don't show too much skin or wear clothes that are too tight. Be beautiful but demure.


Watch movies with Audrey Hepburn (i.e. Breakfast at Tiffany's, Funny Face) to adopt some of her class.

First you should know who you are and where you belong, this takes time, don't push yourself into being someone you're not, instead take time to get to know yourself.,
Speak openly about your tastes, music, fashion, boys, girls, whatever, don't hide behind other people's views.,
Try to find a hobby or interest that you enjoy and are good at, it builds self esteem and gives you stuff to talk about.,
Don't ditch friends or desperately try to make new friends, being independent means that you don't cling.,
Establish your own doctrine and walk into it.,
Try to build your self esteem by pushing your comfort zones, you'll never grow out of shy you if shy you is kept safe in a cupboard.,
Learn how to accept critics and how to face them.,
Realize that you're a completely valid person and that you've got just as much right to be here as the next.,
BE YOURSELF!",How to Be an Independent Girl," For example, if you like one band/singer, don't pretend to like Justin Bieber because everyone else does.;
, Wait a second though, there's a but. Don't be rude about it! Respecting doesn't mean agreeing.

, It's also a way to make new friends who have the same interests as you!

, Just be yourself and new friends will come to you, and old friends can leave if they don't like it.

, For example, make a list of things that makes you YOU and don't compromise your morals. Stand for something or you'll fall for anything.

, Do things that make you worry, 'feel the fear and do it anyway' as they say. It doesn't have to be something like sky diving, it could be walking around town on your own, taking a bus on your own for the first time, starting a conversation with a stranger, wearing a tighter fitted top than usual in public.

, If someone bitches behind your back, ignore it unless it's really serious, people will always dig into people they don't understand or are jealous of, it's natural. Just feel pleased you're mature enough for it not to bother you. If someone directly starts something, meet them head on, you're an independent person and you've got guts enough to have discussion about this. If someone gets violent however, obviously use your common sense and leave in a calm and collected manner.

, Look up the poem 'I am Me' and the Desiderata, 'If' by Rudyard Kipling and even 'Chicken Soup For The Soul' books, all of these are esteem boosters and chunks of things to think about.

, And love that that's who you are.

Skinny-fit jeans are a must-have. Buy a pair in every known color.
T-shirts should be retro with bright colors, and 80's slogans, such as ""Save the Rave"" or ""Frankie Says Relax"". Video game t-shirts are cool too, go with old-school games though. Super-hero shirts are good, too.
Accessories are also neon. Wear glow stick bracelets, and flashing badges. Get pins of your favorite bands, and put them everywhere.
Studded belts are a good idea. So are any other studded accessories, but don't go overboard with those.
Suspenders, chains, and neon nail polish is nice.
Avoid big sunglasses, bows, tutus and cartoon characters like Hello Kitty. You'll come across as scene.
Edible jewelry is a nice addition.;

Have a small emblem on your cheekbone. Hearts and lightning bolts are popular.
Have long straight hair, or short hair spike in front,or backcombed ( a la robots in disguise) or parted to the side, with hair pushed out forward.

While a lot of people think alternative as having punk, emo, goth, or rock influences, it is up to an individual where she gets her style cues from., While it’s okay to tone for certain occasions that deem certain things appropriate, you don’t have to let go of all your flair. If you are toned down but feel uncomfortable then you are bending to the norm and not being alternative.For example, if you feel a bright pink mohawk is inappropriate for a job interview at an office, wear your hair down but keep pink streaks in. You will be miserable anywhere that you cannot be yourself so allow your personality to come through as much as is appropriate.

, Having an alternative style doesn’t mean that you can’t add your own personal touches. While black is associated with alternative style, you can open your colour palette as alternative is a state of mind and not a strict set of rules. Follow your gut., There will be times when a certain style is inappropriate. For example, skulls may be seen as a staple for an alternative style but wearing skull print during a funeral may be seen as very inappropriate. Tone down anything that may seem overly offensive when necessary., Just because you don’t feel the need or have the time to dye your hair or get more piercings, doesn’t mean that you are no longer alternative. You may also ditch platforms if they have become more of a nuisance during your daily grind. Changing one or all aspects of your wardrobe doesn’t change your mindset., Get out of your comfort zone and look for style inspiration outside of your normal stores. Changing your style is part of an alternative attitude. Wanting to change is a great sign that you are in an alternative mindset.Some store market themselves as catering specifically to an alternative style. You probably already know which stores are closest to you. If that is the case, it means that a lot of alternative people are also using this resource rather than finding it on their own. Step away from the crowd and find your own resources.

, Follow your instincts and remove anything you don’t see yourself wearing any more. Make room for new versions of alternative inspiration. Donate your old clothes or find consignment outlets to help you recover some of your spendings.Use social media to find groups that hold clothing exchanges or cater specifically to people with an alternative style.

, There are a number of subcultures that identify with being alternative including emo, punk, and grunge. You may research online for influences that may still be deemed appropriate at work.For example, you may have the sticker of your favourite punk band on the bag that you use in the office.

, If there is a certain pattern, print, or type of clothing that is trending within an alternative music scene, you may incorporate that into your office wear.For example, if red lips are big in the punk scene that you are listening to, use a more subtle shade of red lipstick when in the workplace.

, Alternative style is often associated with bright hair. While it may be too bold to dye everything a colour like green, you can still have streaks or a single inconspicuous streak.You may also use nail polish or have colourful accents in your clothes or accessories if your workplace is too uptight to allow you to have colourful hair.

, There are a lot of prints and patterns that can be seen as alternative including black lace, leather, spikes, velvet, skulls, leopard print, crosses, chains, and plaid. You can include small splashes of these patterns and prints in your wardrobe without having to commit to something too bold like a leopard print skirt.Make sure to consult your HR department to familiarize yourself with what is appropriate at your office as it may be different from office to office.

, Dress to show off a different aspect of your personality. Just because your office does not allow something doesn’t mean you can’t be creative and find another way to express yourself. For example, just because you may not be allowed to wear a top with a large graphic skull printed on it, doesn’t mean you can’t wear a skull brooch on a more demure top.Take pride in the fact that not everyone can pull off your style.

, It may take time to discover the most toned down versions of your style. You may need to shop for accessories or pieces that look similar with the same alternative flair but with a more professional touch. Have fun creating new outfits and going through your wardrobe for edgy yet complimentary pieces., Get comfortable in your work environment before you become more bold. You may be able to add prints that work with a pencil skirt. For example a top with cobwebs and insects subtly printed on it may look great with a pencil skirt and a blazer as it may just look like a black and white pattern floral pattern.Keep your prints and patterns inconspicuous until your coworkers know you and you have formed mutual respect.

, The best way to stand out in a professional setting is it let your work do the talking. A sense of style shouldn’t impede your professional life. As long as you don’t offend anyone and your work goes above what is expected, your style should be of no question.It may become difficult to work if you feel it has become a hostile environment simply because people are judging you on your style. If your idea of normal is deemed as weird, make sure to politely and calmly talk to your co workers individually so you can know each other on a more personal level and they will no longer question your motives.
Make sure your work is appreciated. It’s okay to be a fashion outsider but make sure you’re receiving validation for your work. Don’t give your employer any reason to discipline you so make sure you’re receiving positive feedback in your work and that your outfit is within the guidelines of your HR department.

, If you have splashes of colour or an asymmetrical count, make the bold style less obvious by wearing your hair up. If you have the side of your head shaved, sweep your hair to make the disjointed look less noticeable., Jewelry and accessories are a great way to express yourself without having to completely change your outfit. Find pieces that compliment your wardrobe and provide subtle splashes of personality to your outfit.For example, wear skull earrings or a skull ring.

, Try to empathize that people see you through a different lense but be proud that you are expressing yourself as an individual and pulling off a look no one else can. Never judge anyone else as you obviously don’t want to be judged either., While it may seem difficult to tone down your personality during the week, ask yourself if your job is more important than your style. If it is, let your full personality out outside of work hours. Part of being professional is adhering to the rules of conduct.


If your style is more important than your job, find a job that let’s you be more comfortable while you work.

, Make sure you check with the school rules before dying your hair but have fun and express yourself once you know it’s okay. Dye can wash out and hair will grow back. Check the hair dye for any harmful chemicals or consult a professional., Make sure to try everything before making it permanent. It may seem like a good idea to get a tattoo or piercing but be safe and get a temporary replacement to test out whether it suits you. You may find a piercing inconvenient or a that you find a better tattoo design.Tattoos and piercings especially need a lot of thought as they are permanent and you may grow out of them. Depending on your age, your body still may be changing physically and your tattoo or piercing may look a lot different in the next few years.

, Whether you talk to your parents, older siblings, teachers, or other alternative friends, you need to find people who can relate to wanting to be different. If you stand out in school people may make fun of you for being different. Find a support system to remind yourself that being different is good and that you are who you are., Whether it’s music, fashion, or activities like skateboarding, experiment with what makes you happy. There isn’t a set of rules for being alternative so don’t let other people tell you what you can or can’t do. Just make sure that you are safe and that you aren’t hurting or offending anybody.If you are trying different activities like skateboarding or parkour, remember to be safe. Always wear a helmet and safety equipment to prevent injury.

, If you do not know how to be alternative but think a group of older students do, mimic their style. Ask them questions about where they show or what music they listen to. If you are shy, you may simply quietly observe them and do research on your own.

, Use social media to find alternative groups in your school or near your house. Chat with others to share resources and learn more about alternative culture. Research bands who interest you and their fan forums for inspiration. Read blogs to help give you a sense of any changes in fashion.

, There are no hardened rules to being alternative. If you feel like having green hair, dye your hair green. If you feel like wearing all black, wear all black. Only you know what makes you happy and comfortable to be yourself.Make sure that your self-expression is within the rules of your school. You don’t want to get detention for an obscene shirt.

, Music can be a large part of being alternative. Listen to podcasts, join fan pages, and explore social media to find music that inspires you. Learn about what others are listening to and what inspires your favourite artists.Get out and see live bands at clubs or anywhere that supports all-ages shows. If you see a group you like, try to talk to them after the gig. Most up-and-coming groups like to talk to their fan base. Find out what music they listen to or what inspires them.

, It's very helpful for them to have a shoulder to cry on. Validate their feelings and let them know that they matter to you.Here are some useful scripts:


""Do you want to talk about it?""
""That sounds really tough.""
""I can see why you're so upset. That's a difficult problem to deal with.""
""Is there a way I could help you with that?""
""Would it be helpful if we told an adult about it?""

, Hug someone who looks upset, draw them a picture, offer them gum, or pick them flowers. This will help them recognize that people care about them.


If you're shy, that's okay. Silently handing them a piece of candy or sweet little note can cheer them up.

, People love to hear that you appreciate them. Thank lots of people: your parents, your teachers, guest speakers, the school janitors, anyone who makes the world a better place.


A helpful rule of thumb is that when you have a nice thought about someone else, it's good to share it. It will brighten their day.

, Everybody loves to feel like an expert, and asking for them to teach you lets them be helpful. Also, you can learn new ideas and pieces of wisdom from them.

, It's hard to be helpful and sweet if your own needs aren't being met. Pay attention to yourself, and it'll be easier to be kind to others. Your health comes first.


Eat healthy food and get at least 8 hours of sleep.
Give yourself some quiet time to relax each day.
If someone is bullying or upsetting you, tell an adult. Your feelings matter.
Never smoke, drink, or try drugs.

, It's good to be kind, but it's not good to be afraid to upset others. It's okay not to please everyone all the time. You don't have to do everything that people ask you to do, and you always have the right to say no.


Speak up if you see something that you think is wrong.
You don't have to hug people or smile if you aren't in the mood.
Practice scripts like ""No, thank you"" and ""I would prefer not to.""If a situation feels weird or wrong to you, even if you don't understand why, talk to a trusted adult about it.
If someone doesn't listen when you say no, tell an adult you trust.

Become environmentally friendly.",How to Be a Teenage Hipster," You simply cannot be a proper hipster wearing the same jeans and Hollister t-shirts like everyone else in school. You need original threads. Hipsters are notorious for their skinny jeans (both for guys and the ladies) so stock up on blue, black, and grey colors. Make sure they are VERY skinny. Band t-shirts are great, especially if no one has ever heard of them. Cardigans for fall, and pea coats for winter. Flannels are also great year round. For shoes, Converse hi tops, Vans, Doc Martens, or classic boat shoes. And of course, to top it all off, thick tortoise or black rimmed nerd glasses.


Hipsters are known for their vintage and ironic fashion. To get some vintage clothing, check out your local thrift stores, or online stores like Topshop or etsy.
During the summer, hipsters wear sunglasses. Specifically Wayfarer RayBans and aviators.;
, They tend to be very sarcastic, and avoid answering questions directly, but instead give a slightly rude sarcastic answer. They're also really chill, no matter what happens. They're laid-back and friendly to people who are friendly to them. If you get a bad grade, shake it off and don't worry, you can do better next time!

, I know this will be hard, since you're depressingly mainstream, but it's time to throw away your Lady GaGa, Katy Perry, and Bruno Mars, and start collecting some Indie vinyl. There are actually tons of great underground Indie bands out there, you just need to know where to find them. Go to local shows frequently, or maybe local music stores to see who's there. Then you can go on to wikipedia and search ""list of Indie bands"" and they will definitely hook you up.


You could also check out music blogs like Gorilla vs bear, Pitchforkmedia, and Stereogum. Pandora and LastFM are sites that find music you might like based on the artist, genre, or song you put into the search bar. Try putting in artists like Neon Indian, Wild Child, Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros, The Ramones, or Girls.

, Most hipsters are a deep and artistic type of people. There are many different types of arts. You can be interested in photography, drawing, or painting, or you can be a writer, of stories or poems, or you can even pick up a guitar or sit down at the piano and play. Any of these stimulating arts are good. Hipsters are also into subjects like Philosophy or Literature. They love reading the classics.

, Hipsters recycle, and don't litter, and enjoy nature and want to keep it nice. Most Hipsters are also vegetarian or vegan, which I highly recommend if you want to be Hipster. Not only does it keep you thin to fit into your skinny jeans, but it's also great to be against the cruelty to animals.

, Your stimming helps you stay calm, focus, and express your feelings.It is part of your disability (just like a blind person's white cane or a deaf person's sign language) and it's okay to be disabled in public. It's cute to be you!

, This can mean different things for different people, but it more or less means dressing in ways that make you smile. If you love it, that means it's lovable.


Wear your favorite colors.
Pick comfy fabrics that are great for stimming. Try soft fabrics like microfiber, breezy fabrics, or whatever you like.
Dress in layers in case you get hot or cold.

, If you do things that make you smile, it will help you be positive and nice to other people. Read about your special interests, sing and dance to music, paint, build a toy robot, or do whatever you like.


Your special interests are very important.Try joining clubs and meeting people who like your interests so that you can talk about them.
Autism is not just a list of problems. You also have remarkable strengths., You may have trouble speaking and snuggle with stuffed animals while you read Jane Eyre. This is all okay. A sweet autistic girl is a girl who isn't afraid to be herself.

, It's okay to be autistic, and it's okay to be you. You are already wonderful just the way you are!

Less is more.,
Strut your stuff with the right shoes.,

Move on.",How to Be a Heartbreaker," Simply put, people who look like they're having fun give the impression that they are more fun to be around. One of the quickest ways to attract attention is present yourself in a fun-loving, light-hearted way.


This is easier to accomplish in some settings than it is in others, so choose your night-on-the-town spot carefully. For example, a club, party, or any event that involves dancing is a great avenue to showcase your fun side. In this sort of setting, dance like you don't care who watches. Doing so projects confidence and a certain carefree mood.
Smile often even when you don't necessarily feel like it. Laugh at jokes, even when they aren't necessarily funny.
Control your laugh. A tinkling, flirtatious giggle will attract more positive attention than a boisterous guffaw.;
, Be the person in the crowd who decides when and what to do next, and never let your opinion get neglected.


If a guy you flirt with suggests heading out to another spot, keep control of the situation by playfully teasing that you would rather dance/hang-out/etc. at your current location for a little while longer, even if you secretly want to go as well. Then, when the time is right, indicate that you are ready to move on. The key here is to show that the decision is on your terms, not someone else's.
If asked where you want to go, come up with a place, even if you aren't dying to go there. This is another way to keep things going at your pace and establish a certain control of the night.

, When in a crowd of strangers, take the chance to make eyes at a few potential targets. Some may be turned off by the notion that they have competition, but others will either accept the challenge or find your obvious self-confidence attractive.


Another advantage created by this situation is that you project a certain boldness, suggesting that you can be just as happy without any given man on your arm as you will be with one. This may seem counter-intuitive at first, but you are, in some ways, throwing down the proverbial gauntlet and giving the guys around you a challenge.
When approached by someone in particular, though, focus most of your attention on him. In order to be a heartbreaker, you will need to offer at least a little hope that the interaction might progress into something more.

, Keep your deepest thoughts and feelings a mystery and only reveal the ones that may help you in your quest to be a heartbreaker.


Keep the conversation light and away from serious topics. Also avoid conversations that will allow the other person to get to know a lot about you, or you him.
If your mood suddenly sours, resist the urge to express as much outwardly. Maintain the same cool, confident demeanor and work through the situation until you can leave.

, The key phrase here is “a little.” Choose clothes that subtly reveal flashes of skin without looking as though you're begging for attention or trying to be trashy. Reveal enough skin to stimulate the imagination while keeping enough hidden to keep that imagination going.


Low-cut tops are the most obvious choice, but also the most abused. A top that shows a little cleavage can be highly effective, but if you feel that there is any risk of “falling out” of the top, it's probably more trashy than sexy.
The miniskirt or minidress is your next best bet.This works especially well if you have long, slender legs. As with low-cut tops, though, there is such a thing as going too far. If you are unable to sit down without flashing your unmentionables to the world, the skirt might be a touch too short. Aim for a length that you can feel comfortable and confident in.
Backless tops are less obvious choices, but they can be very attractive when worn right. During daily wear, the back is almost always covered. As a result, showing your back evokes a sense of intimacy without actually showing off anything inappropriate. Moreover, backless tops and dresses are difficult to abuse. Just make sure that your bra cannot be seen through the opening.

, Wear clothes that flatter your figure and draw attention to your best features while masking any features you may feel less-than-satisfied about.


If you have a wide midsection or minimal curves, highlight your natural waist by wearing a belt or choosing a top that cinches in at the waist. This also works well if you are trying to downplay large hips. By drawing attention to your waist, you accentuate the curves of your figure and balance out your overall body shape.
If you have a slim figure and you want to draw attention to that fact, wear tops, dresses, and skirts in straight cuts. To prevent the look from being boxy, make sure that you wear clothes that match your size. Oversized clothes will make you look frumpy.
If you want to draw attention to your bust, wear necklines that naturally draw the eye to the bust. Deep v-necks sweetheart necklines, and halter tops are all worth considering. Also consider wearing tops and dresses with embellishment or decoration near the neckline or bust.
If you want to draw attention to your hips or legs, wear skirts with a lot of detail. Think along the lines of frills, ruffles, and embellishments. On the other hand, a tight pencil skirt can also look attractive if you have the legs for it.

, Wear a long-lasting perfume with a fragrance that appeals to you. Note, however, that some scents will assist you in your quest to be a heartbreaker faster than others.


Stay away from floral, green, and oceanic fragrances. While these scents are great for casual wear, they tend to be fairly light and may not have as strong an effect.
Lean toward woody, musky, and Oriental scents when choosing the right fragrance for your heartbreaker persona. These scents tend to be richer and spicier.

, Only spray a little perfume along the pulse points of your body--most notably, your wrists, the back of your knees, behind your ears, and at the front base of your neck. Spraying too much perfume can make it hard for people to be around you, let alone fall all over themselves to be near you.

, For a night on the town, your best bet is a high heel. As with anything, knowing what type of heel to choose can make or break your look.


Choose a heel height you feel comfortable with. After all, if you end up tripping and falling flat on your face because you couldn't walk right, you might break an ankle but probably won't break any hearts.
Know that there is a limit to everything, even this. If you have to stop and ask yourself whether a pair of heels is sexy or trashy, you can bet that it will probably be the second option.
Strappy heels are feminine and work well with most dresses and skirts. On the other hand, heeled ankle boots can look a little more “edgy” yet just as appealing.

, Never cake on the makeup. Instead, focus on highlighting your eyes and lips while keeping your complexion looking clear.


Use foundation and concealer to smooth your complexion. You can use a little powder, if desired, but keep this part of your makeup looking subtle.
Apply eye makeup with caution. If you really want to bring out your eyes, you will need mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow. Only use enough mascara to lift your eyelashes, and never apply so much that your lashes look lumpy. You can get a little creative with the eyeshadow, particularly if going out at night, but keep in mind that shadowy colors and rich gem hues tend to look better than bright, “clownish” colors.
Choose the right type of lip gloss or lipstick. If you have notably heavy eye makeup on, a gloss might be enough. You can get away with a lipstick if you downplay your eyes, though. Strong pinks and reds work well, but richer shades may look better than neon-bright shades.

, Stay in shape and keep up on your basic hygiene routine so that you look your best both in and out of heartbreaker mode.


Monitor your weight with a balanced diet and exercise. The simplest way to do this is by keeping your calorie count in check. If you want to stay at the weight you're at, make sure that the amount of calories you consume through food equals the amount of calories you burn through exercise. To lose weight, burn more calories than you consume. To gain weight, consume more calories than you burn.
Bathe regularly. Showering every two days can keep your skin glowing and your hair clean and healthy.
Take care of your hair. If you have brittle, damaged hair, apply deep conditioners and other hair care products designed to infuse moisture back in. For limp, oily hair, look for products that regulate the balance of oil on your scalp.
Take care of your skin. Aside from washing up, you also need to care for your skin by applying lotion after every bath or shower. Stay out of the sun and avoid products that could stain or damage your skin.

, Never go too far with someone you only intend to play around with. The occasional flirtatious touch or kiss is still acceptable heartbreaker behavior, but never give the impression that you might be “easy.” On the contrary, you should make yourself seem like a challenge that never quite gives in.


The Marina & The Diamonds song puts it best: “Gotta be looking pure. / Kiss him goodbye at the door and leave him wanting more.”

, If you really want to avoid getting “trapped” or tied down, you will need to avoid giving out special treatment or getting to know any particular person too well.


Once you give your heart away to someone, your heartbreaking days are over. This is not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but something to keep in mind.

, Avoid frequenting the same spots too often to avoid running into the same crowd. As more people begin recognizing you within a given crowd, you may start to build up a reputation as a heartbreaker, and even new people may stop approaching you.

Reflect on your situation.,
Think about your personality and values.,
Consider what you want to rebel against.",How to Be a Rebellious Teenager1," Think about your life and see if you can determine an aspect that you find irritating or disappointing. If it helps, you can write out a list of things you’re not satisfied about. Think about your relationship with your parents, your friendships at school, and your extracurricular activities. It is normal to be rebellious, but you should be rebellious in a way that benefits you personally.


Connect with current debates on inequality and social justice in your community.
Think of any events in your own life that are currently bothering you.
Reflect if your group of friends agree with the issues you're currently facing.;
, One important part of being rebellious is to be yourself the whole way through! Don’t succumb to the styles and behavior you see your friends portraying. Rebellion should be a way for you to assert who you are with pride. Think about aspects of yourself that you are shy or insecure about.


One way to keep your emotions and desires in check is by keeping a journal. Every time you feel confused or frustrated, write out your feelings in a journal.
Keep track of what you’re feeling and channel this as you rebel.
Embrace the aspects of your personality you’re shy about.
If you’re uncomfortable exposing a personal part of yourself, seek out guidance from a counselor or a trusted peer.

, Once you’ve reflected and determined your own sentiments, you should be able to decide what you want to rebel against. Many teens have trouble following their authority figures such as parents or teachers. The other major force many feel inclined to rebel against is the conformity of fitting in.


These two categories aren’t always separate and it’s common to enact both.
Think about what bothers you the most.
Don't act out towards a teacher. Teachers are only doing their job and shouldn't be a target of your rebellion.

"
Avoid knee-jerk rebellion.,
Let others run their own lives.,
Think about the groups you belong to.,
Use social media less often.,
Critique mass media messages.,
Examine your own actions.,
Expose yourself to different viewpoints.,
List your priorities.,
Examine your inspirations.,
Experiment.,
Read a variety of books.,
Read books that deal directly with nonconformity.,
Persevere regardless of feedback.,
Talk about your perspective.,
Lose the drama.,
Understand consequences.,
Wear what makes you happy.",How to Be a Nonconformist," You might be sincerely unhappy about the pressure to conform, or society's requirements. Try not to let this spread to ""nonconformity for its own sake."" Becoming a nonconformist is about discovering what works for your personally, not choosing the more difficult path out of spite.;
, Stereotypes and snap judgements are just another side of social pressure. Don't form an opinion of someone based on their membership in a subculture, whether that's a religion, a fandom, or a school clique.

, Keep in mind that even a subculture without mainstream status or social respect has its own codes of behavior. Examine these pressures, as well as mainstream social pressures. A group of like-minded people can make you feel comfortable and accepted, but it will not necessarily teach you how to find your own path.

, If you use social media, try to restrict your use to a few minutes a day or less. Constantly checking on other people's behavior, and/or sharing what you are doing yourself, can make it hard to develop your own genuine opinions.

, Popular television shows, magazines, music, video games, and other media are major forces in shaping conformist expectations and pressuring people to follow them. Consume these in small doses, if at all, and use a critical eye to examine them. Ask yourself questions like the ones below, and come up with the answers yourself:


If you have a strong emotional reaction to a television character, do you think the show creators intended you to? Why would they choose that character to be a villain, a hero, or a sidekick?
How do advertisements and song lyrics portray a good time, a good person, a romantic or sexual relationship? Is there a better alternative, or more options that should be encouraged?

, After each social encounter, or after you make plans for one, reflect on your behavior and the decisions you made. If your actions or decisions were made to please someone else, or to avoid teasing, recognize that these were reactions to conforming pressures. Equally, if you avoided doing something ""popular"" or expressed a negative opinion because other people were interested in the topic, the social pressures around the action or topic were still determining your behavior. Make a mental note of these occurrences, so you can think honestly about your preferences the next time the situation comes up.

, The more educated and experienced you are about diverse perspectives, the less you'll take mainstream opinions for granted. Talk to community members you wouldn't normally encounter, outside of your religion, ethnicity, sex, and age group. If at all possible, travel to new places and spend time getting to know the locals.

, Sit down and think about what would make you most happy, if social pressures didn't exist. Decide whether you'd like your clothes to be comfortable or stylish, and which kind of clothing you think falls under that description. List the activities you enjoy, or ones that you would like to try out.

, Copying someone is antithetical to the whole idea of nonconformity, but using individuals or movements as inspiration for your own ideas and behavior is perfectly acceptable. Ideally, critically examine many influences to help direct your own style, political opinion, and behavior. These can be individuals, such as Nikola Tesla or Gandhi, or groups, such as a political movement, a band, or a sports team.

, Try out different behaviors and styles. Learn who you are, what you like and dislike. Many people will assert their standards, opinions, and ideals. Think for yourself and choose the ones that seem right to you.

, Read authors from other countries and centuries, especially ones who originally wrote in another language. Seek out authors who defied the literary and social conventions of their time, to get a perspective not included in mainstream works. Here are a few examples:


U.S. counterculture authors, such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, Kurt Vonnegut, and Hakim Bey.
Novelists that experiment with form and style, such as James Joyce, Flann O'Brien, Andrei Bely, Milorad Pavić, and Gabriel García Márquez.

, If you'd like to understand conformity and social pressures better, many books discuss the issue directly. Two main categories of books deal with this especially:


Many young adult novels deal with issues of nonconformity, including the high school novel Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli, and the sci-fi series Uglies by Scott Westerfield.
Scholars who have written directly against conformity include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Freidrich Nietzsche, Henry David Thoreau, and Jean-Paul Sartre.

, Negative feedback doesn't matter. Positive feedback is not required. Remind yourself of this whenever you feel anxious or stressed because of social pressures.


Just because you don't follow social convention blindly doesn't mean you're immune to it. Try to minimize time spent with friends or family members who discourage you or give you unpleasant feedback.

, If anyone wants to talk to you about your nonconformist behavior, be open and honest about your perspective. There's a reason you make the decisions you do, and talking about them can help reinforce your confidence, and maybe even encourage others to think for themselves.

, Do not overreact or tersely call out words; it tends to aggravate those around you. You may be acting differently than everyone else, but don't confront their behavior unless you find it actively harmful. Most of all, don't try to convince people to conform to your personal, nonconformist behavior. Be an example, not a proselytizer.

, Being comfortable with your behavior does not make you free from consequences. Make sure you are prepared to face negative reactions or punishment for your actions, and move forward only when expressing yourself or challenging the status quo is important enough to outweigh them.

, When shopping, ignore everything you've heard about fashion, what's emo, what's preppy, and all the rest of it. When you see a shirt you like, decide why you like it. Is it because you truly like it, or because you saw a magazine feature it? Decide whether you're comfortable with the answer. If you are, buy the shirt; if not, move on. Nonconformity isn't about wearing controversial clothes, it's about wearing whatever you like.

Act with a passion.,
Go against the rules with strategy.,
Voice your opinions.,
Wear different clothes.,
Do something with your hair.",How to Be a Rebellious Teenager2," The first step to acting rebelliously is to act differently than you normally act. You can do this at home and at school. One trait common among “rebellious teens” is apathy, but this isn’t a true form of real rebellion.Act with a passion to show that you want to see a change.


For example: someone pushes you in the hallway. Instead of shrugging the event off, say something. You could say, “Carl, watch where you’re going.”
Be mindful of your safety and don’t confront the wrong person.

, Break the rules that you find to be unjust or wrong. Consider the outcomes of breaking the rules and think if it’s worth it. Consider something like organizing a peaceful protest against your governor, or refusing to follow discriminatory dress codes in school.


If you are pressured into something serious like stealing school property, don’t risk jail time.
Breaking the rules can be a good thing for you, but you should attempt to keep up communications with your parents.

, In today’s society, many people are afraid to speak what they are feeling. If you have something to say in class, say it. Voicing an opinion is a classic trait of the rebellious intellectual, who tells the story how it is instead of candy coating it. Avoid being the “rebel without a cause,” and speak up when you see something wrong.


Be vocal against inequality or cliques in your school. Speak up for the victims of bullies and advocate for nutritious food for your school’s cafeteria.
Another way to voice your opinions is by joining a group like Amnesty International or your school’s LGBTQ group.
Avoid offending anyone while speaking your opinions.

, There are several trends that are considered rebellious like the goth look or punk rock clothes. A classic wardrobe choice for artists and intellectuals is wearing all black. You don’t have to dress a particular way to express your feelings, but it might help.


Instead of getting too concerned about what to wear, focus on the issues you want to rebel against.
The classic image of a rebellious youth is tight jeans, punk/metal band t-shirt, and a funky haircut. Just because you wear this style doesn’t make you a rebel. This wardrobe has become mainstream, but that doesn’t mean you can benefit from that style.Form your style and dress choices to fit your personality.

, One way to give yourself a new look is by styling your hair yourself. It probably won’t look too good, but that’s the whole point. Try dying your hair a funky color. You can get wash-off, non-permanent dye, in an epic range of colors!


Before you think of yourself as being original, most of the “classic” rebel looks have been done before. If you want to look unique, try giving yourself a monk haircut.

"

Play punk music.,
Skateboard.,
Read a liberating book.,
Draw or make crafts.,
Have a relationship.",How to Be a Rebellious Teenager3," Punk music is a great outlet for frustrations you incur while in your teenage years. The beauty of punk music is that you don’t have to be good at playing music. The classic approach to playing punk is picking out three chords and playing them very fast.


Try picking up the guitar, drums, or bass. Convince your friends to play with you.
Listen to punk music for inspiration like: The Ramones, Sex Pistols, New York Dolls, Minority Threat, The Misfits, and The Fall to name a few.

, Skateboarding culture is very similar to punk rock music and rebellion in general. You skate wherever you want despite what authorities say. Skateboarding is also a good physical release of energy.You’ll get hurt in the process, but that is what skateboarding and rebelling is all about.


You can alternatively pick up a pair of inline skates or even a bmx bike for a similar effect.

, While many might not think of reading as being rebellious, it is. Stimulate your mind and educate yourself by reading thought provoking literature. Learning is power, and you shouldn't rely on the classroom to teach you everything.One of the most classic characters to enact teenage rebellion and angst is Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye by Salinger. Here are some other thought provoking books you should read:


1984 by George Orwell
The Stranger by Albert Camus
Das Kapital by Karl Marx
Candide by Voltaire

, Release your creative side by engaging in an artistic process. Pick up a notepad, pen, and try to create something. If you have trouble drawing something in your head, look at pictures online or from magazines. Once you develop a style you like, try creating stickers with that drawing.


You can pick up a hand full of stickers from the post office and draw your design with a marker. Go around town and stick your work up in public. Don’t get caught by the law!

, While it is not rebellious to get into a relationship, sometimes this type of attention can help your frustrations. Relationships are good outlets for you to share your feelings with. If you are attracted to someone you know, ask them out for a cup of coffee. Even a small coffee date can get a lot off your chest.


Having sexual relationships as a teenager can be considered rebellious. If you do choose to engage in this type of activity, be safe while doing so by wearing protection."

Be yourself.,
Be confident.,
Be calm.,
Be polite.,
Don't be afraid to be absurd.,
Don't go into detail.,
Be unreadable.,
Turn the focus on the other person.,
Talk in facts.,
Be mysteriously absent.,
Keep your past a secret.,
Have perfect posture.,
Develop your own unique sense of style.,
Pick hobbies that don't mesh.,
Keep the emotions to a minimum.,
Stay offline...mostly.,
Take it to the limit.",How to Be a Mysterious Girl," Have you ever met someone that's just so different from you? So different that the way they see the world is just...fascinating? These people aren't mysterious by nature, they're just mysterious because of the difference between the two of you. You know the only way to be different from everyone? By being yourself.


Seriously. Think about it. When a man and woman are dating, the element of mystery mainly comes from the way each person views and interacts in the world. The man sees the woman flitting about in her feminine world, knowing he'll never be a part of it and vice versa. The same goes for your unique world, regardless of gender, regardless of relationship.;
, In order to really be yourself in today's world (the one that's plastered with images from the media about the necessity to blend in and succumb to fleeting trends), you have to be confident. When the world says, ""sink or swim?"", it's the only way you'll swim. And, oh yeah, people love confident people; they're super magnetic. They're persuasive, attractive, and admirable and we often don't realize why.


There is nothing mysterious about having low self-worth. When that's plaguing you, all your actions are dictated by the thought, ""Will people accept me?"" A) That's not at all attractive and B) it's super easy to see through and figure out. The confident person, the one who's comfortable in their skin, asserting themselves, standing up for what they believe in, is the one people naturally flock to, the one people will look at and say, ""What is it about them?""

, People who wear their emotions on their sleeves don't leave much to the imagination. After a few days, you know what eats at them, what makes them happy, and what makes them want to ball up in a corner. But if you're the person that's calm all the time, no one will know what really gets you going. This can backfire though -- they'll try even harder to find it!


Be the one who's lighthearted in dire situations. And if you must show emotion, show ones that wouldn't necessarily correlate with the circumstance. It's cold outside but it's not snowing? What the heck, mother nature?! What kind of game is she trying to play?! Man, this winter just isn't worth it. You're moving to Belize.

, Since being mysterious is often equated with ""dark"" and ""aloof,"" it's important to circumvent those negatives by being polite. Being mysterious does not mean being rude or unresponsive. Don't confuse the two! Everyone deserves being treated well, regardless of how you're trying to come off.


Having a slight smile on your face at all times is a good way to start. Not only will you look more friendly and approachable, but people will be left wondering, ""What's really going on in her head?"" If you've ever walked by someone on the street that's smiling or laughing to themselves, you know this feeling.

, As we age, we slowly gauge what society expects from us and how we should act in public. You could insert a chicken wing into your mouth, chew it up, and then spit out the bone on the floor, but you don't (probably). While you shouldn't necessarily take that example to heart, think about the impulses you do have that wouldn't be terrible. When a waiter comes up to your table and asks you what you'd like, sometimes you just want to say, ""I could tell you -- but then I'd have to kill you."" Completely deadpan. And that's okay.


While it's not the most sophisticated of tactics, it will get people wondering what the heck is going on in that brain of yours. And it can be fun! So next time you order a shrimp salad, preface it with, ""I have a shellfish allergy."" When they ask why you ordered what you did, tell them you'll work through it.

, When people ask us questions, we generally know what they're expecting. When someone says, ""Are you in a relationship?"" we know that it really means, ""Are you in a relationship? And if so, what kind and with who?"" Instead of saying, ""Yeah, I have a boyfriend -- his name is George. George Glass."" Just say, ""Yes."" They won't know if they can pry any further -- but they'll want to!


Try to summarize stories as factually and accurately as possible without truly getting into it. Don't insert commentary -- just stick to what actually happened.
Let's say your boyfriend asks you about your ex. Instead of going on and on about why it didn't work out, tell them, ""We didn't mesh. When the relationship ended, I stopped thinking about it."" Simple. Terse, maybe, but to the point and honest.

, Most of our interactions with other people are non-verbal. We have dozens of ""tells"" going on at any one time indicating to others how we feel at that exact moment. Be aware of this and consciously take advantage of the patterns people are relying on. You know how James Bond gets all serious when he's telling a joke? Kind of like that. When he's hitting on a woman he's stoic, too. And that's one mysterious guy.


Think about your body positioning when you're interacting with a person. Experiment with changing it around and seeing how the other person reacts. Play with your tone of voice. Your eye contact. Leave them wondering how the heck you were feeling.

, This one is surprisingly really easy. Get into a conversation with a person and all you have to do is ask them questions to get them running. After it's over, they'll be left thinking how great of a conversationalist you were and not even realizing they didn't learn anything about you. In short, people love talking about themselves, so take advantage of it!


Ask open ended questions. When you see a spark in them, jump on it. Get them talking about it. Act genuinely interested to keep them going. You'll seem nice, like a good listener, and you'll be fun to be around even though you're barely doing anything. See? Easy.

, When the conversation does roll around to you, talk in facts about other things. Don't talk in your opinions, beliefs, or experiences. That way you can add value to any conversation without truly giving away something about yourself.


Instead of saying, ""Oh my gosh, I read this thing on the Internet the other day while I was killing time before drinks with Sally about how drinking one more liter of water a day can lead to noticeable weight loss long-term and I'm definitely gonna try it. Working out just isn't enough!"" stick to, ""Some research is saying that upping your water intake can lead to noticeable weight loss. Definitely a viable tactic."" You're getting the same point across without exposing too much about yourself.

, So in order to get invited to parties, you have to actually go when you are invited. But once you've gotten your foot in the door and these people like you, feel free to be mysteriously absent. Don't show up to something. Make people wonder where you are. Come late. Leave early with no explanation. Get them wondering.


Do this sparingly. If you get up and leave from a party all the time, it'll become a quirk of yours that's a little annoying. If you never show up in the first place, you'll stop being invited. So as with anything, pick your battles.

, If you're the new kid in town and you want to keep the intrigue up, don't talk about your past. You'd be surprised what you can get away with! When someone asks you where you moved from, say something like, ""It matters not where you've been -- only where you're going."" Or, you know. Keep it simple and say ""Utah"" but don't give any details. That might cause fewer weird looks.


If keeping your past a secret sounds like an issue, make a game out of it. Tell everyone a story about how you lived in Viet Nam a while back and worked on a ferret farm. Then talk about how you were a chef at a fine restaurant back in your old 'hood. And then magically insert into a random conversation down the line the story of the year you spent hanging out with Charlie Sheen. Might as well get a kick out of the image you're cultivating, right?

, Having a slouch shows low self esteem, and instead of seeming mysterious, you'll seem shy, or like a loner, which you don't want. The perfect posture is to stick out your sternum, shoulders back, but keep your stomach in a straight line. If your posture is bad, do exercises to Improve Your Posture. Having a perfect posture makes you seem attractive and confident, which will get you positive attention from both men and women, giving you more people to talk to.

, Unfortunately, clothing trends make us pretty easy to peg -- or at least give people the impression that we're peg-able. Wearing a scarf and thick, black glasses? You're a hipster. Wearing a top that shows off your chest and a mini skirt? Doesn't even need to be said. Are your pants down around your knees and your shoes untied? Sheesh. So instead of prescribing to a label, make your own.


If you like it, go for it. You can mix up styles in one look, or you can rock different looks at different times. One day you rock the black rimmed glasses, the next day it's North Face. The next day it's a top you made yourself. Or it's all three at the same time. Whatever floats your boat.

, If you were shown a typical high school football player, you'd probably think, ""Okay, he's probably athletic, takes classes like woodshop, likes partying on the weekends and has a preppy girlfriend."" If you were shown a typical high school band member, you'd probably think ""A little introverted. Smart. Probably has a few close friends. Close to family. In general, nice. Maybe plays a few too many video games."" While these are just stereotypes and not at all correct, mix the two anyway. Be the girl wearing the lipstick and short skirt who's carrying around The Divine Comedy. Be the saxophone player who lights up the soccer field on weekends. Do it all.


The more dynamic you are, the harder you'll be able to be put into a box. And once people have you boxed in, you're no longer mysterious. So go out there and do something that ""you"" wouldn't normally do. Not only will you be mysterious, but you may find something you seriously enjoy that you didn't think you would.

, When people can easily get a rise out of you, they'll do it. When they know what ticks you off, what really gets you excited, they feel like they get you. Avoid wearing your emotions on your sleeve so you don't get pegged. When people can't get a feel for how you feel, they'll never know what the truth is. When you come up, they won't even know what you like, what you dislike, and what you stand for. Most people can't keep their mouths shut!


it's a good idea to keep the volume to a minimum, too. Ever noticed how loud people are never mysterious? No one ever says, ""Americans, now that's one mysterious bunch!"" So feel free to whisper to the person next to you with that blank, unreadable face of yours. Everyone will probably think you're talking about them. Win. Oh, the games we play.

, You know those people that update their Facebook profiles every six seconds with thoughts like, ""OMG, I just forgot to eat dinner"" and the like? Don't be that person. That person is ruining Facebook for the rest of us. Don't post pictures of everything that's about to go into your mouth, don't post selfies you took in your bathroom when you were bored, don't Vaguebook trying to express your delicate, flowery emotions. When you have something to say online, make it worth it.


The fact of the matter is we don't need to know what all of us are doing at any moment. The less we know, the better, really. If you want to be mysterious, leave people wondering where you are, who you're with and what you're doing. So avoid checking into Starbucks every morning. Avoid ""Dear so-and-so"" statuses. Resist the temptation of putting a hashtag after everything you say. While social networking is useful, don't use it to let the world in on everything you think and do.

, There are a jillion ideas out there that you could take advantage of if you really want to be mysterious. You could do silly things like wearing dark sunglasses. You could purposefully make your room Gothic and yet princess-themed. You could use air quotes and say things like, ""I went to the ""post office"" today."" You could wear a cape. How far are you willing to go?


Wanna have a little fun with it? Pretend you're someone you're not. When you enter a party, you give people a fake name and ask them if the mob has been here recently. It's not quite the same as being yourself, but it can be quite entertaining!

Wear fun and unique clothes.,
Hair.,
Make-up.,
Try decorating your room the way YOU want it.,
Don't be too girly.,
Be funny and fun to be with.,
Don't be shy!,
Be yourself!",How to Be a Fun and Unique Girl," Just about any girl can wear a skirt. But you want to be fun and unique. How about trying something new? Here are some ideas:


You could cut holes into your jeans and sew materials on the back, so that they are visible through the holes.
You could stitch a pattern or even your name onto your jacket (Make sure it is the right fabric - a raincoat would not be advisable.)
Improvise! Create something new and different. What would they say if you wore a skirt and jeans underneath? Not that it matters, of course, because you are unique!;
, You don't have to have long hair just because you are a girl. Try out unique and fun, but also stylish and cool hairstyles. And, also, you don't have to have a natural colour if you don't want to. How about dying your hair red for a change? Just remember not to go too wild, otherwise the people around you will possibly think you're just weird instead of unique.

, But if you want to be unique, you need to create something new. You can go out of the house with black smokey eyes and bright red lipstick, or you can walk around wearing none at all. Whatever makes you feel yourself. Maybe somewhere in between?

, Don't do it because you feel like you need to! Don't do it because someone says to you that it is a mess! Decorate it the way that makes YOU feel comfortable!

, Instead of bringing make-up to school, bring a football once in a while. Of course, you probably have a girly side to you! You can still have makeovers and stuff like that. But remember that you want to be different and unique.

, Tell a joke once in a while. Make the people that are around you happy. Always be cheerful and have a smile on your face! You're gonna want to be a pleasant, kind person, and a nice friend.

, If you hide from people, they won't get to know you and that way you won't have a chance to let them know how fun you are to be with!

, This is the most important step. DO NOT let anyone change who you are! This article is also no use to you if what it describes is nothing like you! Be who you want to be, not what others what you to be.

Hold unpopular views on political and social issues.,
Question popular and common beliefs.,
Know that some conformity is normal.,
Think of rebellion as a movement, not just an attitude.,

Speak your mind, especially when others are afraid to.,
Do what you want to do, not what people expect from you.,

Shrug off people's negative opinions about you.,

Know the difference between rebellion and recklessness.,
Remember that your actions always have consequences.",How to Be a Rebel," A central part of being a rebel is to develop views that go against popular, traditional views.


Musical rebels like Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur based much of their work and philosophies on fighting the establishment, defying expectations of their peers, and acting the opposite of others' expectations.They did what they felt, said what they believed, and didn't care about what others thought.
The United States and other free countries were founded on unpopular beliefs. In the 1960s during the civil rights movement, interracial marriage was deemed illegal in certain states.Segregated marriage was a popular belief and is now considered wrong. The people who fought against it are now credited as being upholders of freedom and thinkers who were ahead of their time.
Remember that ""popular"" is relative. People at your school may believe partying and doing drugs is the popular social norm. Defy this norm by being clean and proudly advertising that to others.;
, Part of holding unpopular views is to question things that most people believe at face value.


The French scientist Georges Cuvier tried to convince people that African-Americans were not as smart as Caucasians because of their skull shape and size.His student, Friedrich Tiedemann, questioned this theory and showed that there was no scientific evidence to support this commonly accepted ""truth.""Questioning your beliefs and the beliefs of others is difficult, but rewarding work. Remember that accepting things at face value is common among people because it is the easiest.When you question things, you will naturally stand out from the pack because the act of questioning tends to be rare.
Questioning things isn't just a way to stand out, it is a way to arrive at the truth. When you question things that turn out to be true, you will be held in high regard by your peers. Most people in the 16th century believed that the Earth was flat. Pythagoras, the person who proved the opposite, is now revered in both science and mathematics., You don't have to be completely different from everyone around you to be a rebel. Following trends is part of being human, and actually helps us navigate everyday life.


Musicians like Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur are credited as being some of the most rebellious artists in their respective genres. Still, they tended to dress and behave in ways that were similar to their peers.
Most people aren't even aware of when they are conforming.Following others is a natural process, but that doesn't mean that you can't consciously notice when you are following others and decide to do otherwise.
You might notice that on the path to being a rebel, you'll find that there are others who share and believe in similar views. This isn't uncommon, and is often the way movements and revolutions start.

, Being a rebel involves taking physical action, not just holding and believing in unpopular views.


Even if you're determined to be a rebel without a cause, you will need to show others that you're your own person.
You don't have to hurt other people's feelings or say outlandish things to be a rebel. Being a rebel simply means displaying behaviors that are uncommon or unpopular.
For example, it may be popular and common for your peers to play football and wear letterman jackets on campus. Do the opposite by wearing torn jeans and obscure band t-shirts.

, You don't necessarily have to break the rules to be a rebel. All you have to do is act in a way that stands out from what's common.


For example, if you play sports and have a letterman jacket, stand out from your athletic peers by removing the sleeves of your letterman and wearing it like a vest.
If you are required to call teachers proper names like ""Mr. Moser"" or ""Mrs. LaGuerta,"" put a playful spin on it by calling them ""Mr. Most-definitely"" or ""Mrs. L.""
If your school requires you to wear a school uniform, like a nice pair of pants and a collared shirt, throw some personality into your wardrobe by leaving your shirt untucked. Or, you could tuck your shirt into nice pants with holes at the knees.
If your peers tend to walk slowly while looking down at their phones, grab some attention by skipping through the hallways on campus. Strut proudly, sing a song while skipping, swing your arms like a gorilla. People tend to remember things that are unusual or difficult to understand., Speaking your mind doesn't mean just blurting out whatever you are thinking at a given moment. It means advocating for your opinions and beliefs, especially on issues you feel strongly about.


You may feel that your cafeteria is severely lacking in yummy foods like burgers and tacos. Tell the school administration that they should include more foods that teenagers enjoy.
If you can't rally up people to present your case, do it by yourself. Having numbers may be a powerful way of showing people that you mean business, but it isn't the only way. As long as you provide solid evidence for your beliefs, you should be fine (for example, good tasting foods help learning because they increase serotonin levels, and high serotonin is essential for memory).If your school is hosting a poetry slam, write some spoken word about how the cafeteria food sucks. Paint a picture of foods that you want to eat at school, and hang it on people's lockers. Sing a song during lunch about people's choice of what to put in their bodies. Art is a great way of getting people to see the merits of your views and expressing yourself in creative ways.

, Doing what's in your heart may possibly be at the ultimate core of what it means to be a rebel.


If you feel an uncontrollable urge to dance, join the dance squad or dance feverishly in the quad during lunchtime. If you like to argue with people about their beliefs, join the debate team and pick people apart in a structured manner. Rebelling isn't just about using your voice, it's about using your body.
Find something you are truly passionate about and align your actions with that passion. If you hate animal cruelty, picket the lunch line for hamburgers with signs of cute baby cows. Rebels with a specific cause tend to be the most prominent and memorable., Making a spectacle of yourself is a great way to make people do a double-take. Dare to grab hold of people's attention from everyday, mundane routines.


Outrageous is subjective. If your school tends to have multiple people who sport mohawks and ripped jeans, dress in a rock/preppy fashion. Wear a long sleeved collared shirt with the sleeves ripped off. Wear dress slacks with holes in them. Wear a tie that is loose and extremely loud.
Rebellion is all about contradiction. If you can create contradiction within your wardrobe, people might notice you even more. For example, wear a mohawk but also wear thick framed glasses. Wear a pair of worn sneakers with a business skirt. Throw a nice blazer over a Black Sabbath t-shirt and jeans.
Sport accessories that are strange but relevant to your personality. If you love teddy bears, have a teddy bear key-chain on your keys but dye the fur your favorite colors. Dye your hair blue to match your outfit. Don't be afraid to clash and look ""weird"" to others.

, Focus on ""doing you,"" not on pleasing others.


It will be common for people to mock and tease you for being different. Though you shouldn't lay down and accept their cruelty, you should also not take any of what they say to heart. People tend to fear things that are strange or different.If you find yourself being mocked and teased for being unusual, flaunt what makes you weird and embrace it. Write ""weird"" or ""strange"" on a t-shirt and wear it to school. When people see that those words don't affect you, they'll know they don't have any power over you and will find calling you those names useless.
If people call you really hurtful or offensive things, tell a school administrator. The reason people tease others is to ""get them in line,"" and is probably a remnant of the evolutionary behavior to regulate the group.Still, you shouldn't have to experience hurtful things for wanting to be different.

, Shrugging off ridicule is a great trait to have, but knowing when to advocate for yourself and others is also very critical.


Don't let people tease you for being different. You don't have to fight them physically or verbally. A simple ""leave me alone, I'm not hurting anybody"" is enough.
Teachers may tell you to act, dress, or behave a certain way because it is ""part of the rules."" If it truly is part of the rules, you may be better off following them. If your teacher is simply telling to behave a certain way because it is the norm, tell your teacher that you're not breaking any rules.
If you see someone who looks, acts, and believes the things you do, ally yourself with them. Rebels don't have to be lone wolves. Having a friend with similar beliefs and attitudes is a great way to expand on what makes you a rebel and come up with rebellious ways to express yourself.

, You don't have to fight the school administration over cafeteria items. Maybe freedoms of expression, like the right to wear certain band t-shirts or play certain music, is a more valued issue.


If doing a certain action - like questioning your teacher when she tells you to tuck in your shirt - means getting sent to the principal's office and possibly getting expelled, choose whether or not you believe enough in that action to bear the consequences.
Fight for issues that matter the most to you. You may be a fan of Led Zeppelin, but maybe being a vegetarian is more important. Forego your plea for ""rock music during lunchtime"" for ""more menu alternatives other than meat.""

, If your actions have a possibility of seriously hurting yourself or others, avoid doing them. Rebellion is about standing out; you don't need to do harmful things to do so.


It's normal for teenagers to be curious and to experiment. If you truly are curious and want to experiment with alcohol, drugs, or sex, be safe and cautious. Know that you don't have to do these things in order to be thought of as a rebel.
Remember that being a rebel means fighting conformity. Within your rebellious group, you may still face peer pressure to experiment with drugs or alcohol. If that is something you truly don't feel comfortable doing, don't do it. Tell your friends that you're ""being an even bigger rebel"" by not following them.
Some people think that being a rebel means damaging or vandalizing property. You don't have to be infamous in order to be a rebel. If you want to express yourself visually, decorate your own property with spray paint, stickers, and permanent markers.

, If being a rebel to you means constantly disobeying rules and fighting with other students, know that there are other consequences besides being ""known"" as a rebel.


You don't have to be violent and unruly to be a rebel. Sure, you can talk tough and walk with your chin up, but you don't have to harm people to be noticed. Being a rebel is about being original, and demeaning others to gain popularity is too common among many people.
Decide whether being expelled and losing an opportunity at an education is really worth being a rebel. Many political rebels like Tupac, Malcolm X, and Gandhi were focused on getting an education as a form of rebellion.As the old saying goes, ""knowledge is power,"" and being a rebel is about showing individual power.

When people ask you what you're doing, simply smile and go on with your business.,
Being mysterious is not about abandoning who you are, nor changing your interests.,
Don't confuse being mysterious with being mean.,
Often just read a book or draw.,
Definitely don't laugh or smile a lot.,
When you are outside, wear sunglasses all the time.,
If you are at a social gathering, don't stay too long.",How to Act Mysteriously," If they proceed further, then ask why it is their concern. Be careful here- some people may take this as being rude.;
, It is about being discrete in whatever you do. One of the best ways to be mysterious is to never reveal your identity to the person you want to appear mysterious to. This also prevents any disappointment later on.

, If you're saying 'nothing' when someone asks you what you're doing, don't say 'none of your business' or stuff like that. You're friend might think that you are mad at them or don't like them anymore. It could hurt their feelings. Being mysterious means to create an atmosphere of suspense, making people want to figure you out, rather than pushing them away.

, Don't skip rope or go play football or something like that. If you're going swimming or ice skating, simply go around just floating or looking about. Playing on rafts or using a bar to skate aren't very clever ways to make people think you're all that mysterious.

, If something seems a little bit amusing, you're limit is a mere grin or smirk, as if thinking 'that was dumb'. Laughing makes people think you're an open person, and you don't want that, now, do you?

, Buy a pair for every day of the week, but don't wear the same pair on the same days. Always switch them up, this will confuse people a little bit.

, Otherwise the people will get used to you being with them and realize that there is nothing that mysterious about you after all.


Be polite but brief in conversations. Don't make small talk or speak about shallow subjects. When you have something to say, make it truly meaningful and something that people will remember. Only respond to small talk or mindless chatter if asked a question or being spoken to. If you are in a shallow conversation and you have nothing to say, don't hang around. Tell them that you have somewhere else to be.
Always look like you are looking for something. Don't overdo it though. Look like you have a primary source of focus and they might get interested to finding out what you are absorbed in.
Don't be afraid of being different, but always limit the amount of information you give to people, the emotions you show to people and the interests you have. If someone is going to find out about one of your deep interests or passions, let them find out by them seeing you doing that thing, rather then you telling them that you like that thing. Actions speak louder than words.
While acting mysterious, avoid acting suspicious and learn the difference between the two looks because you don't want to make people think you are a criminal or a creep.
Being mysterious isn't about confusing people. It's about not revealing your whole self to people unless you are close with them. Confusing people with different clothing, styles, looks, etc will only make people think you have a wide range of style and personality. It is better to go narrower and deeper in your personality than it is to go broader and more shallow.
That being said, be yourself and never change who you truly are just to look mysterious. Being mysterious can fit in with and personality or lifestyle. It is just about being limited about what you reveal to people you don't know all that well.

Avoid dressing ""nerdy."",
Dress neutrally.,
Pay attention to contemporary fashion trends.,
Be open.,
Listen and engage.,
Stand tall and speak up.,
Don't over-obsess.,
Keep good friends.,
Don't forget your own self.,
Learn to balance.",How to Stop Being Viewed As a Nerd," The most powerful social stereotypes towards nerdy people concern their clothing and appearance. Society anticipates a nerd as someone who is dressed slovenly or unkempt. Perhaps some or all of their clothing is branded by icons from their favorite movies or video games. If you're looking to not be seen as a nerd--for whatever reason--look to your appearance first.


Avoid over-accessorizing. The popular image of nerd always involves the subject essentially wearing their interests, so keep away from big logos or clothes with images.
If you wear glasses, think about wearing contact lenses. Losing glasses not only helps you make stronger eye contact, it avoids probably the largest trope of nerdy dress: glasses.;
, Especially for those looking for social camouflage in a professional environment, wear nothing which you might say ""makes a statement."" Avoid bright colors, anything overly provocative, and anything with words or symbols. Save your fun clothes for when you can be your fun self; don't let your clothes give any impression when you're trying to get by unnoticed.


For men, this will most likely be slacks and a button-down dress shirt, tucked in with a belt. If it's not an overly formal occasion, jeans and a well-fitting, plain t-shirt ought to do.
For women in a professional setting, try slacks or a conservative shirt with a blouse that's not too revealing. For school attire or just going about your day, look to your peers who are considered especially fashionable (or at least not nerdy) and try to emulate their style., What some term ""nerd chic"" is seeping into the fashion world, so don't be afraid to re-work some stuff you've already got. For either of the sexes, don't shy away from simply mimicking contemporary trends in pursuit of not looking nerdy.


Formal wear turned casual is a good idea, particularly for men. If you have a sports jacket or suit coat that fits well, try wearing it with a image-less t-shirt and jeans.
If you're really trying to flush away your nerd image, swing to the other side of the pendulum and dress ""preppy."" Consider brands such as Lacoste, Abercrombie&Fitch, and Ralph Lauren.

, To combat the common view that nerds obsess to the exclusion of others, never be afraid to try new things, especially in any setting where you're trying not to be seen as nerdy. Look to be the first one around to step up to the group activity, to offer to get the circle started in karaoke, or to be the first in the pool.

, If people expect a nerd to be over-eager about the topics they love and apathetic about anything else, upend their expectation by being a focused, active listener.


Take interest in what others have to say, and follow up in conversation with appropriate questions.

""I've never rock climbed before, are there a lot of good climbing gyms in town?""
""That's amazing you've played violin for so long; what's your favorite thing about it?""


Try not to answer every question in class, even if you know every answer. People may interpret it as showing off, and it's never bad form to let someone else take the spotlight, even if only for a little.

, A big part of the nerd stereotype is the expectation of shyness and social paranoia. If you're looking to shed that skin, the first and most important factor is knowing how to speak up for yourself. This doesn't mean becoming harsh or abrasive, but instead learning to have confidence in what you're saying in any conversation.


Mind your posture. ""Stand tall"" isn't just a phrase, it's good advice. Be sure not to slouch in order to appear interested.
Don't be afraid to offer your own opinions. Many people opt for constant agreement for a smooth conversation, but dissent (when appropriate) is often a sign of resolve and confidence.
Be sure to speak up when conversing, and do your best to appear relaxed (even if you're not) when doing so., Though popularly associated with a love of gaming (whether electronic or table top), comics, and movies, most people would label ""nerd"" anyone who had a special affection for something, even if only ping pong or ballet. So, keep a check on your own obsessions when looking to disguise your nerdiness, but be sure to save time for them after the fact.


In a conversation, don't rush to talk about your favorite thing. Don't ignore it, but allow your opposite in the conversation draw it casually out of you.
If you're the academic sort, be sure to have hobbies outside of your education. Remember that emotional and social intelligence is something crafted outside of the classroom.
If it does come up, avoid overwhelming the conversation with your knowledge. Offer little, but always welcome questions., Hopefully, you'll be able to drop the social chameleon bit some time. It helps to have good friends who know you for you, and who share your interests. Whether it's work or school that calls for hiding one's self, it's always important to have least one other person around whom you can let your guard down.

, If you get too caught up in playing another version of yourself, you risk losing who you've been. Or, in a more real sense, you risk alienating the people who are close to you. If cloaking your nerdiness is a means to the attention of others, don't get trapped playing that part forever.Make sure any harmless conformity doesn't turn into outright fabrication. Don't lie or feign interest in something just to hide yourself. It not only offends the other person, it's demeaning to you.

, If you truly find yourself so overwhelmed by accusations of nerdiness, consider re-evaluating your interests and hobbies. Don't change just for the sake of change, but really take the time to make sure you're not only staying in your comfort zone for the benefit of being comfortable. Life is generally enriched by trying new things and by making sure we don't focus on any one thing at the expense of another.

Don't neglect your writing either.,
Don't be afraid of being quiet.,
Avoid false indicators of intelligence.,
Have a real conversation.,
Act confident.",How to Sound Intelligent," When you talk, use a clear and even voice. Start by working on keeping your tone and volume as even as possible. When you are prone to shouting or whispering, you might come across as less intelligent. In order to make your speech more clear, you’ll want to make sure you are not speaking too fast. You will also want to watch out for mumbling. Enunciating your words will also make you sound significantly more intelligent.


Enunciation is saying words clearly, without slurring or dropping sounds. For example, you would want to be very careful to enunciate when saying the word “ship”, especially if you were talking quickly.
You can use tongue twisters as an exercise to get you speaking at a good speed and make sure that you are enunciating correctly. Try saying: “Shep Schwab shopped at Scott's Schnapps shop. One shot of Scott's Schnapps stopped Schwab's watch.”;
, When you speak, use proper grammar as much as possible. Don't worry about colloquialisms and common phrases but do make sure that most of your speech is correct. When you use improper grammar, it tells people (even if its not true) that you don't understand your own spoken language. This makes you look unintelligent.


If you don't really know the proper grammar to use, listen to smart people talk and read a lot of high quality books. With a little effort, you'll pick it up with time.
An example of improper grammar would be ""You and me went for a walk"" instead of ""you and I went for a walk"". Another example would be replacing words or cutting words, like saying ""you been"" instead of ""you have been"" or ""I were/You was"" instead of ""I was/You were"".

, There are few things that will make you look sillier than using words incorrectly or pronouncing them very wrong. This tends to happen with more complex words, and especially if you're trying to fake looking smarter by using really fancy vocabulary that you don't actually understand yet. Stick to words you really know.


Common examples of mispronunciation include ""nu-cu-lar"" instead of ""nu-cle-ar"" and ""sup-pos-eb-ly"" instead of ""sup-pos-ed-ly"".
An example of incorrect word usage would be ""fellated"" instead of ""flouted"".
If you find yourself wanting to use a word but you're not 100% sure you know what it means or that you can say it correctly, write it down and look it up later.

, Filler language is made up of words that you say while you're trying to think of what to say next. Everyone uses filler language, even if they don't realize it. This is stuff like ""umm,"" ""ahh,"" ""err,"" ""like,"" ""I mean,"" and other things like that. The fill is different for every region and language but the effect is the same: you look like a slow thinker and it's harder to understand you.


Try to speak more slowly and when you need to pause to think, just stay quiet or redirect the conversation momentarily if possible.

, When you’re having a conversation or you’re in a meeting and you want to sound more intelligent, ask questions. Seems counter intuitive, right? When you ask the right kind of questions in the right way, however, it actually shows that you’re thinking about the situation and that you’re thinking in a smart way. Think of questions that show you’re looking for long-term goals or the reasoning behind actions. Think of questions that show you’re trying to gain a deeper understanding of complex systems. These are the sorts of questions that make you sound intelligent.


Example questions include: “Are we open to doing this more efficiently?”, “What do you think the root cause of the conflict really is?”, and ""What did this failure teach us and what can we take away for next time?”

, When you talk about subjects, use details. How did something happen? When? Who did it? Why? This shows that you understand more than just the surface presentation of the situation.


For example, don't say ""The meeting didn't go well."" Say instead, ""The meeting was unproductive. We brought what we had to the table but they were unwilling to deal. I suspect they think our offer isn't in earnest. Let's see what we can do to elaborate on our position.""

, When you tell someone your opinion don't just tell them the conclusion. Show them how you came to that understanding. Smart people have reasons for thinking what they do, and they'll usually tell you about it. If you don't have enough logic behind your opinion to talk to someone about it, that's also informative for you; it tells you that you need to go back and think some more about the situation.


For example, don't say: ""I don't like Guardians of the Galaxy."" Instead say something like, ""I felt like Guardians of the Galaxy tried too hard to be funny. The jokes occurred too often, making the pacing feel strange. It was like watching a stand up act, not an action movie.""

, Smart people love to fix problems. Problems are puzzles and their brain naturally seeks out the stimulus. If you see something in your life or in someone else's life that is causing issues, stop and try to find a solution instead of just ignoring the problem. This shows people that you're a thinker.


For example, when someone says ""I don't like my job"", don't just commiserate with them. Say something like, ""What don't you like about it? What is the most crucial thing that you would change? How can you change it? What would need to happen?""

, Anyone can learn a bunch of complex vocabulary and then spout off a sentence that they don't really understand. Technical language is good at covering up when someone really doesn't know what they're talking about. A really smart person, someone who really understands a situation, can talk about it in simple ways that even a child could understand. Don't hide behind complex language: explain things as simply as possible if you want to show how much you really understand something.


Bad example of how the internet works (from Wikipedia): ""The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide.""
Good example of how the internet works: ""The information you see on your computer is sent in little packets, like a letter. It's also sent with an explanation of where it's going, where it came from, and how the pieces of information should be put back together. This information is then sent through a series of relays, just like how real letters are sent, until it gets to its destination.""

, This doesn't mean you should use words like “abstemious”; using a lot of words that are very complex or unusual will make it clear that you’re putting on airs. Instead, talk like how we’re talking in this article. Build your vocabulary so that you are using common but high level words. These are the kind of words that you would be common to encounter in college, as opposed to high school. Having this kind of vocabulary (and being sure to use all the words correctly) will make you sound far more intelligent.


Good words to learn include: exacerbate, anathema, fastidious, efficient, idiosyncratic, and elaborate.
You can build your vocabulary through reading. Read books of higher and higher reading levels. Write down the words you don’t know and look them up. Memorize them as you go and you’ll have a richer vocabulary before you know it.

, You’re going to encounter very few people who know everything there is to know about every subject matter. When you meet someone who seems very intelligent, it’s usually because they know a lot about one particular area. You can do that too! Everyone gets excited about something. You’ll have an easier time becoming an expert in something you really enjoy. Do a lot of research on a subject that you care about and you’ll learn enough that when you’re talking about your passion, you’ll sound like a genius.


For example, let’s say that you’re really into video games. You could start learning about the craft, about what makes a game really good. Did you know there’s a lot of theory and planning that go into a good battle or a good story? You can learn about it by reading game developer blogs, in several online communities, and through online shows on Youtube like Extra Credits’ Design Club.

, Intelligent people pay attention to what’s happening in the world. They might stick to the developments in their specific area of interest, but they definitely pay attention. Of course, they don’t just listen to the reports that confirm what they already know about a subject. Smart people look for different viewpoints so that they understand an issue from all sides. When you follow current events, you’ll be able to talk about them in conversation, which will make you sound more intelligent.


You can follow current events by reading the newspaper. If you don’t get a newspaper, you can find many sources of news online. The BBC is a great source of quality news at a price everyone can afford: free. Wikipedia will also have some current event coverage.

, Sounding intelligent is more than just about how you talk. You also have to pay attention to how you write. If you’re 'writing lIk DIS', then you’re not going to leave a very good impression on the people that read your text. Even if you’re really very intelligent and what the text actually says is quite smart, you’ll still come across as dumb. Write in full sentences with correct grammar and spelling as much as you possibly can.


Example of a bad paragraph: ""Money is obviously important BUT if you chasing that #$%^ hoping it will solve all ur problems..you gonna be chasing that for the rest of ur life lol..so what's really important then? ""
Example of the same sentences edited to sound more intelligent: ""Money is obviously important. However, if you spend your whole life chasing it and thinking that it will solve all your problems, you'll end up wasting your life. What's more important: living your life or having the money?""
You can use online text editors, like Google Docs and Hemingway, to help get your writing looking as professional and intelligent as possible. Both programs are free.

, You might think that staying silent will make you look stupid but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Don’t feel like you need to state a fact every few minutes or drive the conversation in order to look smart. Saying something just for the sake of saying something can easily lead you to say something that is wrong or even might sound stupid. Instead, if you don’t know anything about the conversation or topic and even if you don’t have anything significant to add, just stay quiet.


Staying quiet makes it look like you’re thinking about the situation and thinking a situation through is a clear sign of intelligence. By saying nothing, you’ll actually be making yourself sound more intelligent.

, We associate some things with sounding intelligent but people that are actually smart will know what you’re doing if you try to fake it. They’ll also know when these indicators of intelligence aren’t actually an indication of intelligence at all. Focus on just being yourself instead of creating an act to make you sound smarter.


The best example of this is with accents. You might think that having a posh London accent makes you sound smarter, but accents are hard to fake. You’ll be caught and you’re more likely to look foolish than intelligent.

, Have you ever sat down and listened to a really dumb conversation? Think about how the conversation actually went. Most of the time, you’ll notice one common theme: the conversation never actually goes anywhere. People will talk and argue with each other just so that they have something to say. This is normal (people want to feel heard) but when you haven’t got very much going on upstairs, you’ll be more likely to have more of a two-sided monologue than a conversation. Conversations should be an equal exchange that follows a path until it gets somewhere, not just you talking about nothing to someone who is also talking about nothing.

, Finally, act confident when you talk. If you’re really good at projecting confidence, people are much more likely to believe just about anything you say (even if you’re wrong). You can make yourself sound more intelligent, if nothing else, by just making everything you do say sound positive and confident.


You can make yourself sound more confident by speaking up when you have an opinion or something to contribute, by looking people in the eye, speaking firmly and clearly, and speaking at a normal pace.
People talk higher, faster, and quieter when they’re nervous. Avoid this and you’ll go a long way towards sounding more confident.
Another giveaway is making a statement sound like a question. It’s “I am confident.” not “I am confident?”, right? You can do it!

Check out your clothes.",How to Avoid Having a Label," Clothes are one of the main things a label possesses. Dark clothes point towards goth and emo. Pink, Pastel, Polos and Clothes equal preppy. Bright, colorful, tight clothing scream scene. Weird, kiddish clothes speaks nerd or dork. Oversized hoodies, jeans hanging off the bum, jerseys, bling, and baseball caps usually equal swag. Thrift shop stores means that you're a indie or hipster. Flannel and hunting attire usually means that you're a flat out redneck or farm boy.;

Invite geeks to the holiday party with the promise that hot chicks (and/or dudes) will attend.,
Let them dress up.,
Add a Fantasy Theme.,
Get out the gaming.",How to Throw a Holiday Party for Geeks," You will need to find something more powerful than World of Warcraft to get a geek to leave the house and the only thing that will do that is the opposite sex. However, how are you going to get a hot chick to attend? One way to get a few lookers is to ask older siblings to invite their friends. If you get desperate, try begging your mom to invite her youngest-looking cougar friends to hang out during the holiday party. If you can push it to get them to wear Santa hats and short skirts, go for it.;
, Anyone who has ever been to Comic Con knows that geeks love to embody their favorite character. Whether they are hitting the town dressed as someone from The Walking Dead, Scott Pilgrim or The Amazing Spiderman, you know the request to dress up will be welcomed with open arms. Since geeks are very detail oriented about their costume you may want to throw down a few ground rules:


No real weapons with your costume. Real weapons, while totally cool could turn your innocent little holiday party into an evening where everyone is stuck looking for Jacob’s slashed thumb. While geeks may be fascinated and have a true appreciation for a Japanese fighting sword, they don’t have a great track record with weapon finesse.
Wear a costume made of breathable material. Unless you want your home to smell like a burrito factory, encourage guests to avoid sweat-provoking outfits.
Leave webs, oozing blood and magic potions at home. Unless you are into peeling sticky webbing off your couch well into 2012, ask guests to arrive in a costume that won’t shed itself all over your shag carpet.

, If you want to really get your guests excited, twist a crazy geek-inspired theme in with the holidays. Ideas to ponder include:


Favorite video game world. Do your geeky friends love to play World of Warcraft, Second Life or Battlefield Bad Company? Choose everyone’s favorite game and then decorate party central with touches from the game. For example, if you are doing Battlefield Bad Company as your theme, make the room look like an apocalyptic nightmare with remnants of Christmas cheer (like a wreath, but burn it a little beforehand so it looks like it has been to hell and back)--other people may not get it, but don’t worry, your friends will!
Fantasy movie. Obvious “go to” films include “Star Trek” and “Star Wars,” but there are numerous other cult geek classics to consider. Some of the new sci-fi zombie films and retro flicks like “War Games” or “The Last Starfighter” could be fun to re-create for your holiday party. Like with the video game, use the overall theme of the film to set the mood and tone for your party. Pull out pieces from the movie such as trying to re-create the famous cantina from “Star Wars” or the ginormous old time DOS computers used in “War Games.” Throw in a few Christmas or holiday inspired decorations and everyone is at home.
Junk food inspired. Sure everyone loves junk food, but you must tap into geek-specific junk. Geeks are enormous fans of Mountain Dew and Hot Pockets for some reason. Consider hanging empty two-liter bottles of Mountain Dew from the ceiling and have a huge food bar with your friends’ favorite junk foods--don’t forget to buy the Nerds (candy) for an added treat.

, At most parties antisocial gaming would be frowned upon, however at a geeky holiday party, it’s encouraged. In addition to the obvious Xbox 360, consider other types of games including:


Guessing the number of jelly beans or candy canes in a glass jar. Some of these geeks may guess the ACTUAL number.
Ridiculously impossible math problems. Find the toughest math book around and copy a few problems down on a piece of paper. Make numerous copies and ask guests to answer the questions. Be sure you find out the answers so you can give out prizes for correct answers.
Pin the tail on the quarterback. Most geeks are not the biggest sports fans, so turn the tables on the football heroes and pin a tale on the quarterback. Find a photo of a football player (famous or not), take it to the local copy store and have it expanded to poster size. Draw a Santa hat on the player’s head and mount to a wall. Make donkey tails out of construction paper and place double-sided tape at the top of each tail. Blindfold each guest and then send him or her in the general direction of the football player. The guest who pins the tail in the “most interesting place on the football player” gets a prize.
Helium-sucking game. Nerds love to suck the helium from balloons so turn it into a game where you award a prize for the craziest sounding voice. Decorate the room with a bunch of helium filled red and green balloons. Halfway through the party, announce that it’s time for the “helium balloon sucking game” and instruct guests to grab as many balloons as possible and start inhaling. Pick the top three weirdest voices and then have the crowd make the final decision on who is crowned “weird helium voice.” Consider offering a prize to the person who does the coolest impression of beloved film or game character in the helium voice--now that's talent!

If you must, make a priority list. Start with the stereotypes that you dislike the most, and work towards counteracting. As time goes on, work your way down the list.





;
, Don't just shop at one or two stores, go into several stores and just look. You don't necessarily have to have a shirt from every store in the mall, but don't be a brand snob. You can shop at American Eagle and still like the Target brand. You can shop at JCPenny and still go to Hollister or PacSun. Shop for clothing anywhere you see clothing you like, not what you think others will like. Clothing and fashion is first and foremost a reflection of your own personality. The most important thing is don't be afraid to try something new.

, You can have a favorite color, but that should not be the only color you wear! Don't just hate a color just because it may be associated with a certain group or clique. You can wear black without being ""emo,"" and you can wear pink without being a ""prep."" Now, there are some colors that just don't look good on certain people, so know what works for you and looks good on you before you decide to totally ban that color from your wardrobe.

, Don't copy people. If you see someone's outfit that you like, don't ask them where they got it and go copy the same exact look and wear it the next day. You can have the same clothes as others, but it's all about the style. Add your own accessories to things.

, Don't expect people not to label you if you label yourself. Don't try to fit in any kind of stereotype, for example, don't categorize your style as ""emo"", ""preppy"", ""gangsta"" or ""punk"".

, People may also stereotype you based on who you hang out with. If your friends are only skaters or only emos, you will most likely be placed into that stereotype too.

, If you call somebody ""an annoying prep"", that person will most likely call you back ""a weird emo"" or something. Be tolerant and don't judge people for how they dress or who they hang out with.

, As a teenager, your personality is still under development and you're influenced by everything around you in creating your own unique personality. Find some positive traits in every type of behavior and blend them in with your own. For example, you may appreciate the nerds' intelligence and maturity, the preps' optimism, confidence and sense of style, the emos' sensitivity and romantic nature and the punks' nonconformism and thirst for justice. If you take what's best from everything, you're on your way of becoming a well-rounded, wonderful person.

, Do not sing too much in front of people or they will think you are trying to get attention. But, sing a lot by yourself. And sing just a tiny bit in front of people. They will notice your voice is a lot like a robot without it being like beep boop bop or monotone.

, They will make fun of you.

, Speak it a lot around people. But, not too much or they will not understand you. Go simple like, ""Konichiwa,"" or ""Sayonara!"" or ""Genki?""

Take a look at yourself in a mirror, and try to imagine your someone else, a hot girl at a bar, a group of people you want to make friends with etc, and see yourself through their eyes, would they find that big ole pimple attractive?,
Anything you see that you don't like, change it.,
If you have moderate to severe acne, do what you can to minimize this, but remember that acne alone does not make you a nerd.,
General hygiene is important.,
Hairstyle is important as well.,
Clothing is important, but not as important as you might think.,
Widen your hobbies and skills.,
Speech: Don't change the way you speak, just what you say.,
DON'T STICK OUT.,
Music taste is something that people are very passionate about, usually people have 2-3 genres they enjoy the most, try to open this up to more genres, that way you can go to more places, new bars, new clubs, more opportunities to lose the nerd status.

Last but not least, if you feel like you're trying to be someone you're not, you've gone too far.",How to Lose the Nerd Status," Would those new friends really give you time to prove your cool if the first thing they see is greasy hair etc?;
, Get contacts instead of glasses, or if you want to keep glasses, pay more and get some designer ones, or more oval/rectangular, as opposed to round ones.

, Most people get or have had acne at some point, so don't get disheartened if you can't get rid of it. Your best option is to go to a dermatologist.

, Daily showers are important.

, If you can't be bothered gelling or waxing your hair, get it cut short. Look at some of the nerdy/geeky celebrities like Kevin Rose, Alex Albrecht and many others, there's still something cool about them whilst being nerdy, this is something you want to imitate and make your own.

, Stay true to yourself and what you like, but step it up. For example, if you like wearing scruffy clothes, get some ripped Calvin Klein jeans etc.

, Remember Napoleon Dynamite? ""Girls like guys with skills""? Its true. If you like computers, get into computer DJ'ing or some kind of music creation. Or if you like manga, try to learn to draw it. Just widen your skills and hobbies so you can find things to relate to other people.

, Watch your mouth around different people. You don't need to change anything at all really, it's just using common sense. At a club, your nerdy friends you're with might want to talk about the latest Graphics Card or new WoW expansion, but when you go over to a girl, she wants to talk about HER! And when that group of friends you want to get in with arrive, make your way over and keep it light, say ""hi"" and blend in, which leads me to my next point:

, This doesn't mean you have to be bland, just think twice about doing things that aren't acceptable around the people you're with.

Mix white powder with water.,
Apply the white foundation paste to your face.,
Apply the white makeup to your neck and upper chest.,
Go over your face with a large sponge.,
Apply white powder.",How to Look Like a Geisha1," Before applying your makeup, you want to get all of your hair up and out of the way. Since you will be applying makeup to your neck, including the back of your neck, it's best to put your hair up in a bun.;
, Apply wax with a brush to everywhere you will be applying the white makeup. This should be your whole face, your neck, the nape of your neck, and the chest area around your collarbones. This substance will act as base so that the white makeup you will use will stick in an opaque layer.Bintsuke-abura is the soy-based wax that many geishas use as their base. However, if you can’t get your hands on this, just buy a wax that will be safe to use cosmetically.This wax not only enables makeup to be applied smoothly and opaquely, it also helps to keep makeup out of the pores so that your skin won’t get clogged.

, Take a pot of white face powder, and mix in several drops of water. Mix the water into the powder with a small brush. Keep adding water while stirring until you achieve a paste. This is the paste that you will apply over your oil or wax base layer., Apply the paste to your face using a foundation applicator or a foundation brush. Leave about half an inch of space where your skin shows around your hairline. For the rest of your face, try to apply the white foundation in an equally-thick layer.


The strip of skin around your hairline gives the illusion of wearing a white mask.
Don’t forget to also paint your eyelids, lips and eyebrows with the white foundation.

, Take the white foundation and apply the makeup to the front of your neck. In the back at the nape of your neck, leave a W-shaped area of skin clear of makeup that leads up to the hairline. Then apply the makeup to the upper part of your chest under your collarbones.


In Japanese culture, the back of the neck is considered a very alluring area.
You may need to use several layers, as your face, chest and neck must be completely white.

, Use a large sponge and dab over all areas that have applied the paste to. This will pick up any excess moisture and leave you with a matte finish., White powder will help set the white foundation and make it less likely to come off. Use a pure white powder and a large, fluffy cosmetic brush to apply the powder. The traditional powder used by geishas is called kona oshiroi, but you can use any white powder.

Fill in your lips with red lipstick.",How to Look Like a Geisha2," Geishas cover up their eyebrows, and then redraw them. Since you have already covered your eyebrows, it’s time to draw them in. Using a steady hand, draw in the eyebrows with a black or dark brown eyebrow pencil.Make sure that the eyebrows you draw in are not too thick, and that they have a gentle arch as opposed to being straight across.
Some geishas incorporate a little red into the beginnings of their eyebrows. Do what you wish according to your preferences.

, Many geishas use red makeup for the outer corners of their eyes. Geisha apprentices, called maiko, usually use the most amount of red, and as they go through training they wear less and less. You have some liberty about what amount of red eye shadow you want to use.Some geishas draw red eye makeup in a small dot at the corner of their eye, while others draw diamond shapes, or simply layer a light layer of red without forming a specific shape.

, Use a gel liner or liquid eyeliner and apply a line of black against your top lash line. A gel or liquid eyeliner will give you the crisp, precise look that you want for your top lash line. If you wish, you can also apply eyeliner to the bottom lash line using a pencil. , Use a red lip liner to create a lower and upper lip line about a centimeter in from your actual lip line. For the upper lip, draw the line slightly lower than your actual lip line. For the lower lip, draw the line a little higher than your natural line.In traditional Japanese culture, a small, pouty mouth is considered beautiful. This is why geishas draw their mouths smaller than they actually are.

, Use a red lipstick to fill in the lips that you outlined with pencil. Traditional geisha lipstick is made from beni, extract from Japanese safflower. This extract is mixed with water and applied using a brush. However, you can use any bright-red lipstick that has a lustrous finish."

Don't worry if the rings are droopy or if you can see through them; you will correct this later.

, Take down the section of top hair that you pinned up. Make two sections out of this hair: a top and a bottom section. Back comb through your bottom section by holding it up and softly with a comb coming from the tips of the hair toward the roots. This will give your hair more volume.

, After back-combing, place a small hair sponge or donut between the two top layers of hair. Clip the sponge in place. Then make sure the sponge is fully covered by the top hair. Then tie the top hair using a hair elastic.The hair sponge or donut should give you a bump in you hair, which gives it more volume.

Pin the equipment in place with bobby pins so that the buns don’t budge.The Shimada hairstyle depends on the definition and volume of the buns. If you don’t use hair donuts, your hair will look droopy and asymmetrical, which is not the look you want to go for.

, Many times geishas, and especially maiko, will wear ornaments in their hair. These include flowers, ribbons and ornamental pins and combs. Although ornaments are not necessary, you may wish to buy or create ornaments. If you already know what color your kimono will be, try to match the ornament in some way to the color of the kimono. You may put a hairstick in the bun, but don't use a chopstick. , Many geishas use wigs as opposed to their real hair, since styling your hair can be a very labor-intensive process. If you don’t have long hair, you will have to use a wig, as the elaborate geisha hairstyles require long hair. Wigs vary in price, and also in quality. If you buy a wig, you can also add flowers, accessories or any other embellishments you want."

Some popular performers with different sounds are are X Japan, the GazettE, Dir en Grey, Mejibray, BUCK-TICK, An Cafe (although they are also often referred to as Oshare Kei, a brighter and ""happier"" style of v-kei), Alice Nine, Versailles, PaRADEiS, SuG, LM.C, Gackt, Miyavi, DecoLa Hopping, Screw, Girugämesh, and many, many more.;
, Try finding a little bunch of favorites and let yourself be inspired by their songs and style. (Tip: Visit shattered-tranquility.net for the latest news on Japanese rock, and maybe discover new artists.)

, There are really no rules for this, just try to get a hairstyle that is unique, suits you and, of course, that you feel comfortable in. Bold colours, spikes, and sectioned hair is rather often used by people that want to look like a j-rocker, but there are many artists that have their natural hair colour and a very ""normal"" haircut and have very mainstream clothing, focusing on music instead of style.

,, Just keep in mind that some hairstyles are not appropriate for some hair types, and some haircuts demand a lot of styling.

, Or just don't change your hair, if that's what you feel like. The j-rock style is, after all, about being unique, so you might look unique with you natural hairstyle/colour among other j-rockers.

, Just as with the hair, make it unique, stylish and get inspired by your idols.

,, The clothes can be hard to get, but if you are creative, you can make your grandmothers ugliest dress look like a valuable collectible from a concert. Use accessories if you think that your outfit isn't special enough. Once again, get inspired by other j-rockers and add a personal touch to it.

, Not that important, but really impressive, and also fun because this way you can understand the lyrics of your favorite songs better and maybe also make your own songs.

, This is also an option, but shows originality.

Smile and giggle frequently.",How to Look Kawaii," Dressing kawaii is a personal process, but you want to make sure you have at least one statement piece in every outfit that you create. Find your personal balance between comfort and fashion.


Graphic t-shirts and sweatshirts make great statement pieces that are comfortable. These can range from anime-inspired t-shirts with characters printed on them to sweatshirts with animal themes. For example, you might want an entire sweatshirt made into the face of a panda bear.Pick pastels. Kawaii style often offsets bold designs with soft colors. Try creating an outfit base with creams, ballet pink, lavender, light green, and baby blue.
Update classic styles with cute prints. For example, take a plain pair of cream Converse shoes and decorate them with repeating cute objects like cats or ice cream cones. If you make your own clothing adjustments, you’ll have one-of-a-kind pieces.
Add frills. The sweet baby doll look is an important part of kawaii styling.Try wearing blouses, dresses, and socks with lots of ruffles or pleats.;
, Like any style, kawaii changes all the time. Unless you live in Japan, you're not going to see a lot of kawaii around you on the streets, so looking online can help you update your kawaii wardrobe.


For example, current trends in kawaii include pleated, school-girl style skirts and chunky sweater layers in the classic kawaii pastel tones.Search words like “kawaii” and “Japanese fashion” on Tumblr to see pages of current images from the kawaii style. Follow blogs that strike your eye, and use these as inspiration for creating new outfits with clothes you already have.
Make a kawaii mood board online. Use sites like Pinterest or Polyvore to keep track of trends you like and to save your own ideal outfit combinations.

, Kawaii clothing fits well but still leaves something to the imagination. It retains a kind of playful innocence. Kawaii is all about balance.


For example, if you want to wear a short skirt, try pairing it with thigh-high socks, a long sleeve top, and chunky platform shoes.

, Layering is a key part of kawaii fashion, no matter what specific style within kawaii you want to achieve.Mix and match sweet patterns with bright colors.
Wear bright leggings or tights underneath ruffled skirts or dresses.
Pair a white long sleeve top with a colorful sleeveless dress.

, Cute, fuzzy accessories are a staple of kawaii. Also popular are brightly colored accessories and accessories adorned with 'chibi,’ meaning small, adorable depictions of manga or anime characters, often with larger-than-life heads.Keep a cute Tamagotchi stuffed animal with you all the time. Small tamagotchi can be attached to key chains or necklaces, and stuffed animals can peep out of bags. Some stuffed animals even have Velcro pads on the end of long limbs, enabling them to hang around your shoulder.

, This is a practical way to carry your stuff, and it’s another way to show off your unique style.


Use a messenger bag. You can get a plain one and decorate it with kawaii pins and patches, or try painting it with fabric paints. Messenger bags give you plenty of room to carry around your laptop, a notebook, or games.
Find a unique cross-body bag. Many purses exist to fit your personal kawaii style. For example, you can find ones with large bows, bags made to look like animals, purses shaped like clouds, and purses with lots of frills.
Try looking on auction sites like eBay or crafter sites like Etsy to find interesting, affordable bags that others won’t have.

, Having cute everyday things that match your style is a large part of kawaii fashion.


For example, if you're using a plain blue binder and yellow pencils at school, this doesn’t fit your aesthetic.
Invest in some cute stationery, bento boxes, and bags. You can always order online if things like this aren’t available where you live.
If you can’t buy them yourself, ask for kawaii gifts for your birthday and major holidays.

, Use a light-coverage foundation that looks natural.Avoid foundations that look thick or caked. Keep blush to a minimum.

, In kawaii style, you want your eyes to look round and wide.Use plenty of black mascara on both your top and bottom lashes.


If you use eyeliner, use a black liquid liner close to your lash line. Don’t bring it out into a cat eye.
Use colorful eye shadow. Keep your eye shadows colorful and light. Try a light pink, green, or blue. Avoid a smoky eye look, as this is more of a sexy style than kawaii.
Use a white or skin-toned pencil to line your waterline. This will make your eyes appear brighter and wider., In the kawaii style, lipstick should always be pink or coral, never dark. Apply lip gloss sparingly.

, You’ll want to use a clear or soft pink polish to accentuate the innocence of your look. The kawaii style doesn’t use neon or dark colors.


You should keep your nails short and rounded.

, The perfume will add just hint of some extra to your stylized but still demur kawaii look. Go for a perfume that is mild and slightly sweet or floral.


Spritz the perfume on your wrists and neck sparingly.

, The classic kawaii hairstyle is medium to long hair with thick, straight across bangs.


If you’re uncertain about cutting your bangs, try using a faux fringe hair clip.

, If you want to go all out with your kawaii look, you might dye your hair. Classic kawaii hair colors include light pink, lavender, or white-blonde.

, In kawaii style, hair accessories can help you to stand out even more.


Look for unique head bands or make some yourself. Think pom poms, hearts, stars, animal ears, and glitter.
Try wearing huge bows.
Style your hair into pigtails, and add in hair clips for more creativity.

, This will accentuate the facial look you’ve created through your kawaii hair and make up. Nothing says kawaii like an adorable giggle.


You should come across like a child who is genuinely amused about something.

There are many different types of hair accessories to help pull your outfit together.,
A less maid-like and more casual but still very lolita hair accessory is the hair bow, which can attach either by clips, a hair comb, or a headband.,
Old-fashioned hats and miniature versions of regular hats are also common styles but are harder to make at home.,
Mini-crowns and tiaras are a must for hime Loli and can also look very good with punk styles.,
Possibly the hardest hair accessory to pull off is the bonnet which can easily look too childish.,
Lolita jewelry is hard to define because almost anything can coordinate with a lolita outfit - especially old fashioned jewelry or jewelry with loli motifs.,
Some more seasonal accessories are scarves, mittens, and muffs.,
Lolita jackets can be divided into two major classes by weight.,
Some coats also have hoods, and some come with cute animal ears - especially bears and bunnies.,
Caplets are essentially small, elegant capes.,
Boleros are the cute little shrug-like sweaters that tie in the front that brands like BTSSB put out.,
Cardigans are a little more casual but they are good for keeping you warm in only slightly chilly weather and for coordinating with your skirt.,
When looking for a lolita blouse, look for something very feminine and a bit old-fashioned.,
Avoid more typically masculine features like hardware (buckles, etc.),
Cutsews are perfect for a more casual loli style (though many cutsews can be worn even for formal lolita style).,
Bags and Purses are one of the last things people think about when coordinating a lolita outfit, but they really do bring an outfit together.,
Lolita purses are very adorable, sometimes they are shaped like hearts or outer lolita motifs, other times they are shaped like everyday purses but trimmed with bows and lace.,Bags or totes are typically bigger and floppier, but they are still cute and elegant - they are made of nice fabrics, sometimes patterned, and will often have a lolita print on them such as a scene from Alice in Wonderland.,
Parasols can easily be distinguished as very lolita by their frills and old-fashioned appearance.,
Skirts are the cornerstone of lolita clothing.,
One-pieces are dresses that can be worn by themselves or sometimes with a blouse underneath.,
Like one-pieces but without the sleeves, jumper skirts are made to be worn over a blouse but can be worn on their own in warm enough weather.,
Waloli outfits are inspired by Japanese clothing.,
First of all, the skirt needs to match the print of the fabric, second the shirt or dress must be cut appropriately to accommodate a large skirt underneath.,
Aprons aren't just for Alice in Wonderland costumes or french maids anymore, but they still have a bit of a comical.,
There are two main types of lolita aprons, those that cover your entire front and those that only cover the skirt.,
What gives the lolita skirt it's telltale poof is typically a petticoat, a bell-shaped but lightweight fluffy skirt-like garment you can wear under any skirt or dress.,
Lolita stockings aren't exactly underthings, but they're going in this category anyway.,
Stockings can be worn two different ways.,
The basic lolita shoe is the Mary Jane.,Boots are sometimes harder to fit into lolita style (with the exception of punk), but several of the major brands have come out with very cute boots.,It is also possible to work in cute sandals with your summer lolita attire.,Traditional Japanese wooden shoes or Chinese slipper shoes work for waloli or qiloli, respectively.,For punk lolita, there are a lot more options (including clunky boots and even converse) as long as the rest of your outfit is very lolita.",How to Dress With the Proper Items for Lolita," The most obvious is the headdress, which is either a round or rectangular piece that is decorated with lace and bows that ties around your head with a ribbon.;
,

If you don't want such a large bow you can also opt for mini bow-clips.

, Top hats and mini-tophats are often found with punk and boy style, but some of the more feminine hats are suitable for any style., Mini-straw hats go perfectly with country style and are usually decorated with ribbons as well as small fruits such as cherries or strawberries., Look for a bonnet without an overly wide or floppy brim and never tuck your hair fully underneath. Some less common but still elegant hair accessories include berets, caps, rose clips, hairbands, and cute earmuffs., Lockets, cameos, pearls , and loli-esque charms (keys, bows, hearts, cakes) fit very well. Chokers are good for gothic, punk, and ero-loli styles. Ties can fit with almost any style, but not just any old tie will do. #Lolita ties tend to be shorter and fatter, often coordinating with a skirt and decorated with lace or even appliques. Neck corsets are fit with these styles, but these can look awkward if they are too big or your neck isn't long enough. You can also have matching wrist corsets or the more lolita wrists cuffs, which are like stocking toppers but are worn on your wrist. #Gloves can be worn as well, but make sure they suit the outfit. Long gloves tend to fit best with aristo or classical styles, while short gloves are sweeter in nature and suit himeloli especially well. The key to coordinating these accessories is to keep them elegant, feminine, and not-cheap-looking., Scarves, mittens, and muffs should be cute, elegant, and coordinate well with your outfit both otherwise nothing short of bunny scarves are very lolita-specific. Look for ones that match well with your winter coat., #* Light jackets are worn to coordinate with a skirt and can be worn during any season so long as you don't feel too warm. They are similar to suit jackets but they have more feminine collars and rounded edges. Some even have puffed sleeves, but the key is the softer shape and the frilly trim.

Heavier coats are for winter, obviously. Like old-fashioned coats, they are designed to fit voluminous skirts underneath, so they flare a bit at the bottom making them look a bit like dresses themselves. They are much longer and more fitted than a lot of modern coats (no short puffy jackets). A number of these coats also have attached caplets (as seen in the example), which can either be made out of the same wool as the coat or be lined with fur. You can sometimes remove the fur collars from coats if you want a less fluffy look.

, These can be very expensive so find one that goes with everything., Those that are are made of cotton and only cover your shoulders aren't very good for keeping you warm, but they are still somewhat seasonal because they should be worn over a long sleeved blouse. Caplets like this aren't really meant to be functional and simply coordinate with your skirt or dress. Longer caplets (which could probably be called capes at this point) made of wool or velvet are better for keeping warm in the winter months and look especially cute with muffs. Winter caplets can come with hoods much like those of the lolita coats., Often they are knitted, but they can be made of any fabric. But they always look very delicate with little ruffles or puffed sleeves - they don't keep you very warm but they can keep out a Spring chill., A lot of cute cardigans will go with your lolita clothes, but those that are strictly lolita have a very feminine cut that's not too fitted and are typically trimmed with ruffles or a bow. Some may have a lolita print or applique such as a crown., It's not just lace and ruffles that make a blouse lolita - it's also the shape. Pointed collars can work, but a rounded or high collar are more fitting. The same applies to sleeves - straight sleeves can work, but puffed sleeves or sleeves that are gathered at the end are preferable. It should be tailored for the female shape but not overly tight. #* The fabric should be crisp (not the wrinkly stuff) and should never be see-though. Overall it should look a bit formal and elegant while still being very soft and girly., and large pockets., What makes something a cutsew is they are typically make out of knit fabrics so they can simply be cut and sewn, without all the tailoring needed for blouses or other cotton clothing. They aren't simply t-shirts (though a few of the brands have put out very loli baby tee with cute prints), they are trimmed just like a blouse or a cardigan with ruffles, lace, or puffed sleeves. They can have collars or have a t-shirt-like neckline, occasionally trimmed with criss-criss straps that tie around your neck. They are a more comfy alternative to blouses or heavy jackets., There's tons of purses out there that perfectly match a single outfit down the the lace, bows, and the little bunny applique, but all that really required is something pretty and elegant that goes with your general color scheme., They are made of good material, they aren't floppy and they shouldn't show signs of wear.,, They are not simply umbrellas with lace sewn on - they are far more delicate and usually more attractive. Children's umbrellas can sometimes work but look for one with a curved or otherwise elegant handle that extends rather than pops out (umbrellas that fold back in on themselves don't usually work). Asian style parasols are typically only suitable for waloli and should not be used with other styles., Their bell shape provides the typical lolita silhouette, and their length (for anything but ero) is typically around 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the knee. They should sit at your natural waist (not where you wear your low-rise jeans but right around your belly-button). Trimmed with the typical lolita arsenal - lace, ruffles, ribbons, bows, appliques - it's not hard to figure out what skirts are lolita and which aren't.

Not all lolita skirts are bell shaped, but those are hard to pull off right. Beginners should stick with this general rule. Some skirts are tiered, some have scalloped edges, and some have cutouts to display an underskirt - there are too many possibilities for skirts, one-pieces.

, The bodices have a lot in common with cutsews - they can have puffed sleeves or cross-ties or lace trim. The skirts resemble typical lolita skirts, though they may be elongated if the dress has an empire-waist. Again, too many possibilities., Plenty of examples to choose from., They aren't simply kimonos that are cut off with a poofy skirt underneath - care is taken to trim the kimono like any other lolita piece or the obi might be made into a cute bow. Sometimes all that is needed is to make something waloli is a Japanese print fabric on a dress. Qilolita, inspired by Chinese clothing, is equally more elegant than just a qipao over a floofy skirt., These are not very common styles and they are often done wrong, so it may be better to find your footing in the usual lolita styles before attempting waloli or qiloli., Only wear them during appropriate situations, such as while cooking.

If you feel confident, you can pull it off without it looking like a costume.

, The full aprons can sometimes have shapes at the bodice such as hearts, bunnies, or gloomy bears, and both they and the short aprons are trimmed like any other lolita pieces., Do not use a square dance petticoat. Go for a high-quality petticoat with enough fluff that won't show through your skirt. Short bloomers can help give a skirt some poof and are also good if you plan to run around in your lolita clothes so people won't be getting any panty shots., Stockings should be *knee-highs* or full on tights unless you're going for ero loli. Thigh-high stockings won't fit under a knee-length skirt (unless you're trying to give the appearance that they're full tights which is fine) and short little socks look like sissy style (something you probably don't want to be associated with)., One is simply the stockings themselves- these stockings generally have cute patterns or decorations (such as ribbons lacing up them) that make them lolita on their own. Sometimes you can find striped stockings - not the gaudy goth-style of hot topic stockings, but knee-high ones made with knit material that are elegant in their own way. These look best when worn in pastel shades rather than black and white. But often they are worn with stocking toppers - just a bit of lace and ribbon that goes at the top of the stocking to match the frill of the rest of your outfit. Sometimes they are attached to the stockings but they can come separately with elastic inside so they can be worn over any stocking., These can be trickier to find for adults but look for one in which the strap goes over the top of your foot nearer to you shin than to your toes. Flat, platformed, and high heeled mary janes are all good choices, but avoid Mary Jane-Esquire shoes excessively high heels and a strap around the ankle (commonly referred to as stripper or drag queen heels). Ballerina flats (like mary janes but without the strap) tend to look slightly less youthful and coordinate better if decorated with bows or lacing. There are also tea party shoes, which are lolita flats that have straps, mostly used for sweet lolita but not limited to. These are usually decorated with bows, pearls and multiple straps.

Another common lolita shoe is the rocking-horse shoe, originally designed by Vivienne Westwood but now you can find several brands that carry them.

Take some different cans of paint and splash it on the walls to give it a one-of-a-kind look. Try to get it to have the same as your favorite colors.;
, Alright so, as cool and bright as scene rooms look, you can't just throw a bunch of multi-colored stuff into a room. You can mix-and-match, just don't over-do it. But if you do, it's best to have a plain white room. Also, don't add TOO much stuff or it'll become too crowded to walk around. Be creative, but also know some limits. You can't have an all black colored room and suddenly a yellow chair pops in. But do remember to have fun and try not to cause yourself a load of debt.

, Tape or hang up a bunch of your favorite things on your walls, mirrors, desks, anywhere that'll look cute. But make sure they're not so...disturbing to some people. Put up things that are kind of tacky, if you're an artist, put up a painting. Print out pictures from the internet and put them on your walls. Photographer? Hang up those pics. Go to the Goodwill or thrift store and they always have a spot filled with old 25 cent records. Pick out some cool ones and you can put those on your wall too. Get a subscription to a magazine you are interested in, like Rolling Stone or AP (or just look through old magazines), and cut out interesting things to put on your wall. And ALWAYS have at LEAST ONE poster of your favorite band!

, Every bedroom needs one, so why shouldn't it be allowed to be scene too? For bedspread (blankets, sheets, etc.), try some cute comforters with bold colors or patters, or anything with cartoons. Plush toys, teddy bears, or pillows of characters such as Hello Kitty, Domo, or Spongebob look perfect, so place a few of those on your bed. If it looks like a 5 year old uses your bed, you're heading in the right direction.

, Have a place in your room where you can keep all of your CDs, your iPod, iPod dock, radio, and stereo. Look at this article for examples of scene music, in case you don't already know.

, You may be trying to make your room look scene, but you want to make your room cozy, too. Throw a few beanbag chairs or comfy and cute pillows on the floor for chilling with friends or listening to music. Little details such as a fun lamp, a fluffy carpet, or bold curtains make your room both cozy and scene. Don't forget to throw together at least one extra epic cartoon plushy/pillow, it will make your room look extremely special, especially if the rest is not as 'cartoon-y' as you wanted it to be.

, It’s not usually considered scene when your room is squeaky clean, however your bedroom should never be dirty or too messy.

Create a good scene name.,
Find a nice background, such as neon tapes, records, Converse, Hello Kitty, diamonds, or anything bright and amazing.,
Start with the About Me section.,
Go ahead and fill out all the sections, such as Music, Movies, Who I Want To Meet, Books, but don't overflow them with information.

,
Learn HTML/CSS, and you can do cooler things like putting the list of bands you like in a scroll box to take up less space.

,
Add other scene kids, and start talking to them.,
If you can, get professional photos taken but if not, that's definitely okay.

,
You may want to buy a tripod so you don't have to hold the camera yourself while you take pictures.,
You can use props like glow sticks, candy, and stuffed animals.,
Be yourself, and be different.

",How to Make a Great Scene MySpace Page," Take inspiration from scene kids such as Kiki Kannibal, Dakota Rose, Blair Ravish, or Matthew Lush. Your name needs to be unique and catchy. But, don't make a name like Kiki Chaos or Blair Brootal. Be unique; those names are so unoriginal. If you can't think of anything you could even try using your first name with your middle name.;
, Leave the rest of your page white. Get a cursor like Hello Kitty or Gloomy Bear.

, Write down some basic facts about you. Give information but not your whole life story. No one wants to spend twenty minutes reading your About Me.

,,, But, be cool about it. Don't post a thousand bulletins a day or you'll annoy them.

,, This also opens up a whole lot more options.

, Actually, you can use pretty much anything as a prop--soda, coffee, Starbucks, energy drinks, pets, flowers, etc.

Decide what form of scene you want to be.,
Personality.,
Clothes.,
Bottom.,
Shoes.,
Accessories.,
Hair.,
Makeup.,
Music.",How to Look Like a Scene Girl (Preteens)," You can be practically anything such as wild, shy, sweet, rebellious, funny, punky, unique, etc. Pick one or two that fit you as you are now. You can even go with a unique form of scene.;
, Get into the scene vibe before it takes over your look. You can be very random if you'd like. Make sure everyone hears every word you say. Scene chicks are very confident with themselves, so embrace your flaws and know that you're pretty! Don't care what others think about you, just be you and be outgoing. Be original--that's what scene's all about.

, Start finding some clothes that look scene-ish. For the top, cartoon tees are really popular among scenes. Band Tees are also a big hit. Shirts that say random sayings are really popular too. At this age, you have an advantage because you can most likely fit into both girls' sizes and juniors'/women' sizes. Hot Topic is the main place you'd find sweet clothes, but if you still fit into kids' sizes, try Justice. Don't go to any preppy stores like Abercrombie, Hollister, or Gap.You can also check out thrift stores where you can get amazing bargains. Grab a few hoodies--some plain ones and/or patterned ones look cool. You could also try Four Leaf Clothing, Darkside Clothing, Blue Banana, and more.

, Skinny jeans are a must! Black and denim are usually the ones available in kids' sizes, but if you're really tall, Hot Topic, Vans, and some more places have awesome colored and patterned skinny jeans that are so scene. You can also wear skirts and colorful tutus. Make sure the skirts don't go below your knees and wear leggings. It's never a bad time. Wear your tutu to the grocery store.

, Some really scene-like shoes are Converse, Vans, and ballet flats in ""happy"" colors. These include hot pink, neon green, orange, yellow, turquoise, and deep purple. To make your Converse look neat, use some awesome laces. Steer clear of flip-flops, unless you're at the beach or pool. You can grab a white pair of converse and paint a totally random pattern on it yourself for a more unique look.

, Remember those colorful necklaces you wore when you played dress-up as a kid? Remember the corny bracelets with the random colors and chunky beads? Rather than throw them away, you could recycle them. Wear them with your new scene attitude. Wear bracelets galore, this means bracelets up and down your arms, and try some cool belts over your shirts. Earrings aren't a big issue, so you can get by with some cool studs.

, Most people say scene hair must be long. That's an over statement. You may want the look everyone else has, but short hair is always cute and funky too. Just get really choppy layers, and bangs. Usually, your parents don't mind if you have short or long hair. Stand out.


For hair accessories, try clip-in extensions (they aren't permanent). Most parents, at this age, will probably not let you dye your hair. Some days, you can put little plastic bows in your hair or tie some ribbons in it. Think silly, cute, and colorful. If your parents won't let you dye your hair, talk to them about Kool-aiding it. Kool-aid lasts for 4-7 days, depending on how long or how many times you shower, and it does not damage your hair at all.

, Your parents or school may not like the popular, wild scene makeup most scenes wear. Tone down some of it and it should do. That means dust on some eyeshadow in bold colors like purple, green, yellow, pink, or blue. Try a little bit of eyeliner, but only on the top lid. Make it winged a bit going toward your forehead. Just a bit of light pink or clear lip gloss will look nice too.

, To be Scene, you have to love the music! Some big music examples are: Blood On The Dance Floor, Brokencyde, Millionaires, I Set My Friends on Fire, Owl City, and Breathe Carolina are just some good examples of scene music. Try looking up bands like the ones listed. If your parents look for the ""explicit"" label, try buying the clean versions of those songs.

, Separate all the clothes you can't wear, the clothes you don't want but can wear, and the clothes you can wear. Give away or recycle clothing you can't wear and box up and store the clothes you don't want but still can wear, just in case you change your mind. If you really don't want those old clothes than give them away or recycle them too.

, Try a style such as parting your hair in a horizontal line and put low pigtails on the lower half and making the top half in a bob-like style. An example of this type style is when Wenwen Han first appeared in the movie Karate Kid.

Find a store that sells Visual Kei clothing.,
Dark clothing is always in fashion!,
Plaid, stripes, lace, webbed patterns and skull motifs are very popular.,
Wear your clothes loose enough to move around comfortably in.,
Don't be afraid to mix and match different styles!,
Your clothes might be the outfit, but it's definitely your accessories that make it.,
Any shoes that aren't too casual or pretty will go with your outfit!,
Dyed hair is always great!,
Makeup isn't necessary but it's still one of the biggest parts of the style.,
It's very rare to see a Visual Kei musician without any piercings.,
This is the most important thing to remember.,
It doesn't matter what people think of you.,
Have fun!",How to Dress Visual Kei," There are plenty of online stores that sell Visual clothing - but beware of bad quality clothes, check the store reviews first! If there's one near you, you might be able to find great accessories in Hot Topic or another ""alternative"" shop like it.;
, Lots of Visual Kei stars dress in neons and loud colours and patterns, so don't feel that you can never wear bright colours again (quite the opposite!) but a monochrome outfit, or an outfit mostly made of black pieces with a splash of a bright colour like red, blue or orange as an accent nearly always looks stylish and pulled together.

, But Visual Kei is a very anything-goes fashion so long as it keeps to the 'cool punk' feel of the look. Plaid skirts or plaid patches on tops are very cute for girly Visual Kei wearers! Stripy tops, either horizontal or vertical, are stylish and versatile for any look, so it's always worth having one. Lace is more often connected with the Lolita subculture, but it can add some really interesting texture to a Visual-kei outfit, so long as it isn't cheap and scratchy. Cobweb fabrics are also very cool - it's dark, spooky and reminiscent of the very sought-after brand Alice Auaa's signature cobweb material. You don't have to limit yourself to just these, either - as well as skulls, crowns and crosses, anything with a spooky, grotesque, or OTT adorable look to it, depending on your outfit, will work really well.

, Although skinny jeans never go out of style in Visual Kei, make sure you have enough freedom of movement to dance! Your top or T-shirt shouldn't be tight either, especially if your trousers are tight too; the up-and-down fitted look isn't really a part of the fashion. Don't make it so baggy that it looks like it doesn't fit you unless it's actually meant to look that way, though.

, Visual Kei borrows hugely from all kinds of other fashions like western Goth and Punk, Lolita and historical fashion, so if you have the basics of both styles down and you're confident about making it look good, go for it. How about, for instance, mixing a poofy knee-length plaid skirt with a distressed tank top, platform heels and spiky hair for a great Visual Kei Lolita look?

, Necklaces, bracelets, studs, chains and belts are all musts for any outfit - even if you're going for a simple look, don't skimp on at least a punky belt and a few rings to pull it all together.

, Creepers, platform boots, Doc Martens, winklepickers and engineer boots are all popular choices. For an extra bit of flair, how about wrapping a few chain bracelets around the ankles of your boots?

, If your hair is already a nice colour naturally, or has a great style then it doesn't really need it, but dyeing your hair is fun and makes it that much easier to make your style more polished-looking. Any crazy colour will go down a storm, but it doesn't need to be unnatural; silver, ash blond, dark brown and black are all seen just as much as bright pink or blue. But if you really can't decide on a single colour, how about a split a la Waka from Danger Gang?

, Especially if you're after a more modern or, for females, androgynous look then you can give it a miss or just go for simple concealer, matte powder and eyeliner - but it's always cool to at least know how to dress it up for special occasions. Look for makeup tutorials and collect lots of pictures of Visual Kei musicians to see how they do it!

, Nose and septum piercings, lip piercings and tongue piercings are all cool, as are any kind of ear piercings. If you don't want to get something permanent done, your work won't let you, or you're too young but you'd still like to have some metalwork, try buying some fake piercings. They're cheap and easily available on sites like eBay.

, No matter what you're aiming for, Visual Kei is always very carefully coordinated and pulled together. It has to look completely polished and intentional even when it's all ripped up and distressed - that's what separates it from other styles like emo, scene, punk or western goth. If your coordination skills aren't great, just start simple with a few outfits made of items like kilts, skinny jeans, printed tops and cardigans or blazers and a few accessories. Build it up slowly until you feel more confident about complicated outfits. If you don't feel like you can spend hours every day on your hair and makeup, get a low-maintenance, good-looking hair style like a thick mohawk, short hime cut or an undercut that can be drawn up into a teased ponytail, and keep up a good skin routine.

, If you're going into a dangerous area it probably isn't sensible to dress up and draw attention to yourself, but otherwise, try learning to ignore any stares or comments. You look damn cool, so believe it!

, Visual Kei is often a bit self-mocking, especially when it's especially gloomy or angsty, so don't feel like you have to be extremely serious about it.

Perfect your look.,
Get a good camera, something that's not too large like a Samsung NV.,
Get the angle right.,
Try different poses and such.,
Get good items to put in the picture.,
Have good lighting.,
Upload the photos to your computer and start examining.,
Use a photo editing program such as Photoshop, Paint, or Gimp.,
Upload the pictures to Myspace, Facebook, Buzznet, and any other website.",How to Take Good Scene Pictures," You may not have to be completely perfectly scene all the time, but when you take pictures, it's a big deal. Get your scene makeup, clothes, etc. ready. Try to choose colours that bring out your best features, e.g. for green eyes, a coppery brown eyeshadow looks amazing. Add extra eyeliner, brighter eyeshadow, rat your hair some more. Make it obvious.;
, They are a lot easier to handle than a big digital camera, but still take high quality pictures. A digital camera is good, because you can upload them to your computer. An iPhone or anything like that is great because the Internet option means that you can send them to your website or profile instantly. You'll also need a tripod for your camera or something to lean your phone on.

, It just takes practice. It really does. Get a tripod to set your camera on. Then take the picture. Learn what looks good and stick to it. You could even try finding a bright colored wall or duct tape a bright colored piece of fabric to a wall and pose in front of it. The most interesting photos are taken at unusual angles. Try looking up or down at the object.

, Blow kisses, text message, tousle your hair, dance, blow bubble gum, whatever makes you a scene queen.If all else fails, throw on your huge sunglasses and have a friend take a pic from above while you're facing into a blowing wind or fan. They usually turn out well.

, Cupcakes, juice boxes, pop cans, stuffed animals such as Gir, turtles, random animals or anything random. If it's food, put it up to your mouth as if you were eating it. If it's a drink, use a straw and put your mouth on the straw. If it's a stuffed animal, hug or kiss it.

, Find a place with good lighting, and take your pictures there. A bright light is good, but the outdoors can be better and more natural looking.

, Find any things you don't like. Take note so you know what do right next time. Try to collaborate different poses into one new one, or try a different location with a different pose. Delete any embarrassing shots - having them leaked after giving a funny copy to a friend is not cool.

, It's nice for erasing a random zit or taming frizzy hair. Never use it to make yourself look thinner or something because people will figure it out.

, You can make a folder for your photos, or just place them randomly in any folder.

First, you have to pay attention to yourself and not others.,
Now you need to look at your current clothes and decide what style they are.,
If you don't have any of those types of clothes, or any clothes that could be the style you're going for, maybe you should take an article of clothing and adding maybe one piece of fabric to make it what you want it to be.,
It's time to do the age old thing that everyone does once in a while, if not everyday; shopping.,
Shop for bright colors, but at the same time, keep an eye out for those browns, blacks, and whites, as they go great with a colorful shirt.,

Shoes can be anything, as long they compliment your feelings that day.,
Attitude and witty comebacks?",How to Look Like a Scene Teen," Sure, there's that girl named Trinity that calls herself scene, but then, there's that person inside of you that knows that deep down, you got an eye for style.;
, Make piles or bins for different styles, like girly, goth, sporty, geeky, etc. Decide if you're going to throw some things away. If you already have 'scene' clothes, you need to know what kind they are.


Are they:
Trendy Scene?
Insider Scene? (Popular Scene)
Musical Scene
Hippie Scene?
Or Dark Scene?

, Like taking a black jacket and adding lime green and tangerine orange fringe on the cuffs. You have to be creative!

, Whether you're shopping at Salvation Army or Punk United Nacelle, it's considered shopping. Hot Topic has sweet tees, but they're expensive. So, if you frown at Hot Topic, Rue 21 is know for great bargains, and their shirts are only 10 dollars.

, Amongst girls, tank-tops are really popular, especially when layered with other tank-tops or paired with a tee shirt over it and a pair of colored skinny jeans. But with boys, stay away from any layering of shirts unless it's a long sleeve and a short sleeve. Baggy jeans are always great for hippie scene, boys and girls, but if you wanna be either insider or trendy Scene, stick with the skinny jeans. And, it's not worth it if you spend 200 bucks, use your clothes for a month, then throw the mall away and chase a new trend. If you want to do this temporarily, spend about 30 dollars so if you throw it away, it's not that big of a loss.

, The best thing to do is get short choppy layers, and lots of them! Without layers, you can't do any big hair. Also get either a fringe covering one eye or bangs. Fringes are the more ideal choice. For boys, don't tease, but spike up. Girls, grab your teasing comb and freezing blast hairspray, and tease up!

, Dye your hair all the colors of the rainbow! Bleach it, spike it, then chop it! Do what you feel like doing! That's what this style is all about. Don't you get it?

, Always make sure your skin is flawless, and blemish-free. Your eyes should always be the main feature. A good start is using just plain black eyeliner. Then you can start playing around with liquid black eyeliner and eye shadows. You can draw some swirls, stars, hearts, peace signs or anything around your eyes in neon eyeliner. Keep it to a minimum with the drawings; with swirls, you should go crazy. Buff up your cheeks with a little peach blush and keep the lips neutral. If you wanted to, you could put on a little chapstick, or a shade very close to your natural lip color.

, Pastry sneakers will look great if you think they will. Platform boots, high heels, flats, sneakers, anything as long as you keep flip-flops for the beach and the pool. Don't limit yourself to one thing just because everyone is doing that, too. Remember, individuality.

, Check. Cool, bright clothes and makeup? Check. Any stinking' shoe you want? Check. Sweet hair and a nice scent? Check and check. Well, look at that. You're a scene teen!

Have a role model/fashion idol.",How to Have a Unique Indie/Scene Style (for Girls)," Long, choppy layers look really nice and so do short styles. It just depends on what looks best with your face shape. Indie is all about being ""independent"" so always do what you feel most comfortable with and don't try to be someone else. If you want a wild color like purple that's fine but if you don't want to dye your hair that's fine too.;
, everyone needs them unless you're extremely indie and happen to be a nudist. Thrift stores, best friends and concerts are where the goods are. Walmart and Target, are great too for basics. Now everyone always says stay away from Hollister, American Eagle etc. because those brands aren't ""indie"" but honestly if you see something you like at one of these stores then go for it...you can always add a personal touch to clothes. Depending on your body type, choose your jeans. Skinny jeans have become very popular and that's okay, a lot of people feel confident in them. If you prefer skirts or even dress pants then those look really good too. A good thing to keep in mind with all of your clothes is that you should REALLY love them, because you shouldn't be changing your wardrobe all the time, just enhancing it! So feel free to express yourself and add personal touches to everything you wear. Tie dye, beads, sharpies, pins and patches are good things for enhancing your clothes. If you want to be truly indie, don't go out and spend a ton of money on more clothes. Try working with what you have first and deciding on the kind of effect you want your style to have and keep in mind..some looks are better for certain situations, whereas they can not be so great in others.


P.S. Goodwill is a great place to find all sort of different styles of clothes and they have really good prices.

, Experiment with different looks and be daring. If you really don't like the outcome you can always wash it off.

,,, That's the most important thing. No one likes a poser., Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn are very popular, some others include Raquel Reed, Audrey Kitching, Twiggy, Hanna Beth, Hayley Williams, and Vanna Venom."

Make a lot of friends.,
Be charismatic.,
Be likable.,
Stay consistent.,
Get noticed.",How to Be a Trendsetter1," It will be easier to set trends if you have many friends who are popular and well-liked in their own right. This gives you more social capital and influence on the rest of your peer group.


Trends are a powerful demonstration of how social influence motivates people. In general, people follow trends out of a desire to fit in.Trends are typically started by the rich and the famous because on some level people think looking more like them will give them some of that prestige.
Don't make friends with popular people just to be a trendsetter. Make sure your friendships are genuine.;
, If you are confident and fun to be around, people will want to be more like you. Be conscious of how you present yourself, and try to be as likeable as possible.



Maintaining good posture is often overlooked when thinking about charisma. Always try to keep your back and neck straight.
Avoid being overly serious. This doesn't mean you have to be the class clown, but more laidback people tend to be more universally liked.

, Being kind and compassionate will go a long way. Express genuine interest in other people by paying them thoughtful complements. Ask them about their lives and interests. Doing these things will make others feel good about themselves and they will attribute these good feelings to your presence.


Once you're known as a likeable person, others will want to be more like you. Without even noticing it, they may adopt some of your style, preferences, and habits. In other words, they will follow the trends that you set.

, This may seem counterproductive if you're trying to be stylish. While you may want to shake things up when it comes to your appearance, your personality shouldn't also change drastically. Don't be consistent in how you dress, but be consistent in how you act.


In general, popular people are known to be reliable. People like to know where they stand with a person and are put off when someone is completely unpredictable.If you try to be a chameleon and change who you are depending on who you're with in a bid to make everyone like you, people will catch on. You may develop a reputation as being inauthentic, causing your popularity to plummet. Instead, be your best true self wherever you go.

, You won't be able to set a trend if other people don't see and follow it. Start by trying to be more ""seen."" Make people notice you and cultivate a presence. Talk louder if necessary, make jokes, and learn how to be the center of attention.


If you want to start fashion trends, try to dress well in general. Your peers will start to think of you as a person who knows style and will be more likely to attribute an unusual look to a new trend rather than a fashion faux pas.
While positive attention is great, don't be too loud or obnoxious. People who try to be cool rarely are. Make your outgoing persona seem effortless. If you have trouble being extroverted without it seeming forced, focus more on other methods of securing popularity.

Keep current with pop culture.,
Track trends on social media.,
Travel to hip locations where trends tend to start.,
Understand the fashion cycle.,
Know when a trend is over.",How to Be a Trendsetter2," Global trendsetters tend to be musicians, actors, and other celebrities. They often bring existing subcultural trends to the mainstream or kick start crazes based simply on their personal tastes. Regardless, they tend to be a good barometer when you're trying to spot a trend. Pay close attention to what they wear.


If you see a celebrity sporting a unique look that you love, borrow it. Don't copy the outfit exactly, but take inspiration from it.
Fashion trends can be fabric types, color palettes, and specific garments. When planning a similar outfit, use one or two of these aspects instead of all three. That way, you may start a trend in your peer group without being accused of simply being a copycat.
Fashion magazines are also a great way to research what's on-trend., Social media has become an extremely important tool for trendsetters as a way to both track and disseminate information. Follow users who are popular and are in line with your own sensibilities. Check out the ""trending"" sections of popular websites. Create a personal feed for yourself using an aggregator to help keep track of what's trending in your personal area of interest.Some experts are now using high tech computer algorithms to create and even predict style trends. If you're technologically inclined, consider researching and possibly using these methods yourself., If you can afford to travel, try going to cities known for fashion like Paris, New York, and Shanghai. If you live in a rural or suburban area, visit the nearest urban center to get an idea of what's trending. If you already live in a fashion-forward city, go to restaurants, shops, clubs, and neighborhoods that you know to be trendy.


Check out what other people are wearing to guess at what may be the next trend to hit the mainstream. If you notice multiple people sporting a style you haven't seen before, it's probably the sign of a new trend., Remember that looks come back in style over the years. Don't get rid of any quality clothing or accessories just because a trend has passed. Instead, save these items for when that look is back in vogue. That way, you'll have a partial wardrobe ready to go for next time., Spotting when a trend is waning is just as important to a trendsetter as tracking its start. In order to stay on-trend, you will need to recognize when a trend begins to end before anyone else does. From there, jump ship to the next potential big thing as soon as possible.An easy way to tell when a trend has gone stale is how ubiquitous it becomes. If you start to see a style that was once quirky and unique become mass-marketed, it's safe to say it's no longer trendy."
"
Be yourself.,
Do the opposite of what's in style.,
Wear an item of clothing frequently if you want it to catch on.,
Take time to be creative.,
Use your own social media influence.",How to Be a Trendsetter3," Once you've established yourself as a popular, fashion-conscious person, you may find yourself starting trends without realizing it. Just wear whatever you want and think looks nice. Your peers are likely to adopt aspects of your personal style to be more like you. If enough people follow suit, a new trend is born., One popular strategy among fashionistas is to be a contrarian. Look at whatever trends are hot in the mainstream and craft a look around something completely different. More people will notice your look and are more likely to think of you as a trendsetter instead of a follower.For example, if everyone is wearing baggy pants, try wearing skinny jeans. Or, if you notice many of your classmates with the same short pixie haircut, consider getting long hair extensions.
Don't go too overboard. If dark colors and long pants seem on trend, don't start wearing bright yellow shorts in the middle of winter.

, Make sure to maximize visibility for whatever look you want to trend. If it's something simple and not too flashy, such as a dark pair of pants, you can wear it up to once a week. However, if it's more memorable, such as a bright patterned blouse, make sure to bring it out only about once every two weeks.Consider getting multiple versions of your item of choice that look different enough that people won't think you're constantly wearing the same thing. For example, if you want a certain style of shoe to catch on, buy pairs in multiple colors. That way, you can encourage the trend every day.

, Setting trends is a creative process. You will need quiet time to take in and process all of the information you absorb in a day.Getting too caught up in forcing yourself to come up with the next big thing may actually stifle your ability to do so.

, If you have a sizable following or friends list online, you can start trends without leaving your house. Start posting about or reblogging things related to whatever trend you want to start. Mention how much you and your friends love the potential trend. Think of it as a method of marketing where the product you're selling is something's popularity.


Be sure to also keep posting your usual content to avoid losing followers.

Play it safe.,
Develop a great personality.,
Get a bag.,
Be a scene queen.",How to Get Back to School in Scene Clothes," Chances are if the kids aren't blessed with knowledge of stereotypes and the scene, they'll mistake you for emo, goth, or have no idea what you're trying to pull off.;
, Jeans. Skinny jeans are an absolute must among the scene crowd. You can do plain jeans, bright neon colors or animal print.

, Even a unique pair of shoes from Hot Topic can qualify within the scene wardrobe.

,, Hoodies are also good for putting over a graphic tee. Start out with something in a basic color, like black, which can match with everything you wear. You can also try a jacket in neon, zebra, or cheetah print.

, A good belt whether it is studded or just something with a cool design on it doesn't matter. Get some bobby pins and barrettes as they seem to be the cheapest. Having one good bow or one good headband is necessary, but only choose one to start. get as many rubber bracelets as you can, as these tend to be pretty cheap. Have one or two necklaces with guns, brass knuckles, peace signs, diamonds, skulls or cupcakes. A cute chunky ring is nice too. Hello Kitty is very scene also. Claires, despite its girly reputation, has very nice scene accessories.


Shop smart. You don't always need to go to big brand stores. Try small, second hand stores, like Value Village, Plato's closet, And Ross. They have cute things, you just have to dig.

, You can always get your hair done at the salon with choppy layers and crazy colors and all, but maybe tone it down a bit. Get your hair dyed one simple color and get a fringe. Blonde, brown, black or red are always a good start. Buy some colored extensions or just get some simple streaks. As for makeup, have good black liquid eyeliner. it is good to have an angled brush for this, instead of using the wand thing that comes with it. Black eye shadow and a two neon colors. Also have white. Have a foundation that matches your skin tone and some blush that highlights your cheeks a bit. Bright lipstick is good and totally original, as not many scene kids wear makeup on their lips. Mascara, too.

, Or if you're school is strict about amount of makeup you could only use black eyeliner and mascara, some scene girls wear coloured eyeliner over black eyeliner (For ideas see Bebo scene queen CarylCatastrophe)

, Most scenes have a very lively personality. Just be random and have fun!

, Whether it is a tote bag or a backpack, make sure it is cute and original. You can take sharpies and draw on it, have your friends sign it, and even add a few buttons and safety pins to it for that unique look.

, If you want a scene style more like the scene queens, I'd suggest staying away from the unmatching shoes, tutus, and graphic tees. Try to coordinate your outfits and get unique tops, that don't have as much of a lazy feel.

The bouffant is much easier to tackle with shorter hair (shoulder length). See How to Tease Your Hair for help on achieving the bouffant.






For headbands: Go for a relaxed, well-combed loose look, with an added neon thin headband worn like a hippy would, not on top of the head, but surrounding the head. Try out some pretty fabric-covered thick headbands too.

Go shopping over the weekend, go to stores like Aeropostale, Pac Sun, Rue 21, Journeys, Sanrio, etc.,

, Go to the salon and ask for razored, choppy layers especially at the crown area, and bangs (either side bangs or straight across.) for the first couple months, leave it your natural hair color. Then if your parents will let you, dye your hair any color or colors you want. If they don't let you, ask about getting extensions. But if you don't want to, that's fine. Also, for the first week into your new hairstyle don't tease it. Then the next week you can tease it a little, then the next week even more, and so on.

, When you were preppy, you probably listened to rap, pop, and hip hop. Well, for scene, this music is also quite good. But also try music like Blood on the Dance Floor, Millionaires, 3!OH3, Owl City and I Set My Friends on Fire.

Stop labeling.,
Realize what you like about scene.,
Unsceneify yourself if you're already all-out scene.,
If you have to work your way up, don't be called a poser.,
The most important thing of all: Learn to be yourself!",How to Incorporate Scene Into Your Style Without Being Labeled," In order to be yourself and scene at the same time, you need to get rid of your idea of labeling. Just because that girl in second period teases her bleached hair doesn't make her scene. That one girl in your math class? Yeah, she wears colored hair extensions...but she's not scene. You have to quit labeling everybody for the little things. Because you're going to have little parts of scene incorporated into how you look, right? You better stop labeling before you label yourself. Because if you're labeling yourself scene, you're going to end up looking like a poser--and that's not what you want.
In other words, clear your mind of labels and don't label anybody...especially yourself.;
, Before you can incorporate scene into your appearance, you must know what it is you like.If you like the hair... Go for it! You're trying to be an individual with a hint of scene. Individuality is key in scene hair...so go for it! Dye it however you want. White to black to every neon color in between. Streaks. Clip-in extensions. Wacky hair cuts. However, if hair is what you really like about scene, you better keep it to hair. People may be directing their attention to your hair for your label. If it appears to be scene, they'll examine the rest of you for confirmation--whether they realize it or not. So if your hair is scene material, keep the rest of yourself unique. Meaning lay low on the eye liner. Don't dress typically scene. Etc. Be yourself and let your hair shine...however literal you want to take that.If you like the clothes... The clothes aren't really that noticeable, unlike say..Goth clothing or prep clothing--they stick to certain styles or brands that make them stick out. Scene, on the other hand, is more into what's on the clothes. Robots, dinosaurs, Hello Kitty, Skelanimals, Gloomy Bear, kiddy things, indie bands, etc. Of course, they also wear a lot of solid-colored clothing. If you love their fashion, by all means, wear it. Just tone down everything else. If you're matching your clothes with a lot of eye liner, you won't necessarily be called scene. Worse. A poser. Because you've only got half the look down (which is what you want) yet it'll look like a bad thing. You need to be respected by the true scenes...not shunned.If you're into the makeup... Wear it. Accent it with something else scene so that you're not thought to be emo or something else! The makeup is into heavy eyeliner and eyeshadow. (False eyelashes, as well, thanks to Jeffree Star!) Bright colors or dark colors...it's up to you. So accent it with the clothing, slightly. And by clothing, I mean wear more bright things among the style of scene. As stated, you shouldn't be taken as emo. Just make sure you don't have wild hair with your wild makeup. That's most of the scene appearance right there! Have more natural hair if you're going to go for the makeup. Wear more bright clothes, if wanted, to avoid other labels.If you just like some of everything... Good for you! You get the least picky of ways to look. Tease your hair, if you desire. Not too much or too dramatic. A bow once in a while doesn't hurt, as long as it's not that big and accents your hair and face more than it does stand out. Base your clothing off scene, but don't limit it. It's cool that you have that Hello Kitty shirt, but it's also cool that you have your Pirates of the Caribbean shirt! Wear some scene-inspired clothing, but most importantly, wear what you like! Also wear some eyeliner if you want. Not heavy but somewhat noticeable. Eyeshadow is optional. Don't go for the false lashes. Heavy blush is okay as long as it's blended well. Basically, go for the makeup, but don't overdo it...at all.

, Quit those Myspace trains. Stop sending out the wh_-me bulletins. Take the scene queens --including Star--off your top. Your Myspace says a lot about who you are. Be more normal on Myspace. However, it's okay to keep your friends, comments, interests, etc. hidden like some do. You also need to stray from your scene friends. Moving on isn't easy to do. Maybe you don't want to. That's okay, but make sure they know what's going on in case they ditch you, in the rare case your friends are like that. Also, if you're going to keep scene friends, don't let them influence you. Just because this one girl is going to a show and bringing all the other friends with her doesn't mean you have to come. Just because this other friend of yours is getting snakebites doesn't mean you have to come and get a septum. Just remember that you don't have to be everything your friends are.

, It takes a long time to gradually become scene and avoiding being called a poser. You know, slowly but surely. Well, you want to be individualistic while being slightly scene, right? Even though you're not going to be fully scene, you need to still work slowly. And remember, subtly is key. If you have too much scene but you're still yourself, you're going to be called a poser for looking part of the part. Look somewhat scene. BUT BE SUBTLE. Too much is posing if you won't be completely scene. And you want respect from the real scene kids, trust me.

, That may seem a little odd, seeing how this is supposed to help you be slightly part of a labeled look. But understand that the other part is purely your individuality. Think outside the box. Don't be limited to what people think is fashion or what is defined inside of labels. You may be partly scene, but the other part is individuality. So be who you want to be. Don't cave into the wide world of scene. Take a piece of it and use it to become your own person. Scene should just be a tiny chunk of who you really are.

Learn the lingo.,
Start wearing scene makeup.,
Start buying the clothes.,
Go on Social Networking site.,
Get scene hair.",How to Go from Prep Chick to Scene Girl," Listen to music such as punk rock, alternative, rap, techno, and crunkcore. Scene style isn't about following the mainstream, so try searching around MySpace and finding new and undiscovered bands.;
, Use cute little kid words that people normally wouldn't say. And do not forget to overuse them. Also, *do not* copy someone else's words.

, Black eyeliner and bright colored eyeshadow is the way to go.


Note: Do not go from wearing natural tones one day to totally punked out eye makeup the next. This will cause people to notice, and it will seem like you are trying way too hard. Start with more mascara than usual, then slightly more eyeliner, and go from there.

You are going to need super bright accessories and necklaces.






Buy bright coloured ballet flats and/or Vans.(converse work too)







, The sites that scenes are interested in are Myspace & Facebook. They are what you need to get noticed and make friends. Also there's this scene site called (Sceneteens.ning.com)that's starting to get more popular so you need to check that out too.

, If necessary, wait longer than 6 weeks for this change. Remember, your hair needs to be original, colourful, and preferably do-it-yourself.


The scene hair cut is, short choppy layers cut at the crown of your head. Part your hair from temple to temple and cut the top layer until it reaches your cheekbones, then cut into it to make it choppy.

,
Hoard sugar.,
At the rave, give away your kandi bracelets and candy to anyone who is nice to you.,
Enjoy the atmosphere, and stay straight edge if you want to.",How to Be a Kandi Kid (Girls)," Be enthusiastic. No matter how much your feet hurt from dancing all night, keep smiling.

, Candy ravers are famed for dressing in bright, punchy, neon colors. When raving, try to be practical and not pile on the clothing because it's going to get hot. Tutu skirts are a good option. They are cute and give your legs lots of freedom to move. Cargo trousers (pants) are another rave essential as the large pockets on them can hold bottles of water, candy and anything else you care to sneak in. A brightly colored tee and a pair of customised jeans are a great look. Details tend to be fluffy, or are related to kids' characters such as Care Bears or Hello Kitty.

, Fluffies are fabulous and easy to make. They are available online as well.

, A feather boa makes a great accessory.

, Preferably choose one that has lots of pony beads in it; pony beads are a staple of kandi. Make as many elasticized bracelets (categorized as singles - single strand bracelets, doubles - a double stranded bracelets, phatties - triple stranded bracelets, cuffs - x base, UFO, cage, epic, and ones that display pictures are all subcategories of the cuff, etc.) and necklaces as you can, and put them on before going out.


A big priority of them is making them able to make noise when you dance. Try adding bells, cute charms, or toys to them.
Pacifiers are also common but be aware that they are considered drug paraphernalia as they are intended to prevent teeth-grinding while on x.
Oftentimes, kandi is made in day-glo colors, along with other colors to make them pop (for example, baby pink and green on navy blue and baby blue, red, cyan, and yellow on black and white, rainbow on white n glo in the dark, etc.).
Get creative and have fun with your beads.

, Try putting on neon colors and contrast them with black eyeliner.

, Glitter and colour sprays are cheap and easy to work with, plus give good results and come in a variety of colours. Look online or in party stores for hairsprays, Halloween, and glow-in-the-dark makeup.

, They're pretty much every Kandi Kid's favorite kind of music. It's fun, fast-paced and upbeat. It helps you get happy and makes you dance!

,, Candy is an essential when raving, and Kandi Kids seem to be constantly hyper. Candy necklaces are great as they fulfill both definitions of raver candy. Lollipops (suckers) are another essential.

, Or, trade bracelets with another kandi kid - this is one of the fundamentals of being a kandi kid. This is called a kandi trade. The easiest and most common way to do it is to interlace fingers with the other person and slide it over your hand and onto their wrist.

, After all, you have candy!

This way you will always be prepared for a spur of the moment dip in the ocean.;
, The California girl aesthetic is often described as laid back, chill, and casual. Jeans are a staple of a laid back style, so invest in several pairs of jeans, from skinny jeans to wide leg jeans and boyfriend fit jeans.You should also look for jeans that are distressed or ripped to create a more laid back vibe.

, Kimonos are great layering pieces that can be worn over a vintage band t-shirt and jeans shorts for a casual day out or over a long summer dress for date night. Look for kimonos made of interesting prints at flea markets and vintage stores.You can also look for cover ups in the form of jean vests or button up shirts that you can then layer over a bikini or a vintage t shirt for the ultimate California look.

Integrate color into your jewellery by going for turquoise rings and bracelets.Many California girls also like to wear straw hats or wide brimmed hats. Baseball caps are also good for casual days out at the beach when you want to keep the sun out of your eyes.

, Many California girls have a seemingly effortless beachy hair look from swimming in the ocean all day long. You can create this look at home with a few styling tools, no ocean water necessary.Start with damp hair, straight out of the shower. Create a rectangle with your hair at the front of your head. Make sure the rectangle extends from the end of one eyebrow to the end of your other eyebrow and four inches back from your hairline.
Use volumizer spray on the roots of your hair and blow dry your hair using a round brush. Move the brush straight and upward to create a tousled look.
Once you finish drying your hair, use three fingers to twist the rectangle section so it forms a pin curl and pin it with a bobby pin. Let the section cool as you spray sea salt on your hair. Tousle your hair with your fingers.
Remove the pin and let the curl fall over your face. Use dry shampoo on the roots of the rectangle section and flip most of the section to one side. This should form a side part that goes from the arch of your eyebrow and angles toward the crown of your head.

, This is the go to style for many California girls, especially after a long day at the beach when their hair is still damp with salt water. It can also be done at home with the aid of damp hair from a shower and styling mousse.Apply two dollops of styling mousse to dry hair or start with damp hair. Use your fingers to apply the mousse from the roots of your hair to the ends.
Flip your hair over and dry your hair with a blow dryer, using your fingers to roughly blow it out. Dry it until there are no stiff pieces and the mousse is completely dry. If you are using damp hair for this style, you can skip this step.
While your hair is still upside down, pull your hair together into a ponytail at the very top of your head. Use a hair tie to secure the ponytail and flip your head back up. Divide the ponytail into two sections and twist each section until they come together. Secure the sections at the base of the ponytail with bobby pins.
Finish with a few spritzes of salt spray.

, Keep your face minimal by using a few products on your face. Apply waterproof mascara and minimal foundation so your skin looks natural and fresh. Then, apply a light tint of eyeshadow and lip gloss or lip tint in a warm pink to finish the relaxed California look., Get the ultimate California look by “tanning” your skin tone with bronzer. Use a big make up brush to apply bronzer on your hairline, temples, chin, and jawline. Do one to two swoops of bronzer and do not over do the bronzer, as you do not want your skin tone to look too dark and unnatural.Finish by applying bronzer to your neck and chest, including your collarbones, as well as your shoulders and your shins. This will give you a full body sun kissed look.
Another option is to try self tanner so you have a nice, even tan. However, self tanner can look fake and unnatural if it is applied poorly.

, California girls are known for their love of the outdoors, especially due to access to many beautiful beaches and national parks. You can embrace this love of the outdoors by making an effort to explore the natural areas where you live on your own, with family, or with friends. This could be weekly hikes, a daily walk in a park nearby, or even a surfing trip to a coastal area with friends. Focus on emulating the California girl way of connecting with nature., Get the California girl look the natural way by going to the beach for a long swim in the ocean and a tanning session in the sun. If you do not live near the ocean, you can spend time tanning outside in your backyard during a warm day or swim in a lake close to your home.

Wearing colourful beaded bracelets are great.,
Love and respect the environment.,

For hair accessories you could use are the old hippie headbands, feathers, flowers, you could also try using bandanna's as headbands. Shaving among hippies is common-place now a days, but in the 60s and 70s feminist and hippies were against it. Hippies are in a sense naturalists, so if you're a strong person, stop shaving.

, Please note that certain drugs can cause serious health problems and most drugs are illegal. But you don't need to take drugs to be a hippie, you can get a more ""natural high"" from meditation, try reading books that have different philosophies and ideas.

Shooter and first person shooter video games are amongst the oldest types of games. These games involve shooting at targets and are often war themed in nature. First person shooters involve the player navigating an environment from a first person perspective. You'll often be required to shoot and kill your enemies. Examples of shooter and first person shooter games include Halo, Doom, and Wolfenstein. If you enjoy action, you may want to consider a shooter game.Adventure games usually involve the player going on a variety of quests to obtain information to aid with an overarching mission.

Wear used clothes.,
Choose loose, comfortable, and natural tops.,
Try out a vest.,
Carefully choose your kind of jacket.",How to Dress Like a Hippie1," Shop at thrift stores, flea markets, and, whenever possible, garage sales. Though you can find gear designed to look “hippie” in other places (like New Age stores and eBay), the whole point of hippie fashion was to stop buying what big corporations were selling in favor of used clothing that was purchased locally.


Many hippies are into sewing and other handcrafts; if you can make your own clothes, that's even better. In making your own clothes, a little effort goes a long way; something that was made by you nets you a lot more credit than something that was anonymously bought from someone else.;
, A simple tee will work if you have other accessories to dress it up with, but try to opt for faded, old, or used tees. (If you're a woman, wear a soft, cotton bra — no under-wire or padding — or don't wear a bra at all.) Hipsters have largely claimed the ironic and retro tees, but that doesn't mean you can't dabble, too. Still, there are other options for you to try if you want to branch out:


Incorporate tie-dyed tops into your repertoire. Sure, they probably shouldn't be worn every day, but once in a while, they're a great alternative.
Dashikis can add beautiful color and tribal patterns to an otherwise drab outfit.
India is another source of hippie clothing inspiration.
Nice, long-sleeved peasant blouses are an especially popular choice among hippies, as they're stylish without being fussy.

, A vest is a great option for accessorizing with other tops. In the '60s, at the height of hippiedom, the suede fringe vest was a classic option for man and woman alike. There's a lot that says ""hippie,"" but this screams ""hippie."" Alternately, any variety of vest should work:


Long vs. short
Colorful vs. monochrome
Loose vs. tight
Floral
Beaded

, Although the vintage denim jacket is classic hippie, there are other options if you want to spice things up. If it has beads, embroidery, or patterned trim, go for it. Leather, suede, sheepskin, or even fur (although if you're an animal-conscious hippie, you may want to steer clear) are all fair game. An army jacket could also be appropriate in some situations, although some hippies might misinterpret the clothing. You could embroider peaceful slogans on it to make your intentions clear.


Hoodies, although comfortable, are not generally thought of as hippie material. You can wear them in a pinch, but don't rely on them.
In general, stick to older jackets. Newer tees can be made to fit into hippie wardrobe, but newer jackets are hard to incorporate.

"
"
Go for denim bell bottoms.,
Get some denim shorts, especially if they're ripped or torn.,
Utilize your options if you're a lady.",How to Dress Like a Hippie2," Faded, torn, or patched jeans will work if the rest of the outfit is sufficiently hippie, but the holy grail of hippie bottoms is none other than the denim bell bottoms. Men and women both wore these; they're a staple of hippie culture.


Embroider a peace-sign patch on your bell-bottoms.
Denim, corduroy, or patterned pants will work as long as it has that characteristically hippie flair at the bottom. In fact, these might be a good alternative to your best pair of denim bell bottoms.
Having trouble finding bell bottoms in this age of the skinny jeans? Here's a tutorial on how to turn a pair of jeans into bell bottoms.

, Or better yet, rehab your old ones by fraying, ripping, or tearing them (although it's not strictly necessary). If you're male, turn your old jeans into cutoffs. If you're female, try turning your old jeans into short shorts.


Really, the grungier, the better, especially if you're a dude. You're not really concerned with your clothes being pristine and pressed.

, There's much more that you can do with bottoms as a female. Take advantage of it! If the weather allows, you have many options. Consider:


Loose, flowy skirts (think gypsy style)
Dresses such as tunics or sundresses
Even mini- or micro-skirt (especially if paired with above-the-knee boots).
Many male hippies did wear robes or even skirts. There are skirts made especially for men. Don't be afraid to wear what feels right regardless of gender.

"
"
Choose the right kind of sandal or flip-flop.,
Try on some hippie boots.,
Know that many hippies also wear moccasins.",How to Dress Like a Hippie3," Though hippies made a point of going barefoot, they often wear flat sandals when this isn’t practical. After all, no shirt, no shoes, no service.


The sandals most often associated with hippies are Birkenstocks. They have cork bottoms and leather upper material.
Try also leather flip flops. They're easy to put on and pull off and look great with dresses and skirts.

, Especially in colder weather, or if you want to dress up your outfit, you can try on some boots. Hippie boots are generally suede or leather and could almost pass for booties in a pinch.

, Any style of moccasins will work, but they should be comfortable. Many moccasins will have bead work on parts of the shoe.

"
"
Put on select handcrafted jewelry.,
Choose your belt.,
If you don’t mind altering your clothes, add fringes.,
Embroider your clothes and paint your face.,
Slap on some ankle bells.,
Go for granny glasses or shades.",How to Dress Like a Hippie4," Bonus hippie points if you make your own. See our articles on making jewelry. Try the following pieces of jewelry for a hippie flavor:


Long beaded necklaces and macrame

Natural stones
Seashells
Peace charms
Large, ethnic-inspired earrings

, A wide leather belt, peace-symbol belt, or chain belt would work nicely. Anything that says DIY or vintage pretty much goes.


If you're a very DIY kind of person, a simple shoelace can be tied through your belt loops and then fastened in a bow knot. This is a great trick used mostly by male hippies who don't want to purchase a belt but who still want support on their trousers.

, In fact, add fringes to everything you can get away with. Back in the day, this was done to pants, shirts, vests, jackets, or anything else that could feasibly be fringed.

, Embroider brightly colored flowers, stars, birds, and slogans like ""love"" and ""peace"" on your clothes. American flag patches, pins, and patterns are also popular as part of the anti-war movement. For festive occasions, decorate yourself with face paint.

, You'll be heard coming from a mile away, but gosh-dangit you'll be authentic (especially for females). A precursor to the silent anklet, ankle bells were just that -- bells around your ankles. Sounds fun!

, The 50s had those thick, black-rimmed glasses (or, wait, are we talking about today's hipsters?) and this trend had the small, half-moon granny glasses. If history repeats itself, these will be next!


Fun sunglasses, think tinted John Lennon specs. You know the kind. Hippies weren't much concerned with peripheral vision!

"
"
Grow your hair out.,
Wear a headband.,
Style your hair minimally.,
Consider getting dreadlocks if you think you could deal with them.,
Keep the make-up to a minimum.",How to Dress Like a Hippie5," Whether you're male or female, long hair is the norm. This is mainly because you're not going to bother getting it cut! It should be clean (you still bathe!), but it doesn't have to be anything beyond that.


""Artfully disheveled"" is a definite look you could pull off as a hippie. Whatever comes natural to your follicles is how you should rock your mop.
Men -- grow out your facial hair, too.

, Wear your headband horizontally over your forehead, not vertically over your hair, and accessorize it with a flower (a daisy is classic).


If you want a feather in your hair more permanently — or just don't like the idea of killing a flower in order to festoon your hair — look for a flower clip that you can put in your hair along with your headband.
If you can't find a headband, make your own with string. Try to find a stretchy fabric for your string; cotton or other, inelastic string will begin to hurt and may leave a mark on your forehead if worn for a long time.

, Leave your hair long, loose, and low-maintenance. Don't put any chemicals in it. The less you style it, the better. If you’re a man, leave your facial hair scruffy and unkempt.


If you do need to tie your hair up, put it in a low ponytail, two low ponytails, or a braid.

, Getting dreadlocks is notoriously difficult, but they're definitely worth it if you think that you can pull them off. They're a labor of love.


They're a semi-permanent labor of love, so make sure you're committed before you take the leap.

, For women, go practically bare. A bit of black kohl outlining your eyes is okay, but not much more than that.Stay away from lipstick and any outrageous, obvious coloring. You're a child of the earth, after all.

Every so often choose a new identity.",How to Be Weird," Invent a holiday, give it a weird name, and then when the day comes around, get decked out. Talk about a place you went that no one's ever heard of. Your holiday is celebrated there and you can show your friends the timeless customs of this magical place if they'd like.


Nowadays, every day is something, but no one actually celebrates it. Is it National Pancake Day? Walk around handing out pictures of pancakes, telling everyone that you’re trying to spread the word about this hidden breakfast treat.;
, Try ""Hello Granny! I haven't seen you in years!"" while grinning, of course, or ""Oh my gosh! Are you okay?"" When they are clearly alive, fine and well. Just make sure you're picking someone who will laugh, and not someone who will think you're crazy.


Ask random people if they've seen a rhino, and elephant, etc., ""anywhere around here."" Seem serious about it. But, of course, after a couple of minutes of pulling their leg, you may want to admit that it's a joke!
Pretend like you don't know what some specific, common things are. When your friend asks you if you want a banana, say, ""What's a banana?""
Of course, some people may think you’re certifiably crazy and may think you’re harassing them. Choose your targets carefully and always do things with a smile on your face, showing you mean no harm.

, For example, if you see a slinky, act as if it's a great discovery. Or, if you do a minor bad thing, like forget to push in your chair or crease a piece of paper, be inconsolable. How could you dare to do such a terrible thing?! No one will be able to tell if you're serious or not!


If you see your friend step on an ant, say, “Oh no! What have you done?! Oh, little ant, your life was so short and meaningless! I’m so sorry!” And then move on, happy as a clam.
Only do this on occasion. Again, if people can't predict your behavior, they'll probably just think you've lost your marbles.

, For instance, say, ""Oh my gosh! Are those Oreos? They're so spicy! I never knew they sold them here!"" or ""These pickles taste like my brother's wallpaper.""


Try foods most people don't eat or foods that people eat, but wouldn't eat the way you're eating. For example, bring a lemon to lunch and eat it like an orange, or put an orange in between two pieces of bread for an ""orange sandwich.""

, You want a thing that's quintessentially you. It should be quirky and something no one else you know does. You could put a little skip in your walk, make a noise after every time you sneeze,always wear hats everywhere, or be afraid of clams. Be creative!


It could be how you say things, when you say things, or even just the way you laugh. The tinier the thing, the more it'll stand out, too.

, You want to do something that no one else does, like collecting packing peanuts and turning them into sculptures, making piñatas, painting your nose, or writing bad poetry about Jackalopes. Who knows? If you're original enough you could turn it into a business!


This hobby could be a strange pet, such as a pet rock, a pet ladder, a pet soda can, or a pet sneaker. Take it everywhere with you, and converse with it. Soon enough, you’ll be the person “with the pet rock.” If you don’t have it, eventually people will start asking you where it is!
Make sure you have loyal friends who don't ditch you for being weird.

, Ninjas have ninjosity and ninjitude, for example. Use these words constantly, just like they’re real words. If someone tells you something is not a word, tell them it is now! Explain philosophically why.


Can't come up with something? Take a couple of your favorite words and mash them together. Your favorite words are bubble and flamingo? Bubbingo, it is. Now what's a bubbingo?

, One day you fancy yourself Irish, one day you're French, and the next day you're Chinese. Why not? You could even invent your own accent if you'd like. Perhaps it's the accent of that made-up place you go to?


wikiHow has a great article on speaking gibberish. That's a way of speaking your own language that is very easy to learn. If your friends learn it too, you could be ""weird"" together!
Wildly fluctuate the tone and pitch of your voice at different times, too. Whisper when you don’t need to, sing your words, or talk very, very, very slowly whenever you feel like it. But be warned, this can really get on some people’s nerves!

, For best results make sure your half-thought has nothing to do with the conversation. Is everyone talking about that new song on the radio? All of a sudden, you come in with, “Oh, man. Blueberries. They’re just so…”


This is a good way to stop a conversation and get another one started. The current topic boring you? Say, ""Did you see that TV show?"" and your friends might be too distracted to go back to what they were originally thinking about.

, Don't do it all the time (otherwise you'll just look schizophrenic) – just if someone around is ignoring you. That’ll get them to pay attention to you for sure!


A lull in the conversation? Friends boring you? Why not strike up a conversation with your notebook or your food? You could be the life of the party in no time! Weird, but the life of the party nonetheless.

, Use a different one every day. They don't have to be good! Take aspects of their personality or their look (without being mean of course) and think about what fits them.


Or what doesn't fit them! Some nicknames are funny because they are so unfitting. Have a friend who's way taller than you? He's ""short stuff"" for today. A friend who loves puppies? Call her ""cheese puffs"" – it doesn't have to do with anything!

, Clothing is a major part of being crazy! Combine clashing colors or patterns to create outfits that can't help but stand out. Combine decades too, with new, modern clothes and vintage ones. Just make sure you're okay with everyone staring!


Dress up in unusual clothing, too, such as fairy wings, witches' hats, or vampire teeth. Halloween costumes are always great, regardless of what day of the year it is.

, If people are wearing skinny jeans, wear ripped up bell bottoms. If people are wearing checkers, wear some crazy design. Mix it up. Try thrift stores to find unique looks. Being weird is all about doing your own thing and standing out.


To be truly weird, this may mean wearing clothes you don't actually care for. After all, it's about being weird and not being fashionable, right? Raid your mom or dad's closet to get ideas that are truly inspirational.

, When Halloween comes around, dress as someone...completely normal. Choose other random, arbitrary days where you dress normal, too. Otherwise, people might just get used to what you wear.


If you want to be weird, you have to be a little inconsistent. Being normal once in a while will highlight to others when you're being weird again. If you're weird all the time, they'll just come to expect it.

, Nowadays, everyone is trying to be something. By just being yourself, you'll be a little weird. Finding someone who's truly genuine is a rare occurrence. Embrace the quirks that come to you naturally – they may be enough.


Everything will come a lot easier if you do as you're naturally inclined. If you fake being weird, you're just putting on a show, and it'll be hard to keep consistent. What's more, it may bring you down not being you. All the more reason to be yourself!

, If you're concerned with your image, being weird will not come easy. You need to abandon what others expect of you and only think about what feels right to you. Your reputation does not matter – you are an oddball now.


Whether you're an oddball or not, it shouldn't matter what others think. Those who matter won't mind who you are. Why should anyone else have any say in they you are or what you're like?

, Once you start acting weirdly, word will get around that you're a little odd. Eventually people will just come to expect it. You may do something totally normally and just because it's you, people will get a kick out of it. So be sure you want to be weird – because it may last a while!


What's more, you may forget how to act normal. Habit makes practice, after all. If being weird doesn't work for you, it could be difficult to go back to the way you used to be. So be sure before you take the dive into weirdness that you're ready for the commitment.

, Be Napoleon, the President, a princess, a prince, an elf, etc. Embody them in their look and in their personality. Hit up Halloween stores after Halloween for awesome discounts and make your own costumes, too.


Try to think like them too! An elf wouldn't know what do with a cell phone, for example. When yours rings, you respond with, ""Ahhh! What is this blasphemous contraption! How do I...hmm...interesting.""

Know what a Flapper girl is.,
Research some famous Flappers.,
Live like a Flapper.,
Talk like a Flapper.,
Dress like a Flapper.So, you know how to act, how to talk... but how do you dress?,
Get some Flapper Glamour.,
Get Flapper hair.",How to Be a Flapper Girl," The dictionary defines a flapper as - ""A young woman, especially one in the 1920s, who showed disdain for conventional dress and behavior."" That is, conventional in the 1920s. The style came around after the first world war, and women were tired of trying to conform to society's idea of normal - women were gaining more independence (e.g. being given the right to vote), and the face of America was changing! Flappers were most commonly known for their dancing, drinking, smoking, wearing a lot of makeup, and a love of films.Almost all flappers had bobbed hair, dated frequently, and stopped wearing their corsets (which were social norms in the 1910s.) If you want more information, try going down to your local library, or try using resources such as Wikipedia. There are also several websites with information on Flappers.;
, What better way to learn than by example? Here are some women you may want to look up -


Anita Loos (Author of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes)
Clara Bow (Actress in film It)
Louise Brooks (Actress in film Pandora's Box)
Josephine Baker (Performer in the Folies Bergère)
Helen Kane (Singer of I Want To Be Loved By You)
Zelda Fitzgerald (Socialite, wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald)

, Now that you know exactly 'what' a Flapper is, and know you wish to be one, you'll need to start acting like one! Here is a list of things Flappers would commonly do.


Instead of watching TV when bored, do crosswords. Try to do them every day.
If possible, get a driver's license and a nice car. go all out, one circa 1920s) and drive it. Flappers drove everywhere they could, and were not afraid to drive fast.
Instead of sitting at home, or going to dance clubs, find a Jazz club to frequent, and dance the night away.
Pout. Constantly. Make it a habit, because it will come in handy later. And if you must smile, don't do a big grin, just a small polite one will do.
Keep your hair perfectly styled and frizz free.
ALWAYS wear makeup. Even to go grocery shopping or walk the dog. Keep your makeup with you in a purse or bag and apply it often, in public places. In the 1920s, this was very unconventional and all Flappers did this.
Be very flirtatious, but remain classy. You should practice being sexy, sophisticated and care-free, and try to go out on plenty of dates and to parties - looking fabulous, of course.
If you're staying home with your friends (who are preferably Flappers), play games of Mah-Jongg.

, Now that you're acting like a Flapper (and I'm sure your friends will have noticed the change), you should start talking like one, too! Here is some common Flapper slang. You'll probably recognize some of the words that have lasted through the ages! (Note: Use in moderation to begin with.)


Good - Bee's knees, berries, cat's meow, cat's pajamas, copacetic, ducky, hep (wise), hotsy-totsy, It, jake, kippy, nifty, ritzy, spiffy, swanky, swell.
Bad - Applesauce, baloney, banana oil, bunk, flat tire (a boring person), hokum, hooey, horse feathers, lousy.
Body parts - Feet = Dogs, Legs = Gams or Stilts, Mouth = Kisser, Nose = Smeller
Money - Sugar
Dud - A wallflower
Sweetie - Anybody you hate
Butt me - Give me a cigarette
You can find much more in the link to the ""Flapper's Dictionary"" in the Sources and Citations area at the bottom of this page!

, Well, Flapper's had a very distinctive dress sense - it was like nothing else around in the 1920s. Go out to your local clothes shops, boutiques, thrift stores and vintage stores, or click on eBay or a specialist vintage retailer, and try to find these items.


Dresses. When buying dresses, look out for - dropped waistlines (VERY important to the Flapper style), plunging necklines, plunging backs, and sleeveless dresses. Material wise, go for beaded material, sequined material, and flowery material.
Stockings. When wearing your stockings, roll them down to either above your knee or directly below, and wear chains instead of garters. If you are wearing silk stockings, Try to find them with embroidered icons on them.
Long shoulder-length satin gloves. Don't forget to look for gloves that will snugly fit your arms, their tight fit will save you from having to pull them up every 5 minutes, which would be very annoying for you. To make sure that the gloves will have a snug fit, choose preferably gloves that are made of at least 15% spandex. Longer gloves will also fall more slowly than short ones (i.e. elbow-length or shorter gloves).
Cloche hats, peekaboo hats and feathered hats
Headbands, particularly feathered headbands
Things with feathers and fringes
Knee-length skirts, or those slightly below the knee
Knit suits (skirt sets)
Knitted sweaters
Lace
Long strands of pearls
Raccoon coats
Sleeveless shirts

, You could easily be regarded as a Flapper now! Your wardrobe is the bee's knees, but what about your makeup? Well, don't worry about it, we'll sort that out next. You might be surprised to hear that many brands popular in the 1920s are available today - Avon, Max Factor Elizabeth Arden were all popular among flappers.


Before you begin applying your makeup, wash your face well. You'll need a good canvas to work on. Also, remember to take all your makeup of at night, and cleanse and moisturize daily. Who ever heard of a flapper with bad skin?
Cover your face and your lips with a thin layer of foundation that matches your skin tone (your lip colour should be the same as your skin colour, now), and top it off with some powder on your t-zone. Apply blusher at your own discretion - if you do choose to, keep it up at your cheekbones.
Pluck your eyebrows. Flappers were known for having tiny eyebrows. They should be very thin, and either straight or slightly turned down. Highlight your lovely brows by going through them with a dark brown eyebrow pencil.
Flapper's wished to achieve the large, doe-eyed look. Wear smudgy, smokey eye-makeup. Finish with some dark mascara and false eyelashes, to really make a statement.
This is possibly the most important part of the Flapper look - the lips! You'll want to have cupid-bow lips. Before you begin, make sure your lips are properly coated in foundation. There are two ways to create this look. The first is to take a red lip liner and draw two dramatic peaks on your top lip - don't fill these peaks in, however, nor the rest of your lips. Or, if your prefer, you could take a jar of lipstick, dip your thumb in, and rub it twice over each of your peaks (a lot of girls did this.) This is where your pouting practice will become useful - you'll look very silly with a big grin and cupid bow lips!

, Your flapper look will not be complete with out Flapper hair. A Flapper's hair was extremely important. Ridiculously important. Flapper's wore their hair in bobs. If you have straight hair, or hair straighteners, have a sleek and smooth bob. If you have curly hair, have a wild and unruly one! The choice of having a fringe, or ""bangs"", is completely up to you. Some people find comfort hiding behind long hair. Well, that has to change. Be loud and proud! NOBODY doesn't suit short hair - there are many different styles of bob to suit different face shapes. Ask a professional hairstylist about what will suit you best. You could also try ""finger rolls"" in your short hair. Here is a website with information on achieving this look. (Putting finger rolls in long hair isn't an alternative.)

Read the classics.",How to Be a Flipper (Girls)," Explore the acoustic hits of the 90's. Flippers LOVE Green Day. In fact, the flipper theme song would probably be ""Time of Your Life"" but to be a true flipper, always call it ""Good Riddance"" and be super-annoyed by people that don't know the real meaning behind it. Also, listen to Jewel, Enya, Nora Roberts, the Indigo Girls, and Dashboard Confessional. Emo, rock, ska and punk are very acceptable, but nothing too hardcore. NEVER listen to hip-hop, country, rap, or anything popular. (Actually, you can listen to whatever you want, but this is what is what's recommended.);
, Also, don't eat junk food, it's just as bad.

, A flipper's goal in life is to not cause pain and suffering. However you don't have to be vegetarian if you don't want to or if your parents don't let you.

, Because, hey, why not? It's a super cool skill to know and may come in handy a few time in life, eh?

,, Flippers HATE the Hollywood culture. Reality television, unless it has to do with science, is also pointless.

, Flippers love learning. Make friends with all of your teachers. Flippers know that although this sounds geeky, it'll pay off in letters of recommendation.

, Make sure you really absorb the information and you don't rush through it.

, Flippers have unmatched creativity that spills out everywhere. (flippers love drawing on shirts with sharpies, and the designs don't wash out!)

, Flippers usually only drink water (flavored is good.) Milk and orange juice are fine, too.

, Rollerblade everywhere possible.

,, Go to anti-war, disability rights, animal rights protests.

,


Remember, you're just a kid!

, Flippers want to be lean and athletic. Wear sports bras all the time and play down your chest. Flippers love swimming, running, yoga, pilates, and martial arts. These help you slim down, not get bigger.

, Reduce calories but eat tons of fruits and vegetables.

, Plastic-rimmed glasses are VERY flipperish!

, The signature flipper hair color is red for uniqueness and oddity.

, Flippers are careful with their skin.

, Flippers are musicians, and prefer sentimental, acoustic music.

, Paint them bright colors.

, Don't try to change your features with your makeup like contouring your cheeks (evening skin tone is fine.)

, Flippers love going camping and hiking.

,, Decide that you are too smart to be an object for guys.

,,, Flippers don't go shopping that much, and spend most of their time in the bookstores.

, Most colors are fine, but flippers don't usually wear brown.

, You should also have a few rings.

, Flippers don't make spectacles of themselves. Don't look people in the eye until you've talked to them for about a minute. Flippers don't people watch; they stare into space.

,, When starting off a conversation, just smile and nod like you've heard something similar before. Look at people like they're interesting animals, this will freak them out. Never divulge too much information. Speak moderately and methodically, and try not to have an annoying accent like valspeak.

, If you've got a problem, like you're late, don't let it shake you, just get there and apologize. A true flipper can be held at gunpoint and go, ""You really need to relax, man!""

, When you start dating someone, don't be clingy.

, Don't try to be a Barbie, and don't be a people-pleaser. Flippers are generous and helpful towards their friends and families, but they'll stand up to them.

, Gone With the Wind is a good starting point, since it is from 1936 but the language is quite simple to understand in today's world.

, Decorative scarves are also popular accessories for hipster girls.Look for scarves in thrift shops and independent clothing stores. Choose scarves that have unique designs, bright colors, or bold prints.


You can wear a scarf with just about any outfit. For example, you can dress up a plain t-shirt and jeans by adding a scarf, or wear a solid color scarf with a floral dress.

Read up on what’s going on in the world of the internet, such as the latest memes, viral stories, and viral videos.There are certain websites known to be full of hipster information, such as Vice.com and Pitchfork.com. These sites provide up to the minute information on the latest trends and influences happening in pop culture.

Hipsters are noted for a preference for food that is local, organic, and artisan made.
A good hipster approaches eating with a sense of adventure. Whether it is trying Ethiopian cuisine or trying to make homemade cheese, a hipster tries new things.
The food rules are not entirely hard and fast when it comes to fine dining. Hipsters also have a soft spot for places which have plain, good food and an atmosphere of authenticity. ""Kitschy"" eateries such as truck stops, diners, and the like are also acceptable places.



, Hipsters usually have extensive knowledge of film, music, and television, new and old. You can find out the latest, hottest shows for hipsters by asking hipster friends for recommendations or searching online blogs for the shows everyone is talking about. Hipsters also enjoy old films, specifically independent films by directors from America and Europe. Strike up a conversation with the clerk at your local video store, if it still exists, or go online and search the top American and European films.Search music blogs online for recommendations on hipster music and independent or alternative music. It may help to focus on a particular genre or style of music and a particular artist or group. Hipsters often listen to alternative and independent music, as well as rap, hip hop, soul, and progressive rock.

, Hipsters are often aware of the social and political issues of the day, and may be involved in protests or grassroots movements in their area. Think of a cause you feel passionate about or are interested in, and join in an online discussion about the issue or go to a protest organized in your area. Getting involved in social and political movements is part of the less superficial aspects of being hipster, where you are an informed and involved individual in society., Many hipsters strive to live a sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle, as they believe in caring for the environment and being aware of the effects of climate change. This may mean recycling, composting, or donating old clothing to charity rather than throwing them away.You can also look at ways to cut down on the amount of greenhouse gases you produce by biking or walking to work instead of driving or taking the bus.

, Hipsters are known for their unique sense of style and for having an independent streak in their approach to life.

Or you may decide to be more independent and confident in your current work situation where you take more initiative and try to climb the career ladder.

Take it slowly.",How to Be Independent," You cannot build a strong, independent you if you can't live with yourself. Accept your body, your personality, your opinions, your choices, your preferences, and your life story. Do not say things against yourself. Everyone can be strong enough. Everyone has put up with something, proving their strength. Put behind you your mistakes and learn from them. Make an effort to be a better you and most importantly love yourself.


This is an important part of being independent because accepting who you are will keep you from trying to act like someone else.;
, If you don't believe in yourself then who else will ? We are all different and have something unique to say. No one can speak the words on your lips and not everyone is going to agree with what you say which is why it's important for you to stand by who you are because at the end of the day you are all you got and if you believe in yourself that's really all that matters. Believing in yourself will make you trust your own decisions -- even if they completely go against someone else's -- or even society's -- expectations.


If you don't have faith in yourself, you will always second guess yourself and turn to others for help every time you have to make a decision. Step away from that.

, Independent people are not vain, nor do they believe the entire human race is cruel. Independent people are those who see the world, with its good and its bad, and consciously choose to be strong for themselves and others. You are not independent because you do not trust anyone. You are not independent because you think highly of yourself. Follow this guideline: Learn to accept the world, and decide to be strong.


Accepting the world and all of its complications will also help you see that there are an infinite number of ways to live out there -- nobody is forcing you to conform to one of them.

, Chances are, you depend on many people for emotional support. It may be your parents, a boy or girl friend, or good close friends. Although it is possible to continue to depend on these people for the rest of your life, it is in your best interest to realize that everyone in your life that you depend on will one day no longer be around. Some will move away, some will stop talking to you, and they all will eventually die. The only person that will always be with you is you. If you depend on yourself for support, you will never be let down.


It's okay to get attached to a few key people in your life, but you cannot let these people determine your level of happiness. That's up to you.

, Other people do not have and will never have the same vested interest in your success. Motivation and success is a function of habit. You must break your bad habit of procrastination, and replace it with one of good planning. The most successful people in the world aren't always the brightest, or the best looking, but no matter what other talents or gifts they have been blessed with, they have underpinning their self esteem a series of victories over tasks both large and small. This is how you learn anything in school, gain confidence dating, and everything else in life.


If you want to achieve a career goal, it should be to please yourself, not to please your family. If you want to get amazing grades, then the same thing is true.
Don't be motivated to lose weight, publish a book, or build a house just to impress others. Do it because you want to drive yourself to succeed. Do it for yourself.

, A role model can help inspire you and show you how to live your life. It's not a bad thing to find someone you deeply admire who shares your values. However, at the end of the day, it's important to think of yourself as your own role model, as a person who is capable of doing and saying anything he or she wants. Aim to be yourself, and be the best you can be. If you can't look up to yourself, you can't be independent.


Avoid idolizing any friends or acquaintances in your social circle. This will only make you even more likely to forget about doing your own thing.

, Our parents cared for us so much that they did everything in their power to raise us in a fair and just environment. The real world does not function on that principle which is a big problem today. The rules in the world usually protect either the majority (which you may not be a part of) or people with money and power. You will be treated badly for all sorts of unfair things: your skin color, your intelligence, your height, your weight, how much money you have, your opinions, your gender, and just about everything else that makes you who you are. You have to be happy in spite of that.


Don't let the unfairness of the world keep you from doing what you want to do. Want to be a male nurse? A female in the military? The first person in your family to graduate from college? Go for it instead of convincing yourself that it's just not possible in the world you live in today.

, This is the most important thing about being independent. If you depend on others to tell you if your music is cool, or if your outfit is cute, you won't be very happy! As long as you like it - nothing else matters! Stop worrying about other people's judgments about your life, whether they are thinking about your clothes, your choice of career, or your choice of significant other. These are your decisions, and not anyone else's.


If you always have the nagging thought, ""But what will other people think if..."" in the back of your head, then you'll always be holding yourself back from doing your own thing.

, Your opinion matters the most in your own motivation, but you know when you're pulling your own weight as to your accomplishments. It's far easier to just start dealing with your responsibilities knowing, with an incredibly strong faith in yourself that you can handle what comes up because you have before, than trying to accomplish goals because you're all warm and fuzzy inside. Warm and fuzzy accomplishes very little, but neither does beating yourself up.

, Watch and read the news and make sure you get it from a variety of sources. Follow it as often as you can and always have a goal of getting both sides of every story before forming an opinion. You can talk to people of a variety of backgrounds to get more information on a relevant topic, too, but never let other people tell you what to think. Make a goal of reading as much as possible, whether you're reading literature or The New York Times. Being well-informed will keep you from being a follower and will lead to more independent thought.


You don't want to be a lemming and to believe something just because your 50 closest Facebook friends tell you to.

, You don't have to throw away your friends to be independent. In fact, your independence is reinforced with good friends. When your friend needs someone to talk to, be there for them. Be trustworthy. Do not gossip or tell anyone about your friends' secrets or personal matters. Even if they didn't say anything about it. Be a strong person for your friends and loved ones. It not only shows you're selfless, but pretty soon you'll learn how to deal with any situation that comes your way because of your friends' experiences.

, It will be difficult because parents have a natural instinct to provide for us. Just politely decline when they offer financial help. It is tempting to depend on others financially, but before you experience independence, you must be independent. Secure your finances. True independent living relies on financial freedom. Pay your own bills, drive your own car, sign a personal check for your rent.


If you don't have the money for these expenses, save aggressively. Not only will you gain financial freedom with your savings, but the money you keep to yourself will give you an incredible feeling of independence and motivation.

, Work hard at everything you do. Defend your opinions. And, for you girls, don't let a man feel he has to pamper you. If you're capable of doing something good, do it. So long as it doesn't have a bad effect, you should do it. That doesn't mean do absolutely everything, but you shouldn't feel it's necessary for people to do things for you that you could do for yourself.


Work your best and hardest to leave people saying ""That person doesn't rely on anyone to do things for them. What a strong, independent person.""

, This is a difficult step on the journey to independent living, but you must start doing things on your own. You do not need to drive with someone to the restaurant, because you can meet them there. Go shopping alone, spend at least one or two evenings a week by yourself. Work on activities that force you to lead, not follow.


If you're used to always having a buddy when you go hiking or go to the mall, see how it feels to rough it on your own.

, Don't break friendships unless absolutely necessary. Learn to keep a healthy distance. Even if those friends are ""totally cool,"" they may only hold you back from breaking out on your own. ""Weed out your garden""; some people make you shine, while others will stunt your growth and draw all your energy. If you have a friend who is trying to make you do things that make you uncomfortable, whether it's stealing or just being a meaner person, then it's time to cut the cord.


Avoid any friends who really like building a following and having people worship them. These people will want you to only do what they say and will keep you from being independent.

, Save as much as reasonably possible. This will help you create an emergency fund, since life can be unpredictable at times. You don't plan accidents. Improve the quality of your life by putting aside a set amount of money each month. There are such things as accidents, health problems, or even natural disasters, which can occur when you least expect it.


You may not think that you have the capacity to save money, but even doing small things, like making your own coffee instead of going to Starbucks once a day, can save you over $30 a week -- that's over $1,500 a year!

, Most banks offer a checking and savings account together, in one convenient package. Some companies, institutions, and organizations will require you to have at least a checking account (some only pay employees via direct deposit). Money you earn that isn't necessary for your own expenses should be put into a savings account until you're ready to be independent.


Having your own bank account will keep you from depending on others for money, and will help you stay away from reckless spending.

, Experiment with different careers and find the one that you enjoy most. If money makes you happy, be an investment banker or start a small business. If you like kids, be a teacher. If you like being an expert, be a lawyer, professor or consultant. If you enjoy talking to people, be a salesperson or go into the services industry. If knowing how things work is more your game, try engineering, or Psychology and sociology.


The majority of students end up in careers unrelated to their major. Some people do not get far in formal education and end up millionaires. Working in a career that you enjoy is a part of becoming a mature person.

, Something you are devoted to, whether it is a sport, girlfriend/boyfriends, music, a band, a form of art/dance, religion. Something that you do constantly that takes up some time. Video games and playing Barbie all day aren't the best value out there. (This includes wasting your time on the Internet).


Finding a passion will make your life feel more meaningful and will make you feel more like you know what you really want out of life.

, People who are most dependent on others allow their worlds to revolve around the needs of other people or other things. Plan your day according to your own schedule--make a list of what you want to do, what you need to do and what you should have already done. If a friend really needs a favor, fine, but don't let that friend dominate the plan you had made so carefully.Treat your alone time like it's a date with Brad Pitt. That is, guard it carefully and don't let anyone stop you from spending time with yourself.

, You don't have to be stubborn to be independent. If someone has really helped you out, then thank that person by giving him a sincere ""thank you,"" writing a card, or giving him a big hug if he's a close friend. There's nothing wrong in admitting that you do need help sometimes and it won't make you any less independent to acknowledge the times when you need help.

, Just because somebody wants to pay $60 for a shirt doesn't mean you have to. Dress how you want to dress, and say what you want to say. If you like to act crazy, by all means go for it! A good thing to remember is that good taste and style does not have to cost money - it is something that is innate or learned but can make good of anything with a little know-how.

, Hanging out with people who are just like you won't inspire you to be any more independent. Making an effort to be friends with a variety of people who all have different perspectives and occupations can give you more of a sense of what's out there and to see that there's no one way to do it right.It can be refreshing to hang out with a lawyer if you're a yoga instructor, or to spend time with a chef if you're a student. This can make you more open-minded and more willing to do something completely new on your own.

, You'll never be fully independent if you don't learn to drive or how to get around on your own. How can you call yourself independent if you always depend on your boyfriend, best friend, or parents to drive you around? (This is assuming, of course, that you're old enough to drive). If you live in the suburbs and need a car to get around, take life by the horns and get a driver's license, and then work up to having your own car.If you're in a big city, don't depend on walking everywhere if the weather is nice or waiting for a friend to give you a lift -- learn how the subway, bus system, or train system works.
Depending on other people to get around will make you more likely to stay home or to wait around for other people to determine your fate. You should be able to do whatever you want to do -- whenever you want.

, Maybe you always call your dad for help with finances, or maybe you call your mom every five minutes when you're planning a big party or a wedding. Maybe you have a friend who is an expert in every possible thing and that's your go-to person whenever you run into trouble at work, with your car, or when you're trying to fix your TV. Make a habit of doing your own research before you call these people if you want to be more independent.


It's great to have people to turn to, but the next time you pick up your phone, ask yourself, can I figure out this information on my own? The answer will most likely be yes. Sure, it will take longer, but think about how much more rewarding it will feel.

, Are you tired of calling a plumber, repairman, painter, or even a trusted friend every time there's something wrong with your house? Learn to be more handy by watching useful videos, reading wikiHow, or reading Popular Mechanics. If you have a good friend who is a carpenter, ask for some carpentry lessons. Learning how to fix up your own space will make you save lots of money and feel like you don't have to wait around for others to make your life better.


And hey, learning how to quickly unclog a toilet is much better than waiting for somebody else to get to it.

, Don't depend on Trader Joe's or the gourmet deli across the street to cook for you. You don't have to be a master chef to feel like you understand the basics of cooking: how to sauté basic foods, how to use your oven, and how to cook simple dishes like pasta, potatoes, and salad. Knowing that you can go to the supermarket or farmer's market, pick up a few key ingredients, and whip together a delicious meal will make you feel like you are capable of doing anything on your own. If you become a great cook, you can even invite other people over to enjoy the benefits of your skills.
Not only will learning to cook for yourself make you more independent, but it will help you save lots of money, which is another key to your independence.

, Maybe your parents, spouse, or significant other have been balancing your budget for you, or maybe you just haven't given this much thought and have been spending a little too recklessly. Whatever is going on, you should understand how much money you have to spend every month or week, and to make a list of all of the things you are spending it on to have a better sense of where you can cut costs.


Finding ways to save money will make you more independent because you'll have more money to spend however you like.

, Sure, turning on your GPS or the map on your smartphone can help you get from one place to another. But what happens if your GPS suddenly malfunctions, your phone runs out of battery, or you're led to the top of a cliff? Will you follow it all the way down? Hopefully not. Before you go anywhere, make a mental map of where you have to go and print out physical directions to follow if you can. But better yet, know exactly where you're going so you'll feel less dependent on a device.


If you're taking a long trip, then sure, the GPS can be useful. But make sure that you have a strong sense of where you're going regardless, so you don't feel completely clueless.

, If you're truly independent, then you won't need a buddy to accomplish every little task or to do any fun activity. Don't wait around for a friend to be available to try that new restaurant in your town or to see that new movie at the theatre. Treat yourself and go it alone -- if you head to the movies, you'll be impressed by how many other people are enjoying a good film solo, too.


It's all in the attitude. If you look and feel like you're really comfortable doing these things on your own, then no one will think twice.

, Rome wasn't built in a day, and no one is completely independent. This isn't a hard-and-fast guide that you must stick to. If you don't want to do something, don't do it. This is here to tell you how to be independent, if you want to be.

Train yourself to hold back on sharing your thoughts all of the time, not because you're shy and meek, but because you're comfortable enough in your own skin. Talk when you know it's essential, but don't feel the need to speak every chance you get.


Culturally, we often mistake fast-talkers for smart-talkers, but pauses in conversation have a power all of their own. Allow for reflection and silence in conversations, letting what is said sink in. This will give weight to your words and a gravity to your presence. Sometimes it's not so much what you say as what you do not say that people will remember.;
, Enigmatic people are often unpredictable, suddenly voicing an opinion you might have thought counter to their opinions or presence in general. Don't follow the crowd. Instead, look for new ways of seeing and try to think creatively around topics. Ask questions instead of agreeing to avoid conflict.


If three people at a meeting have already spoken up for one way of solving a problem, play devil's advocate, even if you think they're probably right, or stay quiet. There's little sense in being another voice in the crowd, saying the same thing.
Ask lots of questions to make sure that decisions are the smartest possible. Clarify, specify, and interrogate all ideas to get to the heart of the matter.

, Small talk is by nature banal. We talk about the weather, work hassles, childcare, traffic snarls, the cost of living. Enigmatic people might prefer to have one-on-one conversations that go deeper. Learn to take creative turns in your conversational skills and head for the deeper waters of discourse.


If you find yourself at a party, confronted with a parade of dull getting-to-know-you talk, try to find one person who's willing to have a different sort of conversation and engage. Lead with an unusual question, or a probing follow-up. If someone mentions off-hand that they liked a movie, instead of agreeing, ask ""Why?""

, Be creative and say things that will make people sit up and take notice, instead of things that will fade into the background of conversations. If someone asks how you're doing, you could say, ""So-so"" and be forgotten in an instant. Or, you could say, ""I feel like a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs."" If someone asks how the baseball game turned out, you could say ""Terrible"" or you could say that it was ""Like slurping hot lead."" People will take notice.

, Spend time every day learning a few new words and practicing them in your conversations. Using precise and accurate diction in your everyday conversations will help you to stand out among the text-speak and the other chatter.

, Social networking has changed the way we relate to each other, stripping much of the mystery from ourselves. It can sometimes be hard to change people's perceptions of you because they've heard too much about who you think you are now. Don't box yourself in in conversations online or in person. Instead, be judicious with what you tell acquaintances and strangers about yourself, and be more generous with those closer to you.


Apart from those closest to you, there's no need to broadcast your whereabouts all the time, or your interests and tastes about every little thing. If someone asks where you're going, just evade it. ""I'll be around later.""
Remove the location information and updates from your social networking accounts such as Twitter and Facebook. Online, stop calling yourself a citizen of a particular nation. Strip as much personal information from your accounts as possible.

, Some people are open and trusting, appealing for the love of others almost instantly. Enigmatic people, on the other hand, exercise a great deal of discretion in whom they place that trust. Trust and respect are things to be earned with time and experience, not to be assumed. People should have to work to get close to you.


Spend time with people one-on-one, instead of in larger groups. Enigmatic traits are more difficult to tease out when you're in larger groups. Get to know people for who they are, not who they pretend to be in public settings.
If you want to be enigmatic, you also need to learn when it's okay to let people close enough to you. Enigmas aren't hermits. Even enigmatic people have people in their lives to trust and to lean upon. It just may be fewer than what we might think of as a cultural ideal.

, Enigmatic people can control their emotions and passions so that the front they present to the world appears composed, calm and unruffled. This isn't to say that you lack passion or emotion, but that you're in control of those emotions. Good or bad, be unflappable.


Enigmatic people don't need to be martyrs. if you have ongoing pain, physical or emotional, see your doctor. Stay healthy and you won't have to worry about masking it. Look after your body and health so that you can stay strong in any situation.

, Where does an enigmatic person come from? Parts unknown. Where is an enigmatic person going? Anywhere. Don't dwell in the past, or in dreams about the future. Instead, focus on living in the moment and being fully present in the here and now.Be spontaneous and willing to adjust to the situation and you'll be as enigmatic as the world around you.


If you're upset about a break-up, a loss in your family, or a failure of some kind, speak to a trusted friend confidentially, then move on. It's not something to talk about at work.

, Challenging yourself intellectually will keep you engaged in life and thereby interesting and enigmatic to others. Don't spend hours playing video games, spend hours reading books. Don't spend hours chatting online, spend hours writing poetry. Devote yourself to intellectual endeavors and surprise the world with your intellect.

, Enigmatic people may seem mysterious, but they're not mean spirited or thoughtless. Indeed, your strong presence should be reassuring when people know that you don't gossip or abandon your friends at the drop of a hat.


Listen when people speak. Practice close listening skills, really focusing in when someone else is talking. Too often, we like to wait for our turn to speak. Instead, be fully engaged in conversations. You'd be surprised how unusual this can be for some people.
Remember people's names and try to have a good memory for things other people say. Enigmatic people can seem aloof, so you'll be a surprising presence when you remember an acquaintance's birthday, or a specific story they tossed off once.

, Let out your inner weirdness by following an interest or hobby that is out of the ordinary and definitely something that arouses curiosity in others. Find something that gives you genuine pleasure for its unique qualities, not because it's a popular thing to do.


Start collecting rare coins or crystals, or start backpacking in the woods each weekend, identifying mushrooms. Take photographs. Learn Latin. Find an obsession and follow that obsession.

, wikiHow is the right place for aspiring enigmas. Do you know how to sew? How to change your engine oil? Tune a mandolin? How to install vinyl flooring? How to gut an elk? The more esoteric knowledge you have under your belt, the more capable and surprising you'll be when those skills come out of your head and into the world. Surprise people with your capabilities.



Learn a card trick and never perform it for anyone, just in case you're ever at a party and someone brings up the subject. You'll knock their socks off when you unveil a mind-blowing card trick all of a sudden.
try to get a part-time job, if you're young. Learning the way of the working world can help you develop more adult skills and real-world experience that can help you to stand out among your peers.

, Enigmatic people are voices of reason in otherwise chaotic worlds, known for their even temperament and carefully calculated ideas. That sometimes will come into conflict with dominant ways of thinking. Enigmas are people like Rosa Parks and like Batman. Enigmas don't ask for permission to do what they want, they rely on their own capabilities to move through the world and find their own path. Think of characters like Sherlock Holmes, Clint Eastwood, and Julia Child.


Look for enigmas all around you. Bob Dylan and Miles Davis might be enigmas on wikipedia, but so are your town's librarians, gravediggers, baristas, and street musicians. Look for quiet leadership all around you, not just what's coming from the television and the newspaper. Find other sorts of role models.

Know you'll bump heads.",How to Be Different," For starters, know that you're already different than everyone on the planet. Sure, some people are more different than others, but all of us have a unique set of experiences and characteristics that spell out a different reality than everyone else on Earth. No one else has the same brain you do, the same thoughts you do, and the same reactions as you do. You're different by just being human.


Labels are pretty useless. Even striving to be different isn't something that's truly achievable. A quick change of cultures will show you that people operate differently by default. Instead, accept that you're already unique and work with yourself. Who is you, anyway?;
, In order to be as different as possible, you have to be you -- not a carbon copy of someone else. If you don't know who you are, that process can seem a bit scary. In order to be yourself, you have to find yourself. Do you know what it is you like? What you are like? Who are you when no one else is around?


It's important to love yourself, too. If you're not comfortable with who you are, you'll inevitably end up trying to be someone else -- or at the very least being someone who you're not to please others.

, It's normal nowadays to be constantly bombarded with stimuli -- whether it's on a screen or the people around us. To really get down to who you are and what makes you different, spend some time alone. Disconnect from everything. What are you left with? Meditate on what matters to you.


We're constantly being told what to wear, what to eat, what to say, what to look like, how to act, what to read, what to watch...you get it. Get alone and all of a sudden you'll be without guidance. It'll be a strange feeling, sitting there, thinking about what you wouldn't miss if you never had to wear/eat/say/do/read/watch it again. Think about what aspects of your environment are shoved onto you and which ones you openly embrace.

, Be very careful that you actually want to be different. Maybe you're just in a group of friends that you don't jive with and that little voice in your head is just being misinterpreted. What does different actually mean to you?


What do you perceive as normal? What is it about people that strikes you as ""the same?"" Every person's interpretation of what ""different"" actual is is, well, different. Is it how they look? Act? Talk? Dream?

, Once you've pinpointed what ""different"" is to you, how do you want to go about it? If you're in a group of friends that only eats Swedish protein bars and wears pink on Wednesdays, how do you want to go off on your own? Do you want to become a math mastermind or do you just want to shake it up by wearing purple? You could be different in so many ways.

, A Japanese man that shakes hands instead of bowing will be different in his culture, but be pretty normal in the West. Reading Thoreau for fun will be commonplace in some circles, while ""normal"" is Cosmopolitan in others. In order to know how to be different, you have to take into account your environment. Think of three words to describe yours. Now, what's the opposite of that?


Let's go back to ""Mean Girls."" Three words to describe that environment? Superficial. Vain. And unsurprisingly, mean. Want to be different from the Plastics? You'd have to be a deep thinker, not into looks, and nice. However, being nice in other circles is totally normal (and expected). What's your circle like?

, Take a step back from your surroundings for a moment and just observe. How are people behaving? How do they interact with each other (friends, strangers, cashiers, lovers)? What assumptions do they all make? How are they dressed? If you were to walk in unexpectedly, how could you not fit into the mold?


There's definitely a spectrum of outrageousness here. Something so simple as wearing a bright color could set you out from the crowd in a Cafe on a dreary day.
You could make small changes to your behavior -- when the cashier at the cafe asks you what you'd like, instead you could reply, ""Hmm. Not sure. How was your day?""
You could go the wrong way -- be loud, throwing things, start dancing on tables -- that'd sure be different than normal public etiquette. But it'll probably get you thrown out.

, Straight up, you're going to enjoy some things that are trendy and some things that are not. That's fine! As long as you're doing what you enjoy, you'll have a combination that's probably unique to you. Maybe you love baking, jiujitsu, and thrift-shopping. If you enjoy it, it'll feel right.


It shouldn't matter what anyone else thinks or does. Do you want to sing a song from Jekyll & Hyde at karaoke in German? Awesome. Go for it. Do you want to buy that Abercrombie & Fitch bag? Well, if it would make you happy, sure. Just make sure it's not someone else telling you to do it!

, We are naturally raised as part of a group. Therefore, we're constantly being exposed to things that others around us have already approved. These things are good -- they can open us up to things we're not even aware of -- but it's also important to try things that are brand spankin' new to you that other people haven't already endorsed. How else will you find out what you like and do not like?

, From a very young age, we're sort of brainwashed to fit into our society. We wear clothes, eat with utensils, go to school, do things to match our gender, et cetera and so forth. It's hard to realize that this is a box you can get out of. There are lines that you can color outside of. It just hasn't occurred to most of us.


Think about how you would act if you were in a dinosaur costume. No one can see your face or body and you're in a dinosaur costume. All of a sudden you start bursting into rooms and waving your tiny arms and creeping up on people just because you can. You could do this in real life. You just choose not to. ...Why?

, As if the dinosaur example wasn't enough, instead of just coloring outside the lines, you don't even have to use your metaphorical crayons on the metaphorical paper. If you want to go around school wearing headphones and dancing like you're in a Selena Gomez music video, the thing is, you can. If you want to wear a hat shaped like the state of Texas and stand outside of Walmart all night long, if you can find one, you can. (Doesn't mean you should, but you definitely could.)


Some people are going to severely frown on the dinosaur costumes, the public dancing, and the weird-shaped hats. Know that you if do want to start pressing the limits and toeing the line, you'll most likely experience opposition. If you can handle the heat, go for it. But know that lots of people frown on what's ""abnormal.""

, This is a way to say act differently toward people than they expect. In a good way, of course! And see where it gets you -- who knows, the next time you have to deal with a cop, shake his hand, ask him about himself, and see if you get out of that ticket! You very well may.


One way to be certainly be different is to be friendly to everyone. How many people do you know that are friendly to literally everyone? Probably not many. It's hard work! We all end up judging those around us and gravitating toward certain types of people. Instead, be friendly toward those you may not feel inclined to be friendly toward. You'll be different and learn a lot!

, It's really easy to get caught up in what society tells us looks good and is attractive. While it's impossible to completely avoid that (without making the clothes yourself), use fashion like a cafeteria -- take what you want and leave the rest. Do you like a certain trend? Great. Would you rather be sporting a pair of rain boots from 1972 than a pair of Uggs? Awesome -- maybe your mom has some in her closet.

, It's hard to come up with a few examples that everyone does. You could say, for example, ""listen to unpopular music,"" but there are loads of people that do that. However, one thing that seems to be a pretty normal characteristic across the board is drama. We love it. If you want to be different, avoid it! Don't let it be a part of your life. And definitely don't start it!


Because of how interacting with people works, we all end up playing games a lot. A friend asks us if we're mad and we say no to keep things calm, even though we are. We do things to get attention, we lead people on, we employ tactics to get what we want, even if they're not the nicest. If you can recognize those urges, try to resist them. Being honest and genuine is a characteristic to be proud of and is more unique than it should be.

, One of the games people play is not saying what we mean. We're afraid of standing out, making noise, hurting someone's feelings, or just getting embarrassed. There will be times when an entire room is thinking something, but no one says it. The term ""elephant in the room"" exists for a reason! Be that person!


Most people are caught up in what they look like or the impression they give off to truly do what they really want. They're too wrapped up in thinking about others and not being themselves to really operate on a genuine level. If you catch yourself not doing something because others are present, do it anyway! (Within the law, of course!)

, If you haven't noticed, there's a pattern here of how others' opinions shouldn't really matter. Since most people are concerned with impressing others and how they're perceived, try not to do it. It's often when we're not trying to impress that we do the most impressing!


You know how they say love will come to you when you stop looking for it? It's sort of like that. Instead of presenting an image to the world, just present you. It's so much better and so much more unique.

, Nothing is really as it seems. So many people are trying to be different it results in them all being the same! Being quiet may mean that when you talk, people hear you louder. When you're not trying to attract that boy or girl, they become attracted to you. So trying to be different may not get you anywhere.


Dressing in a squirrel suit (or a dinosaur outfit) and walking into a bar, for example, isn't necessarily different. In a certain way it's saying, ""Look at me!"" just the same as a short skirt and high heels are. So the next time you're trying to be different, think about what you're actually doing. Is it the opposite?

, Society isn't super good at accepting what isn't trendy. People are praised for being fashionable and pretty -- few are praised for expanding our limits and coloring outside the lines. Those people may not welcome you with open arms. And that's fine! You don't need 'em. But you do need to know it's gonna happen. That way you'll be prepared for when it does.


Aristotle said, “To avoid criticism say nothing, do nothing, be nothing.”This is one thing he nailed. Criticism is going to happen if you step outside of the box at all. Think of it as a good thing! By getting criticism, you're doing something. You're getting noticed. You're exposing people to other things. Excellent! You're different.

Go for a nerdy dress or skirt.,
Try suspenders.,
Wear a t-shirt advertising a nerdy interest.,
Select appropriate footwear.,
Try a button up shirt with high waisted shorts.,
Go for bright colors and mismatched patterns.",How to Dress Like a Nerd as a Girl1," People often feel they cannot be feminine and nerdy. However, this is not true. Many nerd girls enjoy a nice dress or skirt that meshes well with the nerd style.Mini-dresses often look like something out of a superhero movie. If you feel comfortable with a shorter, more revealing dress, this can look great in a nerd costume. Bright colors often come off as somewhat quirky or nerdy, so don't hesitate to pick an outfit that draws attention to yourself.
A lot of nerds enjoy skirts as well. Colorful, pattern skirts can work well in a nerdy ensemble. Many nerd girls enjoy wearing frilly tutus, which are odd enough to fit with the offbeat nature of the nerdy aesthetic. You can also go for a plaid skirt, as this is reminiscent of a school girl uniform.;
, If you're wearing pants as part of your costume, suspenders can solidify the nerdy look. Purchase a pair of suspenders at a local clothing store, strap them onto your pants, and then hoist them over your shoulders.Brightly colored suspenders can help. Many people associate nerdiness with a somewhat messy style, so dramatically mismatched suspenders may help with the look. For example, you could wear pink suspenders over a red shirt.
Tighten the suspenders so they hoist your pants and shorts up high. This further contributes to the nerdy look.

, You can also try a simple t-shirt. Online, you can find t-shirts with printings on them from a variety of aspects of nerd culture. For example, get a t-shirt with a quote from Doctor Who. Opt for a t-shirt advertising a superhero. Get a Star Wars or Star Trek t-shirt. A simple t-shirt, when paired with other girlish clothing and accessories, can help you look like a nerd., You want to make sure your feet are also looking nerdy. There is no set type of footwear for nerd girls, but you have a variety of options depending on the rest of your look.If you're wearing a dress or skirt, gladiator-like boots with a large ankle can help. You can also go for something like Doc Martens. Such boots may remind people of superheroes like Wonder Woman.
Converse shoes are also popular in nerd culture. If you have an old pair of converse, this may also help as nerds are often seen as somewhat sloppy dressers.

, If you want to go for a somewhat tomboyish nerdy look, try wearing a large button shirt and high waisted shorts. If you're using suspenders, you can use these to pull the shorts up even further. This can create an awkward, nerdy look.It's a good idea to go for a loose-fitting shirt. This contributes to the somewhat messy, unflattering appearance one associates with nerd culture. Opt for a shirt a few sizes larger than what you regularly wear.

, You'll want to look somewhat haphazard if you're nerdy. Therefore, go for a variety of patterns and colors. It's a good idea to strive to clash a bit for the nerd look.


Choose brighter colors, like bright shades of primary colors. Feel free to do awkward matching combinations. For example, go for a purple button up shirt with orange shorts.
Patterns can also help, especially if you go for a variety of different types of patterns. Wear a polka dot t-shirt with a striped skirt, for example.

"
"
Wear a large pair of glasses.,
Carry books.,
Bring a tote bag.,
Have pens, paper, and a calculator sticking out a pocket on your shirt.,
Try wearing a bow-tie.",How to Dress Like a Nerd as a Girl2," If you want to be a nerd, glasses are key to solidify your look. You don't have to wear your own glasses. In fact, if you're going to a costume party, it's a good idea to wear contacts to prevent your glasses from being knocked off or broken. You can easily make a pair of fake nerd glasses with a cheap pair of sunglasses.Purchase a thick-rimmed pair of sunglasses from a local thrift store or gas station. The bigger they are, the nerdier they'll look. When you get home, pop out the lenses. You can wear these glasses to help with your nerdy look.
You can also put a piece of masking tape in the middle of the glasses. Broken glasses are one of the many stereotypes people have of nerds.

, Many nerds are prone to being bookworms. It can help to carry a variety of books with you to solidify the nerd look. Books can be an especially useful addition for a nerd costume at a party.


It can help to select different types of books by interest. For example, you can decide to be a literary nerd and carry around classics like the works of Jane Austin or Virginia Woolf. You can also decide to be a science nerd, and take books by Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking.
If books are too cumbersome to carry around, carry around a few comic books. Many nerds are interested in superheroes, so stop by a comic book shop and get a few books to carry around.

, If you're going to a party especially, a tote bag can help. You can carry your nerd accessories here and bust them out during certain points of the party.


A plain tote bag, made of leather or a similar material, can work here. It can be fairly simply to find.
However, you can go for something slightly more specific. A tote bag in the theme of a nerdy TV show can help with the nerd look. For example, a Doctor Who tote bag with an image of the TARDIS on it can really make you look nerdy.

, If you have pockets, fill them up with nerdy items. Have pens, pencils, and calculators pouring out of your pocket. This can help make you look bookish and nerdy., While bow-ties are generally thought of as a man's accessories, a good bow-tie can help with the nerd girl look. You can try a large, somewhat gaudy bow-tie with an odd pattern. A polkadot bow-tie, for example, can help you look extra nerdy.

"
Apply powder foundation to achieve a pale appearance.,
Try mismatched, brightly colored eye shadow.,
Use colorful eyeliner.,
Apply blush for a flushed look.,
Add freckles with a brown pencil.",How to Dress Like a Nerd as a Girl3," Many people feel nerds look pale, as they spend a lot of time indoors. Therefore, a pale complexion can really help with a nerd costume. Use a makeup brush to apply a heavy amount of light foundation. Choose a fairly pale tone and blend the foundation all over your face until you have an even, pale tone., From here, add eyeshadow. As nerds are often seen as mismatched, choose bright and unusual colors. A bright blue, green, or purple eyeshadow can work for a nerd costume. You can use your fingers or a makeup brush to apply eye shadow for your nerd costume.It's a good idea to apply a lighter shade of eyeshadow, or an eyeshadow primer, before applying your actual eyeshadow. This can make the bright colors show up even more.
If you mess up a bit, don't worry. Makeup that's somewhat smeared may actually help with the nerd look.

, Stores sell eyeliner in a variety of shades. Pick a fun, bright color instead of using black. You want your makeup to look nerdy and somewhat awkward. Eyeliner in shades like purple, pink, and blue works well. Apply a thin line of eyeliner just above your eyelashes, and another line just underneath your bottom lashes. You can also draw a line of eyeliner on your water line, as long as the makeup is safe for use this close to the eyes.It may be a good idea to pick a shade of eyeliner that clashes with your existing eyeshadow. For example, if you did green eyeshadow, go for a purple eyeliner.

, Another notion about nerds is that they're shy and easily embarrassed. If you want to develop a flushed look to help with your nerd costume, add a heavy layer of blush to your cheeks using a makeup brush., Freckles are thought of as somewhat awkward. Use a brown makeup pencil and dot a few freckles on each cheek. How many you want is up to you. Add enough that you feel you look adequately nerdy."

If you can't find a pair with thick rims, then any pair of reading glasses will do. Be sure that they are the right prescription, or are prescription-free if you don't wear glasses.;
, Checkers, plaid, and argyle are the triple threat when it comes to ""geeky"" or ""school-nerd"" style. Try to find a sweater, vest, skirt, or dress in one of these prints.


You can also try striped and polka dotted patterns. Try mix-and-matching a few different prints. The more they clash with one another, the better!

Wear suspenders. Try to find a standout color or pattern like red, purple, neon green, checkers or rainbow.
Wear either a standard tie or a bow tie with your collared shirt. Again, you can keep the color scheme simple for a more reserved look, or choose funky patterns and textures if you want to channel the 90s nerd style.
Choose the right socks. If you are wearing a dress, try white knee-high or thigh-high socks; for pants and shorts, try a pair of dress socks in white or argyle. Whatever type of sock you choose, make sure to pull them up so that they are visible!

There are plenty of other ways to dress like a cool nerd without compromising your comfort.Jeans, T-shirts, hoodies, sweaters, loose skirts and dresses, and flat shoes count as comfortable clothing.;
, Argyle, plaid, and pinstripes are nerdy staples. Try polka dots for a quirkier look. You can wear these patterns on your shirts, sweaters jackets, or even on your pants. Look at vintage shops and stores that sell conservative clothing, like J.Crew to find these patterns.Try wearing an Argyle sweater or a skirt with polka dots on it.
Flannel plaid shirts also work well.

, Consider T-shirts or other clothing items with video game characters, superheroes, science fiction themes, comic prints, and other media motifs. Choose clothing items with interests that you at least know something about so that it can be a topic of conversation if someone brings it up.You can buy this clothing at stores like Target, Hot Topic, and online.
For example, if you like Star Wars, look for hoodies and/or T-shirts with your favorite characters on them.

, Wear a long or short-sleeved button-down shirt. Especially look for shirts with collars. You can wear it in a solid color or with a pattern. You can wear these on their own, or under a sweater. For a casual look, wear a button-up under a favorite “nerdy” T-shirt. To appear dressier, add a simple tie and keep the shirt buttoned up all the way.If you don’t already own a button-down shirt, one can be purchased from most department stores.

, A simple crew or V-neck sweater is a staple of nerdy style. It can be styled to look casual, like with jeans, or dressed up, like with dress pants or a skirt. If you don’t like sweaters, hoodies are another popular option for nerdy style. You can wear a fitted zip hoodie over a button-down and skinny pants.If you don’t like plain sweaters, you can find sweaters with “nerdy” themes, like Star Wars.
Look for a basic cotton hoodie in the color of your choice.

, In recent years, brightly colored pants have become a staple of cool nerdy style. Skinny jeans are popular, but you can wear any fit of pants that are comfortable for you. You can choose bright colors like lime green, yellow, red, or blue. Or, if you prefer muted tones, you can choose maroon, brown, or navy blue pants. Pleated or plaid skirts are also classic nerd staples that can be styled in a variety of ways.If you’re not into brightly colored pants, khakis are a classic alternative.
You can find eye-catching pants at stores like Hot Topic and American Apparel.

, Try loafers or Chuck Taylor All Stars. Loafers work better with dressier outfits. Chuck Taylor All Star’s are usually more casual, but you can wear them with dress pants or a dress if you want to. Mary Jane’s, ballerina flats, and any type of sneakers also work.Heels that are too high will hurt your feet long-term. Stick with kitten heels or platforms if you want to wear heels.
Leather sandals work well for a summery look.

, Suspenders are a staple of nerdy style. You don’t have to wear them to pull up your pants. They can be worn purely for style. Choose a plain, brightly colored, or patterned pair of suspenders. Wear them over a T-shirt, like your favorite superhero shirt, or wear them with a button-down. You can pair the suspenders with dress pants, jeans, or a skirt., If you’re wearing a skirt or shorts, try wearing knee socks or leg warmers with them. Knee socks can be worn during any season because you can wear a thicker or thinner pair. Leg warmers are better suited for colder weather, and they can be paired with tights.If you’re having trouble finding legwarmers, go to your local dance store to purchase a pair.
Try wearing themed knee socks, like Dr. Who or Harry Potter, with a pleated skirt or long shorts.

, A beanie can work with almost any type of outfit you wear, even if it’s a dressier outfit. A plainly colored, brightly colored, or even a beanie featuring one of your favorite, nerdy interests will work. If you don’t like beanies, try an Eskimo hat, or any other type of hat that you like is okay to wear.You can even make a top hat work for you.

, Glasses are yet another nerd staple. You should only wear prescription glasses, however, if you need them and they have been prescribed to you by a qualified optometrist. If you still want to wear glasses, but don’t need them, you can wear glasses that don’t have a prescription. Thick-rimmed, Ray-Bans, cat-eye, and half-frame glasses are popular nerdy choices.Choose glasses that can be worn with a variety of outfits.

, Pick a neutral color like brown or black so that it matches everything. Or, you can choose a messenger back that reflects your interests. If you can’t find a messenger bag that reflects your interests, you can always sew a patch onto the bag. This completes your nerdy look, and can fit a book and/or laptop easily.Pack lightly, and switch shoulders every once and a while. Hurting your back is definitely not cool.

, Two ponytails with thin scrunchies is a classic nerd look. You can wear mismatched scrunchies if you want to. Ponytails, headbands, braids, and barrettes also work. If you don’t want to wear accessories in your hair, you can put your hair up in a simple bun.For shorter hair, consider slicking it back with gel.

, If you want to pull of the cool nerdy style, be consistent with it. Dress the part on a daily basis. This may mean purchasing some new clothing, or planning your outfits ahead of time. If you can’t purchase new clothing, choose an accessory, like glasses or a messenger bag, and wear it often.You can find clothes at an affordable price in thrift shops.

, Nerds are known for being passionate about what they love. Don’t be afraid to show off your passion for your interests, no matter what it is. Talk about it to your friends. If your interest has accessories and apparel, put it on your clothing, school supplies, or other accessories, like purses. Showing off your knowledge is cool.If you don’t have a passion that you know a lot about, think of what you already like and make an effort to learn more about it.

, If you live in or near a city, consider attending a convention. Some popular and nerdy conventions are Comic-Con, Dragon Con, and anime conventions. You can meet people that share your interests at these conventions and get inspiration for style and/or interests. Conventions are also a great place to buy apparel that you can show off on a daily basis.There are conventions for almost any interest you can think of. Check online to see if there is a convention dedicated to your passion in a city near you.
Conventions can be costly. Start saving up well before tickets go on sale.

, Having books not only emphasizes your nerdiness, but it also lets you expand your knowledge in your free time. Always have a book or comic book on hand to read, whether you're on the bus or waiting for class to begin. Be careful if you're going to read while you walk. People will get upset if you bump into them."

Cater your geekdom to your specific interests.There is no such thing as a typical geek.,
Subscribe to a specialty magazine or journal.,
Develop your skill with computers.No matter what your other interests are, virtually all geeks are united by a common interest in computers and technology.,
Stay up to date with technology.Even if technology isn't your forte, it doesn't hurt for a self-respecting geek to stay up to date on the hottest trends in tech.,
Pick up bits of sci-fi and nerd trivia.Shortly after computers, geeks are most associated with their obsessive knowledge and passion for science-fiction and fantasy.,
Rebel against the establishment.Ultimately, a true-to-form geek may appear meek on the outside, but he should have no qualms with shaking up the order and rebelling against the status quo.,
Embrace ""geek chic"".Since geek culture has become popular and accepted as fashionable, there are fashion outlets that cater specifically to it.,
Wear ironic humour t-shirts.Your clothing should offer some indication of the person you are and what you value most in life.,
Consider donning glasses.For ages, glasses have been seen as the go-to symbol for geeks and nerds alike.,
Show confidence as a geek.Above all else, geeks are an attractive bunch because they simply don't care about what the rest of society makes of them.,
Accept that geeks are social creatures.If there's one major difference between geeks and nerds, it's that geeks like to celebrate their niche-interest passions with likeminded folk.,
Join web forums.,
Attend conventions.Conventions are like big parties for geeks.,
Game together.Gaming is a widespread phenomenon these days, but it used to be privy to geeks and nerds alone.,
Consider the risk of alienation.",How to Become a Geek," There are geeks of all different interests, from all walks of life. Are you passionate about computers? Congrats, you're a computer geek. What about math, or music, or architecture, or history? Technology-oriented interests may be favoured in geek culture, but the fact remains that you can fit the identity to match your own however you want.;
, Nuts & Volts, PC World, Mac World, and Cinefex all fall under this category. Read from cover to cover and in each issue, pick out at least three words you've never heard of before. Memorize these and try to use them often. You'll find you learn more if you actively take notes during your pleasure reading, and learning words will help you big time when you're discussing matters with your fellow geeks.

, Even if you consider yourself a klutz when it comes to computers, being a geek comes with the expectation you should at least be able to work your way around a PC, Mac (or Linux!) relatively comfortably. Magazines like PC World will get you learning fast. Your local community college may offer night courses in computers as well, which would be a good idea if you're planning on taking being a geek seriously.


While all kinds of technology are considered important to the geek culture, computers earn special credit. True geeks will go out of their way to learn the ins and outs of using a PC. Don't hesitate to try out different browsers, media players and play around with coding.Many self-proclaimed geeks are computer programmers by trade.Computer wizardry is by no means a requirement to be a geek.

, If people know you're a geek, chances are they're going to approach you asking for technology advice at one point or another. Even if you're not a master at apps and computers, knowing more than the basics will take you far in your geekdom. Look at magazines for the latest tech and check online electronics publications for reviews and specs.

, Whether you're talking about video games, films, TV or books, geeks are all over anything that speculates about far-distant lands and strange new worlds. If you have any interest in being a geek, it's possible and even likely that you already have an interest in some of these franchises. Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings and Doctor Who are a few of the most important. Dive into this media and read up about them online for trivia. Trivia can come in handy when you're hanging out and want to impress friends with your knowledge.


A true geek will hold his own tastes as more important than any social expectation. If you like sci-fi and fantasy you'll fit right into geek culture, but even if your tastes lie elsewhere, there's so much diversity that you'll always found other people with likeminded interests.
Traditional geek interests include Dungeons and Dragons, science-fiction, fantasy, comic books, video games and computers. Less common interests include board games, history, antiques or conspiracy theories. The list goes on. Some things are more common amongst geeks, but nothing is prohibited, so long as it doesn't hurt anybody else.
Anime is a very popular subject for geeks as well, and attracts its own specific kind of geek.

, Geeks are outsiders by definition. They are more passionate about their interests than what is normally seen as fashionable, and their interests themselves are very nichey. Being a geek, you shouldn't let yourself embrace certain values simply because you think you're expected to by society. Part of the fun of being a geek is knowing that you stand apart from the mainstream.

, This doesn't just include clothing, but gadgets and home decorations as well. Geek chic is a fashion style that references geeky interests (like science fiction) in otherwise fashionable clothing styles. Bolster your wardrobe with some of these clothes. You'll still look fashionable to the mainstream, but the people who get the references will be able to see you as a fellow geek.


""Geek chic"" options can be found in cosmetics as well.Certain brands of makeup will be coloured or themed after a pop culture reference, like Star Trek eyeliner for example. There's not a lot of difference between that and regular cosmetics, but purchasing something that's based on your favourite sci-fi or fantasy franchise can be a bit of extra fun.

, There are tons of cute t-shirts you can buy online that have tongue-in-cheek references to pop culture. Star Wars and Doctor Who shirts are very common in particular. Wearing a shirt like this is a casual clothing choice that will fit you right in with the rest of the geeks. While the majority of people you cross paths with won't get the reference, fellow geeks almost certainly will. Recognizing a fellow fan can lead to great new friendships.

, Whether you wear glasses or not, wearing them carries the association of being more intelligent than the average person. Although it's not recommended you wear glasses if you don't have a proper use for them, trading your contact lenses back for glasses can be a smart move if you're embracing your geeky side.


Non-prescription glasses can be worn by would-be geeks without a need for them. If you really want to complete the typical geek look, you might think about adding a pair of clear glasses to your wardrobe. This is not recommended however, as geeks with legitimate prescriptions may be offended by the fashion choice.

, They love what they love. They are who they are. In order to be a true geek yourself, you need to embrace this mentality as well. Take full confidence in who you are, and reflect upon all the things that make you worthwhile.

, Keep in mind that geeks are social creatures by design and definition. Even if you're incredibly introverted, you can stand to gain a lot by talking to other people and sharing the things that make you tick.



Overcoming shyness isn't easily done. Luckily with a common interest ready to talk about, it's a lot easier to break the ice. If you feel timid at first when talking to someone new, remember that they have at least one thing in common with you. If need be, you can just talk about that the entire time. Most geeks won't complain about discussing their interests one bit.

, Part of the reason geeks have become so cool is the rise of the internet. Now, no matter how specific and obscure your interests are, you can meet likeminded people at the touch of a button. Joining web forums is invaluable when you want to meet friends locally or from abroad. Join multiple forums based on each your interests and comment on threads you think look interesting. You'll start meeting a lot of people really quickly this way.


Social media outlets like Facebook have in-site groups that you can join for the same purpose.
Keep in mind that talking over the internet is no replacement for in-person socializing. With any luck, you can meet people locally using the internet.

, Whether the convention is for anime, science fiction, comic books, video games, or computers, attending one of these events is sure to be a memorable experience. Although you'll only stand to get a lot out of going if you have a vested interest in the subject at hand, they're a great opportunity to meet people who are into the same kind of stuff you are.

, Nonetheless, video and computer gaming remains a tried-and-tested favourite amongst geeks. If you have any geek friends who might be interested in playing a game with you, set something up and play. It's a good idea to have live microphones working; that way you can talk to your friends while you're playing together.


MMORPGS (massively multiplayer online role playing games) are perfect for the would-be geek, as it's an opportunity to immerse yourself in a passion and share the experience with others., Although you might get closer to people with the same interests through geekdom, you'll probably end up alienating yourself from the mainstream of society. Even if you're totally functional in society, there are going to be people from the mainstream that will judge anyone who shows an unfashionable interest in something unfashionable. Fortunately, you're not alone. There are lots of other geeks out there to band together with. You can look to them if the loneliness ever starts to get to you.


Being a geek is arguably more difficult if you're a woman. There are some men in the subculture that will take exception to women trying to join in. Don't let yourself be riled by these individuals, and know that they are the exception to the rule.Most geeks would be all too happy to have you as a friend.

You may be most comfortable with a preppier look, dressing in a button down and layering a cardigan over top.However, a clean-cut graphic tee with a pair of khakis will give your look a more casual, edgier appearance.Graphic tees are a great way to represent the parts of nerd culture you love best. You may have one that features a math or science theme, a Doctor Who design, or even a Star Wars character.
Cardigans are a versatile over-garment that'll give your nerdy look a dapper appeal. This article of clothing is a cozy substitute for hoodies, which may come across as overly casual.
Button down shirts are a popular option in nerd chic fashion, especially when paired with a cardigan or trendy sweater. Patterned fabrics, like checks or stripes, will make your shirt stand out even when layered beneath a cardigan.;
, A pair of dressier pants will be usually compliment your nerd chic style. Khakis will often be enough to set your look apart from the everyday, but you can add a slightly more formal touch with chinos.A nice pair of jeans can work with this style as well, though you'll want to be sure the other elements of your outfit are more formal to offset the casualness of the jeans. Fitted jeans are a good option, as these will match with the clean-cut vibe that is iconic among nerds.
Slim, straight-legged Levis are timeless, go-to jeans that flatter many men and match nearly everything. Bootcuts and calf-hugging skinny jeans can look excessively trendy.

, For the style of your shoes to fit the nerd chic look, you'll have to abandon your sneakers for a less casual option. Oxford shoes, brogues, or shoes of a similar design to these are well suited for nerd chic outfits.Be sure that your shoes match your choice of pants or are similar tones, otherwise your outfit might not match well.Try to avoid black shoes and brown pants or brown shoes and black pants. Though there are some exceptions, generally these colors contrast too sharply to match well.
Brown shoes are very versatile, and match with most colors aside from black. If you are struggling with choosing the right shoe color for your nerd chic outfit, brown shoes are a safe bet.
Black shoes work best in a formal setting. You'll find that dark tones, especially gray and blue, pair well with black shoes. Lighter colors, like mustard, burgundy, and tan, can create an unpleasantly sharp contrast. This can be lessened by cuffing your pants to reveal a small amount of ankle., You don't have to have poor vision to wear a pair of stylish frames! You can buy glasses with non-prescription lenses at your local eye boutique or eyeglass store.More economic choices are also available online for the cost conscious nerd. Of course, if you already wear glasses, you probably already have this accessory as a part of your wardrobe.


When selecting a pair of frames, you should try to choose a pair that compliment the shape of your face and highlight your eyes. As each person's head is different, you'll have to try on pairs until you find out what looks best on you!
A thick framed pair of Buddy Holly-esque glasses can add an air of goofy innocence to your getup. Your lenses should be an expression of your inner nerd.
You should be careful when buying frames online. Although the cost of these is usually very competitive, without a try on first, you may find the pair uncomfortable or unflattering when they finally arrive., Bow ties have taken off in popularity thanks to characters like The Doctor, hero of nerd culture's adored TV series, Doctor Who.But if you're uncomfortable with a bow tie, a tie repping your favorite aspect of nerd culture, like a 20-sided die from Dungeons and Dragons, can further nerdify your ensemble.You may want to save your tie for collared shirts and avoid wearing one with a graphic tee. The lack of a substantial collar in tees can make your tie look out of place, causing it to clash.

, The nylon commonly used in the backpacks and satchels of your late high school days can come across as childish, losing you nerd points in the style game.You can improve your choice of backpack/satchel with a canvas or leather bag. Look for rich, luxurious colors and materials, like brass clasps and oxblood colored leather.These sorts of accessories frequently remind people of the kinds of bags used by professors and academics. This will only add to your air of nerdiness.

, This is not a necessity, but if you're a person who likes to have a watch on hand, a timepiece can be a classy alternative to checking your phone every five minutes. You should opt for a simple, elegant timepiece. One that is too flashy might seem more preppy than nerdy.


You may want a more retro look, in which case a large, multi-function plastic watch will do nicely. These have the added benefit of being relatively cheap and coming in many colors.
For nerds with an appreciation for class, a pocket watch can be a posh addition to your nerdy attire. What's more, many of these come in designs popular to nerd culture, like watches featuring styles from Doctor Who, Fullmetal Alchemist, or even mathematic formulas., You don't want to go overboard with pins and buttons, as this can give the impression of immaturity. However, you can proudly wear one or two of your favorites on your backpack, satchel, or shirt as a badge representing your nerd culture.A lapel pin can be a simple way of identifying yourself with nerd culture. These also make an excellent conversation piece, giving you an opportunity to share a little bit about your nerdier interests.

, Though this isn't necessary for dressing up in the nerd chic style, being able to easily use a computer will give others the impression that you're a dyed-in-the-wool nerd. You don't have to be a master programmer or software engineer, but a basic understanding of common programs and interfaces, like Windows and Apple, would surely help your nerdy appeal.


You might also want to learn how to type. This way you don't ruin your nerd chic image by having to hen-peck letters from the keyboard while typing., This is especially true of gadgets that are common in your areas of interest. For example, if you claimed to be a math nerd but couldn't use a graphing calculator, people may question whether or not you're really a nerd at all.Some people may feel as though they're being deceived if they find that you appear to be something that you're not. In this case, you may want to address this by saying, ""You're right, I'm not a nerd - I'm just a fan of nerd style!""

, Your hard selected and well-chosen nerd outfit could fall apart like a house of cards if those smart glasses you've chosen aren't backed up by substance.

Recognize that nerds are cool.,
Own your oddities.,
Don't conceal your hobbies.,
Be able to make fun of yourself.,
Spend time with your talents.,
Dress well.,
Don't worry too much about what others think.",How to Have a Good Experience As a Nerd1," Your quirks are part of what makes you awesome. Remind yourself about what your good traits are: maybe you're good at science, you work hard at school, and you're a fantastic listener when people need you. It isn't arrogant to think positive thoughts about yourself—give it a try!;
, Being authentic will help you feel good about yourself. People are more likely to respect you when they see you respecting and accepting yourself. Tell yourself that you are going to rock your nerd status.

, If it comes up in conversation that yes, you know the name of episode 23 of Star Trek TNG, or that all the fabric and supplies you're carrying are for your next cosplay/LARP outfit... fine. People may think these things are a bit odd, but not nearly as much as they will if you start stammering excuses.

, Having the self-awareness and confidence to laugh about your nerdiness helps diffuse uncomfortable situations. Acknowledging that you're a little odd, instead of trying to hide it, can help make people feel more comfortable around you.

, Your interests and skills are important, and they are certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's okay to spend a Friday night playing with parametric curves or watching Star Trek. Time for yourself is time well spent.

, Your style might be preppy, indie, hipster, geeky, or something else—what is important is that it's something that you like. Take good care of your personal hygiene and stand up a little straighter. Then give yourself a smile in the mirror. You'll look (and feel!) better than before.

, You're living your life for you, not for other people's opinions of you. Relax a little. Nobody is thinking as deeply about you as you are.

Deflect bullies if they target you.,
Don't insult them back.,
Talk to someone after the incident.,
Be a nice person yourself.",How to Have a Good Experience As a Nerd2," Mean people are the worst, and it can be hard hearing their cruel comments. It helps to have a strategy chosen beforehand, so you can feel prepared when they come at you. Here are some things to try to frustrate a bully.



Confusing kindness: Act like you've just been complimented; smile and say ""thank you!"" when they say mean things. Give them a kind word like ""I like your shirt today.""

Broken record: Prepare a script like ""Now's not a good time to talk"" or ""I'm okay, you're mean."" Keep repeating it each time a bully needles you.

Noisy room: Pretend not to hear them. Keep saying ""I'm sorry, I can't hear you"" and ""Could you say that again?"" Reference the noise level in the room for added effect.

, Fight the urge to snap back at them; instead, take a deep breath and pause before responding. The bully might think that you're backing down, and they will de-escalate and realize they aren't getting a rise out of you like they wanted. (If they get bored and leave, you won.)


Hurling insults right back will only escalate the situation. They will get worse, and you might even get in trouble for it.

, Try someone you trust: a family member, a friend, a mentor, or anyone who is a good listener. They can support you and help you work out a plan to deal with it.


It's often a good idea to tell an authority figure. This isn't tattling—this is getting help with a serious situation. You have the right to go to school, work, etc. without getting picked on.

, Haters attract haters, so be kind to people who are different than you. A nerd might be intellectual, but that doesn't mean looking down on others who have different passions or a lower IQ.


Kindness is more important than brains. Treat everyone as an equal, whether they are brilliant or intellectually disabled or somewhere in between.
Recognize that it's okay to have non-intellectual interests, like sports and makeup. People who like these aren't lesser, just different.
Encourage fellow nerds. This includes the newbies who can't recite obscure facts or solve quadratic equations in their head. Show them that it was a good idea to join the nerd community.

"
"
Realize that many people are into one aspect of nerdiness or another.,
Be good to everyone.,
Try getting a nerdy partner (if you're looking for one).,
Make friends with other nerds; that way you can share your passions with them.",How to Have a Good Experience As a Nerd3," That jock sitting at the back of the room might enjoy Star Wars, lots of people are into the more mainstream anime, and pretty much all people play video games these days.

, Life becomes easier when you are kind. Cultivate compassion towards others, and they will be kind in return. Try doing random acts of kindness, becoming a good listener, and validating people's feelings. You will gain friends, and acquaintances will smile when they think of you.


Bullies do exist, and even when you are nice, it is still possible they will target you. However, people will remember you're a good person, and they're a lot more likely to help you out.

, Nerds often find love with other nerds, because it is easier to relate to each other. If you both feel shy and awkward, it's not as much of a worry, and soon that feeling will disappear as you debate Trek vs. Wars.


Try looking for bookish people near the fringes of social areas. Quiet people might have a lot to say once you get to know them.

, It can sometimes be hard for nerds to make friends, but if you push yourself a bit to be social, and go to the right places, it can happen easily. There are lots of clubs and societies devoted to people with nerdy interests, especially once you get to college or university. Look for both in-person and online friends.


If you're into tabletop gaming, ask people at a local store if they know of any groups.
Get involved with some nerd forums and fan groups online.
Try out some different channels on IRC.
Look for geek websites like Soul Geek and OtakuBooty.

Fall in love.","How to Be Dangerous, Unpredictable and Mysterious"," Get the dark and edgy look.


Wear clothes that look good on you and are comfortable. Get inspiration from Avril Lavigne's and Little Mix's clothes. Look for denim, shorts and crop tops.
Wear dark make-up (if it suits you).;
, When it comes to doing stuff that scares you, just be brave and do it. Everyone gets scared but the reason we have fears is so that we can get over them. The trick is to count to three and then just do it.


Never admit to anyone that you are scared.

, Don't let people tell you what to do. This is your life. Don't let others control it and if you don't like something, then change it.


If you want to do something then do it. You don't have to follow other people, you can be the leader. If you have an opinion about something, then say it.

, If someone says ""that's crazy"" then you should do it, even if it is crazy. For example, do crazy dares, play weird games, have some fun, etc.

, If someone wants to know something about you, keep it a secret for a little while. Don't tell everyone what you're doing. Don't let everyone know how you feel.

, Do not let anyone read it! Write about how you feel, what you're doing, write about other people.


Write a diary 'for someone'. Write a diary telling them all your secrets and emotions. Don't tell them it's for them, but 'accidentally' leave it where they will find it.

,, Gossiping makes you seem like 'all the other girls'. It will make you seem shallow and bragging makes you seem self-absorbed. Be a good listener and hear what other people are saying.

, Practice smiling while looking in the mirror. Make your smile seem like you're hiding something or make it seem that you know something that they don't.

, If you're walking home from the shops with your friends, tell them that you want to go to the library or something. If you're getting lunch with your friends then don't order what you always do. The trick is to surprise the people around you.

, Don't turn into 'the hulk' when you're angry. If you are angry at someone, then cross your arms and don't talk to them. The only thing worse than shouting at a person is not talking to them at all.

, Let yourself fall in love. Go out with guys who are not ""your type"". If you don't usually go out on dates, then go out with a few guys. Refuse to commit to any guy though; just say that you're happy having fun.


Don't go out with the whole school!

Analyze the situation.,
Learn to listen.,

Disregard what some idiots think about you.,

Dress cool!,
Be an easy to talk to person.",How to Be Smart and Cool at the Same Time," How nerdy are you? Are you a nerd at all? We're not talking about how smart you are. You need to figure out how people perceive you, for the most part. Slightly dorky, but mostly cool? A normal kid with a geeky side? A total social outcast? Someone you wouldn't expect to have good grades? Don't let what you find out in this step get you down or make you arrogant. Others' opinion of you isn't the end of the world. We are just using it as a tool for your personal development. Besides, you're not really ""nerdy."" You're just smart and you happen to be capable of forming interests without the validation of the mainstream.;
, Sometimes you might not notice that you are talking and think that people are actually interested but they are annoyed or bored. If you can't think of anything to say ask a question that is not too lame. Most people like to talk about themselves. It's good to be talkative and able to hold up a conversation, but make sure to let the other person or people speak - really listen when they are talking. Practice your speaking skills with people you feel comfortable with, like a sibling or neighbor.

, If someone asks what you like to do for fun, don't lie. Just answer honestly (no matter how geeky the answer is). But do not go into much detail. For example, if you like to make web-pages, don't say ""I make the best web-pages without even using any programs. I make them with NotePad because I memorized HTML and I'm fluent in JavaScript, and I hate how the WYSIWYG editors force you to conform (conformity is so mainstream) and to relax I like to play MMORPGS, Warcraft on the Dalaran server, to be specific, blah-blah-blah."" Just say, ""I like to use the computer and play videogames."" If they ask you specifically, say ""I make websites"", or ""I like to play Warcraft"". Don't go into details, unless you're asked, because most people don't care. They're just making conversation (something you'll soon be doing). If you play a sport or do something else in your free time, like go shopping, go to the beach, watch movies or eat at your favorite restaurant, you might want to mention that too, in order to downplay your ""nerdy"" hobbies. Make sure you ask them what they like to do, as most people are quite happy to talk about themselves.

, For example, do not care about your post count on any forum. Or don't care about your page views. The point of forums/communities are to share thoughts, ask questions and discuss topics, not have 65,405 posts and 485 topics with 6,584 replies. Life is too short to freak out about stuff like that. Go outside and get some fresh air or learn to play an instrument instead of wasting your time with that. And if it really is that important to you, you probably don't want to mention that to most people.

, Do not try to say that you are better than someone through bragging. You think you're being cool, but bragging is annoying, and that makes you annoying. Don't be a know-it-all who always corrects people's grammar and ideas either.

, For example, care more about knowledge than your grades. Fail rather than cheat. Have some integrity and class!

, Don't even respond if someone insults you (unless you want to look up some snippy comebacks). You know that you're cool. Don't lower your mentality to theirs! If they keep bothering you, you can walk away, or use one of those snippy comebacks and then walk away.

, Nothing screams ""NERD!"" like gunky teeth, greasy hair and too-small clothes. It is kind of sad that people place so much importance on looks, but it is the truth. For right now, it's best to just stay healthy and clean for wellness's sake. Shower daily, brush your teeth, floss, wear deodorant/antiperspirant and brush your hair. You might want to save up for money to buy new clothes if you are sick of people making fun of yours. You don't have to buy exactly what the ""popular"" kids wear, but something stylish and flattering works fine. Ask a friend if you need help. If you have glasses that you think detract from your appearance a lot, you can always try contacts. If you can't wear contacts for some reason (sensitive corneas, for instance), don't worry about it. Plenty of really cool and smart people wear glasses. And don't worry about people thinking braces are dorky. See all those perfectly straight teeth on the movie stars? Most of those have had to deal with years of orthodontic treatment.

, Do you have a mighty brain but weak and uncoordinated muscles? Build up your strength and stamina through sports or other daily physical activities. Studies show that daily exercise improves your brain and your mood.

, You can be a nerd in the inside just don't show it! Wear cool stuff out side! But be smart!

, People like to be able to talk to someone smart without having to feel stupid. If someones asks you something really simple to you like, ""What is pi?"" don't say ""I'm not telling"". You'll just become a total jerk and super uncool. Say something like ""Here, I'll show you"" and when you've explained it in an easy form, say, ""It seems hard but it's really not"" and when they thank you say ""Any time!"" This makes you a likeable person that can help people a gain new perspective. And if people start taking advantage of you, all the better! You could show the fact that you're a self-reliant kid, and you can stick up for your self by saying something like, ""I'm here to help you, not to baby you"".

Preps dress in a very modest, clean-cut way. They always look presentable, and their style isn't ""Sexy"" or ""Hot"". When looking for clothes, look for cute, well-fitting, and well-made items.;
, If you are thinking about purchasing something, always ask yourself the below questions. If you answer no to any of these questions, the piece is either not preppy or not right for you.


Does this fit me right?
Does it have a modest cut?
Do I have other clothes that match it?
When will I wear this?
Is it an okay price for me?

, Preppy girls care about brands, it's all part of the effect and the style. Some popular preppy stores would include: Vineyard Vines, Ralph Lauren, Tory Burch, Lacoste, Lilly Pulitzer, Tommy Hilfiger, and J. Crew. These are only some of the biggest names out there for preppy clothing, but it's easy to find preppy items at stores such as Target, Old Navy, and T.J. Maxx.


Additional popular preppy brands: Southern Tide, Southern Marsh, Kate Spade,Hunter, Jack Rogers, Kendra Scott, Simply Southern, Krass and Co., Ann Taylor Loft and Jadelynn Brooke.

, Preps love to mix and match clothes. Before you go and buy a ton of bold statement items it's a good idea to stock up on some staples. Preppy clothes rely on standard items that never go out of style and are endlessly classic. Preppy clothes would include:


Plain colored t-shirts: T-shirts from preppy brands (Vineyard Vines, Southern Tide, Simply Southern, etc.)
Striped shirts
Solid belts
Plain dark-wash skinny jeans
Solid colored blouses
Basic-color formal dress
Corduroys, khakis and skinny jeans
Plain colored polo shirts: Polos and cardigans (stay away from polos that are too long/tight though; also stay away from polos in weird colors, patterns, or fits. Basic colors are safest.)
Oxfords
Chinos: Solid color chino shorts (any color is fine, but start with the basics- khaki, navy, white)
Khakis (make sure they fit properly).

, These include:


Sandals
Riding boots
Boat shoes/Topsiders (Sperry Topsiders are most well-known, which means more recognizable for preppiness).
Basic ballet flats: Tory Burch, Ralph Lauren, or Chanel recommended. It must be brand-named. Nothing trashy, ugly or one-season shoes.

, Navy is best for all clothes, and recommended. Pair with white, pastels or conservative blues, greens and yellows.

, Once you have all the staples, it's time to have some fun. Some ideas for additional clothes include:


Patterned/bright colored chino shorts
Lilly Pulitzer printed items
Printed shirts, skirts, and dresses
Colorful sandals/tennis shoes
Shiny Statement necklaces, bracelets, and earrings
Colored sweaters, jackets, and cardigans.

, Below are some examples of preppy outfits that you can try out:


Semi-formal dinner out (summer): Lilly Pulitzer skirt, solid shirt (color matches skirt), Bright statement necklace, Jack Rogers sandals
School (winter): Red and white striped sweater, light chambray shirt under sweater, dark-wash skinny jeans, brown leather riding boots, ruffled socks peeking out of boots.
School (spring, warm weather): Floral chino shorts, matching colored polo tucked in, brown belt, Sperry's.
Casual spring/summer day: Short sleeve preppy t-shirt, white chino shorts, matching color Converse, statement headband
Casual fall/winter day: Long sleeve preppy t-shirt, dark wash skinny jeans, matching color hunter boots, cute head wrap, Northface jacket

, A good way to get style ideas is to go onto a social media (YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.) and search something along the lines of ""prep"", ""preppy"", or ""preppy style"". You can also just google it and see what comes up. There are a lot of bloggers who share their preppy lifestyle on the Internet, you just have to look for it.

, Accessories are extremely important, and will help pull your preppy look together in a polished, attractive style. Some great preppy accessories include:


Tote bags: A nice monogrammed canvas tote from L.L. Bean is owned by every prep, get it with your initials. Or, with a small bow, collegiate-looking stripes, or even just plain
Ribbon belts
Anchor belts
Statement necklaces

Diamond stud earrings, grandmothers jewelry, classy earrings, Rings, Bracelets, and nice pretty necklaces. Remember, dress to impress.
Also, Remember what Coco Chanel told us: take off at least one accessory before you leave the house. Do not overload.


Another great accessory is the nautical bracelet - in either rope or metal (preferably gold). Keep it simple and only wear one or two at a time. Kiel James Patrick's are best when it comes to a great and chic bracelet.
Anything from Vera Bradley
Kate Spade accessories in gold or silver

, The classic look for preppy hair is long, straight, and clean. Of course, there are variations on this. Lots of preps have short hair, curly hair, of anything between. Good colors are just basic, natural colors. As long as it looks well-groomed, shiny, and fresh, your hair is fine. Preps style their hair is basic, tasteful ways. Some ideas are:


Worn down with a barrette or bobby pin holding some hair off to the side
Curled with a cute headband
Neatly french braided down the back
Medium-height ponytail with a fun bow
Low braided pigtails or just one side-braid (Be careful with these; if you have layers big chunks may stick out the side and that doesn't look good.)

, Well-groomed, shiny and clean hair is essential -- a lank, tangled and oily mane is not going to pass you off as preppy. Your hair should be kept up with.


Try a simple hairdo, or just leave your hair natural.When you have styled your hair, add a few accessories. The essential preppy hair accessories are:
Headbands -- also in a bright color, or a sophisticated, plain one. If you're willing, try a simple print one.(If you have curly hair, a headband is a great idea.)
A simple but pretty hair clip. If you have irritating bangs or a bump in your hair, brush them back and smooth it back with a pretty hair clip.

Hair should look neat (not too fussy), and natural.



, Preps often wear only light or no makeup. Never put too much dramatic makeup on. Remember- the purpose of makeup is to enhance your natural beauty, not cover it up. As for your nails, they should be cut at a short length in their natural shape and painted in basic colors like pink, white, red, or French Manicured. However, they do not have to be painted, just keep them clean.

, Little breakouts and acne are sometimes inevitable, but you should do whatever you can to keep your face as clear as possible. Cover any problem areas with concealer. Also, For your teeth, keep them as well groomed and white as possible. Get braces if they are too crooked.

,


Make sure your face is clean before you apply makeup. Also, make sure your eyebrows are well done and well combed.
Apply concealer. Make sure your concealer's texture is either cream or liquid - they are the best, and solid concealer always creases and looks caked.
Face powder or translucent powder, pressed or loose, no matter which, always apply it with powder brush, as the application will be a lot more lighter, softer and will give a natural result.
Stay away from bright eyeshadow, or many layers of eyeshadow (different colors on the lid, crease, and corners). Stick with pastels and neutral colors, lightly applied.
Eyeliner and mascara are good, just make sure they don't smudge or clump. Also try to pick brown eyeliner and mascara over black, it's classier and more natural. Also, when applying eyeliner, apply it as close to the lash line as possible, or else it will look ugly!
Don't go overboard on the blush either. if anything, use a cheek tint to get that rosy glow, but nothing more.
Lipstick can look very classy if used with the right colors. Nothing too dark or bright; stick with lighter, more neutral pinks; if you're going for a bright red, make sure it has blue undertones to make your teeth look whiter.
What also works, if you have a nice complexion with no zits, spots, shadows or eye circles, try not wearing skin make-up if possible, only eyeliner, mascara and lipstick so you won't look plain.

, Every preppy girl must have flawless white pearls for teeth. Get braces or night-retainers if necessary, and brush and floss at least twice a day. Use mouthwash as well for extra freshness.


Shower at least once a day; preps are well-kept and fresh. They smell the way they look: neat and clean. Wear a light perfume (think Chanel No.5, not a muskier or richer scent but not too much)
Keep your nails neat as well. You don't always have to wear polish , but make sure they're nicely filed and trimmed. Too-bright nail polish will make you look too high-profile. Stick with French, light pink, pearl creams or clear.) This is to keep the perfect prep-like image, remember to keep your areas of your personality.

, Preppy girls are not shy-faced little lambs. They are completely unafraid to be daring with their fashions and express their opinions. If you find yourself staring at the floor and blushing when you talk to somebody, this needs to stop-right away. Build up your self esteem and be confident within yourself. Don't put yourself down - at the same time, nobody likes a brag. Strike the balance. Hold your head high, talk in a confident, quiet voice, stand tall, and don't be afraid to be yourself. Try not to become loud and annoying, just polite and happy with yourself.

, Being classy is not exactly a solid rule to becoming preppy. However, as preppy girls will never fall under the label of ""sleazy"", ""tacky"", ""impolite"" or ""unpleasant"", it is safe enough to assume that picking up some overall class will certainly up your preppy bar. Don't fall into the waiting trap and become a snob. Being classy simply means being polite, pleasant, and relatively well-educated. You don't have to have been born a genius or beautiful to be considered classy. It is a skill and a trait that can be picked up quite easily. Do not use foul language frequently; it makes you come off as trashy and impolite.

, Again, you do not have to play a ""preppy"" sport to be considered preppy. It's not a solid fact, and forcing yourself into sports will simply earn you the label ""poser"". However, sports can be enjoyable, especially if they fit into your preppy style. Some sports and activities you may want to consider: rowing, tennis,volleyball, Lacrosse, sailing, golf,track and field,ballet, swimming, field hockey, soccer or horseback riding, softball, cheerleading, or any dancing too. The official preppy sport is fencing because of its old-world charm. Don't restrict yourself to these -- just give them a go!

, Preppy girls are never rude or obnoxious, so don't be. Being nice doesn't mean sucking up to teachers or making friends with everyone. It simply means being pleasant, smiling to everyone, and not participating in nasty activities such as gossiping or bullying. Being nice comes with practice, and after a while it will come naturally. With your newly gained confidence and class, try striking polite conversation with the neighbors, or helping someone with homework. Try not to take out negative emotions on others -- it comes back to bite.

, Showing that you're social will definitely keep people from thinking you're a nerd.

, It's okay to spend a bit of money sometimes, but spend it on the right stuff. Showing you have a nice style will show people that you know how to dress and aren't a nerd. Huge glasses are a definite no. If you need glasses, get ones that have smaller lenses and a nice frame. Even better, switch to contacts. The black rimmed glasses are okay if they are small.

,, If you're in a gifted program, you'll find yourself surrounded with a lot of nerds.

, If you tell everyone that you made an A when nobody else did, then people will see you as a nerd or a suck-up. If you have a high grade on a test, tell people you did, ""okay"". Never lie about your grades, or do poorly on a test in order to appear average. (This is difficult with some people as they might be annoyed with you for downplaying a higher grade than they got).

, They really don't like it and other people hate it.

, These make it look like you are hiding something. There's nothing wrong with being able to use English.

, (Don't change your goals/ inner person) Be who you are, and be proud of it.

, People will see you as desperate and ignore you, or worse, make fun.

, Use some of the same language patterns, but say it nonchalantly, as if you talk like that all the time.

, At anything. It's great to be passionate, but there is a fine line between the two. Trying too hard is being obsessive about doing good, being liked, etc. Being passionate is getting involved, helping out, and focusing.

, You don't have to be great at it; do something easy like volleyball or biking. Horseback riding (*sigh* my true passion...) is awesome, fun, and anyone can be good at it. (Not everyone is great at it, but you can still be good. The key: Balance.)

, Don't throw up, under eat, or smoke to be skinny(or cool). Jog, walk your dog(s) or other peoples', or simply walk.

, If you have a problem with impulse eating, talk to your doctor. Until then, keep your kitchen stocked with healthy, easy snacks. Instead of ice cream, try frozen yogurt. Hungry for hard candy? Eat some cashews or unsalted almonds.

, And if someone accepts your invite to your house, make them a yummy snack (cookies, s'mores, etc.). DO NOT show them all your collections, if you have them. (Or your grades/ papers you may have saved.) Instead, introduce them to your pet (if you have any) or favorite art/ books. If you do invite someone over, make it a person who shares the same interests. Maybe a person from drama or book club.

Choose your genre.,
Know what is and is not a song.,
Listen, listen, listen.,
Never, ever say you don't like mainstream music.,
Do your research.,
Buy CDs and buy posters .,
Do NOT be act like you know more than other people.,
Go to see local bands/singers at talent shows or clubs.",How to Be a Music Know It All," Whether it is rap, punk or pop, you usually have to stick to one type. But remember, there are branches of every genre. For example, along with rock is punk, metal, emo, etc. So if you choose rock music, be sure to check out its branches.;
, Outside of most popular music genres, the term will frequently be inaccurate. There's no easier way for you to reveal the limitations of your knowledge. A safer idea is to use one of the terms ""piece"" or ""work"" unless the musical object in question has words that are sung.

, The only real way to develop an ear for that which makes pieces of music unique is to get as much exposure to as much music as possible. Also, evaluate music as you listen to it. By doing this, you build the associations between descriptive or critical terms and the actual phenomena associated with them. Most people familiar with pop music can identify verse, chorus, and bridge; awareness of concepts such as alternative modal frameworks and metric modulations is a sign of a greater musical knowledge.

, This mostly goes for people that like alternative music because it is, well, alternative. In every genre of music, there are alternative bands. For example, My Chemical Romance, newer stuff by AFI etc. are mainstream punk, although AFI covers many genres because they try many different sounds. Artists are usually mainstream for a reason, and it may be their image rather than their music that you do not like.

, Find the origins of your scene, and learn the grandfathers of it. Find out as many bands as you can, and listen to as many songs as you can by them. , Join the official fansite, and then after maybe there, branches. , It's fine to correct people's lyrics while they are singing, but do not say to someone 'You can't like that band because they came out five years ago and you've only liked them for five months!' Remember, there was a time that you probably knew nothing about music yourself, or had only recently started liking a band.

, Who knows; maybe they'll make it big and you can brag about having seen them at their first shows.

Make a large number of friends.,
Get rid of the idea that you have to look like Regina George (from Mean Girls) to be gorgeous.,
If you are struggling with the fact that nothing about you is beautiful, then you are wrong.,

Don't pretend to be stupid just to talk to a certain guy or to talk to a certain girl.,
Don't freak out if you get acne.,
Be super nice to everyone.,
When you go shopping for clothes, make sure you get something that is a reasonable price and something that suits your figure.,
Be SMART.",How to Be Gorgeous and Nerdy," They can be any race, gender, or IQ level. Not only will they make you happy, but they will make you popular and make you feel good about yourself.;
, Beauty exists in all shapes and colors. Some people have beautiful eyes, hair, or figures. You can have it all or just have one. If you only have one, exaggerate the thing you do have! Lets say that you have big pretty brown eyes, and you wear glasses. Just find a pair you love, and that emphasizes your eyes. wear some mascara, and eyeshadow also. If you have beautiful long black wavy hair, don't tie it in a ponytail, wear it down!

, Talk to your mother, or a friend and ask them to find something about you that is pretty.

, Try never to wear your hair in the same hairstyle two days in a row. It makes you seem boring. Straighten your hair, curl it, crimp it, braid it, put it up. There are all kinds of cute accessories out there like headbands and ribbons.

, It will most likely give you some confidence.

, Be yourself, and if you are smart, use it as a good quality in you.

, Don't freak out if you are fat. Don't freak out, period. If you freak out, people will find you too self conscious and will not feel comfortable to hang out with. It's a really good idea to talk to your friends about it, and don't try to be perfect. No one likes a perfect person. Admit that you're fat, and you work hard to lose weight. Or admit that you hate your skin and you've tried Clearasil and no one will make fun of you. If they do, then they are just a jerk because you know she isn't exactly the thinnest person ever, and that she doesn't have angel soft skin.

, No one likes a smart aleck or rude person. If you make people feel good about themselves, then people will like hanging around you.

, Wearing long skirts or comfortable fitting shirts will make people respect you for not trying to be someone else or not trying too hard.

, Get good grades. Don't compare yourself with other people when it's with grades. Don't make people envy you, and don't brag about your grades either.

Dress preppy.",How to Be a Nerd," If anyone would care about the subtle distinctions between the three, it would be a nerd. Getting the distinction down is important but not necessary, as there may be significant overlap between the three.


A nerd is thought to be a highly intelligent person who has a singular passion about an academic pursuit. They are, rather, nonsocial or socially awkward, being quite absorbed by a singular passion of intellect.
A geek is thought to be an individual who is always interested in a niche activity or subject, but who is not necessarily academically inclined nor as socially inept as the nerd.
A dork is thought to be slightly sillier and also socially inept, but perhaps not interested in a niche or academic pursuit.;
, In other words, act the only way you know how, in a way all your own. Nerds are renowned for eccentricities because they are, each, quite unique. Live your life, every day, like it's entirely your own, like you are the master of your own ship. If you need inspiration, read about some famous nerds in history. Here are three short vignettes of people, considered ""nerds,"" who did entirely what they wanted:


Thomas Edison, for example, spent 18 hours each and every day tinkering with rudimentary electronics at a time when it was still a relatively obscure endeavor. Edison labored to invent the light bulb, the phonograph, the alkaline battery, and an electric train, along with a thousand other patents, at a time when such invention were considered mysterious and amazing.Edison was a quintessential nerd.
Isaac Newton is a great example. He made many discoveries including the reflector telescope, calculus(both, differential and integral), Laws of Motion and Gravitation, Colours of light. He was usually busy with his research work. He didn't talk much. He is considered to be the most influential person of this world. He did not sleep much, about 3 hours.
Alan Turing is another famous nerd. Half-hero, half-scapegoat, Alan Turing is credited with helping to crack the Nazi Enigma codes at the end of World War II, as well as playing an instrumental role in developing the first computers of the 20th century.Despite his achievements, he was later prosecuted by the British government for a homosexual encounter and was forced to take estrogen injections to ""neutralize his libido.""Turing killed himself not long after the trial.

, It doesn't need to be science-related, although researchers are finding that increasingly numbers of autistic individuals (who often qualify as nerdy) are drawn to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM majors).Learn as much as you can about the subjects you are interested in, and safeguard that knowledge so that you can use it effectively later on.

, Many nerds are defined by their ability — some say habit — to question the information they receive until they are satisfied about its authenticity or understand the logic behind it. To be a nerd, you must be on an insatiable quest for knowledge. To be on an insatiable quest for knowledge, you must constantly question the quality, source, and utility of information you receive.


Don't trust information just because it comes from an authority figure. Nerds understand that figures of authority can sometimes get away with misleading or falsified information simply because of their power. The difference between a nerd and a plebe (tradesman/common laborer) is that the nerd will pore over Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers to see whether they hold-up, while the plebe (simple) takes the information/propaganda for granted.
Get to the root of things. A nerd will understand a question inside and out. A nerd will not rely on memorized information, but rather on understanding a concept. If a nerd asks the question ""Why is the sky blue?"" and is given the answer, ""Because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light,""her next question will inevitably be: ""Why do molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light?"" She will continue the line of questioning until the answer relates to something she already understands completely.

, The devil may be in the details, but that doesn't mean you can't embrace them. (That was Vladimir Nabokov's advice to his students.) The nerd may prefer concrete details over generalizing statements because details can be cross-checked by reality more easily than generalities can. The nerd cares more about being right than appearing smart, so he grabs onto details as a way of investigating reality.


No wonder, then, that nerds tend to gravitate towards the sci, tech, eng, math, i.e.: STEM majors: STEMs deal plainly in facts and systems observable in nature, whereas many other more subjective disciplines lack the objective, fact-checking component.

, No, this is not an obscure fashion directive; it's a way of thinking. Nerds tend to see gray areas where others see black and white. This is because nerds are good at examining pros and cons, comparison and contrasts, theses and rebuttals. They devalue their own opinion and focus on the ""quantifiable"" facts. Sometimes, this leaves them looking like occupational vacillators, constantly seesawing back and forth between ""sides"" of an argument (arguing with themselves, it may seem). In fact, they are gathering information and waiting for pre-aligned, set ""opinion"" (conclusion) to hit them with the force of facts, instead of forming an opinion (hypothesis) that one begins justifying by supporting facts.


There are several scientific/philosophical theories that nerds who love the gray area reference. It might be helpful to get familiar with just a few of them:
Thomas Kuhn's paradigm shifts: Periods of ""normal science"" are interrupted by periods of ""revolutionary science,"" called paradigm shifts that are relentlessly discussed and expounded (defined, diagrammed, flow-charted, mapped, extrapolated, spanning and forming a new amalgam, a new reality...). For STEMs adherents paradigm shifts are entirely new, focuses of scientific thinking and concentration.Kurt Gödel's incompleteness: It's impossible to establish consistency and completeness inside formal logical systems. In other words, all consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include propositions/assumptions that are undecidable (fundamental elements of math include the undefined point, line, plain and space which are nonetheless bases to define large fields of mathematics)., If you know someone who is experienced in a certain field, ask them what they know. Pose questions, listen closely to their answers, and speak up if you don't understand yet, or if you disagree with them.


Remember, knowledge can come from surprising sources! Everyone is good at something. Practice intellectual humility and approach each person as if they have something new to teach you.

, Being intelligent doesn't mean knowing everything; it means knowing things and being eager to learn more. Get comfortable with asking questions and being wrong. The quest for knowledge includes wrong turns and realizing that you don't know. Focus less on ""What do I know?"" and more on ""What can I learn?""

, Nerds get the reputation for being in the clouds half the time because their minds are wandering, probing distant places or complex correlations and equations. For this reason, don't be afraid to be aloof, if that's who you are. Lose yourself in the intellectual areas that make you happy and help you feel connected to the world, even if it means you seem disconnected by the ""depth"" and ""displacement"" involved in your internalizing a singular passion.


Your passion could be anything, from cryptology to philosophy to Norse mythology to brewing. It could be anything from morphology to cardiology to numismatics or philately. Whatever it is, make it a blast!
Set short- and long-term goals for yourself. The sooner you set yourself some goals (perhaps in an outline of variable and constant parameters, a rubric, or a protocol), the easier it will be to achieve them. Setting absorbing goals has the benefit of being especially nerdy!

, Think differently. Don't be afraid to tackle an idea or activity that isn't popular. (Realize that you may not have a great grasp of what is popular and what isn't in the first place. No matter!)


If you found that lining your car antenna with aluminum foil gives you better reception on the AM stations in your car, then go for it. A nerd does not care how his car looks if the radio station is playing properly.
If you decide that coding all night and eating grilled peanut butter and jelly sandwiches makes your heart squeal and your tummy hum, then go for it. A nerd does not care whether his lack of sleep and confounding diet make him an object of mystery.
If you propose to test all your friends for an antibody not yet known to science, then go for it. A nerd does not care whether the world doubts her methods and challenges her findings.
If you are interested in computer viruses and want to tell all your friends what a trojan is, then go for it! A lot of nerds like to learn about things that seem pointless to others.

, Say ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and ""excuse me."" Don't hesitate to apologize if you've hurt someone's feelings or done something wrong. Treat everyone with courtesy, whether they are a fellow nerd, a valley girl, or a person with an intellectual disability.


Sometimes, correcting others hurts more than it helps. If a person is sensitive or in a bad mood, or if the situation isn't good, let it slide. If you know that a person prefers to be corrected, discreetly correct them and don't make it a big deal.
Support fellow nerds. Be there for nerds who get bullied, and build up budding nerds instead of tearing them down for not knowing as much as you do.

, A nerd is on a constant quest for knowledge. A nerd doesn't always care whether the information they receive has any utility. The mere fact that it's simple, profound, or counter-intuitive is enough to make it cool.

, Nerds are usually pretty good with words because they care about getting things right. It doesn't hurt that they may read more in a month than the average American reads in a year.Regardless, the misconception out there is that nerds use big words. Wrong. Nerds use the right word given the context. Sometimes, the right word happens to be a big one. Extremely smart nerds have the ability to use incredibly basic words to explain incredibly complex subject matter.


Make the dictionary and thesaurus your friend. Whenever you come across a word you don't know, consult the dictionary. Whenever you believe you could be using a better word given the circumstances, consult a thesaurus.

, Read everything in your area(s) of interests that you can get your hands on, including reference books and encyclopedias. Read and watch the news enough everyday to be informed about what's going on beyond your community. Read fiction books, too, because they can help build your vocabulary and gives you a good sense of spelling. Read things that you like, but your parents don't approve of. For example, you like the Harry Potter books, but your parents claim that they will ""give you nightmares."" Read them! (The Harry Potter series isn't very scary at all. A little mature, maybe, but not horror.)


Study several related languages. Try to pick up a language just for kicks; or maybe because a subject your learning about has original sources in the native tongue. Experiment with web-based translation machines. If you feel that learning a language is too hard, then try and learn Pig Latin. Pig Latin has a set of rules to go by in order to speak it, so it is very easy to learn.
Extra cred goes to nerds who study a ""dead"" or fictional language, such as Cuman, Eyak, and Karankawa, or Elvish, Dothraki, or Klingon.Dead or fictional languages are exquisitely nerdy.


Keep your bookshelf/ebooks stocked. Prioritize non-fiction over fiction, although use and abuse fiction all you like if that's the only thing you plan on reading.
Note that informative reading doesn’t have to mean slogging through a dry, unbearable textbook. For an entertaining and informative read, try the funny physics classic Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman, any of Brian Greene’s very popular and accessible science bestsellers, or well-researched historical fiction like I, Claudius (whose unlikely hero survives a particularly brutal period in the Roman Empire) or the hilarious Flashman novels (whose anti-hero is a lecherous scoundrel of the colonial British empire).
Though Non-fiction is more informative than fiction, fiction can still have real facts in it, too. Some books to read in the teen's genre is John Green's ""The Fault In Our Stars"" (even though the book is about teenagers, they have adult views on life and cancer, which the main character has). Some classics are Jane Eyre (a classic by Charlotte Bronte, a very good one, though with tough words and text. If that's a problem, then read an abridged version) and Little Women (even though Little Women is a classic, with views that are from back then, it isn't very boring, it makes sense and the plot is interesting).

, Try to get a seat where you can clearly hear, see the teacher and chalkboard, and pay attention. A good goal to set for yourself is to try getting mostly As in everything you do at school, including homework. Take notes, study for that test, and focus. Most of all, come to school ready to learn and try not to worry about the social scene too much if it's uninteresting or uncomfortable. Note, however, that just because you're a nerd doesn't mean you have to care about school. Many nerds (Bill Gates included) either flunked out of or were close to flunking out of school.


Try some extra-curricular activities, such as robotics or math club, chess, or drama. Try to balance your extra-curriculars so that they don't bring your grades down.
Ask a lot of questions in class. There is no such thing as a stupid question, remember? The only stupid question is the question you didn't ask.
Do research above and beyond what is taught in class. YouTube channels such as Khan Academy, Crash Course, Vsauce, Numberphile, CGP Grey to name a few, offer the opportunity to get ahead at the convenience and enjoyment of your computer. This saves the hassle of hiring a tutor.

, Nerds deal with their anger and heartbreak in a productive way: they practice music, make art, or amend changes to their debate presentation before they lash out at other people. Don't cut yourself down. What other people say about you isn't necessarily who you are. Just don't pay attention to what they say about the way you are.

, Nerds don't need to rely upon excitement and danger in order to have fun. They enjoy more wholesome fun, such as LAN parties, watching Star Wars, or building and launching a rocket. These activities can be enjoyed alone (independence is a fine thing) or with friends (the more the merrier!).



Note: playing games like Magic the Gathering or D&D, dressing up as your favorite characters for movie premieres, and LARPing is more geeky than nerdy, but that doesn't mean that you have to stay away from them.

, They could be other nerds, but they don't have to be. While geeks often navigate between social groups, nerds are more likely to associate with other nerds, because of common interests. Maybe if you're an abstract thinker, try to find a nerd who's more practical or technical, and vice versa.Having a friend, or a set of friends, who complement you is as much as anyone could ask for.


If you don’t know any nerds who are interested in what you do, find a community online or try to get your own friends interested in aspects of nerdiness. The web is increasingly becoming an important social community for nerds, mainly because of its focus on free expression and its utility as platform for technology.
If you're prone to being picked on or beat up, think about making a strategic friendship with someone (preferably not a nerd) who might stick up for you in a pinch. Maybe he gets help on his homework, and you get muscle when you need it. Being a nerd doesn't mean you can't also be diplomatic.

, You're a nerd and you know it. You're also happy and optimistic. That's because your life is pretty good. You like who you are, even if it doesn't seem like very many other people do. (That's okay, they simply don't understand you.) The friends that you do have are good people who make you feel like to be alive. Life is pretty good.

, The most important part of looking like a nerd is not caring what you look like. Nerds tend to like clothing that is efficient and comfortable. So if it just so happens that the most worn item in your wardrobe is a pair of sweatpants with 17 pockets, so be it. Embrace it!

, Pull long hair back out of your face. Wear comfortable clothes that don't itch and are good for walking, sitting, and running. A nerd prizes comfort over appearance, and never wears clothes that feel unpleasant.


Only wear high heels if you can walk and run confidently in them. If you want to be taller, stick with kitten heels or platform shoes; a significant heel can cause foot damage and is definitely not practical.

, Video game characters and superheroes, like Megaman, Mario, Superman or Sonic, are de rigueur. Math jokes, or obscure topics (binary code, Latin, etc.) work great, too, as do movie references.

, Hipsters have taken the lenses from the lows of the '90s to the rich, abundant, and suddenly cool plateaus of the twenty-teens. No matter. If you're a nerd and you can't see a baseball from a barnyard at two feet, wear your glasses. Your nerd quotient will increase drastically.


Because nerds aren't into fashion statements, wearing fake glasses isn't really a nerd thing. (Geeks and hipsters sometimes do this.)

, Nerds are known in the fashion world for wearing clothes that do not flatter their body type and are horribly anachronistic, probably because their clothes are hand-me-downs. So if you're going for the nerd look, choose your wardrobe by lottery instead of carefully fitting the outfit together.

, Some nerds, but not all, have the preppy look on lock-down. Chinos, a button-down (tucked-in, of course), a vest, and loafers, with a hint of messiness to tie it all together. Especially when worn during informal occasions, this style will get you pegged for a nerd in no time.

,
How high you put your bag depends on the school you're in and even the country.",How to Be a Genius Nerd," Being a nerd isn't limited to wearing braces, suspenders, or glasses. You can wear anything you please, but demure clothing is preferable. If you do want to appear nerdy, conservative clothing, glasses, messenger bags, and neutral colors are generally accepted. It is also preferable to have natural beauty, as it can signify confidence and an interest in matters more important than your appearance.;
, Read magazines of your choice. Take an interest in mathematics, science, poetry, or classic novels. Constantly expand your knowledge. You should read magazines like Knowledge by BBC, The Smithsonian and Popular science.

, Practice writing neatly in both cursive and print. This will help to make less errors, and get better grades. Remember, you're graded on your grammar and punctuation!

, Try educational television if necessary, good examples would be ""PBS Create"", the Science Channel, the Discovery Channel, or the History channel.

, Put it in a place where everybody can see it. If you want it to really be convincing, make a whole bunch of the pages dog-eared so that it looks well-worn.

, It should have crinkled-up papers with writing on them, and books. For suggestions, see step two as well.


Your books do not have to be all nonfiction, as some fictional works greatly increase vocabulary. All books are welcome, the key is to have a large interest in them and become knowledgeable.

, Try not to be verbose, substitute some words (threw, building, bored) for those less commonly used (lunged, edifice, ennui). Make sure there's someone around to appreciate your vocabulary, otherwise those around you may become annoyed.

, If at any point you're not pondering, you need to try harder. Question yourself first and the world around you. Don't be afraid to ask others for their answer. Be ready to accept it and even adopt it if it's better than yours.

, If a challenging problem is asked by the teacher, rivet your eyes on the calculator, while clutching the device as close to you as you can manage, and press the keys non-stop. If in English class you are called to write an essay, always tap the edge of your writing utensil on your head. Having these idiosyncrasies may help you.

, Nerds can often make a lot of money by tutoring.

, Try very hard to excel in academics.

,, If low hanging bags are fashion, put it up as high as possible.

Make a list of your strengths and achievements.,
Eliminate negative thoughts.,
Avoid negative atmospheres.",How to Be Proud of Being a Nerd1," Knowing your strengths and your achievements will help you feel good about yourself and will enable you to find the confidence you have within.


Write down your the things you admire about yourself, what you are good at, and what you have accomplished. If you need help, get a friend or family member to help. Keep these lists in a safe place, and read through them regularly. ;
, You deserve to feel good about yourself. Eliminate negative thoughts you have about yourself and replace them with positive ones. Try to remember that, despite your problems, you are a unique and valuable individual.Identify negative thoughts, such as “I am a loser,” “I never do anything right,” or “No one likes me.” Replace these thoughts with positive ones, like, “I am great,” “I am smart,” or “I have friends who love and support me.""

, If you can, try to avoid situations where you feel you are being treated badly or where you are made to feel badly about yourself.


Instead, frequent places and surround yourself with people who make you feel liked, comfortable, and valued.
Some places where you may feel people treat you badly are unavoidable. If you are bullied at school or at work, tell someone whom you trust like a parent, teacher, counselor, friend, supervisor, or school psychologist. "

The first step in becoming Oshare Kei is having the right make up.,
Now, you need the clothing.,
Wear shirts with cute patterns and motifs.,
Jackets are cute.,
Skirts or pants are obviously important (don't want to go without them now do we?).,
Ripped jeans with bright leggings/socks underneath work good too, and shorts with socks/leggings (as Miku from An Cafe demonstrates oh-so well).

,
Knee high socks are good.,
You can wear bracelets, but not too many (unless you want to of course!).,
Necklaces with cute things on them are good.,
Have clean and shiny hair.,
Some people put gems and stickers on their face.,
Piercings look good in Oshare Kei, but you don't need them, as they are painful and leave scars.,
Try different kinds of shoes.,
Listen to the music, obviously.,
You could also listen to Visual Kei bands such as The GazettE, Versailles, Direngrey, Miyavi and Nightmare.,
Make sure you don't look 'cosplay'.",How to Dress Oshare Kei," Make sure for the make up you use bright colours. However, some Oshare Kei wearers keep their make up natural-looking (such as Teruki from An Cafe) , so you don't need to wear too much make up if you don't want to. Black eyeliner is commonly used in Oshare Kei. Look at pictures for ideas. There are videos of Cure Style Council on YouTube (Cure is a Visual Kei magazine in Japan), or you can just look up Oshare Kei make up tutorials - there are plenty of them.;
, Oshare Kei is all about bright colors. You can find many items at local stores which can be coordinated into an Oshare Kei outfit. Remember: Bright colors are key, but try to add some darker colors too, or you will just look 'Decora'.

, Animal print and polka dots are also good for Oshare Kei. A good place to get darker Oshare Kei like things is Sex Pot Revenge, a brand that An Cafe have worn before. As mentioned before, many things can be found in local stores. You just gotta shop around. Some Visual Kei clothes can also be classed as Oshare. You can find some things on eBay, but be careful and make sure you read the feedback and reviews of the items. Some Oshare Kei artists, such as Mashiro (ex:Himeyuri/x) and Waka (Danger Gang) incorporate clothing from the Lolita fashion. Make sure you get educated on Lolita fashion before wearing any of it.

, Wear a fluffy jacket, or one with cute prints on it. Animal print, cartoons, anything as long as its bright and colorful. Remember, you can always sew your own clothing!

, For skirts, get cute bright ones, and layer. Wearing bright leggings or knee high socks with skirts looks best, in my opinion. Get colors such as pink, purple, yellow or green. Any bright colors. You can layer the skirts, but make sure you don't look Decora, unless that's the look your going for.

,, Striped socks, socks with bows on them. You can also layer them, but again, not too Decora. Pastel colors paired with bright colors look wonderful.

, Ones that compliment the outfit are best.

, Beads can also work. Some Oshare Kei wearers wear plushies on necklaces (JunJun from DOG in the PWO, Bou ex:An Cafe). These can look cute, but can be a bit much, and again look more Decora.

, Make sure it doesn't look scraggly. You could straighten your hair, curl it, dye it bright blue, anything! But it's got to be clean and neat looking. Look at pictures for inspiration.

, But don't go too over the top or you'll look like a sticker collection. Fake eyelashes also look good.

, But if you have them, leave them, they look great!

, Converse, platform shoes, ugg boots, Lolita shoes and even slippers can work - just make sure they are bright and colorful.

, A few of my favorite Oshare Kei bands are An Cafe, x, Decola Hopping, SuG, Lolita23q, LM.C and Aicle. There are many more than this, however. Decola Hopping are fairly unknown by now, and many people don't listen to them because of their weird name, but I promise you, they are amazing. You have to listen to them!

, If these aren't your thing, don't listen to them, your music taste is your music taste!

, Well, not cosplay, because a lot of time, money and effort goes into that too... so I guess don't look BAD cosplay. Make sure you do enough research. Remember to be creative! Good luck and have fun!

Purchase a kimono.,
In addition to the kimono itself, you must have a juban, a koshi himo belt, a datejime, an obi makura belt, and white tabi socks.,
Put on a slip called the ""juban."",
Put on the kimono, making sure the back seam is centered.,
After you have put on your kimono, pull the kimono so the it ends at your ankle.,
As you hold the extra material about your waist, tie the koshi himo belt below the excess material.,
Now take the datejime belt and wrap it around your waist over the koshi himo belt.,
Put the obi makura into place and wrap the obi.",How to Dress in a Kimono," You can go someplace like Japantown in San Francisco, or you can buy a kimono on an auction site like Ebay. There are also online stores that specialize in kimonos, like Ichiroya, but these may take longer to ship your kimono.






;
, As you're getting dressed, put on the white tabi socks first. It is difficult to bend down after dressing fully in a kimono, so you should get the socks out of the way while you can.








, It consists of a white cotton top and skirt, which you can easily substitute with separate pieces if you can't find an actual juban. Today in Japan, an alternative is to wear only the white collar that goes around the neck called a ""cri-sugata.""








, For both men and women, you should wrap the right side of the kimono over your body to begin with, then bring the right side of the kimono towards the left side of your body, overlapping it with the left side as you do so. Adjust the white slip collar to show evenly around the neck, just under the kimono collar.








, The length of the kimono is always adjusted, which is why there are only a few lengths made by the manufacturer.








, Cross the belt in the back and tie it in the front. Straighten out the excess material and bring some down to cover the koshi himo belt.








, Tie this belt in the front, leaving the overlapping kimono fabric visible below. The excess kimono fabric should hang out evenly below the belt so that the fabric is seen.








, Tie both ends of the obi together, folding it in across your waist and tightening it at the center. Then slide it to your back, straighten yourself out a bit, and you should be all dressed up in your kimono!








"
"
Join a club.,
Take a class.,
Don't follow the crowd.,
Help others in need.",How to Be Proud of Being a Nerd2," Find other people with similar interests. By surrounding yourself with others who are like you, you will create a positive, uplifting, and inspiring environment for yourself. For example, if you like learning foreign languages, consider joining a French, Italian, or Spanish language club. Or, if you like learning about environmental issues, try joining an environmental club. Look for these clubs at school, in your local community, or online. Joining these clubs and communities will help you feel supported in your interests.

, Try not to be discouraged, depressed, or enraged by those who ridicule you. Instead, get involved in artistic activities where you can express yourself, acquire a sense of mastery, and interact positively with others. Find a local painting, music, poetry, or dance class through your local adult education service or local community center.

, You may be used to being labeled “different."" Turn this into a positive: your unique interests give you the ability to see things differently and to be in tune with the things going on around you rather than conforming to the mainstream. Remember that being a unique individual is a virtue that many people admire. A way to stand out from the crowd is to wear an outfit, a hairstyle, or jewelry that reflects you and your interests, no matter how different you may look.

, Aspire to be honest, compassionate, and kind by offering to help others who are bullied or teased for being “different.” Knowing that someone else is on their side can make a big difference in the lives of those who are bullied. Offer to hang out with them or invite them to have lunch with you.
Speak up for them if you hear someone teasing or bullying them.
Help stop rumors and gossip about them by interjecting, if appropriate, when somebody badmouths them. You could say ""Sam is actually really great - she helped me make new friends when I first moved here.""

"
"
Volunteer.,
Apply for an internship.,
Celebrate.",How to Be Proud of Being a Nerd3," Find your favorite local cause and volunteer. Finding organizations that are meaningful to you can increase your morale. It can also help you meet people who have similar interests and the same kind of passion you find in yourself.


You can find local volunteer organizations through your school, local community, religious institution, online, or through a friend.

, By applying for an internship program, you can get real world experience while doing the things you are passionate about. Remember that experience dating back to your high school years looks great on any job application. It shows that you are focused and dedicated; qualities that employers look for.


Start by looking for local businesses and organizations in your areas of interest and see if they offer internship programs. You can search online, or ask a counselor, teacher, coach, or club advisor. You can also find out if family or friends know someone in a field that interests you. , Today, geeks and nerds are becoming increasingly fashionable. The mainstreaming of geek culture has even resulted in geek protagonists. Just think of Seth Cohen in the TV series “The OC,” or the protagonists in the popular TV series “The Big Bang Theory.” Embrace your inner nerd or geek by celebrating “Embrace Your Geekness Day” with your friends on July 13th.
Plan to get together with your group of friends once a month to celebrate your interests and differences.

Gather inspiration.,
Learn how to sew, if you don't know already.,
Don't rush your work, otherwise, it will turn out sloppy.,
Remember that this is Gothic Lolita, so pick the right colour scheme for the style, and remember that it has to be flattering to you, too.,
Make a preliminary sketch.,
Learn how to do your hair and makeup.,
Gather your fabrics and other materials.,
Draw your pattern on a piece of paper before you start on the fabrics themselves.,
Go to work on the fabric once you're happy with the pattern.,
Try it on several times.,
Add the details.,
Look at your sketch again.,
Have a final try on, this time with make up, hair, accessories, and all.,
Polish the look, and wear it proudly.",How to Design Your Own Gothic Lolita Outfit," Many sites or stores love to show off their own creations; take what you like and work with that. Research on the style, what can be done and what can't, so that you won't look like an Ita Loli.;
, Look for patterns in websites. They don't have to be exclusively Lolita patterns, as they are in Japanese most of the time. Victorian and Edwardian patterns can work wonders; you just have to adjust and edit them for the garment you want to create.

, If you are on a deadline, feel free to enlist friends who can help you.

, Maybe you love the colour red, but it makes you look all blotchy, so try to avoid using it as an accent instead of part of the main scheme. A good colour scheme might be navy blue with white, or black with red tartan, or even a very very deep purple or the ever present white and black combo. Stay away from bright or neon colours combined with black.

, Focus on the details of the dress, skirt, blouse, or jacket. Remember the basic shape of a Gothic Lolita outfit: bell shaped or A-line knee-length skirts that are at the waist or a tiny bit lower, but never at the hip. If you're using lace, use it in moderation. Remember to put all the details: buttons, ruffles, bows, etc. You might want to gather small samples of the fabrics and other materials you might use and paste them next to your sketch so that you can have an idea of how it might look all together. DON'T FORGET TO ADD YOUR PETTICOAT AND BLOOMERS TO YOUR SKETCH, THEY ARE A MUST IN ANY LOLITA OUTFIT.

, You might to want to look into the makeup and hair by this time too, remember that those are also essential parts of your Gothic Lolita outfit. Hair is neat, clean and tidy, usually in soft curls or straight and with bangs. The makeup is a bit darker than on almost all the rest of the styles, but that doesn't mean Raccoon Eyes. Gothic and Lolita Bible has great examples of makeup and hair looks.

, Good fabrics for a Gothic Lolita outfit are cotton fabrics or mixed cotton fabrics with a dull natural shine to them. Synthetic fabrics or satin fabrics are a total no-no. Don't use heavy or crushed velvet, and try to find natural fibers. For the laces, eyelets, Venice and Cluny made of cotton and other natural fabrics are a must. Synthetic laces tend to be hard, rough, and have a wide netting that will look grayish and ugly from afar.

, That way if you make a mistake, you won't be wasting precious fabric.

, Remember that you can always make last minute modifications, but always be very sure of what you're doing.

, Don't save this for the exact day you'll be wearing it on. Do this fairly early on to fix anything outrageously wrong. Do it as many times as necessary.

, Once you have the skirt, dress, JSK, etc. done you can add the rest of the details, be it lace, buttons or some such. Always look back at your sketch, but keep in mind that you can change anything last minute if you're very sure of it. DON'T OVERDO THE LACE OR YOU'LL END UP WITH AN UGLY AND ITA LOLI LACE MONSTER.

, Start looking for the complimentary accessories. As a Gothic Lolita, you can look for crosses, coffin purses, Alice bows, bracelets, chokers, etc. Remember that they should match and compliment the outfit. Remember that the shoes are very important too: Mary Janes (with or without the characteristic Lolita heels) and rocking horse shoes are great for a Gothic Lolita style, stay away from stompy boots. Knee or over the knee length stockings are necessary to keep your modesty.

, Check the over all outfit and fix things here or there.

, Try not to brag too much, but be proud of your hard work!

Consider your style.,
Consider your clothing.,
Change your hair.",How to Dress Kawaii (Japanese Cute)," This is about being mega cute, colorful but sweet and not too noisy. Draw manga and anime, perhaps by watching some YouTube videos about it. Discuss Japanese culture and clothing with your friends to shape your own views. Play Dance Dance and maybe some calligraphy, and write messages with love, peace symbols in Japanese to friends. There are many ways to form your style.;
, Try to dress colourfully, see cute anime colorful pictures, they'll get you in the mood. Rainbows, polka dots, stripes, peace signs, happy faces, cute animals... casual but colorful. Try out some oriental clothing in alternative clothing stores, and don't be afraid to try something bold. Shirts with cute graphics paired with a colorful tutu or some dungarees are very cutesy and suit this look perfectly. If you don't want to spend too much money, you can always try investing in things like socks, tights, headbands or even wigs if you are into that.
, Spikes, accessories and slick hair is what's ""it"" in kawaii style. Get some gel and work your hair into a manga or anime inspired hairdo. While bangs are not necessarily, they still fit really well into the look. Then a simple headband with or some colorful clips from the kid section of a clothing store will do.

Gather a reasonably sized wardrobe of lolita garments.,
Lay out your outfit before dressing.,
Make sure all the colors in the outfit are complementary.,
Do your make up.,
Get dressed.",How to Dress Lolita,"

These should basically consist of JSKs (jumper skirts), OP's (one pieces), cut sews, skirts, panniers and petticoats (these will give your dresses and skirts a ""poof"" look, and depending on the style, may be used in quantity), bloomers (many bell-shaped dresses tend to ride up and the skirts may be shorter at the back than the front, as lolita is for modesty, the bloomers help to maintain a modesty and also to protect you from people seeing your underwear), stockings (commonly knee high), Mary Janes, (they are very versatile and cute shoes), various shoes, accessories (incl. head dresses, bows, rings, necklaces etc...) and a reasonably large bag.



 


If this is your first outfit or if you just started to build your wardrobe, it may be better to get some basic pieces that match each other, so that you can easily make new outfits without having to buy too much new clothes.

First of all, make sure you have a good petticoat. You will need it in almost all your outfits to give your skirt the typical poofy, wide shape. Tulle petticoats may seem a good choice, as these often give a nice amount of poof for a low price, however they tend to deflate very quickly.Those petticoats might work for you if you plan on wearing Lolita occasionally, but they just won't last long enough if you wear Lolita regularly. A better solution is to get a chiffon petticoat. This type of petti will almost never deflate, and is usually the best choice. Those pettis are sold by known Lolita brands as well as some off-brand stores. You should also make sure your petticoat fits a Lolita dress or skirt. Check that it has the right length : it should never peek out from your skirt, or be much shorter than your dress. Your petticoat must have a proper shape, too : Lolita skirts are usually bell-shaped, with a very round, cupcake-like shape, or A-Line, with less volume at the top of the skirt.
It is useful to have several plain, solid-colored high socks or tights in a ""base"" color such as white, black or cream. They are easy to get and much more versatile than patterned socks.
A versatile blouse in your base color will go with nearly all your skirts and JSKs. (You can skip it if you first choose an OP, but you will likely need it soon).
Find a pair of shoes that match your wardrobe. You can use shoes you already own (avoid sneakers and other obviously un-Lolita shoes though !) if they match your outfit, or purchase Lolita-specific ones. It is often a good idea to get them in your base color or in a color that easily matches it.
Do not forget to get a headpiece : you might make a Lolita outfit without it, however it often looks better with at least a small hairbow. If you don't feel like wearing huge headdresses or head-eating bows right away (it is indeed a better idea for a first outfit), you can easily find cute smaller bows, flowers or hairclips in regular fashion stores. (Make sure it doesn't look like a costume accessory though !)


You can find your clothes in Lolita-specific stores, but you may already own some Loli-able accessories or clothing. However, do not try to build a whole outfit with ""regular"" clothing as it won't result in a Lolita outfit. Off-brand cardigans are fine, but garments such as skirts or dresses should be specifically made for Lolita.;
, Is it neatly pressed and ironed? Are there any fraying edges, loose threads or missing beads? Are there any spots or stains? If there are any, fix them. However, if it all needs to go in the wash, make do with another outfit depending on the situation. If at all possible, you should try to find something similar. Remember, a lolita should always look his or her best, no matter what!

, Does that accessory honestly go with the outfit? Or is there a cuter one in your drawer somewhere? Do you honestly need to wear your hot pink bloomers with your green and cream JSK? Try to ensure everything works well and the colours work for that specific sub-style, after all, we can't have a Goshikku Rorita wearing bright pink and lilac.

, There's a wikiHow on Lolita makeup that you should look at. It is probably the most informative one you will ever find.

, The dressing order:


Underwear (Avoid exposed bras and panty lines). Also make sure that, if you wear one, the corset looks OK and is laced or buttoned properly.
Bloomers.
Pannier.
Skirt or one-piece (lift them over the head carefully, so as not to get make up on them)
(if you're wearing a blouse and a JSK instead, or just a single JSK, put them on carefully. No, BLOUSE FIRST silly!)
Cut Sew or Shirt (if any)
Carefully roll your stockings on
Shoes
Hairnet and Wig (if any) (or if using natural hair, style it.)
Accessories
Jacket
Bag
Parasol

Take care of more than just your appearance.,
Form a Lolita group in real life.,
Have a list of guests.",How to Become a Lifestyle Lolita," Places like ""Anna House"" and ""In the Starlight"" are wonderful for those on a budget, as well as other indie shops which carry Lolita. Ebay is not recommended; often the stores won't use their own photographs and you will get a low-quality item. Some essential items are:


A white blouse and/or a black blouse (depending on what style of lolita you are)

Blouses vary with style. For sweet, you may want a peter pan collar. For classic, you may want a high collar. Other elements to look for in a blouse are a nice, tailored look, puff or cap sleeves, a bib or yoke, pintucks, ruffles or a decent amount of lace, and a neck bow if desired.


A few full skirts. The skirts should be around knee length and full enough to fit a petticoat underneath. Make sure that the skirt fits on your waist or a little below it, but not at your hips. In order to get the right silhouette, the skirt must sit at the natural waist.
A good lolita petticoat. This is nothing like a square-dancing petticoat. A-Line or Bell-shaped work best. Hoop skirts and light slips won't fill out the skirt correctly.
Bloomers
Knee-high/over-the-knee socks
Mary Jane shoes. Black or white can work depending on your style; pink or white are good for sweet lolita.
Optionally, you can get lolita-specific undergarments.





;
, Parasols are a key part of lolita fashion. Try to get parasols with similar patterns to those of the dresses you plan on wearing.

, After you have the basics, expand into colors other than black and white. Red, pink, light and dark blue, brown, and floral patterns are common.

, Use references to see what hairstyle works for you - wigs are always an option! Bangs (fringe), ringlets, long hair and pigtails are common. Wild, unnatural colors are optional. Your hairstyle depends on your face shape, body shape, height, and personal preference.

, Study the Victorian and 18th Century French lifestyles for inspiration, and combine elements you like into your everyday life. These are good sources if you don't want to mix-match from multiple outfits specifically labelled ""lolita"".

, Also visit sites on Lolita etiquette and mannerisms.

A good movie is Kamikaze Girls. The main character, Momoko, is a lifestyle lolita. There's a manga version of it, too.







, Think about how you walk, eat, sit, etc. Slouching is very unattractive. Don't sit back. Stick your butt out slightly, though not noticeably, when you sit - this will make it much more comfortable to sit straight and tall. Try walking with your eyes level and not focused on the ground.

, Remember to always be clean: brush your hair, keep your nails dirt-free and neat, brush your teeth, and bathe/shower. When spraying perfume, be sure not to use too much. Excessive use of perfume isn't attractive and does not improve your hygiene. Being clean is important; being grubby isn't pleasing. Never have greasy hair. It is gross and very ita-lolita (""hard to look at"").

, This shows politeness. If you talk loudly, it'll seem like you're desperate for attention. Being loud in public isn't just obnoxious, but also inconsiderate to the people around you. Listen to what people have to say and always make eye contact.

, Parents will appreciate a girl who cares more about her education and work ethic than her nails. This will reflect in how you are viewed by those in authority. Who do you think gets the break when her homework isn't turned in? Teachers are harder on a girl who admits to spending two hours doing her nails than the one who is usually consistent.

, Go on trips, swap clothing and do whatever you want to do. Some Lolita-esque activities include:


Tea parties
Art shows
Watching movies like Alice in Wonderland
Karaoke
Visiting a fair or festival
Seeing a movie
Attending a seated concert or performance
Going shopping (for lolita clothes)
Ice skating
Going on a historical tour
Picnicking in a garden
Visiting the aquarium
Bake sales
Having a sleepover

, If you have arranged a meeting place for everyone, carry a small notepad with people’s names (or online aliases) to tick-off as people arrive. This way the chance of losing someone is minimal, especially if you have organized a large meet-up.


Another idea is to give out your mobile phone number before the event. This way, guests can contact you if they get lost.

, It's important to know what you're getting into and it's best to be really familiar with the looks that come with this particular style, rather than just copying one picture that might not be most fit for your body type or the shape of your face.

, Most gyaru blogs are on blogspot and live journal some blogs are universal doll, moments like diamonds, and sushi cat. But don't limit yourself to those few, try to branch out and discover blogs that you like.

, some basic things you might like are hair accessories, a mini skirt, an a line skirt, a pleated skirt, a white blouse, a black blouse, two cute graphic tees, dark wash skinny jeans, colored skinny jeans, black skinny jeans, and a sun dress. Common gyaru accessories are sun hats, collars(by themselves), nerd glasses, and jewelry.

, The basic gyaru makeup includes pencil liner, liquid liner, white eyeliner, natural toned eye-shadows, concealer, foundation or a tinted moisturizer, nude lipstick pink lipgloss or clear gloss, false eyelashes, mascara, and blush.

, In most styles, gyaru hair is glamorous, big and puffy, often curled, it takes a bit more work than most people's everyday hairstyle.

Sometimes it might look wild but in many cases each strand was carefully arranged that way. there are also more ""toned down"" hairstyles like sock buns, half up, and curly ponytails.

",How to Be a Sweet Lolita," Items such as purses, head dresses, and socks with designs like flowers, music notes, candy or anything sweet printed on them (knee-highs or over the knee socks).;
, You can still wear dark colors, but it should definitely be toned down. Popular colors are mostly pastels: pink, sax blue, white/cream, pale yellow, mint green, & lavender.

, A Lolita almost always adds decoration to her hair, because it would be a wasted surface if one could not slap a bow on it. The traditional head covering is the headdress, which may come in all shapes and sizes, but is typically rectangular so that it may arch over the head like a headband.


The Alice bow is also popular. This is a large bow made to sit on top of the head. Smaller bows, such as on barrettes and elastic bands, may also be used if one wants a less overpowering look. Hair corsages are more common among classic Lolitas, as are vintage-style hats.

, In general, Lolitas prefer to minimize exposed skin, and so shoulders are, of course, usually covered. Most jumper skirts are made to be worn over a blouse. A typical Lolita blouse buttons in the front and features a collar which is, traditionally, in the rounded Peter Pan style.

, The ideal Lolita silhouette is of the bell shape, whether or not she is wearing a dress or a skirt. This shape is achieved thanks to the petticoats and bloomers beneath the skirt. A skirt which cannot fit enough petticoats underneath to achieve this shape is usually improper for the style. A Lolita skirt should be no shorter than 2"" above the knee.

, If you're wearing a jumper-skirt (Like a lolita dress, but sleeveless), wear a blouse underneath. Lolita fashion aims to be cute and modest and is not supposed to be a sexy style! Your skirt should go 1"" above the knee usually.


A Lolita dress for £200 will probably be worth it. Brands like Angelic Pretty and Baby The Stars Shine Bright will never let you down. Love them and look after anything you purchase from there. If you want cheaper brands with an effect that almost matches, look at Anna House and Metamorphose. When it comes to blouses, bloomers, and shoes, use Bodyline.

, An often ignored but vital key to a proper Lolita's attire, bloomers and petticoats should top every new Lolita's shopping list. A proper petticoat is necessary to achieve that bell shape that is so essential to the Lolita silhouette, while bloomers are necessary to retain a young Lolita's modesty.


You may be asking yourself, ""But why should I need such fancy undergarments if nobody else is going to see them?"" Because you are wearing a skirt in the shape of a bell. You may recall that if a real bell swings upwards, much as a bell-shaped skirt may do when a Lolita is moving around, the interior becomes quite visible. For a Lolita with naught but her hot pink Hello Kitty panties underneath, this is unacceptable. Wearing a set of matching bloomers keeps one's thighs--and all else--well protected from the casual eye.

, Though a Lolita's skirt may scandalously reveal her knees, a Lolita tends not to expose her legs too often, as this would be improper. It is generally good practice to cover one's legs at least up to the knee, which means wearing knee-length socks.


Other options include over-knee socks, stockings, and opaque tights. Sheer tights tend to be too ""sexy"" for Lolita, while ankle socks, especially those topped in lace, remind one too much of unassociated subcultures such as Sissy, and are simply less flattering on people's legs.

, The traditional footwear of choice for Lolitas is the Mary Jane, but similar options are available. A proper Lolita shoe should feature a closed, rounded toe as well as chunky, thick heels or platforms (although flats are also an option).


Boots fitting into this criteria are quite common with brands, though care must be taken not to go too edgy in one's boot choice. Another favorite style, owing to the popularity of Vivienne West-wood in Japan, are rocking horse shoes.
Socks are very important at the moment. In Lolita it is fashionable to have pretty, high socks. Prints on socks always look cute! Find prints with gingham, cakes/sweets, animals, bows, hearts, musical notes, etc.

, They have some things that could be modified with a little extra lace or ribbon that may turn out very nice.

, It must be a style suited to Lolita, such as pigtails or curls. If you think you would like to wear a wig for Lolita, make sure it does not look fake; get a high-quality one from eBay. Also important: make sure you have a fringe, and that it does not go over your eyes.


For headbands, try bows, bonnets, headdresses and flowers.

, Facial stickers are adorable, light pink blusher is a must-have! Eyelash extensions, if worn, must not be too long or else they will look bad.

, This is optional. Hello Kitty or other cute stuffed animals are a good way to go.

,,, Take Purikura pictures with your friends if you can! It's a great, fun activity.

Keep your uniform tasteful.,

Bring Bento for lunch.,A petticoat would be nice and is relatively unnoticeable

",How to Be a Lolita in a School Uniform," When you become a Lolita, you're representing every other Lolita of the world; so remember to leave a nice impression on people who are unfamiliar with the trend!


Shower regularly. Remember to use soap and invest in purchasing skin-care products for your face. Such as an exfoliator, everyday cleanser and oil-free moisturizer. Clear skin is a great thing to have. Even if you don't have it, getting into the routine of using these will lead you down the road to achieving it!
Brush at least twice a day; before going to bed and after waking up in the morning. Preferably with whitening toothpaste for a pearly smile! Don't forget to gently scrub your tongue afterwards. It removes the bacteria that causes bad breath!
Keep your nails free of dirt and trimmed to equal lengths. If you choose to polish your nails, make sure the color you use meets the school's uniform guidelines. Only wear bold colors such as black and red if you're going for a Gothic Lolita look. Clear and baby pink are perfect choices for Sweet Lolitas as they make your hands look very delicate.

Hair is a very important asset to keep in mind. Make sure you wash it in lukewarm, or, even cold water to prevent the scalp from drying up and secreting extra oil. Apply shampoo and conditioner according to your hair-type and needs, but ones with sweet scents are always nice!;
, Anything you'd primarily keep in a pencil-case is an article of stationery. Believe it or not, the contents of a person's pencil-case tell you a lot about them.


Keep your things clean and organized. If your pencil-case has compartments, use them. You should use the smaller one(s) for things like pens, pencils and erasers; whereas the larger one should be used to carry bigger items such as a calculator and ruler.
If your pencil-case is small, or doesn't have compartments, it's fine to mix everything together, as long as you keep the lids to your pens on tight and sharpen pencils in a waste-basket and not in your pencil-case. For convenience, it's best to buy a sharpener with a small container attached. The shavings fall into it and can easily be disposed of whenever you're ready/when the container becomes full.


Cute stationery would include, but are not limited to, anything with Japanese cartoon characters on them (such as Hello Kitty, Domo and Rilakkuma). The cutest erasers are the ones shaped like animals and food!

, If you haven't got one already! Backpacks are considered to be cuter than shoulder/messenger bags because most little kids take them to school. They're also the best choice in terms of comfort and are widely popular even amongst adults in Japan. If you just aren't a fan of backpacks, anything is fine!


Feel free to get creative with your bag. Add clip-on plush toys, buttons, sew-on patches and charms. Like your pencil-case, your bag tells people a lot about your personality, too!

, If you had the ""sexy school-girl"" look in mind, Lolita fashion is definitely not for you! Because of its focus around the 1800s' Victorian and Rococo era of fashion, Lolitas' wardrobes are elegant and modest.


Wear your uniform's skirt/dress at a respectable height; at or just above the knees are acceptable.
Avoid ankle-socks! At or above-the-knee are a good length. As for color, it depends on what your school finds appropriate. White is a common color for Lolita socks, but black is slimming and makes any uniform seem a little more Japanese. It's all up to your dress-code regulations, comfort and personal style!
Mary Janes are a must; they're adorably old-fashioned and really give the Lolita essence. Any black pair is fine, as long as the heels are at a minimum. Flat ones would be a good choice to avoid crossing a line and to walk comfortably.

, If you're allowed to do makeup, you can use it to enhance your Lolita look. Wear white eyeshadow around your tear ducts. Curl your eyelashes and wear mascara so that your eyelashes look really dark.

, But Lolita hairstyles are typically straight and/or curled; using either an iron or hair-rollers. This doesn't mean that you must straighten your hair to be classified as a Lolita! Wearing your hair as it looks naturally is great.



Pigtails are adorable, if your hair has the length for it! Especially if you have bangs of some sort. High pigtails are favored, but low ones are good, too.
Accessorise your hair with ribbons, bows and headbands! If you're a fan of wearing your hair down, a different bow everyday will keep people guessing and spice up your hair!
For a Gothic Lolita look, you may want to back-comb (or, tease) your hair for an edgy image.

, Bento is a Japanese boxed meal; usually consisting of steamed rice and various side dishes. Bento boxes can be purchased from stores that sell Japanese goods or simply online. It isn't required to eat Bento from an official 'Bento Box', it just adds to the atmosphere of the meal. Any regular, sterilized container will do!



Freshly cooked rice is preferred. Once it's finished steaming, let it cool down for a few minutes before packing it into your container.
Cook some side dishes (such as Steamed Vegetables, Teriyaki Chicken or anything else you feel like!) or re-heat leftovers. Once again, wait for them to cool and carefully pack them into your container. Try to avoid perishable or liquid-like food. Arranging your Bento in the shape of an animal or character is very cute! Seaweed pieces are great to be used as eyes.

Eating Bento with chopsticks is a lot more fun than with a fork. Give it a try!

Enjoy life itself.",How to Be a Mori Girl (Forest Girl)," Dresses and skirts are the main pieces of the style, but blouses and sweaters are also incorporated. The texture is very important, as most Mori girls wear knits, lace, gossamer, and cotton. Don't forget to layer; some girls wear long skirts under short dresses, or scarves and shawls over layers of sweaters and skirts.;
, Earth tone colors such as antique white, white, off-white, beige, brown, mauve, gray and ivory are popular with Mori girls. In addition, you can wear colors such as mustard, dark blue, bordeaux and dark green. Mostly use colors that you could find in a forest - keep the colors natural and calm.

, Clothing of the Mori girl is not body conscious. This means nothing fitted or that hugs the body. Instead of a S-M, pick an L-XL. Don't forget to layer your clothing. This will create a natural volume as well.

, Most Mori girl outfits have an element of layering to them. Layering can often be more difficult to pull off because it's easy to over-complicate it. Keep it simple. Start off by layering a dress with a skirt or layering two shirts. Layering does not mean you have to have many items on you. Remember that each layer should be partially visible and is adding to your outfit.


Mori girl is all about looking like you actually live in the forest, so you would probably want to keep cozy, right? To help achieve this cozy look, try layering tights, tall, scrunched wool socks, and granny boots or flats.

, Mori girl hair can be airy, straight, wavy, braided or put up. Just keep it natural. You can use lace or string to put into your hair. Flowers and berries are popular hair accessories.


Hair can be any style, as long as it looks natural. Waves, braids, buns, or low pigtails accessorized with flowers or lace are popular but work with your hair's natural texture and color, as this whole style focuses on looking natural and healthy.
No blow-dryer fried hair or white blonde dyes.

, Keep your eyeshadow in earthy tones. Perhaps don't wear any makeup at all. Keep your skin clean. Natural oil shampoos are great if you are into that.


Have rosy cheeks. Mori girls love nice round rosy cheeks. Use a red or pink blush for this look. A nice, muted pink color applied on the apples of your cheeks works best. Or, you can opt for a natural looking cheek.
Try to keep the look fresh-faced and natural. Use a good liquid foundation or BB cream, then set it with powder to give your skin a natural glow.
Do not wear circle lenses, unlike most Harajuku styles which idealize those big doe eyes. Just use a little mascara, or a white, brown, or pink eyeshadow if you have to wear any.
Keep your nails short, clean, and glossy, or paint them a pale pink or pearl color.
Try wearing a tinted lip balm instead of lipstick, as balm gives a more natural finish and stays on longer.

, Flowers are always good, in your hair, on your scarves or sweaters, or on your shoes! Lots of delicate and antique things like lace or cameo pendants, or jewelry featuring flowers are good. Necklaces, rings, and bracelets are primarily all you need and don't wear too much. A little goes a long way! Try going to a thrift store and looking through the jewelry for old-time finds.

, Are you a Mori girl? The original Mori girl community on Mixi created a checklist of 60 rules to find out if you are a true follower of this style.


Mori girls stop and enjoy life, travel by bike, and read in cafes or the woods.

Wear Jewelry.,
Have the attitude.",How to Be Hime Lolita," Pale pinks, baby greens, white, and cream are all basic colors. Then, there's mint greens and pale yellows and sometimes red or black. Basically, you want to look innocent-- like a little girl playing princess games or fairy games. Patterns are usually crowns, cupcakes, flowers, or butterflies. Once you have a couple of skirts/dresses in the color scheme, it's easy to accessorize. The skirt should maintain basic Loli rules-- bell or A-line shaped with a petticoat to hold it up. Frills and bows and mostly just above the knee. Sometimes hime skirts and dresses go below the knee.;
, White is always almost the best color to go with any skirt. And you don't have to buy a white blouse at a real Loli store. You can get them almost anywhere and add your own little collar, etc.

, Hair is one of the hardest parts, in many people's opinion. If you have short hair (Shoulder length or chin length) don't worry! You can still do hime hair, although it won't be as big as other dos, unless you use extensions. For people with shorter hair, try curling it and adding a little bow or tiara. Pigtails always look nice. An example of a cut has a fringe and long side-bangs. If you have long hair, curl part of your hair and tease the rest of it up into a beehive like hair style. This hair is practically the same as Himegyaru hair, and there are lots of tutorials on the net for that. Always add a tiara, bow, headband or cute clip.

, A lot of people get stuck on the winter wear. A coat with a shape that fits nicely over the bell or A-line shaped skirt and a long-sleeved blouse is all you need. You can wear stockings instead of socks if you want, and find some boots and a hat that match your coat. Simple!

, The socks should be knee socks, but they can also be ankle socks. They can be lacy, have frills or bows attached or just a cute pattern such as cakes or striped. Make sure they match the rest of your outfit though. Shoes are like any other Loli style. Mary Janes with a heel, or flats, or even Rocking Horse Shoes. Sometimes you can get good deals at a normal shoe shop. Such as flats with a small bow decoration or heeled pastel colored boots. As long as they go with the outfit and seem girly and 'princess-y' it's good!

, Bows, tiaras, flowers and frills are all you need. Add a tiara, maybe get a necklace with a rose or bow on it. You can get lots of rings with little bows on them. Look on the net for ideas. Makeup is easy. You don't need much, just enough to make you look fresh and innocent. So rosy, rosy cheeks! Eyeliner to open up the eye. White eyeliner in the corner and waterline of your eye really makes them look big. Some people like false eyelashes and some just use a lot of mascara. Pink lip-gloss also works very well. Nail art is very popular in Hime. You can buy fake nails, or get your real nails done professionally.

, Gold or silver Jewelry is perfect for this. Maybe a bracelet, a necklace or some cute gold earrings. Keep it limited, but not so much so it looks like no jewelry at all!

, Just be your self. As in everything you do, try to have good manners in front of rude people, remember you are a better person and don't need to go to their low levels to make them shut up. But most of all be yourself, there's no attitude code for ANY type of Lolita.

Research gyaru.,
Choose your type of gyaru.,
Wear the clothes.,
Apply the appropriate makeup.,
Do your hair.,
Accessorize!,
Enjoy gyaru media.,
Live the gyaru lifestyle.",How to Become a Gyaru," Gyaru is defined by it's uprooting of typical Japanese beauty standards- pale skin, dark hair, neutral coloured clothing and subtlety. Ergo, gyaru fashion is all about darkly bronzed faces, extreme makeup, bright fashion and comes with it's own culture of rebelling against society, not conforming. Gyaru culture is about being youthful and ""out-there"", an emphasis on hanging out with friends over impressing guys, partying, owning your sexuality, being rebellious and having fun. Some say gyaru was an exaggerated representation of American teenaged party culture. For some information on history and culture, read articles online.;
, While there are many different types, they often encompass the same things. The following is only a few types, look online for more.


Ganguro: Influenced most by ""black culture"" and hip-hop culture from the mid-90's and early 2000s. Always needs dark makeup and bleached hair.
Kogyaru/Kogal: The ""ko"" in it's name comes from the Japanese word for ""child"", meaning this form of gyaru is all about looking cute and young. It involves wearing forms of school uniforms with alterations (eg. loose socks, short skirts).
Yamanba: Uses thick, bright and colourful eye makeup for an almost ""panda"" effect and symbols from pop culture (especially Disney characters)
Manba: Uses beach-wear eg. strappy bright sundresses and sandals, and equally colourful hair highlights and tanned skin.
Banba: Similar to manba, but takes inspiration from Barbie. Has naturally coloured hair and slightly lighter skin, and uses a lot of pink.
Ganjiro: A more common form of gyaru that follows the culture and trends but doesn't use the same dark skin.
Tsuyome: A more subtle version of Manba/Banba that uses less heavy makeup.
Onee-gyaru: A classier form of gyaru for older women and girls who wanted to retain their style but also look more professional. Subdued but still takes from American culture.
B-Gyaru: A style that is all about looking like an African-American R&B artist by wearing cornrows and painting their skin brown. Not recommended, since this classifies as blackface and is offensive.
Hime-gyaru: A style of gyaru that's all about looking like a ""hime"" (princess). A lot of pearls, expensive products and frills are involved.

, From the above list, you should have a rough idea of what clothes you should be getting. If you're looking at hime-gyaru or another romantic style, go for pastels and pearls and glamour. If you're going for something like Manba, you're better off raiding thrift shops for cute, bright clothes. Things from the early 2000s and the 90's are great, the more colourful and cheesy the better. Look online for inspiration and more information, since there's so many variations.

, This is arguably the most important part of the fashion. While many gyaru styles involve just simple bronzer, falsies, light lipstick and contouring, many go above and beyond. If this applies to you, you'll need dark bronzer, large false eyelashes in various colours (even metallic or glittery ones), strong white eyeshadow or highlighter in the brightest and strongest colour you can get, a big colourful eyeshadow palette, both white and black eyeliner and pale lipstick. Use images online and copy those at first as you find what you like best. Some people prefer the white panda-eye effect, others like to wear just a little white eyeshadow around the eyes, some like intense and in-your-face obvious contouring along the nose in white eyeliner, others like the natural subtle look, some like flashy false eyelashes in crazy colours and textures, other prefer a simple black one along the upper lash line. You get the idea: gyaru can be as extreme or as subtle as it needs to be. However, put focus on the eyes and make them look as big as you can. False eyelashes are a must.

, Think big, beachy and bright. Many gyarus wear wigs which is especially helpful if your hair is thin or you don't want it permanently bleached. You can buy wigs online, but don't be tempted to buy a cheap party wig. They are usually bad-quality, shiny and not suitable for fashion. If you choose to use your natural hair, it's traditional to bleach it to blonde, light orange or colour it a pastel colour. Hairstyles include a lot of hairspray, waves and curls, sideswept fringes and are usually a considerable length. Use things like plastic hairclips and scrunchies if your style permits, or for a more feminine look use tiaras and silver headbands.

, Gyarus like ridiculously long manicures with plenty of decoration on them. You can recreate this style by using false nails, glitter, tiny beads/rhinestones and a bright coloured nail-polish. You can pretty much ""gyaru-ify"" anything you wear like earmuffs, handbags, necklaces etc. by gluing on rhinestones and trinkets. An especially common trait in gyarus is their dramatically glitzy phones- the process of adding bling to your phone or iPod is called ""decoden"" in Japan (a mixture of the word ""deco"" for decoration and ""denwa"" which is phone). You can look online for tutorials in making such a phone-case or buy them online from sites like eBay or Etsy.

, Since gyaru isn't as popular as it once was, many gyaru-centred magazines have been discontinued. The most famous gyaru magazine was ""EGG"", which you can still find copies of online. Older versions focus more on Manba than the more subtle styles, and of course all the articles are written in Japanese. However there are photoshoots, street fashion, makeup tutorials and other fun stuff that you can enjoy even if you can't speak the language. Since gyaru takes a lot of inspiration from American culture, things like R&B music, 90's pop, Disney movies etc. are all relevant to gyaru.

, Being a gyaru is all about owning yourself and being confident. If you're of age, many gyarus would go clubbing and partying on the weekends. They also owned their own sexuality and didn't stigmatise casual sex. Being a gyaru is all about having fun and being crazy while you still can, so own it!

Music is what visual Kei is all about!,
Become Visual.,
Hygiene comes first.,
Use foundation.,
Wear eye makeup!,
Add jewels and other items.,
Lips.",How to Be Visual Kei," Before diving into it, you should first be familiar with what it actually is. You should be a fan to multiple Japanese rock and/or Visual Kei bands, understand the particular sound and why they dress the way they do. Again, to many people this can become an awesome lifestyle, not just a pretty fashion statement!


There is plenty of information available on the Internet, you can download music (But please don't forget to buy it, too! Support the artists you love!), join online forums on the subject, and much more! There are also other sources you can learn from, such as Japanese Rock magazines. (Shoxx, Cure, Purple Sky, etc.) Many of these magazines have excellent information on every aspect of Visual Kei, and feature countless bands that may end up sparking your interest.
Also realize that many fans of Visual Kei can be much different than ordinary fans of the more western music. Their love for the bands are deep and loyal; Don't be afraid to really learn about band members and be dorky talking to other Visual Kei fans about them! You may even be inspired to pick up an instrument!

To get even more into it, it's always fun to not just listen to the music, but watch videos as well. Not only Music videos, but backstage clips, special commercials, videos for the fan club, etc. Something very different, and usually only Visual Kei bands do, possibly for more exposure. But all the same, this can be entertaining in itself and can help you understand how and where other Visual Kei fans pick up some mannerisms that may seem a bit odd to outsiders.



, Now for the Visuals! After becoming part of the Visual Kei fan base, you'll probably be interested in looking like your favorite artists. You should start out by doing just that; reflecting the looks of bands! Once you get used to the way it looks and feels on you, then you should start to create your own, unique look. Do plenty of research into types of visual Kei, since there are a lot of them. It's a style that blankets a whole range of different looks, so pick the one you want before you change., Before starting anything, you should be clean! Be sure your hair looks soft and groomed, not oily or fried. Have a fresh face. Use a gentle scrub to clear away any dead skin and oil, and pat dry. You may want to use just a little bit of moisturizer to keep your skin from looking too dry and this can also make applying makeup a bit easier. After you're all ready, clip back your hair to keep it out of your face.;
, Usually, Visual Kei makeup looks pale. However, not many bands now days go for the full white face-paint look, but there's not anything wrong with doing that, either. For a complete white face, don't over-apply! This can cause it to look cakey. Use a makeup sponge to spread it evenly over your face for a clean finish. If you want even more of a ghostly glow, you can apply a small amount of powder. If you can't find any powder foundations light enough, baby powder can work wonders. For the more common look, you should choose a liquid foundation one or two shades lighter than your actual skin-tone, but not any lighter than that–it'll end up looking unnatural and awkward. You might want to choose a foundation with little or no oil, because it can be uncomfortable and tends to look heavy. Water-based ones are much better, lighter, and sometimes cheaper. You may be able to spread your foundation with your fingers, but to avoid any streaking you'd probably be better off with a makeup sponge. After evenly applying your liquid foundation, make sure there are no obvious streaks or lines, and apply a small amount of powder foundation or shimmer. If you wish to manipulate lighting, or the shape of your face you should have even lighter and darker foundations handy. To accentuate features, use darker foundation on those places such as cheekbones, on your jawline and around your nose. To give a bit more light, elegant look you can use lighter foundation on the bridge of your nose, your brow area, and cheeks.

, This is probably the most important part of the process, so be sure to make it interesting, but still tasteful. Let's separate this up, even more to make it understandable to even the most clueless of people. =D


Eyeshadow. The makeup can be applied in whatever order you want, but personally, it's less hassle. Putting down the color first can create less of a mess, later. Digressing! Depending on how eccentric you want to look, it's always best to have a wide range of colors at hand. If you only plan on using one color, you might want to have different shades of that single color. First apply the base color onto the eyelid, usually going to the outside, or nearly to the brow for a bold look. Next, take a darker shade and apply it to only the top of your lid, blending with the lighter shadow. To enhance your eyes further, you could use a small amount of shadow on the bottom lid, near the outer corner and blend. Eyeshadow isn't really a big task, so you should just experiment with what looks best on you.
Eyeliner. This is key to making your eyes amazing! There are many different looks to choose from. You could look natural and elegant, bold, eerie, or anything you could come up with. First, apply black or colored eyeliner (pencil or liquid) to the inner-most part of your eye and close to the lashline of your top eyelid, to avoid any odd spaces of color, then apply thicker, to your liking. People with single eyelids, or 'Asian' eyes should probably cover most of their eyelid to get the same desired 'thick' look. A popular look is the 'panda' look, where the eyeliner is raised thicker and farther beyond the eye. It is very common in Visual Kei for eyeliner to go passed the corner of your eye for a certain look. This look could make your eyes seem thinner, more seductive, menacing, or cuter depending on how you apply it. For a darker look, eyeliner can be applied to the bottom lid but there is such a thing as 'too much' there, so be careful not to over-do it. Again, to make your eyes stand out more, you can apply eyeliner to the outer corner of your eye, growing thinner as you go along the bottom lid. Sometimes, using white, or lighter colored eyeliner on your bottom lid can give a nice touch and/or contrast. Don't forget to be creative! Feel free to create designs, or use different colors against the others for a more drastic look.
Heavy, intricate eye makeup is a bit difficult to do every morning if you're in a hurry, so if you want to be quick about it, why not try experimenting with a more everyday look? Something as simple as surrounding your eye with black eyeshadow for a smoky look and wearing concealer and gloss on your lips can look great for daily wear.

, Jewels are always a nice and fun touch to finish off your eyes. You can place them along the bottom of your eye, in a row down the side, across your nose to the other eye, anything you can think of! You can get jewels at any craft store, or anywhere where cosmetics are sold. They may come with glue or you may need to use your own. A dandy ol' glue stick could probably do fine, and eyelash glue works perfectly! Remember, in visual Kei the sky's the limit. Look as weird as you please. Other items can be used, such as buttons, glitter, bits of fabric, fishnet/mesh - even tinfoil! If you like how it looks, go for it. Another wonderful touch for your eyes is false eyelashes. Be as tame or as wild as you want. Usually, the crazier-looking lashes are easiest to find during Halloween. If you want to add some extra pop to your eye makeup, why not even try circle lenses in a variety of natural or unnatural colours?

, Usually, a nice gloss will finish off your look, but if you want to go further, that's just spiffy! Some darker bands will smear makeup, usually black, from their lips to the side of their face. While this is easy and can look great, it must be remembered that this is often ridiculed by older members of the scene due to its connections with cosplay and amateurish outfits. Others will make their lips pale and only color the inner portion of the mouth for a creepy, rigid look. For a full effect, you could always use lipliner, though it can be tricky so keep at it. Again, you can just be creative with your lips: Line them with black and color it in white, only color half your mouth, color beyond your actual lips, anything you want.

Pick a music genre.,
Do your research.,
Ask people.,
Browse.,
Find what you like.,
Get to know your local bands!",How to Find Awesome Music (for Scene Kids)," If you only know one or two genres, you won't have as wide a variety of music to choose from - and you won't know much about music. Do some research, and pick one or two genres that you think you'll probably like. Always remember to experiment; you never know when you might come across something great! These are the typical Scene Kid genres:


Alternative Rock and Pop Punk
Glam Rock and Metal

Skate Punk, Electronic Punk Rock
Metalcore, Deathcore, Hair Metal
Indie
Techno, Dance, Trance, Posicore (Positive Hardcore), Crunkcore, Electronica/Electro,Dubstep, Nightcore;
, The more you know about these types of music, the more likely you are to find something really great. You may look at a genre name and think nothing of it, but it might be just the type of music for you. Select a few genres and do some research on them - find out their history, style, popular artists and bands, etc.

, If your friends are into the Scene, ask them to recommend you a couple of bands or singers. Don't be shy or embarrassed - you may discover some really great music. If you know anyone else who might know some music you might like, ask them who their favourite singers or bands are.

, When you're hanging around in the mall with some spare time, step into a good music store. Check out the different genre sections and look around; you may find something that you really like or would like to try out. You may want to look at genres that you know you like, or just pick at random. Don't be afraid to experiment and try something new - you won't get anywhere otherwise!

, If you're really into a certain singer or band, try finding someone who is a little like them; for example: if you really like a certain artist, try listening to someone who's voice or style is a little like theirs. You may find another great artist or band that you haven't discovered before. Try some online music recommendation sites like last.fm.com or ilike.com. they will take what you listen to and try to find similar artists.

, Find underground bands, so you know them before they get famous, and go to local shows, even if you have no idea who is playing. Go with your scene friends to any other shows. Seeing bands play before they are really famous is a great way to actually get to know and talk with the band members personally - who knows, if you wanted to get into playing guitar or bass, they might be able to give you a few pointers!

You don't have to wear them all the time, just for some of your pictures. Most scene queens on Facebook will have varying hair. You can dye your hair, preferably black or platinum blonde with a few bright coloured streaks. Or you can go all one crazy colour, the choice is yours. Also coontails look really cool. Be creative! You can keep your natural colour, you can still be just as scene as everyone else as long as the style is right. Remember there are many popular scene girls on Facebook with natural hair colours.;
, You should have specific clothes for taking photos. Make sure they are your best clothes. Look around at what your favourite scene girls are wearing. Your clothes for photos can be a little different to your usual. Some good clothing for scene photos are


Baggy band t-shirts. (They go great over shorts)
Long tops over cool tights
Cute, bright, fitted logo tops. (Anything Hello Kitty, Gir, #* Domo, or with dinosaurs saying ""Rawr"" is perfect)


Even if you don't usually wear high heels they can look great in scene photos when you are in cool poses







,, They are really good for photos. Get them in neon colours, animal print etc. Be unique with them though!

, Accessories are REALLY important when it comes to taking scene photos for your page. Hair bows, lots of beaded bracelets, head bands, cute necklaces, loads!

, But be creative, do what you want, just remember when taking photos you must look your best, so add some!

, Piercings are very scene. You don't have to get one but get a few fake ones just for some of your photos. They look great and are very scene.

, It's important to have a good camera for taking scene photos as the modeling sites look for high quality photos. You don't have to get something outrageously expensive, just one good enough for taking clear photos. Just don't use a bad phone camera.

, It's fairly straight forward.

, Use your scene name. If you already have an account, it's a good idea to make a new one specially for site modeling and adding other scene kids. Keep your old account for close family and friends.

, You should look your best in your profile photo. Make sure your hair and make-up is perfect and that you look great in it.


Use props in your photos. Anything cute is perfect. Cupcakes, stuffed toys, fruit (such as apples), lollipops etc.
If you have any food, put it in your mouth as if you are about to eat it
If you have a stuffed toy, hug it, kiss it or cuddle it. If you have a lollipop pose with it, don't just put it in your mouth. If it is large use tilt it upward to cover one of your eyes or purse your lips and press it to them.
Take cool original photos. Be unique! Take inspiration from other scene models but don't copy them! Gothic style photos can look great and be very scene most of the time. Have varying photos. Some very bright and happy, others darker and more mysterious.
Pose! Pose in lots of cool and unique ways. Blow kisses, text, put on huge sunglasses and play around with them, tousle your hair. Do whatever looks good!

, Don't worry if you don't get accepted, just send out lots of applications to different modeling sites (make sure they are looking for scene/emo models and you have all the requirements). Make sure you look really good in all your application photos and that you have one proof picture.

, Take as many photos as needed and enter competitions. Get known! Start adding other scene kids. If you don't know any of the scene kids personally don't give out any personal information! They might not be who they say they are!

,
Only get a Myspace or Facebook if you're not going to paste yourself everywhere as a scene kid, you will only look like a poser.,
Don't say you're scene.,
Finally, if you follow all these steps you will not be unique because the thousands of people before you are also doing this to be ""Unique"" the only true way to be unique is to be yourself in every way possible.",How to Be Scene Without Being a Poser," Colorful with extensions is good and looks scene. If you type in scene kids on Photobucket the majority of them are colorful with a good hair style.;
, Do whatever you want with it, but do keep in mind that in order to look ""scene"" it is best to get razored, choppy, short layers on the top of your hair so you can tease it, or spike it, or gel it anyway you want. The typical puffy-top hair is what many scene girls aspire to have. So keep a fairly good length but add plenty of layers, regardless of what every single scene person out there has.

, Wear skinny jeans. Keep them fairly long, but make sure they are not TOO tight. Don't be afraid to wear crazy, random, bright jeans! Get some with prints on them! Be bold! The same goes for T-Shirts. Scene kids are known for being random and loud and for having a don't-give-a-crap attitude. Cartoons and characters like Hello Kitty are really big in the scene world, but don't limit yourself.

, Keep them simple up top though. Its acceptable to wear short shorts! Just make sure you feel comfortable wearing them.Be crazy and unexpected

, Keep it simple but if your going to accessorize let it be belts, belly button rings, bracelets and cute necklaces!!

, Take good care of your hair and skin and nails. Paint your nails different colors, sometimes multicolored. Again, bright and bold are good colors to try. Neon colors may also work.

, Start off with a good, clean foundation, that matches your skin tone.The more the merrier. Some scene kids like the pale look, but don't go so far you look like a clown! Wear black eyeliner, or other odd colors, on the top AND bottom eyelids, but only make the line about 3 mm thick on the top, and about 2 mm thick on the bottom. Cover the corners of your eyes, front and back and end with a little cat-eye. Eye-shadow is fine. Its also fine to wear two or more colors at once and its cool to add little patterns are the edge of you eyes like a little star or three dots or something like that.

,, If you do, don't drab it with stupidity. Keep it simple and personal. Also, don't try to hard, as this will make you seem like a poser. If you decide to use some specifically scene words (such as uber, stellar, legend, wild, roar, or kid, or adding extra letters to the ends of words ex: kid with two d's) don't overdo it and don't start using scene lingo just out of the blue.

, The best thing to do is never ever ever say out loud you are a scene kid that just annoys people.

, You are the only you out there. Unique people are just people who know who they really are. The vast majority of people are trying to hard to be unique so the vast majority becomes the vast majority. Never forget you can be amazing if aren't already.

They look great with denim shorts. Most sandals aren't very scene, except strappy or studded ones, but maybe you could start a new trend! Metallic ballet flats look great with tutus and bright shorts so pick up a few pairs.






Try something new. Instead of wearing skinny jeans, try mini skirts, cut-off skinnies (for girls), denim capris (also girls) and combats. Bright shorts are a must for the summer. Also buy a tartan mini skirt and match it up with colorful neon leggings. Topshop also makes shorts that are super cute. You should also look for colored minis and patterned shorts at secondhand stores.





;
, Try using hair mousse instead of gel. Hair mousse is more lightweight and still holds you hair in place. Go for a new shorter cut. Instead of leaving your hair long try a shorter cut with dramatic bangs.Layers, Layers and more layers! instead of traditional black (which absorbs more heat, making you hotter, causing you to sweat more and get oilier hair), go platinum blonde, or a bright color. Get funky and creative! Just keep the color away from darks. If you want to keep your hair long and layered, try wearing your hair in a low ponytail, or use a stylish sweatband to keep hair layers out of your face. You can also buy matching wristbands. Bobby Pins, Bows and your five year old sister's hair clips are a must. ALWAYS tease your top layers no matter what hairstyle your have.

, Maybelline Ultra Liner in black is the absolute best liquid eyeliner around for summer. It's waterproof, and when you do wash it off, it doesn't get in your eyes and sting. Waterproof mascara, however, is often clumpy and not very dark. Wear mineral make-up. It is all round better for your skin. Always dust translucent powder over your foundation when you are done.


Wear as little makeup as possible. If you can, try to stick with a foundation, eyeliner, and mascara makeup agenda. It's also the new scene thing to wear cupid lips.







, This will complete every scene girl outfit. Lots of cute colourful bracelets, cute barrettes and bows, colorful hairbands, studded belts, cute charm necklaces and of course NEVER forget your huge sunglasses!

Pick skinny jeans of any color of the rainbow.,
Find band t-shirts to achieve the ""scene"" look.,
Wear converse or VANS shoes.,
Be creative with accessories.,
Tease your hair for school.,
Wear makeup, as long as your school allows it.",How to Dress Scene for School," From fiery red to the darkest black- pretty much anything will do. Try to stay away from the skinny jeans with animal prints on them while going to school. Patterns can sometimes look like you're trying too hard. But other than that- yellow, orange, green, blue, purple and many other colors will be just fine! Skinny jeans or straight legged jeans are the best if you're aiming for that ""scene"" look. Oh- ACID WASHED skinnies are good too!;
, You can find band tees practically anywhere- from Hot Topic to Wet Seal. You could try all different colors of V-necks too. Sea foam green V-necks with purple tanks under look stellar. Even though they are expensive- shirts from ZOOYORK, DC, and VANS are cool too! You can wear layered tanks with bright jackets over too. Try layering white, gray, and black tanks with a bright yellow jacket over. You can pretty much wear whatever you wish, but try to stay away from ""preppy"" labels like American Eagle and Hollister. If you can't resist from buying from these brands, try to steer clear of the shirts with their NAME BRAND written on them!

, If you're really artistic and want ""one-of-a-kind"" shoes, buy a pair of white Converse and a pack of Sharpies and decorate them however you want. Replace the laces on your shoes whenever you get sick of your old ones. It can really give shoes a brand new look without spending too much money. DC's are really nice too. Also, every ""scene"" girl should own at least 2 pairs of flats, as they go great with everything Blue, green, pink, gray... they come in handy, so stock up on them.

,

Belts: All or close to all of your belts should be studded. They can be any color: from black to white, red to blue, green to purple and rainbow. Wear belts that are the same color as little designs on your band tees. It really makes the color pop.






Hair accessories: Buy cute bows from Hot Topic, Wet Seal, and Pac-sun. They come in almost every color. Whenever you're done doing your hair, grab a matching bow and clip it in your fringe or the opposite side of your fringe. Buy headbands stretchy or regular, whichever you prefer. Whenever you put regular headbands, make sure you don't pull your fringe back, as it completely takes away the look. Also, buy bobby pins to put in your fringe while you grow it out or if you just like the way it looks. Little clips are adorable too.






Jewelry: You can wear pretty much any jewelry and make it look good. Wear necklaces that have things like Hello Kitty, Invader Zim and Gir, Strawberry Shortcake, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Brass Knuckles, Guns, Crowns, Diamonds, Owls, and anything else you like on them. Wear a few bracelets too! Neon Silly-Bands are cute, but never overdo it. ""BFF"" Bracelets and rubber ones too are adorable. Wear little silver rings or something with a character on it. EXAMPLE- But only wear a Hello Kitty ring if you're wearing a Hello Kitty shirt. Necklaces, watches, and bracelets are fine to wear.







, Try to tone it down some; you're not going to a concert. Try not to wear your clip-in coon tails to school either. Little clip in colored extensions and regular extensions are fine, but nothing too ridiculous. Plus, some schools have rules that you can't dye your hair crazy colors, so extensions are a good way to go! Use little bows and clips and headbands. If you use all these elements right; you can look amazing.

, Try to use basics: concealer, foundation, powder, eyeshadow and mascara if you can. You can wear your eyeliner thick, but don't make yourself look like a raccoon. With the mascara and eyeliner, try to stick with black and dark blues if you will. Tone down the eye makeup. Stick with whites and grays, and a few bright colors. But try not to make your eyes look like the rainbow, especially if you are young, like going into junior high. Know the basics: clean-looking face, pretty eyes with mascara, nude lips, and a little bit of blush. Not too much- you'll look like a clown.

Decide what cut to get.,
Ask your stylist for input when you get the cut.,
Consider adding some color.,
Prepare to style the look.,
Preheat the flat iron.

,
Spray your hair with flat iron protection.,
Starting a little closer to the root, slowly move the flat iron down your hair to the end.,
Bind back the part you straightened with a hairband so it doesn't get in the way.,
Pin the layer most on the top over to the other side.,
Take the top layer down and spray with hairspray.,
Accessorize.",How to Do a Scene Fringe," Here are many different styles of scene hair that you can use. Some have bangs that are thick and dragged from the back. Some are short and choppy layered and some are blunt. Most that you can find on Google have deep parts with the one side pulled over in front of the eyes and cut diagonally. The bottom layer should be long and reach far, but if it isn't, you can use extensions of about any color since scene hair has many different colors. The top layers should be fringe and layered.;
, Look up on Google to get some ideas and when you visit your hairstylist, ask about what looks best on you in this department.

, If you have parents who allow you to dye your hair however you like, then you should try adding some color. any color will work! If you have parents who have a little more restriction, blonde on the bottom and a darker color on the top look really cool.

, You have the cut done and now want to style it. Pull up the top layers of your hair and pin them. You should leave the long part down if you have extensions, skip this part.

,, This will ensure that your hair looks straight but avoids the problems that come with it, like frizz and split ends.

, Do this all around the head.

, Let down the part you had previously pinned up and lift the top layers. Spray voluminous spray directly on the roots and press up with fingers.

, Using a comb, tease hair by pulling the comb upwards towards your roots, starting at the root itself. spray with hairspray as you go. tease it as high as you want to go. and remember that this is a lengthier process in order to make it look good.

, If you need to add a little bit of teasing to this area, do so. If you have bangs, you can straighten them to the side or in the front or leave them as you wish.

, You can add clips and large bows to hair or sometimes it looks better to leave it plain.

Know what scene is.,
Get the attitude right.,
Go ahead and start getting into the music.,
Start the process.,
Okay, near the end of June, start adding in some hairclips, bows, and headbands, but not a lot!,
It should be around Mid-July.,
It should be August now.,
It should be September now.,
Enjoy your new self, beautiful!

",How to Become Scene over the Summer," It's not just something that happens, and its not something that will be cheap. Becoming scene takes time and a lot of money, so start saving up your allowance. If you make it too quick you will most likely be called a poser. And you don't want to be there. Just look at Jessi Slaughter! She was a young girl who acted like she was scene on Youtube and ended up making a fool of herself. You do NOT want to end up like that.;
, A lot of people think scene kids are rude and self-absorbed, but this isn't always the case. You need to show people how nice you are. Most scene kids seem to be random and bubbly, but DON'T be something you aren't. Fitting into a trend isn't worth losing yourself. Try not to overwhelm people, or you will annoy them. Also try to be really confident. Embrace your flaws! Know that nobody is perfect. Know that you are beautiful. Just don't turn into a total jerk.

, Don't go all screamo or anything yet, unless you already listen to it. Start out with something softer like All Time Low, NeverShoutNever, Avril Lavigne, Greenday, Breathe Carolina, or Paramore. If you love pop, Lady Gaga is great. Dubstep and Electronic music, such as Skrillex and Deadmau5, is also becoming really popular with scene kids. But don't listen to it if you don't want to. You can listen to whatever you want, it doesn't make you more or less scene if you listen to Britney Spears.

, It should be around June, or sometime near the end of the school year.

Your hair should have layers - lots of them! But if you don't already have them, don't get any if you don't want to, since it's the end of the school year and you might not be able to show off your looks to your friends or guys or anything. But at least get it trimmed. Try a new style. If your hair is long, maybe get it cut short, or if it's short, start growing it out. Again, you can do whatever you want. But choose a style that fits your hair type and your face shape.






For clothes, start with some regular, denim-blue skinny jeans. Skinny jeans should be apart of your everyday outfit! Since it's summer, though, you can wear shorts. Denim is great, and plaid ones are also super cute. You could also wear denim skirts, they look more scene if they have the raggedy threads hanging off the bottom. Get some graphic t-shirts, maybe a few with Spongebob and Hello Kitty, but don't get too many yet. Get band t-shirts, but only for bands you listen to, or you could get embarrassed later on. You could also try plaid shirts, since they are becoming popular among scenesters. V-necks are also popular,but they're more of a guy trend, so don't wear them everyday. And for shoes, for now, wear flip flops, but only for summertime, since scene kids aren't normally known for wearing them, but if you like them, wear them whenever! Also get a pair of flats, just one pair is all you need for now. Get black or white. And for accessories, just a bracelet or two is fine, and maybe the occasional necklace.






Wear your hair however you like, just don't tease it often, especially if your hair isn't layered! It won't come out right! And makeup: not too much yet: just some eyeshadow, a thin coat of eyeliner, mascara, and lip gloss is good enough.







, Bows should stay small for now.


Wear what you wore in earlier June, maybe adding in a few more graphic t-shirts of pop culture characters. You should be wearing shorts on a daily basis, since it's probably getting really hot. You should have tank tops somewhere in your wardrobe. Shoes- flip flops, flats, sandals. For accessories, invest in a pair of big sunglasses. Not the kind at the Dollar Store. Some good ones can be bought at Claires, Hot Topic, or Wet Seal.
For makeup, eyeliner can get a bit thicker, eyeshadow a bit darker, lip gloss more sparkly.
And music, start listening to Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, Evanescence, Metallica, or things of that nature.

, Keep saving up that money, you're gonna need it soon! Get more shirts, more Care Bears, Tinkerbell, and Barbie. Get some colored shorts now, like red or pink. You can even invest in a new tutu, now, if you want! Not like the ones ballerinas wear, but some good ones can be found at Claires, Hot Topic and other stores. Get another pair of flats, something bright, but that will match a lot of stuff you have in your closet, like yellow, pink, or red. Get bigger bows, maybe a studded belt. Add a few more jelly bracelets to your accessories, and maybe even wear a silly band or two every once in a while.


Your makeup shouldn't get much heavier than it already is, especially with the humid weather but you should wear concealer or foundation, since the weather is hot and you are more like likely to get zits. Do your makeup near a window, it helps!
For music, try Korn, Slipknot, Insane Clown Posse, and Red Hot Chili Peppers.

, I hope you've been saving up money, because now you need it. You're gonna need to buy a TON of clothes for school. Wear denim blue or black skinny jeans and maybe a white pair. Wear any super cute top you own, especially band shirts, plaid shirts, and graphic shirts. Get a pair of Converse, any color, but get something that matches a lot of the clothes you already own. You can get another pair of flats, but you don't have to. Also get a pair of Vans. If you're up for a change, you can get a pair of Nike or Adidas slides and wear them with colored socks! You should get some leggings, black, white, and any bright colors and patterns you can find! Wear them with a tutu or a denim skirt. You could also wear knee- or thigh-high socks with a skirt. Get some bracelets- jelly bracelets, chunky rubber bracelets, and even just a few silly bandz. Get a necklace with something like Hello Kitty, a bat, skull and crossbones, or a diamond outline-shape.


For hair, you should get layers, lots of layers! If you want to dye your hair, dye the whole thing, but not an unnatural color, not yet, anyway. Try chocolate brown or platinum blonde. Wear bows, hair clips, thick headbands, stretchy headbands, a tiara- anything!
Also, don't forget- you need to be confident, bubbly, and sweet, all at the same time.

, If you don't already have a studded belt, get one! Get some bright, new laces for your shoes. It's a good way to make them look new without spending a lot of money. You could also doodle all over them if you get bored with them or if they just become old. You should get a few pairs of colored skinny jeans, hot pink and red are MUSTS! You could also try acid washed jeans. Or even patterned jeans! Just not too many, or you might look tacky, which is not the look you want. For shirts, just get more band tees. Get a new hoodie, too. It can be black, red, plain, patterned, anything you like! A cute idea is getting a hoodie with devil horns on it, and wearing the hood up on your head. If you're looking for a new pair of shoes, maybe get some boots, like Uggs. For accessories, get a tiara, if you didn't already. If you have glasses, get nerd glasses. Wear a bunch of jelly bracelets all at once. Wear one or two necklaces.


Get a hair trim regularly. If you want to dye your hair, get streaks, any color like blue, pink, purple, red, etc. Or you could dye the whole thing. If you can't dye your hair, get extensions. But never wear feathers, those are so out-of-style now.
For makeup, wear anything you like, as long you don't look like a raccoon, or worse- a clown.
For music, you can listen to anything now, from the soft acoustic of NeverShoutNever to screamo like Brokencyde. And remember, you don't have to listen to what you don't want to listen to. So you can still listen to your Britney Spears.
Keep up your attitude and keep saving up money, because you're gonna need to go to the mall a lot.

The hair: This is one of the most important things when it comes to being scene.,

Scene kids typically go for a layered choppy look. They also tend to put crazy colors like hot pink,neon blue,lime green, or even rainbow in their hair. If you don't have the money to buy expensive colorful hair dye, You can always use kool aid to dye it, But what ever part you're dying must be a light color or you must bleach it. You can find tutorials of this on YouTube. If your parents won't let you dye your hair, Try to convince them that you want to stand out of the crowd and be yourself, if that doesn't work you always have the hair style!;
, Scene clothing is loud and proud! Skinny jeans are a necessity, Band tee's are loved, Girls love to wear tutu's cute short poofy dresses, skinny jeans,and skirts. Guys usually go for skinny jeans,and in the summer shorts or capris. V necks are also a must have!

And you can always cut up some shirts you get from resale shops to make them look cool, Also adding some safety pins or cute buttons adds to it. For shoes, Converse,vans,and ballet flats.

, Music is how a scene kid lives, if you don't know the music, you're going to be called a poser. Some music to try are Millionaires, Blood on the Dance Floor, BrokeNCYDE, Owl City and Scene Kidz.

, In a way you're more mysterious. You blush a lot, and sometimes mess up when you say stuff. You get easily embarrassed, and hate getting called on to answer something in class. The outgoing scene girl: The outgoing scene girl usually talks A LOT, and makes friends with ANYONE. She usually says random things like ""Hey, where did my mustache go?..""

Keep your eyes open for unusual items in high street shops.,
Look out for all sorts of urban markets or shops anywhere.,
Try commercial stores to see what you can find.,
Look at websites online.,
Do it yourself.,
Use flags.,
Do your hair.,
Add accessories.,
Choose shoes.,
Do not, under any circumstances, force a change of personality on yourself.,
Get active on Social networking sites.",How to Be an Irish or British Scene Girl," You never know what you might pick up while you're browsing in New Look or River Island.;
, There are many great places in Dublin (City Center and Dundrum) and London to get the clothes you're looking for.

, Some suggestions include:


Cheap clothing stores where clothing is but a few pounds or euros. Look for cheap clothing stores with such items as pink and black legwarmers for under two pounds/euros. Pick up quirky little things such as kitsch jewelry, coloured skinny jeans, bows, animal print, etc. If the store doesn't have it, ask and they'll probably get it sooner or later.
Try punk stores. Although focused on punk, many do some pretty scene stuff there, too.
Hit the little girl's section in clothing stores and indulge yourself in Hello Kitty stuff and big bow clips for pocket money prices.

, Check out the sites with original indie apparel or manga-themed items. Look for sites considered to be ""underground"" and somewhat unknown, so you can be the first one in town to own their adorable apparel! How indie is that?

, Still searching for the perfect tutu? Make it yourself! Find some simple instructions on the Internet, order some tulle from eBay and get stuck in! You'll have your dream skirt in no time.

, Plaster your country's flag prominently on outfits. A huge Union Jack will make your tight black skinny jeans look amazing.

, Scene hair is quite easy to do. Having a thick fringe sweeping over your forehead will always be classed as scene. But, you also have to look at the rest of your hair, so get lots of layers. Tease them to give you that choppy, messy look but don't let it get out of control.


Dyeing hair is really popular with scene teenagers. Make it colourful but not so much that you look out of place. If you don't feel confident enough, then you could try to go for a more natural colour, such as blonde or black.
Use extensions. If you're not allowed to dye your hair then buy some extensions. It doesn't matter whether they're clip-in or glued-in. Most people prefer clip in because they are easily removable if you decide to change the colour.

, Bows are always a must! The bigger the bows, the better you look. Scarves are also considered slightly scene. For necklaces, try making Kandi ones, or go for cute, cartoon-like styles. If you have any light coloured Jesus bracelets, then turn them inside out and write random things (with one letter on each block) or draw symbols on them, wear them like that when you go out.

, Converse and Vans are always popular in the scene style. Ugg boots are acceptable (especially if worn with full length leggings). If you think the shoes you already own aren't scene enough, then update them by adding some new laces and style them up (just don't go overboard).

, It will lead to people calling you a poser. If that happens, then you have no shot at being a scene queen (which is every scene girl's dream). You may also lose some of your friends because they either don't like the new you or they think you're just purposefully trying to change and you're not the friend that you once were to them. Scene kids are pretty random though... some good random things to do are:


Draw a mustache on your finger and hold it above your top lip
Random 'silly' dancing while you're out with your friends is considered slightly scene so that's always a must (plus it's fun)
Just basically think of random things to do.

, Join sites such as Facebook, Tumblr, DailyBooth, Twitter, Bebo, YouTube (make lots of update videos to increase your popularity as a scene girl) and more as you go along. Most scene girls model for a modelling site, this means your pictures are put onto the internet for people to see, and this will boost your popularity a lot (if your parents don't let you do this then don't worry, just wait a year or so because they may think you're just too young).


Especially use Bebo. Although www.bebo.com isn't limited to the U.K. and Ireland, it is definitely more popular here and is yet another haven for gaining Internet fame. Don't let it limit you to only Irish/U.K. websites, though- you can still have your Myspace and Buzznet privileges.

, Its important to know who you are and know what you want. Remember whenever you get nervous, everyone is human just like you.

, Nobody wants to interact with someone who puts them down, or acts like a jerk. But don't let people walk all over you, either. You need to know just the right balance. A very important thing to remember is not to say anything that could make anybody nervous or embarrassed because we have all had those moments. Know that there's a fine line between confidence and arrogance.

, An example of what not to say is, ""Oh, I'm beautiful and I do this and they do that, so they are rubbish."" They are just being different. Scene kids are very different so this is important. Don't be mean to other people.

, It is expensive becoming a scene queen and you will need money to buy 'scene' clothing, accessories and makeup. Remember though, scene is very poorly defined and virtually anything can be deemed scene, if you have the confidence to carry it off. Scene is what you say it is.

, If you're ugly on the inside, you're ugly on the outside. Take multivitamins, drink plenty of water, exercise daily, do yoga, eat those vegetables and try not to take in so much meats and fats, especially sugar.

, Shower at least once a day. Exfoliate your skin, you'll feel better and your skin will glow.

, Soak yourself in rose petals or bath salts, anything that smells good.

, This should be done before using any makeup at all. Treat your skin with the right products depending on the type of skin you have.

, Scene queens are known for their perfect, detailed makeup, so be sure to be good at putting it on. Use good brand such as MAC, Urban Decay, Clinique, Chanel, and so on. You want to use these high quality brands because you want your makeup staying perfect all day (and night!) long, not to smudge and look sloppy.

,


If you wear fake eyelashes make sure they look right on you. If not, use protein and lengthening mascara.
Eyebrows can be thin and jet black or whatever color you have. Lips look good moisturized and with shimmer gloss. It makes them look bigger.

, Whether it be thin eyeliner with blue mascara and neon green eyeshadow or thick black eyeliner with purple mascara and black eyeshadow with tons of concealer, it's your own thing. Something that you design.

,, Scene queens are supposed to be different and unique, and they must stand out in a crowd; having radical hair can do wonders.

, Dye your hair a bright color, such as purple or pink, then add tons of crazy extensions. Dye your hair a different colour every couple of weeks, and if you like the original dye job, then add some touch-ups every month. Creating or avidly using new dye techniques can rocket you up the scene charts. Try video's on YouTube.

, It's advisable to do small bits yourself but leave the big parts to the stylist. AS long as you think you look good then that's all that counts.

, If you have damaged hair, get it treated and take care of it. A good way to help dry brittle hair is maxx moisture. Take multivitamins with biotin, MSM, horsetail, b12, folic acid, copper, magnesium, and then the vitamin should already have a lot major nutrients. Drinking tons of water can hydrate your hair follicles and help your hair stay healthy. Get your hair trimmed depending on the growth rate of it, e.g. if your hair grows about 3 inches (7.6 cm) a month, get it trimmed by 1 inch (2.5 cm).


If you're getting your hair colored, do not start out with bleach blonde hair because it'll be hard to get colors to stay when you dye your hair. Some good colors are jet black or stiletto black on top with light colors underneath. It doesn't really matter how you style your hair but the main traits of so called ""scene hair"" are a long fringe across the face, choppy crown, and long silky under layer.

, Online clothing stores, such as New York Couture, Glamour Kills, Drop Dead Clothing, Criminal Damage, Attitude, TokiDoki and Bleeding Star are very popular among scene royalty.

, The clothing is about being different and about being comfortable with what you wear. This is important.

, Check out Lexi Lush! She's super original!! Wear plenty of animal print and bold colors. Shirt styles can be blouses, band t-shirts, halter tanks, tank tops, really anything but it has to be fitted to your body to look good. Buy any skinny jeans that you can get your hands on. Print, characterized, rainbow, frogs, stars, ripped, long, short. Skinny jeans! These are what you will wear every day. It is important to have as many as you can! If you get ripped jeans get some awesome tights to peak out under them. Zebra or leopard print are good, especially colorful ones.

, Being random is key and is especially with scene queens. Scene queens are glamorous and tend to wear more characters. Also things like the McDonald's logo are awesome and look very cute. Anything you can think of: gloomy bear, hello kitty, Pokémon, superman, batman, barbie, TMNT, anything anime. Just be different.

, Wear bows, ribbons, headbands. It really is about being different. Skinny headbands are good and huge bows are a must. Wear as many bracelets as you can.

Not everyone will like you and some may call you a poser.

, It's best to use the lingo when talking to friends, and not when talking to your mother. It is simple, just add words into your vocabulary, such as ""rad"" and ""stellar.""

, Its all about using words from the 70's. It is also a new scene fashion to say yer like a pirate. The best way to find more words is to search scene vocab on urban vocab. This will come up with a load of words that you write into your own scene vocab. Just don't overdo it as you will get called a huge poser and only say words that you want to. If you hate all of the scene lingo then don't use it. All of this is basically up to you.

, You want to look like a real model, and if you do good on the shoots, you might actually become one. Becoming a model in a big plus in the scene queen world. (If this isn't possible check out How to Take Good Scene Pictures)

, The point of joining all of those websites is to share professional selfies, remember, to take a professional selfie, you have to be a very proficient photographer. It's okay to just do your best with the selfies, remember you are trying to be a sexy scene queen.

, You want people to got on your Myspace profile, take one look at your blog names saying all the exiting places you've been and for them to say "" WOW!""

,


The most popular place to hang out is at the mall. If you don't live near a mall, hang out at another sexy scene sort of location such as a local park or pick a friends house.

BE YOURSELF.",How to Be a Unique Scene Kid," When you have decided you want to be a scene kid, gradually get there. It may take a long time to get to your standards. If you do it all in one day, you may be labelled as a poser.;
, A common scene kid is normally bold, and likes attention. Maybe you could twist it by being quieter and sweeter. A normal scene kid is bubbly, you have to be bubbly as well, but you could also twist it by being very serious at times. Try not to act sad as you could get called an emo kid, and you do not want that. Take a couple of weeks or more to get to this stage.

, A common scene kid will listen to anything. Pop-Punk, Hardcore, Rock, even at-Country.

, Don't skip to hair first, as if you are a prep, this will look very odd. Most scene kids wear any bright color and black. You could base yours on one colour EG: Hot pink or neon green. Get as many items as you can of this colour, and also get some accessories that are a different colour to stand out. Most kids wear studded belts; black, really dark blue, gray or brightly colored skinny jeans are good too. Don't forget color isn't everything. Check out what other scene kids wear. Some scene kids wear fashionable pink wigs and stylish outfits, some wear vintage, and others just wear whatever they want.

, Start off with very soft layers, then sharper layers, then get choppier layers etc. Also, fringe bangs are very popular amongst scene kids. Get these gradually, so as not to be labeled a poser. Only get these if you have the right head shape, though. Very important - You must dye it. If you have problems with your hair such as alopecia , then try not to tease so much and use heat protectant before you straighten your hair. The normal colours are platinum blonde and brown/ black/ neon. Try going for a completely different colour like a shade of red with black etc. Make sure most of the colours of your clothes won't affect your hair colour. Try to see if it will work first. Also, go for highlights in neon colours, or a colour opposite of your hair colour base. Make it stand out!

, The most important part of being a scene kid is being an original and not a follower. To be a Scene kid is to be a leader. Remember no matter what that you are you and that you have to like who you are.

If someone labels you as Scene/Emo, don't get all up in arms about it.",How to Be Scene when You're on a Budget," It would actually be better if you cut it yourself, since not many hair salons know how to do scene hairstyles. Make it layered with side bangs. Many professionals don't get that you want it to be choppy and not tapered around the face. If you would like, you could use a razor to get the choppy look. If you really want/must go to a salon, Bring a picture of the hairstyle you think would fit you best from a magazine that you think is ""scene"" enough. Better yet, print out a picture from online of a scene kid, And show them that.;
, Wear clothes you already have that just might fit into 'scene': shirts with cartoon characters on them, stripes or polka dots, skinny jeans (if you don't have any try putting normal jeans into the dryer a couple of times when they aren't wet), and colorful accessories. Bangles and beaded necklaces are great! You can find lots of stuff like that at the dollar store. If you really don't have anything that you would consider scene, shop at secondhand stores where things aren't too expensive.

, Just wear anything you can find that doesn't come off too easily. Mascara and eyeliner work great, and if you don't have them, colorful eyeshadow will work too! Also you can use black eyeshadow as eyeliner like the girl in the picture did.

, Listen to punk rock, alternative rock, etc. Don't listen to too much hip-hop, and try staying away from country music. Do not go on music sharing sites! Your computer may catch a virus and if it catches one you then you may face huge problems. Popular bands include: Black Veil Brides, All Time Low, Never Shout Never, As I lay dying, Escape the Fate, Chiodos, Aiden, Paramore, etc... anyone that might be playing at Warped Tour.

, Dig up your childhood things. Wear old crazy sunglasses, paint your nails black or neon green, hot pink, or other bright colors like yellow. But with your kiddie stuff...be careful, because there is a fine line between tacky and Scene Crazy (which is what you want).

, For $10 you can get a decent pair of clear lens glasses (for that cool nerd look) or a good pair of stunners. Or, find some big sunglasses and punch out the lenses! Works perfectly!

, As long as you have the music part down; you're already halfway there!

, Scene kids love to mix it up and add their own touch to clothes. So check them out! there is a lot of unique stuff to find.

, Lots of stores have short sales that you can keep your eyes peeled for.

, If there is a killer pair of skinny jeans that you just can't live without, splurge on that then hold back for a while on the spending.

, Are the skinny jeans you're holding in your hand $32? Is that cute shirt you're eying $20? Is that brass knuckles necklace $12? Well, when you're on a budget, it's more than you should pay for one piece of clothing or an accessory, so put them back. Some stores WILL charge that much for a pair of jeans or a shirt. So, while this may sound crazy, it will make much more sense when you see a pair of jeans at the mall for $15+, but find the same brand at Goodwill for only about $4-5.

, Confidence is the one scene trait that is free. So go out there and don't let anyone judge you. Also, if you can laugh at yourself and poke fun at the stereotypes, it'll help to boost your self-confidence. (e.g. Go to a show and be all, ""Have you guys seen my friend? He's in a 3OH!3 shirt, dark skinny jeans, has snake bites and a pierced septum, and has anime hair that would put Yu-Gi-Oh to shame. Have you seen him?"")

, People label each other as a nice shorthand description (NOT to judge you or put you into a box), and it happens all the time, so get used to it. This goes double if you are making yourself over so as to get the look. Besides, it doesn't make much sense to dress Scene and listen to the music but deny that you are Scene. Basically, if you can admit to being Scene without going around and saying you are just to get attention, you won't be a poseur. Remember--there IS a difference between labeling and judging.

",How to Make Any Outfit Look Emo1," Piling on the necklaces, bands and bracelets is a great way to inject some emo style into a plain outfit. You should aim to wear at least three different necklaces and pile as many bands and bracelets on your wrists as possible. Experiment with different styles and colors for a really eclectic feel.


Look for jewelry featuring chains, spikes, bats, beads and broken or bleeding hearts.






Wristbands featuring the name of your favorite band are cool, and you can introduce a little color to your mainly black look with some bright neon accessories.





;
, Studded belts are a staple of any emo wardrobe, as they make every outfit look instantly edgier. Go for black, white or neon belts with metallic studs. The belts should be extra skinny - that way you can fit two or three of them through the loops in your pants for an interesting layered look.


Note that these belts shouldn't really be used to hold up your pants, they're more of a fashion statement.

, Pins are a cheap and easy way to add interest to an outfit, while also expressing your personality. You can get any type of pin imaginable - ones featuring the names of your favorite bands, ones with brand logos, ones with funny (and offensive) slogans and ones displaying cartons and artwork. The great thing about these pins is that you can easily transfer them from one item of clothing to another, instantly adding emo cred to your outfit.


The best places for pins are on the lapels of a jacket, the pockets on shirts, on thin, striped ties, on beanie hats and fedoras and on the pockets and straps of backpacks.
Another cool thing about pins is that you can trade them with friends, so your collection is always changing and growing.

, If you want, you can add designs to the nail. You should consider painting them on a Friday night so they're nice and chipped by the time school rolls around on Monday morning, just the way you want them. If you like, you can add a pop of color by going for bright neon shades like green or pink. This will do nothing to harm your emo cred - promise! Black is recommended. But some emos might also paint it red or pink, otherwise they don't have it painted. Some emo-pop bands like Panic! at the Disco have done black nail paint before.


Nails are usually clipped (or bitten!) short. Long nails are more Goth than Emo.
Don't worry about painting your toenails... emos never really wear sandals or expose their feet.

, No self-respecting, music-loving Emo would be caught dead without their headphones in. It should become a part of your morning routine of dressing yourself - putting your iPod or music device of your choice into the pocket of your jeans and snaking your headphones up the inside of your t-shirt or hoodie and out the neck. That way your headphones will stay nice and secure throughout the day, without fear of getting lost or broken. Try emo music like Silverstein, Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Senses Fail, Bright Eyes, Hawthorne Heights and My Chemical Romance.


Obviously you'll want to have both headphones in at all times, but if this isn't possible - like at school or at the dinner table - consider keeping just one headphone in. That way you can still listen to your jams while keeping the other ear available for responding to questions.
Even when the music is turned off, you can dangle both earphones over your shoulders, almost like a necklace. That way you'll always have them close by when you need to drown out the world.







, Facial piercings are very emo, and no one can doubt your commitment to the look when you have a hunk of metal in your face to prove it. Lip piercings are popular - you can get them centered on your lip, have one on either side, or one on both sides. Eyebrow piercings and nose rings are also cool. If you're looking for something a little less noticeable, think about getting your tongue pierced, or else load up your ears with multiple piercings.


If you decide to get a piercing, make sure that your go to a reputable piercing shop or tattoo parlor to get it done. Also make sure that your are committed to the cleaning routine necessary to maintain a piercing. You really don't want any piercing - especially those on your face - to get infected. Ouch!
If you're under 18, it might also be a good idea to seek your parents' permission first. Some piercing places require the consent of a guardian before they will pierce a minor, so it might be necessary to have the 'rents on your side.







, You can use glasses to express your Emo-ness too. Simply go for over-large, geek-style, thick-framed, black-rimmed glasses that pretty much take over your face. Anybody can take on this look, not just those with poor eyesight. Just pop out the prescription lenses and add in plain glass ones instead.


Be aware that you run the risk of being labeled a poser if you wear glasses despite your perfect 20/20 vision.
Another option is to wear cat-eyed glasses (particularly for girls) and large round or heart-shaped sunglasses. Even indoors. Hey, you're an artist, right?!

, Being emo is all about being in touch with your feelings and having a passion for creative outlets which allow you to express those feelings. Chances are you already play an instrument (Guitar is a common choice while bass or cello are also good options because they have deep sounds. Electric guitar is also good along with other types of metal band instruments - drum sets, electric guitars, etc.) or keep a notebook filled with scrawled song lyrics, snatches of poetry and dark, intricate artwork.


If this is the case, then why not own it and carry these things around for the world to see? You'll get to show your emo credentials to the world, plus you'll have the necessary materials and equipment easily at hand whenever creative inspiration strikes!
You can also cover any instrument cases or notebooks with band stickers or graffiti, making them look extra worn-in. Give your friend some permanent markers and let them go to town... who knows what they'll come up with?

Get choppy bangs.,
Dye your hair black or platinum blonde.,
Wear your hair straight.,
Spike or backcomb your hair.,
Wear a foundation a shade or two lighter than your natural skin tone.,
Go heavy on the eye liner.",How to Make Any Outfit Look Emo2," Getting the hairstyle right is probably the most important part of perfecting the emo look. In fact, if you have the right hairstyle, you can basically wear anything you like and it will still look Emo. The number one priority when it comes to emo hair is to get choppy bangs, which sweep across your face, basically covering one eye. For both guys and girls, the bangs should be long, coming down as far as your ear.


Although it's possible to cut your bangs yourself, or get a friend to do it, for best results you should really go to a hairdresser who can get the cut right. Try finding some pictures online which you can bring to the hairdresser's for inspiration.
Once you get your bangs, you should practice your head toss, so you can get the hair out out your eyes for a minute or two before it falls back into place. Very emo.

, Another essential feature of the emo hairstyle is the color. Obviously dyeing your hair is a little more extreme than just getting it cut, but if you're truly committed to achieving the emo look, it is a step you should be willing to take. Darkest black is probably the most popular option, for both guys and girls, but platinum blonde is also cool.


You can switch up the look a little bit by adding different colored streaks to your choppy bangs. For instance, a lot of emos will dye their hair black, but have streaks of white blond going through the hair at the front. Alternatively, you can reverse the look and wear your hair blonde with streaks of black.
You can also add streak of bright colors for a particularly funky take on this look. Red, pink, green, blue and purple will all work well with either black or platinum hair. If you don't want to go as far as actually dyeing your hair neon shades, you can buy clip-in extensions which will help you to achieve the same effect.
As with the choppy bangs, these kinds of dyeing jobs can be difficult to achieve and maintain at home, so you are probably better off going to a hair salon to have it done professionally.

, Straight hair is best when it comes to pulling off the emo look, so make sure you have a decent hair straightener easily at hand if your hair is naturally frizzy or curly. Straightening can be a pain, and you'll probably need to get up a half hour earlier in the morning to do it, but the results will be worth it!


Make sure to use a heat protection spray before straightening your hair, as the high temperatures can cause your hair to dry out, especially if it's already been dyed or bleached.
Another thing you can do is use a crimper to crimp the front part of your fringe for a cool, alternative effect.

, Once the color, cut and straightness of your hair have been taken care of, the next thing to do it style. Of course, the choppy bangs should always be left alone, swept to the side and covering one half of your face. The back of your hair, on the other hand, you are free to style.


If your hair is cut short at the back, use hair gel or wax to spike it out from your head or mold it into a sort of mohawk.
If your hair is long, try backcombing it to produce a messy, voluminous look which makes it seem like you never brush your hair.

, Although emos don't aim to be as white-faced as their Gothic counterparts, being pale is still a requirement. You should basically look like you spend all your time indoors, at least during the day. If you naturally look like this, great! If not, try to get your hands on some liquid or powder foundation that's a shade or two lighter than your natural skin tone. Being tan is fine.


Apply the foundation every day using a sponge or powder brush. There's no need to cake it on. A light, even layer will do.
You can buy special white face powders at stores like Hot Topic, which are made specifically for achieving a gothic, punk or emo look. However, any foundation brand which produces lighter shades will do the trick.

, No self-respecting emo would be caught dead without lashings of black eye liner, so learning how to apply it properly is essential. Liquid eyeliner can be very tricky to master (though it does produce very precise lines) so it's probably best to start out with a pencil. You should apply the eyeliner all around the eyes: across the eyelid, on the inner rims and underneath your bottom lashes. Don't worry about it being very exact, as smudged eyeliner is also a good look.


The staple eye liner in your make-up bag should be jet black, however, every now and again you can mix it up with a colored one, such as purple, blue or green.
Applying a pink or red colored pencil to the inner rims of your eyes can make it look like you've been crying, if that's a look you'd like to experiment with.
Although eye liner is the essential feature, you can go a step further by adding some smoky black or grey eye shadow and a layer or two of black mascara.

Always wear band t-shirts.,
Invest in a few pairs of tight jeans.,
Get your hands on the appropriate footwear.,
Wear army jackets or black band hoodies.",How to Make Any Outfit Look Emo3," Band t-shirts should be the number one item in your wardrobe. You should have more of these than anything else. After all, being emo is all about the music and showing support for the bands you care about. Tour t-shirts that you actually bought at the band's gig are best, but t-shirts bought in stores or online will do as well. They should be as tight as possible (while still actually fitting), and girls can knot up the ends or cut out the backs to expose a little skin, if desired.


Some classic emo bands whose t-shirts would make cool additions to your wardrobe and lend you some emo cred (provided you actually listen to the music) are: The Promise Ring, The Get Up Kids, Sunny Day Real Estate, Texas is the Reason, Rites of Spring, Braid, Thursday and Cursive.

, Tight jeans are essential to completing the emo look. If you're skinny, wearing skinny jeans is recommended. However, skinny jeans have been what some emos (especially guys) get made fun of for. Who cares, they look good, right? So stand up to the haters and wear your skinny jeans with pride! Opt for black or blue, and if it's got a few rips and holes in it, all the better. Although skinny jeans (which are tight all the way to the ankles) are probably the most common, tight jeans can also look good.


Even though you want your jeans to be tight, they should still fit you properly. Jeans that are too tight will be uncomfortable and hot and you won't enjoy wearing them. Plus, jeans that fit you properly will look better too.
Girls can substitute skinny jeans for skirts and tights, if they like. They skirts will usually be short and black, though sometimes a tutu style is worn, and tights can either be plain black, colored or patterned. Feel free to experiment!

, What you put on your feet is just as important as what you wear, so take some time to consider your shoes. The classic choice is Converse high-tops, which should be as dirty and worn in as possible. If Converse aren't your thing, skate shoes like Vans, Etnies and Circa are popular alternatives.


Even if your shoes are brand new, you should take some time to go jump in the mud and use a permanent marker or white-out to draw or write graffiti all over them.
Adding patterned or brightly colored laces is another way to funk up your shoes, allowing them to reflect your personality.

, Even emos get cold, so when you need to layer up, opt for worn-out army jackets and black band hoodies. These look great layered over shirts and band tees, but can really be worn over any outfit you like, which makes them a great investment.


Authentic combat-green army jackets can be found in thrift stores or online and look great loaded with pins and iron-on patches.
Black band hoodies are easy to get your hands on and provide another opportunity to profess your love of a particular band. They should also be worn tight and with the hood up, if you want to look brooding.

Give him some space.,
Find out what he's interested in.,
Do some research on the emo sub-genre.,
Find the right time.,
Don't babble.,
Compliment him.",How to Talk to Emo Boys," Don't rush up to him and start flirting at the first opportunity. Unless you're dead lucky, this will probably irritate/startle/freak him out a lot. So try to give him a little space - don't stare too much, don't be too heavy, etc.;
, You don't have to dig to find out what he likes and what he's interested in. Some ways to figure this out would be:


Observing his clothes. T-shirts with band names or pictures on them may be a dead giveaway to what he's interested in, so keep your eyes peeled.
Studying his possessions. Don't become a creepy stalker, but try to get a glimpse of his bag, or something like that. Why he has a bag, I don't know but if he does just walk away. But what's on there may also give you a clue of what he's interested in.
Observing his friends. It might help even more if you know them. They might have the same interests; you can look at what they do together-listen to music, talk about a certain band etc.

, If you know a little - or a lot - about the Emo sub-genre, you're more likely to have a good conversation and impress him. So look them up. Try to find some real Emo bands and give them a listen.

, Don't try to strike up a flirtatious conversation if he's tied to a train track. Okay, that may not happen, but use your common sense to figure out when would be the best time to talk to him. If he's in trouble or looking irritated, avoid chatting-you'll most probably get negative results. But if he looks pretty normal and isn't busy, gather up your courage and try your luck.

, If you don't talk often, babbling away about yourself--or him--may startle or annoy him. You don't want to scare him off if you've come this far. Try to keep it short and sweet. Talk about something that he can contribute to as well-- it makes the conversation a lot better and more enjoyable.

, Everyone loves a compliment, so if you want to please him, give him one. As you probably know, complimenting an Emo guy is a little different. But here are some basic things you can say to him


""Did you get that shirt at a show? It's awesome.""
""I like your (item of clothing/possession)! Where did you get it?""
""Your hair's awesome/amazing.""
""I like the color of your skinny jeans""

Have Good Hygiene.,
Have a Myspace.,
Keep it real.,
The Look - If you search ""scene boy"" on Photobucket, a lot of losers with their hair in their face and their sister's make-up on will pop up.,
Get the hair.,
Get into the Music - Everyone knows that scene kids listen to whatever they feel like.,
Clothing.,
Get into the Scene!,
Don't Forget - Scene is just a fashion, a trend; nothing to take too seriously.",How to Be a Sexy Scene Boy," - This is a must. No ifs, ands or buts. You have got to shower everyday or at least every other day. Keep your hair clean and healthy. Wash your hands and make sure your nails are neat. It's not ""girly"" to have good hygiene. Think you're a manly man if you never wear deodorant? Think again. Girls are impressed by guys who keep it clean.;
, Another necessity. If you don't have one, make one. Keep a basic URL, maybe just something with numbers. Rather then loading your page up with stupid garbage like pictures of babes or you hunting with your dad, keep it minimal, with a basic black or white background and a small 'about me' section where you glamorize your life as much as possible. One thing about the scene style is having lots of friends on Myspace. So add sexy, scene kids.

, Scene guys are notorious for their bitchy, self-centered attitudes. Same thing goes with the girls. They're gorgeous and they expect everyone to agree with that and constantly remind them. It's not easy keeping yourself stunning. Anyway, scene guys lean a little to the gay side being that they spend just as much time in front of a mirror fixing their hair as a girl would. Just make sure you know where you stand, and girls will appreciate but not like it if you're prettier then they are.

, You have to know what's really lame and what automatically clicks as being perfect. Please, please don't wear make-up. It's far too emo and emo is nothing like scene at all. Not to mention guys suck with make-up and girls are not impressed by your skills with eyeliner. Piercings are hot. Snakebites, septum, monroes, you name it. Tattoos are hot too but remember, they last forever. And not dragons or dippy tribal tattoos. Let's face it, girls love guys who are in shape. If you're on the chubby side you should head into the gym and work off those extra pounds so you can fit into your skinny jeans.

, Scene hair for guys is surprisingly easy to come by. It's rather unfair considering all of the work girls have to go through. How long is your hair? It's got to be past your chin for it to work. It's suggested that you go to the salon but you could cut it yourself. You want long sweeping bangs with lots of choppy layers all over the place. The better your fringe looks, the hotter you are. Period. Guys with hot hair drive girls mad.

Buy a straightener; this will be used everyday. Make sure your hair is clean and not greasy. Straighten it until it is completely flat. Make sure you protect your hair from the heat with proper products. You can keep your hair straight, or get some gel and hairspray and try to muss it up into a sexy, falling-into-the-face mess.







, One of the most adored genres though is screamo. Lead singers in screamo bands usually have pretty amazing hair and are good role models for the scene style. Take Olli Sykes for instance, the lead singer of Bring Me the Horizon. He is extremely gorgeous, with the hair, and the tattoos and the piercings. Not to mention the adorable British accent. Some very basic, necessary, bands include: The Devil Wears Prada, Bring Me the Horizon, iwrestledabearonce, Job For a Cowboy, Attack Attack!, Chiodos, Underoath, Dance Gavin Dance, Breathe Carolina, I Set My Friends On Fire, A Skylit Drive, A Day to Remember, August Burns Red, Handshakes and High five Sky Eats Airplane, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Alesana and the list goes on! If you like most or all of the bands and have them on your iPod, you are well on your way to the scene music tastes.

, Guys have it easy in the clothing department too. As long as you keep a mature, simple outlook and remember what's hot and what's not, you should be fine shopping at your local mall or Urban Outfitters. It's okay to embrace your feminine side but you don't have to adorn yourself with pink and girly clothing.


You have got to own skinny jeans. Nothing else. Are they uncomfortable? Get used to it.






As far as shoes go you should own a pair of basic Vans, nothing too flamboyant. Try to be fashionable when it comes to shoes. Wear moccasins or weird sandals. No white sneakers. Converse are A-okay, but drifting a little too mainstream.






Stock up on a good load of band tees from the above mentioned bands. Don't buy a shirt just because you think the design is cool. Know the bands and represent them.






For accessories every guy should own at least two bandannas and two pairs of sunglasses. Wear them around your neck, in your pocket, around your head, whatever. Guys should also own a couple of beanies and don't forget your studded belt!






Sweaters are hot if it looks like your grandpa would wear it buy it. Ugly old scarves and grandpa glasses are hot too.






You can wear a headband around your head as well. A few bracelets made of hemp or beads are stylish, but no sweatbands. Far too ""Hot Topic Goth"" look.






V-necks can never go wrong! Load up on plain colored T-shirts from American Apparel or wherever they're sold cheap. American Apparel also offers good-quality hoodies.







, Go to shows, hang out with friends, meet other hot scene kids. It's always good to have scene friends with you. Make sure you have a sexy guy-friend. Seeing the two of you together will impress the ladies. If you don't already play guitar, you'd better start. Scene guys will brag about their band's latest gig or at least how they're hoping to get a gig. It's expected, even if you suck.

, You're having fun as a young person. Remember to be yourself and to enjoy life!

Find out the real meaning of emo.,
Emo bands.,
Understanding Screamo.,
Today, many bands are deemed emo due to their appearance or lyrical themes.,
Emo Pop Punk.,
Understanding what isn't Emo or Screamo.,
An emo appearance typically denotes a fringe, tight jeans, band shirts and studded belts.",How to Understand What Emo Is," You can find reliable sources by typing in keywords generally known to the mainstream like ""skramz"", ""emocore"" and later ""emoviolence"" and ""powerviolence"". Doing so will bring up pages untainted by mainstream definition. Remember, you're researching the original Emotive hardcore movement in the 80s. You're not looking for emo pop punk, the emo phase or anything which states that it means ""emotional"".;
, Emo seems controversial if you haven't done your research, but actual followers of Emo understand and know that bands like the below are emotive hardcore hardcore bands.


Rites of Spring
Embrace
Jawbreaker
Drives Like Jehu
Indian Summer
Jets to Brazil
Moss Icon
Gray Matter
Hot Cross
Off Minor
Sleepytime Trio

, Like Emo, Screamo is also incredibly misunderstood. Most people think it's a sub-genre of metal, or that it's simply ""doesn't exist"". But in reality, Screamo (also known as ""skramz"") is a sub-genre of hardcore punk/emo which formed out of California in the early 90s. Screamo, being an off-shoot genre of Emo, incorporates Emo characteristics but also includes screamed vocals, melodic breakdowns and is often aggressive and faster paced. Some real Screamo bands are:


Orchid
Pg.99
City of Caterpillar
Circle Takes The Square
The Saddest Landscape
I Hate Myself
Angel Hair
Love Like... Electrocution
Love Lost But Not Forgotten

, One of the main clues to finding out if a band is ""emo"" or not is listening to the instrumental context of the band. If it's metal, it won't be ""Emo"" as they're two different genres of music. A band which uses emotional themes or screamed vocals doesn't automatically make it ""emo"" or ""screamo"" and that's how a lot of people trip up.

, Emo is not a mainstream genre, it was DIY, raw and most importantly, not about the fashion. Once Jimmy Eat World hit the mainstream with their song ""The Middle"", another genre was created called ""Emo pop punk"". Emo pop punk is a fusion genre of emo and pop punk, incorporating more hook filled choruses thus making it catchier and ear friendly (how bands like My Chemical Romance and Paramore can be played on the radio. You'll never find Rites of Spring or Embrace on the radio; because they don't appeal to the majority of people). Listening to Emo Pop Punk is not a bad thing, it just means that you're not ""emo"" but more ""emo pop"". Some bands that started the emo pop style/were later to be were:


The Get Up Kids
The Promise Ring
The Starting Line
Saves The Day
The Movielife
Paramore
My Chemical Romance
Panic! at the Disco
All Time Low

, Bands that commonly get mislabelled ""emo"" are Black Veil Brides, Asking Alexandria, Suicide Silence, Bring Me The Horizon and many other metalcore and deathcore bands.


Metalcore. Metalcore is a fusion genre of hardcore punk and extreme metal formed in the late 80s/early 90s staring with bands like All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet For My Valentine and Parkway Drive.
Deathcore. Deathcore is a fusion of hardcore punk, metalcore and death metal. It originated in the early 00s in North America and is defined by breakdowns, blast beats and death metal riffs. Some deathcore bands are Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Bring Me The Horizon (their early work), Whitechapel, Impending Doom and Emmure.

, Hair is especially important, and is frequently dyed a vibrant or dark colour, rarely being in-between. Originally an emo appearance leaned towards intellectualism, with thick rimmed glasses, tight denim and sweater vests.


However, try not to obsess over fashion or you'll be labelled as stereotypical. All you have to do to ""be emo"" is listen to the genre, and maybe be involved with the hardcore scene by going to local shows.

Organize your clothing.,
Write out or sketch photo angles.,
Write down a list of photo scenes.,
Find accessories.,
Do your hair and makeup.,
Make sure you know the full features of your camera.,
Take the photos.,
Editing.,
Learn how to user your editor to its full extent.,
Find a perfect place to post your pictures.,
Use effects.",How to Take Good Scene or Emo Pictures," Put on your favorite clothes. Make sure they make your features stand out, e.g. got nice muscle? Your shirt should help show them off. Got a great stomach? A shirt that's tied in at the middle or has a belt can make it look amazing. Do whatever you need to make your best features stand out.;
, This can really help, browse Google and find some amazing scene pictures, study the angle of the camera and the person's expression. Makeup and hair helps too. You can print these pictures if you want but drawing works nicely too.

, Where can you take your shots? Is there anywhere you can tape up a cool bed sheet or a large piece of fabric for a cool backdrop? Note down these places and ideas.

, What can you drag into the picture to make it look even cooler? Maybe a plush toy like Hello Kitty or Invader Zim? What about a mobile phone or iPod? A NERF gun? Perhaps a hair bow or jacket? Find something to show off or use.

, This can take a long time and needs practice. When you've got it just right, add a bow or accessory to jazz it up.

, If you can change the saturation, lighting, theme, maybe you can control the color, learn how to zoom in and out (duh!) and how to use your camera's self timer as this comes in handy.

, Facial expressions, poses, lighting, accessories, plush dolls, toys, hair style, clothing, it all plays a part. Don't be afraid to take hundreds of pictures.

, Editing photos is a must for almost all scene or emo kids. Photoshop is the most popular editor but you can also use Gimp or an online service like Picnik, which can be hooked up to your Facebook.

, Remove blemishes, redness, escaped hair and frizziness. Never try to Photoshop makeup onto your self. It looks unrealistic and you will be labeled and most likely hated on.

, Facebook is good but your friends may think the photos are ugly and that you're self-obsessed for posting so many pictures of yourself in one folder. Spread the pictures around on different sites: Myspace, Youtube, Tumblr, Twitter, Formspring, PhotoBucket, Flickr, the list is endless.

, Black and white is very popular but nay color or effect will work, just try them out and see what looks best.

Examine the color choices.,
Know the difference in hairstyles.,
Look for black horn-rimmed glasses.,
Notice band t-shirts.,
Count the piercings and tattoos.",How to Know the Difference Between Emo and Scene1," Scene fashion emphasizes bright, often neon, colors. By contrast, the most popular color choice in emo fashion is black.Aside from the color choices, a lot of clothing between the two subcultures can look quite similar. Because of the similarities, scene kids are even occasionally referred to as neon-emos.The number one goal of scene fashion is to call attention to the wearer, and neon colors are worn to that end.
Scene also takes a lot of cues from anime influences, further pushing their over-the-top and colorful fashion sense.
A zip-hoodie in a dark color is a crucial clothing item in emo fashion. The hoodie can be plain or be covered in icons characteristic of the emo culture, such as bleeding hearts, skulls, ribs, stars and broken hearts.
Scene fashion also champions hoodies, but they will generally be paired with neon drainpipe jeans.;
, The scene subculture’s love for neon colors sets them apart from the emo subculture when it comes to hair, as well, although the actual hairstyles themselves can look somewhat similar. The number one look for both cultures is based around a long fringe (bangs) brushed over to one side of the head, covering one or both eyes.Emo hair is often dyed black, with stripes of color (usually bleached blond or blue) sometimes added in, and very straight.
Emo silhouettes are thin, smooth and flat, occasionally featuring sharp angles and asymmetry. It is popular for the hair in front to be long, while the hair in back is short.
Scene hairstyles are exaggerated versions of the emo look, often dyed in a rainbow of neon colors, and backcombed to be bigger and fluffier.Hair extensions in bright colors or animal prints are prevalent, especially among scene girls., These are extremely popular in emo fashion for guys.Emo has an undercurrent of ""nerd"" style running through it, and thick glasses with black frames are key accessories for both genders, but males especially.


This nerd style undercurrent is not present in scene fashion at all.
The popular choices in scene eyewear are brightly colored sunglasses with very large frames, sometimes referred to as party sunglasses or party shades., Both subcultures have ties to music, but emo is far more music-centric than scene. In fact, as a subculture, emo was born out of a musical style with roots in the punk and post-hardcore genres.


Scene, on the other hand, is usually viewed as a fashion trend or stylistic choice.
Because of emo's powerful link to music, tight-fitting t-shirts featuring bands and band names are one of the most commonly seen clothing articles in emo fashion.

, Members of both subcultures tend to have piercings and tattoos, but they are far more prevalent and extensive within the scene culture. Scene kids will typically have multiple facial piercings and go for more drastic body modifications like ear gauges.


Tattoos are popular in emo circles, with less emphasis on piercings.
Tattoos of stars are considered emo, as well as “sleeves” (full arm tattoos that stop at the wrists).

"
"
Listen for a dance beat.,
Assess the vocal styles.,
Know popular band names.",How to Know the Difference Between Emo and Scene2," The scene culture leans toward ""party music"" that you can dance to and is often electronic. The music is much more pop-oriented and makes great background noise for socializing and having a good time. Emo music, on the other hand, is not danceable, and is much more rock-centric.


The typical emo sound is dramatic in its emotional range and often features a dynamic of alternating loud/soft extremes. It tends to emphasize emotion rather than socializing and partying.
Fast, punk-derived drum beats and heavily distorted guitars are common elements in the emo sound., Emo vocals are dramatic in mood and can even occasionally feature screams, moans and howls. Lyrically, emo musicians are introspective and focus on emotional issues like sadness, confusion, love, anger and pain.Later emo musicians developed a slightly softer, more mainstream sound, but the lyrical content remained just as brooding and contemplative.
Scene music does not put any particular emphasis on lyrical content and doesn’t feature the inward-looking, thoughtful vibe that is characteristic of emo.

, Recognizing and listening to the “right” emo bands is a key component of emo culture. Bands are slightly less important in the fashion-centric scene culture, but there are some bands that are overwhelmingly considered to be “scene bands.”


Some of the flagship bands in emo culture, both past and present, are: Rites of Spring, Embrace, Moss Icon, Drive Like Jehu, Fugazi, Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, Dashboard Confessional, Jimmy Eat World, Get Up Kids, The Promise Ring, Brand New, My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy.Scene band names to look out for are Blood on the Dancefloor, Owl City, Dot Dot Curve, Brokencyde, Scene Kidz, Millionaires, Jeffree Star and Hollywood Undead.
Scene music also features a lot artists from electro-pop, dance-pop, dubstep and house/techno genres. Names to recognize are Skrillex, Knife Party and deadmau5. Occasionally, mainstream pop stars like Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj are also embraced by the scene subculture.

"
"
Investigate online presence.,
Look for androgyny.,
Watch for a smile.,
Note styles of self-expression.",How to Know the Difference Between Emo and Scene3," The scene culture puts a lot of emphasis on online presence, especially via social media and networking platforms. This originated with Myspace and continues today on all social media platforms. Members of the scene culture will have friends and followers in excess and typically post profile images of themselves that are highly stylized. The details of their lives are often shared frequently via pictures and status updates, sometimes exhaustively.


By contrast, emo culture is far more introverted. A social media presence is common, but the sharing isn’t excessive and friends and followers are usually obtained through connections through music and shared interests in particular bands.
Online communities are frequently created by those of the emo culture, and they often use the internet to seek out other emos that they can connect to.Emo posts and status updates are often cryptic and emotional.Quoting song lyrics as a way to explain to the world how you feel inside is a common emo characteristic.

, The scene culture overwhelmingly embraces and celebrates gender-bending and androgyny. The approach is reminiscent of glam rock icons of the 1970s, such as David Bowie. Experimentation in sexuality is commonplace and the lines between genders are deliberately blurred. Feminine or androgynous looks are favored by all genders within scene culture, with little emphasis on masculinity.


While the emo subculture in no way condemns androgyny, there is no emphasis on it at all. In fact, in the past emo has been criticized for being incredibly male-centric.
This criticism is debatable, as all criticisms are, but the members of emo bands are predominantly male.
However, there is no gender dominance among the fans of emo music, which appears to be enjoyed by all equally.

, While the stereotype is frequently overstated, there is a tendency among those who identify as emo to be emotional, sensitive, shy, introverted, withdrawn and even angsty. This stereotype originated in emo music, which often focuses on similar themes.Because of the intimate connection to music that often characterizes an emo personality, these themes are often used to describe the general mood of the members of emo subculture. You are far more likely to see a smile on the face of someone who identifies as scene rather than emo.


Scene culture focuses on fashion and socializing and, generally speaking, its members are more outgoing and friendlier than those of the emo culture.
There is no particular emphasis placed on emotions in scene culture.Emo culture is sometimes criticized for promoting self-harm, suicide, and death in general. This is exaggerated and largely incorrect.
Emo culture's emphasis on emotion is often misinterpreted negatively by those outside of the culture.

, Members of the emo subculture tend to express themselves via poetry, art and music. Scene culture communicates largely through fashion and their sense of style.Emphasis is placed on visual communication and experimentation in scene culture.
Emo culture, on the other hand, finds self-expression mostly through music, and to a lesser extent, other types of art.

Dye your hair.,
Cut your hair.,
Wear dark polish.,
Play with blacks and reds.",How to Look Like a Cute Emo Girl1," Dark hair goes very well with emo style. Black hair with a colored streak or colored tips is a great way to express yourself dramatically. These colors give tone to the emo look and add a cute flair to the normally harsh look of dark hair.;
, There are many short cuts that are popular with the emo style. Jagged bangs, much like the ones worn by punk and rock artists from the 90’s are common. Jagged ends are also very popular and can be a great way to add character to your style.Use gel to add some more style. Spiking it up in an irregular and irrational way to showcase any color you’ve added into your hair can accentuate your outfit., Dark nail polish is very cute for your emo style. It doesn’t have to be black, but find a great deep purple or red to show off your style., You can have a lot of fun with your make up. Don’t be afraid to overdo it. Accentuate your eyes with black or red eyeliner and eyeshadow. Throw on a deep cranberry lipstick to cap off your look.Check out Gerard Way for a great example of red and black make-up combinations.
You can add a pale foundation to your skin, but this is more Gothic than emo."

Research the backgrounds and history of each.,
Learn about the music.,
Look in to associated genres.,
Consider fashion.,
Learn the aesthetics.,
And finally, dismiss all stereotypes.",How to Know the Difference Between Emo and Goth," To be able to understand something, you need to research it. This is the most important part of trying to learn about something, and it's what a lot of people who are trying to be ""emo"" or ""goth"" miss out. Different websites will tell you different things, so it's better to look at multiple sources. The basics are:

Goth

Goth is a subculture which includes aspects of music, fashion and aesthetic.
It takes inspiration from Gothic architecture and Gothic novels such as The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.Goth rock was born out of the British post-punk scene in the late 70s/early 80s in the infamous Batcave nightclub which opened in 1982 in London.Bands like The Velvet Underground and The Doors were described as gothic, as was David Bowie's song Diamond Dogs, however they are not ""goth"".Bela Lugosi's Dead is retrospectively, the song which coined and defined the goth music genre. Bauhaus indicated that the song was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, but they sung it with naive seriousness making the audience understand it differently.Goth rock characteristics include a simple 4/4 post punk beat or drum machine, dry baritone vocals (in men), flanging guitar used for atmosphere and a lead bass. If the band plays more darkwave music, then above but with synthesizers as an addition.
The goth subculture and fashion includes elements of punk, glam rock, new romantic, high chic, antique, retro-kitsch, fetish, secondhand trash, ancient Celtic, Christian, pagan, Egyptian and Asian religions and iconographies.Emo

Emo stands for ""emotive hardcore punk"", which was shortened to ""emo-core"" and then eventually ""emo"".Emo is an outgrowth of the hardcore punk sub-genre, and a reaction to the heightened violence in the hardcore punk scene.
The term was first used in a Flipsize magazine by Ian Mackaye.The term ""emo"" was an insult used towards people who listened to this music, and the people who stayed true to hardcore saw this as a lesser genre. They used to go to shows and scream insults at the band members.Rites of Spring and Embrace, even though they reject the label, were named and considered the first emo bands.
Emo is describe as a loosely based punk genre, because it was redefined as a type of indie rock in the 90s (bands like Sunny Day Real Estate and Texas is the Reason are a perfect example of this sound) but some people like to say it only refers to the first wave as that only had the true hardcore punk sound.

;
, Since these are both musically motivated subcultures, the music should be the most important part of each. Understand that you cannot be both emo and goth at the same time, but you can listen to goth rock and emo together. It just wouldn't make you an ""Emo goth"", like some people think. Some proper goth and emo bands are:

Goth:

Bauhaus
Siouxsie and the Banshees
The Cure (some albums)
The Sisters of Mercy
Southern Death Cult
The March Violets
Fields of the Nephilim
Ausgang
SpecimenAlien Sex Fiend
Christian Death
45 Grave
U.K Decay


Emo

Rites of Spring
Embrace
One Last Wish
Drive Like Jehu

Dag Nasty
Moss Icon
Indian Summer


Emo pop punk

Jimmy Eat World
The Get Up Kids
The Promise Ring
My Chemical Romance (after their first album, which is hardcore punk/emo inspired)
Paramore
Fall Out Boy
Panic! At the Disco



, Goth and emo aren't only what members of these subcultures listen to. They listen to similar genres or fusions which are associated with the primary genre. In goth culture, they are called ""goth friendly"" genres. This means that the genre itself isn't goth, but has underlying dark themes which makes it relevant. The latter list gets confused for goth time and time again when what's really goth came out of the 80s post punk scene. There is nothing wrong with a goth listening to or enjoying these genres, they're just not part of the subculture and shouldn't be labelled as such.

Associated emocore genres include:

Hardcore punk
Indie rock
Skramz (another name for screamo)
Emoviolence (screamo and powerviolence)


Associated emo pop punk genres include:

Emo
Pop punk
Alternative rock
Indie rock


Associated goth genres include:

Positive-Punk
Post-punk
Darkwave
Gothic Punk
Batcave
Cold wave
Shoegaze
Dark indie

New wave


Goth friendly, or genres mistaken for goth include:

Gothic metal
Neo classical
Witch house
Industrial
EBM
Electro
Aggrotech
Shock rock
Nu Metal
Ethereal
Dark ambient



, The main thing to remember when looking at the differences of emo and goth is that emo isn't meant to be dark, but goth is. Emo pop punk was dark, but that was because of heavy influence from Blink-182 and later, My Chemical Romance, during The Black Parade album.

Traditional goth fashion, makeup and hair includes:

Black clothing, with an antique or Victorian air to itFishnets tights and mesh topsSilver jewellery, including piercings, earrings, nose rings, bracelets and necklacesoften depicting religious and occult themesor decorated with skulls, human skeletons and batsSiouxsie Sioux Cleopatra inspired makeupA death hawk, inspired by Jonny Slut or simply just jet black and backcombed/teasedEyebrows which were either; thick, pointed and triangular; high arched and thin or upward strokes, called ""death brows"" and most commonly worn by Daniel Ash from BauhausGarments in leather, velvet, silk, PVC or laceOld school emo fashion includes:

Sweaters and jumpers
Thick horned rimmed glasses
Flat shoes
Messenger bags and jeans
Plaid shirts


Emo pop punk fashion includes:

Band shirts, usually of rock bands
Converse
Sweat bands
Studded beltsOften dyed black hair with fringe/bangs
Hoodies
Eyeliner, While aesthetic is an aspect of each, it is not the only thing that will make you goth or emo. Most people in the goth subculture have had a darkly inclined mindset from the beginning, and that's what prompted them to seek out dark music, fashion, art, literature and film. The goth and emo aesthetic is said to be as follows:

Goth: seeing beauty in darkness, and in anything that would appear ""ugly"", ""strange"" or ""weird"" to mainstream society.
Emo: being in touch with your emotions, but not necessarily being depressed

, Stereotypes are general, usually, negative assumptions about an entire group. There are some people who don't give a second thought and think they're actually what the subculture is about. Some people event to make differentiations by saying ""emo kids cut and goths wear all black"". There are stereotypes which hurt both subcultures and in no order they are:

Self harming
Being depressed
Attempting or having thoughts of suicide
Wearing all black
Worshipping the devil
Being part of a cult
Being a drug addict or dealer
Smoker
Alcoholic
Rude, aggressive or elitist type personality
Being in trouble with the law

Wear thrifted clothes.,
Find some good skinnies.,
Buy a zip-hoodie.,
Girl it up.",How to Look Like a Cute Emo Girl2," Think 90’s grunge. Shopping at thrift stores is a great place to find some cute clothing. Fit doesn’t matter, but it’s a great way to spice up an outfit. Find an old rock band tee shirt and make it into a crop top or cut slits in the back of it.

, Skinny jeans should be a staple in your wardrobe. Find some in a dark, dull color to help make your outfit cute. Dark green, maroon, or dark gray are all good options., This is a classic and a great way to add flair to your outfit. You can wear it as-is or add buttons to it to make it look cute.

, As a cute emo, the standard black skinnies with a tee won’t make enough of a statement. Find a dress or skirt and match it with some leg warmers and converse shoes. Make sure the dress is vintage to keep it within the emo style. Or throw on a rock band t-shirt with your skirt. Make the leg warmers your attention piece by wearing colored ones. Remember, black is a popular color but not the only color. For example, emo style typically involves less black than Gothic style. Don’t be afraid to use color to spice up your outfit and show off your cute character.

Patches are a great way to make an accessory yours and to convey your personal emo style.

, These don’t have to be prescription—they can simply be used as a cute accessory for your style. Find some black horn-rimmed glasses and throw them on before walking out the door., The more colors and the styles of hair clips the better. Because your outfit will be mostly subdued colors, add some bright stars, skulls, or even hearts to your hair. The bright clips will stand out against your dark hair."

, Studies have shown that medium length hair is perceived as intelligent. If your hair is medium length, you can neatly braid it, wear it down and natural or put it in a neat looking bun. If you would prefer to keep it long, that is okay, but, you should make sure it's clean and neat. Whatever your style, make sure it doesn't take too long to manage. You will want to spend more time learning and less time standing in front of the mirror. Keep it natural looking and avoid excessive hair product (including dye, except in a natural colour). A small leather headband is good too.

, Cotton polo shirts, T-shirts with the names of museums or with university logos on them, plain and tailored looking pants, knee-length and above the knee skirts and clean, neat, clean-cut and sensible leather shoes/sandals are all nice. Navy blue, plaids and brown also look nice, but don't do it every day. Avoid trends and flashy clothes. Dress modestly. Don't show too much skin.

, No glitter or shine. Imitate the makeup of women of stature. Look for inspiration from fashion websites that address makeup for working women, and only use makeup in that section. You don't have to wear any makeup if you don't want to. Avoid excessive piercings.

, Sometimes it makes people seem more intelligent, especially rectangle and rounded frames. Keep them clean. Thick frames are especially good. However, if you don't need them, don't be pretentious.

,, Start to study very hard and keep trying to raise your grades. Ask your teachers what you can do for extra credit. Your teachers in high school will write recommendations for you for college. Keep that in mind! Become a ""do-er"" at school which means win the science fair, run for office or organize the school dance. Write good articles for the school newspaper.

, Many teens show, or pretend to have, a very negative or bored attitude about high school and working hard. They think it is ""cool"" to be indifferent. Be the opposite. If you don't take delight in school, why waste your time? You are there to learn.

, Keep all your work/books/supplies in one place, along with a desk and a strong desk light. Insist on peace and quiet from other family members. If it is too loud at home, study at the public library. Organising your schoolwork and making lists helps you, not just in school, but in life.

, Try to raise money and awareness for worthy causes such as ""Stop Hunger in Africa"" or ""Cure Childhood Cancer"". You will also feel like a better person for it.

, It will give you much-needed focus and make you more relaxed. Eat protein sources: egg white, tuna fish, chicken, power bars, etc. Try out for a good team sport like soccer or something you enjoy. Get good at it and enjoy it. Attend sports camps in the summer for at least 2 weeks. Try to jog, slowly building up to 5 kilometres (3 miles) a day to help your endurance.

, Have your planner out, then put your pencil case on top in front of you. Get your ruler and pen/pencil out, ready to learn.

, Teachers will think you are really trying and it could be the few marks you will need to move from a B to A.

Go vintage.,
Sport polos and v-necks.,

Get a pair of jean cut-offs or slim, dark denim shorts with a rolled cuff.Instead of buying a pair of shorts, you could make your own by cutting off a pair of old jeans. Simply measure the length you want and mark a line on the inside of the fabric with a ruler. Cut along those lines on the legs with heavy shears, wash your new shorts, and you’re done.

Ask questions.",How to Act and Look Smart," You know your friends like you but how are you seen by your boss, your teachers or strangers on the street? Look at your physical appearance and also your mental take on things.


Take a digital photo of yourself each day in your different outfits.;
, Start adding smart looking pieces to your wardrobe.


Looking smart requires focusing on quality over quantity and choosing a few good quality key pieces, such has a great jacket and pants set.
Pants and jeans: Shop for pants that are tailored and fit you well in length, in the waist and in overall fit. They can be stylish and trendy. So long as they fit well you appear that you took time in putting the outfit together. Choose jeans that fit appropriately. If they are really long you should wear heels (ladies) or have them altered. No one looks smart in hugely over sized jeans that drag the ground. You look like you found a pair of pants and didn't care if they fit.
For the guys, non-baggy corduroys or khakis are good, and in the summer, khaki shorts.
Tops: T-shirts are fine but avoid controversial or rude graphics. Avoid grossly over sized shirts. Start looking for shirts with social messages, vintage rock bands and smart comments.

Make sure the shirts are within your interest. You don't want someone to ask about your message and you not understand what it means. It's fine to wear your favorite band shirts but dress them up with a blazer so you turn it into your look and not appear as if you've emerged from a Hot Topic yard sale. You can keep a lot of your current wardrobe, just polish up the other elements.
Don't wear t-shirts all the time and if you do you should top it with a blazer, and accessorize with a belt and appropriate shoes.



, Buy shirts that are cut to fit your body type. Look for lengths that are appropriate, not too short and not too long. Plan ahead and don't go reaching into the back of your closet for your old styles when the seasons change.


Girls and ladies should look for pieces that appear tailored and flatter their good features. Don't hide under bulky sweaters and sweatshirts but look for tailored looking pieces. Get a combination of short and long sleeve. If the fit is good you can mix it up with fun colors and trendy prints.
Guys should wear appropriately sized shirts. Add variety by choosing fun colors. If the fit is good you can really mix it up with fun colors and trendy prints.

, Men and women should avoid wearing athletic attire and shoes unless you are actually doing something athletic. This doesn't mean wear it because you'll be doing it later in the day, this means unless you are actually at the gym, running laps or in PE you need to keep your athletic wear in a bag. This includes your favorite player jersey.

, You can get some well made shoes with fun colors that enhance your look and make you look polished while still keeping your personality


Men should invest in a few pairs of shoes both in black and brown. Again, look for shoes that can be polished and aren't worn out.







,


Shower and shave regularly. At least once daily or more if you participate in sports.
Wear a nice fragrance or body spray
Guys should get hair cuts every month or so. If you sport a longer style you should at least get the hair trimmed from the back of your neck. You can still be long and funky but you need to keep it shaped and clean looking.
Hairy necks look sloppy and dirty
Ladies should avoid coloring their hair unless they have the time and money to maintain the look and the roots.
Black may be cool now but it may look unnaturally dark. Go for colors that compliment your skin tone.

,


Wash and exfoliate with the appropriate skin care products for your skin type
See a dermatologist if you have acne or skin problems

, Seeing is a good thing. Get glasses if you need them.


Get your eyes checked if you haven't in a while, can't see from the back of class or get headaches when you read or spend too much time on the computer.
If you need glasses you should shop for a neutral colored plastic (brown, tortoise shell or black) frame or a metal frame.
If you wear more silver jewelry, get a silver frame.
If you don't need glasses, then you can get non-prescriptions ones but you do run the risk of being teased if you're caught. Glasses are a commitment. Instead of getting contacts and fake glasses just don't get the contacts. Go with glasses for the most studious look.

, Think about why you do certain things. Do you do things to be controversial? To get attention? To look like your friends or to fit into a certain group? Evaluate your results. You now know something about yourself by the process of introspection. Do your results apply to the general population? Probably. Now you're a philosopher!


Understand you can still sharpen up your look and not lose your integrity or your friends.

, If you tend to dress in a frumpy manner, or older than you really are, you'll need to let go of your comfort zone and be willing to try something new.

, Is it the look? The confidence? Do they just seem more engaging?

, You'll appear smarter if you talk about things you know something about. Sure, you can carry around quantum physics books but when a person familiar with the topic starts engaging in conversation you'll look like a phony and stupid.

, You have to know a little about something, then stock up on trivia. Did you know that Martin Van Buren was the 8th president and started his term in 1837? See? If someone is talking with you or with you and some friends talking about something, and you know a little trivia about it, then you should bring it up. Don't interrupt them or you'll look like a jerk. But remember, there is a fine line between dropping little bits of trivia here and there and being a know it all. Beware of doing this too much.

, Become knowledgeable about news events and the things that are going on in the wider world.


Read at least 20 minutes of news everyday online.
Read about different subjects or people that interest you.
Visit museums, art shows, historical sites, planetariums, etc. Soak up the world around you. Awareness always makes you more knowledgeable and you will have more intelligent things to talk about.
Walk away from the video games and don't spend all night on the computer chatting with friends. You don't have to give either up entirely but you should scale back to make room for other things.

, This includes reading, reports and even extra research.

, If you like music you can read books about your favorite bands, the music industry, older bands that inspired the bands of today, digital production, instruments, etc. The same goes for art, history, fashion, psychology, religion, etc. Carry those books around and you will look smart and be infinitely more interesting than someone who fakes it.

,, This will really broaden your view of the world and bring you much more knowledge about people and society.

, Talk about the past, events in history they experienced and ask questions.

, Be sure to answer as many challenging questions as you can, but avoid commenting on obvious ones as they will garner no respect and a wrong answer will make you look foolish. Ask questions and openly talk to the teacher about the subjects and ideas behind them either during or after class. Your teachers will respect your interest even if it's newly found.

, Sometimes the best thing to do is just to listen. Plus, others will value your opinions more if they are less frequent.

, The people that actually know about it will spot a phony a mile away. Instead, wait for the conversation to drift to something you are familiar with or gently direct the conversation in that direction.

, Be actively engaged in a discussion or conversation. Don't pretend you know everything. The smartest people ask lots of questions. But sometimes pretend that you know... and don't ask a lot of questions that could irritate people a lot.

Understand the origins of the geek.,
Compare to the geek of today.,
Uncover the origins of the word ""nerd."",
Compare communication skills.,
Compare interests.,
Compare their social skills.,
Find out whom they love.,
Discover where they work.,
Enjoy the differences.",How to Tell the Difference Between Nerds and Geeks," In order to fully appreciate the modern geek, one must find the roots of geekdom.


Back in the early 1900s, when traveling carnivals were popular, there was a performer called the ""geek."" His job was to perform bizarre and disgusting acts for the amusement of the locals. Notably, this included biting the heads off live chickens.;
, Today's geek rarely bites the heads off chickens. Instead, a geek is somebody who is generally very knowledgeable — even to the point of obsession— about a particular topic.


Being a geek gained traction when self-adopted by computer programmers and other technical people, but has since become more mainstream. There are wine geeks, car geeks, and Lord of the Rings geeks, each of which closely follows the minutiae of their chosen obsession.
To further clarify, it's important to note that geeks are generally social. They have their fascination in what makes them unique, but you probably wouldn't know of their geekitude unless they told you about it.

, The word ""nerd"" was started on in 1954, by a young doctor by the name of Seuss, in a line that read, ""A merkle, a nerd, and a seersucker too!"" If you don't wish to defile nerddom by calling someone a nerd, you can also call them a ""seersucker.""The general connotation is of an irritating, unattractive person who may be brilliant, but chooses to focus on non-social pursuits.Another definition of ""nerd"" is a four-letter word with a six-figure income., Geeks and nerds may share similar outward traits — or not — but when you compare their approach to life, the differences become apparent.


Nerds love to use jargon or unfamiliar terminology in their dialogue, whereas geeks will use obscure references rarely.

For example, a nerd might say, ""That's an overused Foley. The SD must be lazy.""
The geek would say of the same thing, ""Oh! I love how Percy Jackson uses the Wilhelm Scream in every movie!""


Geeks often take interest in the microcosmic details of life, such as noticing that your present situation is much like one from a news article or a novel. Nerds will be seemingly uninterested in the details of daily life, being more focused on the macroscopic, such as scientific possibilities and the future of humankind.

, You will know them by how they play.


A geek may enjoy board games, film (and may follow directors, composers, or key grips obsessively), tech gadgets, hacking, and techno music.
A nerd enjoys solitary pursuits like programming and Second life, or games like chess and go.

, While they both have obsessive traits about their passions, they diverge when it comes to normal human interactions.


A geek has normal social skills, though they can be prone to being pretentious and long-winded, especially when the topic happens to land on their particular passion. Then, they may not let you go until they've explained exactly how this widget works, and the history of the team that created it.
A nerd is generally more introverted. They may know a great deal about exactly the same thing a geek specializes in, but getting them to talk about it can take some doing.

, It's a universal truism that geeks can fall for anybody (though the reverse may not be true). However, most nerds fall only for nerds. This may be a survival tactic, but nobody knows for sure.

, While nerds and geeks are both intelligent and educated, there are some career paths that appeal only to one or the other:


In addition to populating IT departments the world over, you can find geeks in artistic jobs like web design, graphic design, or game designs. You may find geeks behind the bar, in your local record store, or pulling espressos at the coffee shop.
Look for nerds to be working as a rocket scientist, or programming the software that the IT department has to manage. They may be an engineer, or an inventor, or even a brilliant recluse who rarely sees the light of day. You might also find them behind the counter at the last remaining video store.
Nerds tends to be interested in the field of STEM - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. People in this field tend to be intelligent and will require years of college education.

, Geeks, nerds, dweebs, dorks, twerps, dolts, and norms all have their niche, and all have something to contribute to this great world of ours. It's fun to laugh and draw out stereotypes, but keep in mind that unless proven otherwise, everybody has value.


Keep in mind that most geeks are part nerd, and most nerds are part geek. Sometimes the line between is very fuzzy, and remember these two definitions from the Urban Dictionary
Nerd: The person you will one day call ""boss"".
Geek: The people you picked on in high school and wind up working for as an adult.

Wear glasses.,
Buff up your lexicon.,
Enunciate and speak clearly.

,
Speak only when you have something substantial to contribute.

,
Don't use sentence fillers, such as 'umm..', 'errr...', and 'like'.,
There are basically two looks to go for: option one, the preppy 'Oxford'/'Harvard' look.,
Eccentricity can be effective, but can be easily misinterpreted; go for the eccentric Edwardian gentlemen as opposed to the tortured Gothic.

,
Learn things in quick ways.,
If someone asks you something, answer them as completely as you can with your current knowledge.,
Avoid swearing and use of other types of 'vulgar' language.,
Be sure you're not being arrogant--this has nothing to do with being intelligent, and all too much to do with being rude and conceited.

",How to Appear Intelligent," People often associate glasses with intelligence. In fact, this has been studied by body language experts.;
, It's common knowledge that intelligent people tend to use longer words. However, when someone intentionally warps their speech into a bunch of--ahem--sesquipedalian, loquacious verbiage--it looks silly, and is obviously fake. Intelligent people use longer words because they're more precise and efficient, and they help explain things in a way that's more easily understood (if you can get a handle on the vocabulary, at least). Avoiding slang helps. If you want to improve your vocabulary, read! You don't have to memorize Great Expectations, especially when a good novel will accomplish the same thing.
If you want to adopt this speech pattern and are 13 or older, I recommend reading the web comic Girl Genius--it's a steampunk web comic that demonstrates how to do this well, while being funny, entertaining, and free to read at the same time. Nearly all the characters speak this way, and they use plenty of longer words you can pick up. Download a dictionary app on your computer or phone, or keep a dictionary site open, so you can understand unfamiliar words. You also get bonus nerd points for reading GG, because it's an extremely nerdy comic.

,,, Sentence fillers make you appear as if you don't know what you are talking about or just appears as less mature (especially when you say like in a weird context). Pause, and run your sentence past in your head before you say it. Pausing to think for a second always looks intelligent.

, The full intellectual look is nearly always casually smart. You will need several well-fitting suits and at least one tweed or moleskin blazer. Don't go for the cheap suit; it looks like you don't know how to dress properly and are only wearing a suit because of decorum. Furthermore, cut your hair. Whilst not quite a requisite for intellect, it shows that you want to look smart but don't wish to have to maintain your look (as in not wanting to style your hair every morning, but still wishing to be efficient).
The other option is the long-haired, bohemian, 'I don't care what you think' look - a risky bet because it can easily be confused with the 'I'm too poor and lazy to wear proper apparel' look. This option is okay for the impoverished genius, but may not get you that post at Oxford or Yale.

,, Want to carry on a conversation with your well-read friends? If you don't have much patience for the classics, read CliffNotes so you at least know what they're about.
Familiarize yourself with famous authors and popular philosophies. Get abbreviated, crash-course lessons on a couple different topics of your choice. Art history? Go for it. Want to know all about the Civil War? Look on the Internet. Mildly interested in psychology? Try the book Psych101--it's a small book that'll familiarize you with the basic theories and theorists, and you can pick it up and read little bits at your leisure.

, Don't make things up. Truly intelligent people are secure in their intelligence, so they're not afraid to admit they don't know everything about everything. Nobody does.

, The primary reason to swear is to use 'shock' tactics; using language that society has deemed inappropriate is supposed to add meaning to your statements. Intelligent people have more creative ways to make their point than bad language, and they tend to look down upon profanity. Give it a rest.

Use words you’re already familiar with so that your vocabulary doesn’t sound forced. And wait for the right moment to use the big, impressive ones.For example, instead of randomly saying, “My backpack is capacious!” wait until a friend brings up how big or roomy your backpack is.
If you want to have better vocab words at the ready, subscribe to a daily word-a-day email or install an app on your phone that teaches you a new word each day.;
, People appear smarter when they’re speaking with emotion. Rather than trying to sound monotone or aloof, get excited. Speak a little faster than you normally would and use as few pauses as possible. Change the volume of your voice a few times while you’re talking, by starting loud, then lowering your voice, and then getting loud again. This makes you seem energetic and confident., If you find yourself talking over others or interrupting people, scale back a little and let others speak. People who need to dominate conversations look insecure, so make sure you regularly pause to ask someone a question. Take deep breaths to regain control of yourself, and take this opportunity to listen to and consider your friend’s point of view., Maybe your friends are into politics, or maybe they’re more into entertainment news. Educate yourself on whatever it is that interests them. Browse Wikipedia to get a general overview of the topic, then delve further into online articles about different points of view.For example, if climate change comes up in conversation, talk about a new environmental bill that’s been introduced by lawmakers.
If your friends talk about movies and famous actors, look for reviews of new releases. Pick an actor you know they like and visit their IMDB page online to learn more about them.

, Make it a daily habit to watch the news on TV, listen to a news podcast, or skim headlines on a news website. Sign up for a daily news summary email, or set up a Google news alert for whatever topics your friends like to talk about. That way you’ll always know the latest information and you can be informed enough to start the conversation.Look for reliable, unbiased news sources like BBC or NPR to be sure you’re getting the best information., Nobody likes a know-it-all, especially if that person clearly doesn’t know it all. If a question comes up that you truly don’t know the answer to, admit that you’re not sure. This will make you seem self-aware and honest – marks of an intelligent person.Follow up your admission with a promise to find out the answer. You could look it up on your phone right away, or do some research later. This sends the message that you’re curious and interested in learning.

, Eye contact can make you seem more confident, and confidence makes you seem intelligent. Rather than looking at your hands while talking, look someone in the eye during a conversation. If you’re in a group, try to make eye contact with each person as you’re speaking so that you seem equally comfortable with each person., Good posture is another quality that makes people think you’re confident. Rather than slouching in your seat, sit up straight so you look interested in the conversation. Try uncrossing your legs and arms to seem more open and approachable as well. If you appear closed off, people may not want to talk to you, and then you can’t prove how smart you are., Smiling shows that you’re at ease with people and that you don’t doubt yourself. Even if you’re not sure if what you’re saying is smart, interesting, or even correct, say it with a smile. People will likely still be drawn to you and think you know what you’re talking about., The more skin you show, the more people will be thinking about your body rather than what you have to say. Dress in a preppy fashion to make the best impression of intelligence. Try a sweater layered over a button-up shirt, and pair it with well-fitting jeans and clean, comfortable sneakers or ballet flats., Don’t go out of your way to add glasses to your wardrobe if you have no need of them. But if you normally wear contacts, or you have glasses for reading, opt to wear your glasses more often. People associate glasses with intelligence, so this is one of the quickest ways to look a little bit smarter."
"
Improve your vocabulary.,
Be expressive when you talk.,
Cite your sources.,
Ask questions.,
Play the Devil’s Advocate.,
Speak last.",How to Act More Intelligent1," A wider vocabulary is a great way to show you are intelligent. Expand the number and type of words you know, and look for more creative ways to express yourself.


Read more to find new words to use, and start writing more to make use of them. Signing up for a word of the day email from dictionaries like Merriam-Webster are also ways to build your vocabulary slowly, and in interesting ways.Avoid swearing. Littering your language with inappropriate words will make you appear less intelligent. In the wrong circumstances, you can even get yourself in trouble with rules surrounding office or classroom conduct.;
, When you talk, avoid a monotone. Change your pitch and tone slightly as you talk, and add emphasis to important words. It will help create energy, and make people think you are interested in what you are saying.Be sure to make eye contact when you talk to people. It will help you appear more focused and confident. If you are speaking to a group of people, try to make momentary eye contact with as many of them as possible.
Keep an eye on your talking speed too. In general, it is better to speak slowly and clearly, which will help you look confident and make it easier to understand you. The other option is to speak more quickly than usual. Cramming more words into a small space of time will make you appear intelligent for knowing all that information., You learned your information from somewhere, so when you talk to someone, go ahead and mention your sources. This will let others know that you are well read, and like to consider different ideas.A simple introduction to a point or question like “I read a newspaper article the other day that said...” should be enough to suggest that you picked up the idea from somewhere else.

, It may seem counterintuitive, but intelligent people ask more questions. They like learning about how or why things work. Asking questions shows that you are curious and want to learn more about something.If you don’t think you have something intelligent to ask, something vague like “What do you think about this?” is a good place to start. This lets the other person know that you recognize his intelligence and ability. Plus, by giving him the opportunity to talk about subjects he knows, you will probably learn something as well.
Asking questions is also a good way to remind yourself that you don’t always have all the answers. It suggests you are confident in your intelligence level without having to be right all the time., Don’t be afraid to provide a well-reasoned counter to someone’s idea. You don’t have to disagree with everything others suggest, but pointing out flaws in an argument, or being able to provide a contrary opinion will show you as someone willing to think differently.When you disagree, remember to keep your focus on the other person’s argument or position. Avoid personal attacks, which will only make people angry at you, and doesn’t make you look very intelligent.

, Let other people open the conversation with their ideas and thoughts. This will give you time to collect your thoughts, and build on what other people have said. Even if you can’t come up with your own idea, you can help to summarize other people’s thoughts.One good idea is to repeat someone else’s thoughts as a way to agree with it. Make sure you give credit too, so you’ll want to say something like “I agree with Jerry, that’s a great idea to increase productivity.”

Don't fear looking good.,
Improve your wardrobe.,
Be classy and considerate.,
Be nice all the time but be firm when you need to be.,
Read widely.,
Remain down-to-earth and relate to a wider variety of people.,
Think differently and be strong.,
Lighten up and allow yourself the space to have fun.,
Have a sense of confidence.",How to Be a Cute Genius," It's common to see a smart person radiating an ""I don't care how I look, take me as I am"" attitude. Unfortunately, that also suggests that you're bound to be stubborn and that you're committed to looking frumpy or unkempt. Flaunting what you have, both looks and smarts is actually a way of taking care of yourself and presenting the best you have to offer to the world, so taking a negative approach to looking good won't help your own cause. Being sexy and smart can make your life easier if you let it. Analyze the reasoning behind why you choose to present this front to the world and not make the most of your appearance. Some of the reasons may be:



You feel rebellious. You'd like the world to accept you the way you are because you believe ridiculously high standards are set about beauty and that beauty is a way of being objectified. While there is a risk of objectification, it's not a good reason to eschew making the most of your appearance; rather, it's a reason to help show that a good looking person is also a smart person who refuses to tolerate labels and insinuations.

You believe that people will only love you for your intelligence. This is especially likely if you have been told how intelligent you are during your formative years, creating a self-awareness that intelligence is a key definer of who you are. This is especially common in praise-heavy parenting or mentoring that lacks a focus on praising effort and simply praises the trait of intelligence instead. Yes, you are intelligent but that isn't a reason to define yourself by this trait alone, thereby ignoring creating a more balanced and happier self.

You genuinely can't be bothered with all the fashion, beauty and personal care routines. It takes up time, costs money you'd rather spend elsewhere and it draws you into a world that doesn't interest you in the slightest and which, in some cases, you feel superior to. While it is not being suggested you turn yourself into a fashionista and spend your day reading airhead magazines, it is important to realize that it is possible to find a balance in creating a pleasant appearance that doesn't involve oodles of time and money.;
, While you don't have to toss out everything you own, you do need to cast a critical eye over all those items that are letting down your appearance. Baggy, ripped, unclean, dark and dingy items don't deserve a place in your wardrobe. And if you like a certain item of clothing because you know it makes you look good and feel comfortable, focus on getting more of that type, to reduce the time investment needed to work out what to wear each day.


Match clothes a little more carefully. You could organize your wardrobe using Picasa to speed up things. One afternoon spend categorizing your wardrobe will pay off dividends in the future, especially if you update it regularly when purchasing new clothing. Use the online photos to make matching faster and easier (and a lot more like fun than a chore).
Try a few bold colors here and there to brighten up darker clothing. Even a simple but beautifully bright scarf or pashmina can lift an all-black outfit and make you feel good about yourself.
Buy within your favorite color range and style to keep down costs and time. When you know you're wearing what works for you, you won't find it a trial.
Consider tailored clothing. In reality, you only need a few really good items to set off all your clothes. Tailored jackets, dressy pants and a few decent skirts can lift all the other wardrobe items to stellar levels and you'll look amazing. And the beauty of tailored clothing is that it fits you and is unique. It's worth the initial investment; just be sure to get classic colors and cut and to use long-lasting fabrics.

, A classy person uses good manners and thinks about others first. Don't act up like everybody else. Talk in a moderate tone, and don't talk unless necessary. Make sure everything you say has some sense of intelligence and thoughtfulness about it but be careful not to keep going on and on just because a topic happens to be your pet passion or peeve. Move about like you have a purpose and with a slight edginess to your strut. Don't forget to smile at appropriate times or else you'll risk being called a snob.

, You're not a pushover but you're also not the iron maiden or Thor. Remember that being nice gets you places and people love someone who shows a genuine interest in them. By the same token though, don't overdo the niceness to the point of seeming nosy or cloying. You need to feel the nice vibe, not just pretend it and being nice helps to impress upon people that you're not stuck up about your beauty and smarts but that you're very approachable.

, You may love reading enormous tomes of literature, science and math articles and lots of very complex things but these aren't all that life is about. While you're not expected to go out of your way to read fashion or entertainment information, try to keep abreast of some of the most popular news in these areas from time to time. You can do this by quickly glancing through websites, reading magazines and listening to radio, podcasts or the TV. Assuming that things are beneath you will often mean that you're not well versed in what the general population is thinking or creating memes about and that can be really alienating for your own development and sense of community belonging. Remember that you do not have to respond in the same manner as those who thrill to these things but having an understanding of what's interesting people and exciting them can help you to be more compassionate, attuned and involved in society.


Become a knowledge glutton. Read, listen, observe, and remember. The more information you can store in your mind, the more connections you can make. That does not necessarily mean you should spend most of your time reading. You can take an active approach to learning no matter what you are doing. Anyone can watch a cartoon and be none the wiser. A genius can watch a cartoon and think about what kind of animation is used, how the characters are developed, how the plot relates to real life, why the cartoon is popular, and practically write a dissertation discussing various facets of that single cartoon.

, Not everyone is ""smart"", so cut down on those technical terms and complicated equations and phrases and save them for the right situations where they would be required. This also prevents you from sounding like you're trying to show off. Remember, there will definitely be more situations where you can appropriately prove how smart you are. Just don't force it. You just might turn people away from you because they might feel intimidated.


Also remember that while being IQ smart may be your thing, a lot of people have excellent emotional intelligence (EQ) and this is more important for getting ahead in the world through positive interactions and social- and self-awareness. If you lack EQ, be sure to improve it and to respect the EQ of others you meet through life. A person with good EQ will also sidestep any feelings of superiority or contempt toward others. See improve emotional intelligence for more ideas.

, Every kind of genius is different and individual. And every kind of opinion (even if it sounds completely off-the-wall) has something true within it. If you are the first to think of something or the first to see an old problem in a new way, you will encounter many people who insist that you're an idiot, a fool or a dreamer. Expect this to happen but don't take it on board; if you truly believe in what you've realized, discovered or concluded, then keep following it through to its ultimate consequences and helping people understand it better. Remember, the broken record approach eventually works, provided you are persistent. Ironically, once your idea is successful or accepted, you'll be called a genius. Being a genius simply depends on how society's viewing things a the time and geniuses are often way ahead of social time.

, Remember, it's okay to set your serious persona aside once in a while. Use your sense of humor to provoke a shake-up in how things are always done and seen. For example, say something ridiculously crazy once in a while, as this breaks the whole routine of strictly calculated speech. And be sure to put away your extra brains and have safe fun occasionally. It's not like you will forget everything you know in just one night out! Socialize with more people and not just those who are just like you. Get involved in other things other than just your books, and research. Yes, it is okay to have fun once in a while and when you're laughing and smiling, you'll also be glowing with happiness.

, Of all things, your air of confidence speaks volumes about you. Confidence not only helps you in terms of how you're perceived by others, but it's also helpful to your academic and professional pursuits as well. Just make sure that your confidence does not turn into being overly confident in a way that starts making everyone around you feel intimidated.

Pay attention to their listening skills.,
Notice empathy.,
Pay attention to courtesy and conscientiousness.,
Assess how they talk about others.,
Notice how they work and get along with others.",How to Recognize a Person Who Has Emotional Intelligence1," A person who is truly emotionally intelligent will be an adept listener. Rather than dominating the conversation, cutting people off, or constantly interjecting, you will note that they are thoughtfully engaged in listening to the other person. Often times, they will summarize what the person has just said to them to signal that they understand and hear them.You might hear them say things like “so what I’m hearing is that it’s not the job that you don’t like, it’s the miscommunication from the staff that bothers you.”;
, Emotionally intelligent people are typically also highly empathetic. Empathy is defined as the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. A person who is empathetic is likely to ask a lot of questions and display curiosity and genuine concern when someone is upset or having an issue. You will likely see them consoling others when they are crying.People often go to them when they are having an issue and want support. Notice the people in your circle whom others tend to flock to.

, Another testament of those with EI is being gracious and thoughtful. This can be evidenced through both physical actions and verbal responses. For instance, the person who regularly leaves their trash for others to clean up is likely not emotionally intelligent. Likewise, the person who constantly talks about how great their significant other is with a coworker who is undergoing a divorce is likely not EI., A person with EI will steer away from gossip and speaking negatively about others, unless necessary. If you regularly hear them bashing others or notice that they tend to be in the middle of drama, then this person is likely not emotionally intelligent.EI people tend to be very honest but not unnecessarily blunt.
Though they will not bash someone, they are also not ignorant to the shortcomings or negative qualities of others.

, If you work with this person, you can easily assess how much of a team player they are. Reflect on the times that you have had to complete projects with them and whether or not it was a smooth process.Note also how well they kept their promises related to deadlines.
Note whether they bicker with others or manage to keep the peace.

Don't worry about race and ethnicity––these don't matter.,
Get the attitude.,
Get the look.,
Dress brightly and colorfully.,
Do Kawaii makeup.,
Get your nails done.,
Keep your eyes large as possible.,
Do Kawaii hair.,
Be yourself.,
Try watching anime.,
Surround yourself with friends, Kawaii or not.,
Have Kawaii role models.",How to Be a Kawaii Girl," Even if you are not Asian, you can still be Kawaii. Being Kawaii is more than just about race or ethnicity. Your body shape doesn't matter either, Kawaii girls can be short, tall, flat, curvy, or skinny!;
, Kawaii girls have sweet, nice attitudes that everyone loves! They giggle a lot, are super kind to everyone around them, never pick fights, and are just pleasant to be around! Kawaii is all about being adorable, so find things that you like. Hello Kitty is super adorable and loved by many so that's a good place to start. Don't just get something because it is Kawaii, get it because you like it.

, Here's where the innocent, lovable image comes in. Kawaii girls dress in bright, frilly clothes that just scream ""cute!"". Think outfits like floral, childish/elegant, scalloped designs, patterned overalls, balloon shorts with bows, etc.


Go out shopping find the most adorable clothing you can find. Look for colour and cuteness, but, if you don't love and don't think it would look good on you, put it back. Don't buy something you don't like just because it is Kawaii.

, Put lots of key chains and things like that on your backpack or purse. Kid robot has some Kawaii stuffed animals.Accessorize well and make sure your outfits look good together.

, Use black gel and/or liquid eyeliner, pink cream blush, sparkly pink lip gloss, and light concealer/foundation. You want a clean but innocent makeup look. For a good Kawaii makeup tutorial, I suggest watching Jemma Kuma's video on Kawaii makeup on YouTube.

, Look videos up on Youtube if you want a good idea for DIY ideas. Often Kawaii girls wear fake, long and accessorized nails. This might be too much for you, so you got to find out what suits to you. Neatly manicured nails are also good and can work in lots of looks.

, In pictures, Kawaii girls always have eyes wide open. You can lay an ice-cold washcloth on your eyes for about five minutes, then apply some pearly eye shadow to under your eyes, on your crease. Big eyes are cute, but don't worry if your eyes aren't big.<brand>
, For hair, think ""young child."" Pigtails, side ponytails, braids, anything you'd see on a student in elementary school. Don't forget to add bows!

, Add your own flair to the Kawaii style using whatever you like, and make the style your own.

, It is super fun and interesting and there is something for everyone. It's not all fighting and things like that! For example, try watching Peach Girl. It's great!

, Really, labels don't matter at all. All that really matters is how much love and support you surround yourself with.

, Look around online for great Kawaii women you can look up to. Make sure they make good decisions, are super nice and sweet, and use good language, because Kawaii girls never curse.

Start purchasing dresses.,
You don't always have to wear dresses!,
Makeup is important!,
Get a hair accessory.,
Get some type of nails.,
Hime gals aren't usually snobby!",How to Be a Himegyaru," Hime gyaru is about a sweet and innocent princess appearance. If you already have cute, frilly dresses, that's a good starting point. Dresses are mostly knee-length, but some are shorter. Popular things on hime gyaru dresses are fake fur, pearls, animal print, flowers, bows and anything that's cute and sweet. But keep all these things in moderation, like ruffles just at the bottom of a dress, or lace on the sleeves. Don't make yourself look like your outfit is eating you alive! Dressed tend to be very regal looking, and generally are in pastel colors - after all, you're a princess girl! Popular brands in the hime gyaru scene include Jesus Diamante and Liz Liza.;
, If you have a nice pair of jeans with no holes, pair it with tops that have bows, lace, animal print, and anything very cute and hime. Add some matching ballet flats or heels and a pearl necklace/cute jewelry, along with cute gyaru makeup and hair. Just be sure to keep it very nice - you're a princess gal, remember?

, Hime gyaru gals usually wear lots of makeup, but it is very simple looking. Usually hime gyarus will take use of liquid eyeliner in black, light foundation, fake eyelashes and/or mascara and pink lip gloss/lipstick. Eye makeup is usually done to make the eyes appear larger. Tanning is optional, but if you do get one, don't make it very dark or orange, usually hime gals just use a light bronzer if they choose to tan at all.

, One huge flower (i.e. a rose) or a silk bow are good hair accessories. If you don't have a bow a little crown or tiara (it shouldn't be too big or it will look funny), whether plastic or metal, will be an adorable option. You MUST have a hair accessory. Popular hairstyles include having your hair teased into a high beehive or bouffant hairstyle, with lots of curls, or having a nice, simple bun. Straightened hair isn't very hime unless you have a bouffant  to accompany it--the elaborate big-hair hairdo is a trademark hime gyaru style. The hime haircut is perfect for hime gyaru--it's basically long bangs cut to your jaw, with regular bangs as well, the rest of the hair is cut evenly at one length.

, Fake nails are very pretty, especially they are nice if you naturally have short nails, but if you want to go totally natural, a clear or shimmery white nail coating can be used. They should be decorated/painted in some fashion. Many tutorials for hime gyaru nails are available online. Furthermore there is also a lot of press-on nails to be found online, a quick Google search will easily help you to find what you're searching after. A lot of hime gyarus - and gyarus in general - use very fancy nails, and many of them happens to be 3d, with laces, bows, pearls, and other kinds of girly stuff.

, Be kind to others, and don't dumb yourself down to seem like a perfect princess!! A lot of gyarus are mean to each other, and many people doesn't want to be gyaru usually because the other people in the gyaru community can be quite rude. So, be nice. Maybe others will follow your path and be nicer to other gyarus. In general, you should also be nice to everyone. Don't be afraid to try new things, and stop thinking about what others will think about you. This is your body and you will choose what kind of clothes you want to decorate it with. Each person have different opinions, so you can't expect everyone to like what you're doing - but furthermore you cannot expect everyone to hate what you're doing. And you don't always have to be frilly and girly, you can still do anything you want, gyaru is simply a fashion, it doesn't restrict what music you listen to, activities you do in your spare time, or how you choose to act. And lastly, BE CONFIDENT! Lovely makeup, cute hair and nice clothes mean nothing if you don't think you look good!

Use confident body language.,
Dress appropriately.,
Carry around something to read.,
Talk to yourself.",How to Act More Intelligent2," People associate intelligence with confidence, as it suggests you know what you are talking about. Stand or sit up straight, and don’t be afraid to approach people directly while looking them in the eye.Smiling often is another way to project confidence, and make people feel more comfortable around you.

, People respond well to those who are dressed well for their setting. Your clothes don’t need to be the cutting edge of fashion, but should fit you well and be appropriate for your work or classroom.


Purple, maybe matched with grey, is a good color to wear that suggests intelligence.Keep your body covered, and avoid revealing too much. Showing skin makes people focus on your body, rather than your mind.Adding items to carry around with you can make you feel more intelligent as well, especially if they have something to do with your job.Even carrying something like a notebook or clipboard can help give you the impression of a hard worker with something important to do.
Wear glasses. Wearing glasses is a common stereotype of intelligent people, so don’t be afraid to take advantage of this. It can be less effective if you don’t really need them and people know. They will likely recognize them more as a fashion statement, which diminishes the effect., People associate reading with intelligence, so having some reading material with you suggests that you have other things on your mind. Just make sure it is the kind of thing that other people will believe is smart reading, so children’s books or comic books are probably not a good idea.Make sure your reading material fits the setting. Reading a novel can be good for general settings, but something like the Wall Street Journal is much better in a business area. Just make sure you aren’t reading when you should be doing your actual job.

, You don’t want to be having regular arguments with yourself, but talking very quietly will make it seem like you are thinking about something important. Verbalizing your thoughts is also a good way to help yourself work through complex ideas."
"
Read.,
Work on improving your memory.,
Surround yourself with smart people.,
Find new cultural experiences.",How to Act More Intelligent3," One of the best ways to improve your intelligence is to read a variety of different things. Reading non-fiction, including books, magazines, and newspapers, gives you facts that build your base of knowledge. Readers are also more likely to be good at solving problems and finding meaningful patterns.This includes fiction as well. Fictional works can help improve your pattern-finding too. Plus, reading fiction can improve your emotional intelligence, that is your ability to read and respond to other people’s feelings.

, You probably already know a lot of facts and other information, but sometimes have trouble recalling it. Find ways to work on improving your fact recall, such as writing down information when you learn it the first time.When learning new information, find ways to associate it with other, easier to remember, things. Try to use or develop acronyms (using first letters to create words, like “ROY G. BIV” for the colors of the rainbow) or acrostics (using first letters to create sentences, like “Every Good Boy Does Fine” for lines of a treble music staff).

, Find people smarter than you are, and try to spend time with them. These people will be able to share their knowledge with you, even if it is just showing you better ways to learn things. It can be tough on your confidence at times, but it will help you remind yourself that there are always things you can learn., Rather than reading the same books or watching the same TV shows, look for something new and different. Visit a museum, see a music group, or even do something adventurous like hiking. People tend to think those who experience more diverse events are more intelligent. This will also give you good stories to tell about looking at art or listening to new and interesting things."
"
Look for direct eye contact.,
Look for a genuine smile.,
Recognize calm gestures.,
Notice if they mirror your gestures.",How to Recognize a Person Who Has Emotional Intelligence2," Those with high emotional intelligence will often look you directly in your eye when speaking to you to convey that they are paying attention and are focused. Those with low EI will look down at their feet or at their phone while you are speaking and may not even be hearing what you’re saying., When a person is emotionally intelligent, they do not feel the need to fake emotions. Therefore, any expressions of happiness, sadness, or anger will be genuine. Notice whether or not the person you are assessing is showcasing a smile that is genuine.A genuine smile is indicated by the eyes, as well. When someone fakes a smile, their eyes seem disengaged from the process. A true smile requires the full face for effect.

, You can also assess a person’s gestures to determine if they are emotionally intelligent. A person with high EI will want to convey emotions that are appropriate for the setting and that will not increase anxiety in the person they are speaking with. Watch out for those who make wild and unexpected gestures or who take up too much physical space by spreading their arms or legs out unnecessarily.Fidgeting is also a sign of those with low EI.
If a person has a poker face, this means they are trying to hide their true emotions. While this may be useful in some settings, you can properly emote without having to be dramatic or stifle yourself.
Notice those who display controlled breathing. A person who is constantly huffing and puffing is likely not EI.

, One of the biggest signs of an emotionally intelligent person is body mirroring. Mirroring is defined as the act of mimicking certain gestures of the person you are speaking with to convey empathy. It is often done unconsciously, but it shows that the person you are speaking to is actively listening and feeling for you.If you have your head tilted slightly to the side, notice if they do, as well.

"
"
Recognize open-mindedness.,
Perceive their level of self-awareness.,
Ask questions.,
Notice how they control their emotions.,
Notice how they handle criticism.",How to Recognize a Person Who Has Emotional Intelligence3," An emotionally intelligent person will often be accepting of and open to the ideas and suggestions of others. Though they may not always agree, they will at least tend to acknowledge the validity of the thought while respectfully voicing their own opinion.


If this person is willing to try new ideas, they likely have some degree of emotional intelligence.
Being open minded signals that the person acknowledges that they do not know everything nor have all the answers.

, Self awareness is defined as the awareness of your own character, wishes, and motivations. If someone tells you that they believe they are honest, but you have caught them lying several times recently, then perhaps they are not very self aware. However, the person who openly and honestly admits both their strengths and their flaws has an understanding of themselves that helps develop their level of emotional intelligence., You can assess a person’s level of emotional intelligence through asking them questions about their thoughts and feelings. Ask them questions about how they handle stress or who they look up to or aspire to be like. This will give you an idea about their inner thoughts and desires.You might ask something like “what do you do to take care of yourself when you’re stressed?”
You could also ask “who do you turn to when you’re facing a difficult decision and why?”

, A person who has high levels of EI will tend to be extremely in control of their emotions. This does not mean that they will not be expressive, but that they will not overreact or respond dramatically to circumstances that do not warrant that. If a person cries over the slightest issue or throws things when angry, they are likely not very in tune with their emotions because they do not know how to respond appropriately.Notice who around you, while being emotional, keeps a calm and steady demeanor.

, One of the truest tests of emotional intelligence is being able to handle criticism with grace. People who are not emotionally intelligent tend to either shut down completely when criticized or react with unwarranted intensity. Notice the person who remains calm and perhaps even asks questions to understand the criticism.For example, perhaps someone says that they didn’t complete a project well. An EI person might respond by saying “I admit that I could have done a more thorough job, but I was facing some time constraints. I will take your critique into consideration moving forward, however.”

Get your basics down!,
Plan a cohesive wardrobe.,
Learn to sew.,
Shop secondhand.,
Join a local Lolita community.",How to Be a Budget Lolita," Before you begin, be sure to familiarise yourself with the fashion. If you only have a vague idea of what you're trying to achieve, you may end up shopping through vintage stores and the high street, and completely miss the mark in terms of the overall look.

The Lolita Handbook on Livejournal is a great place to start understanding the most basic elements of the style.;
, If you pick and choose bits of different substyles, it will be much more difficult and expensive to coordinate your dresses. Select one substyle or theme to start with. That way, you can mix and match basics, and reuse expensive items such as handbags and shoes in different coordinates without ruining the look., Many Lolitas make their own dresses and accessories, and it means that you can tailor dresses to your size. This is especially useful if you find yourself being bigger or smaller than most standard sizes that brands manufacture.

Be sure to select good quality materials. Cottons and soft laces are great for beginner projects. Avoid cheap-looking satins and scratchy lace. Remember, these will likely be dresses you will wear often, make sure the materials will be comfortable to wear!
Further discussion of materials and basic patterns can be found on The Lolita Handbook on Livejournal.

, Even on a tight budget, you can afford to buy brand if you're not buying brand new.

Make a Lacemarket account. Lacemarket is a marketplace for Lolitas to buy and sell their clothes and accessories. Always be sure to check a seller's feedback on the site before purchasing!
Closet Child and Alice Fururun are two reliable Japanese second hand stores. If you check their sites often, you can sometimes grab a great condition brand dress for as little as ¥6000 ($48~/€46 at the time of writing).
There are also some Lolita Sales groups on Facebook. Again, be sure to check feedback and obey group rules.

, Some communities hold swap meets, where members bring along items to sell and buy from others. Some even have their own small sales communities. You will hopefully come to befriend some of the members, and may even learn some tips about where to shop, or where to pick up Lolita-appropriate shoes or accessories locally."

You can purchase brand items second hand online and you can also find 'Lolita' items locally. With a little creativity, though, you can cultivate your own wardrobe from a variety of places near you.


Stores such as Forever 21, H&M, Macy's, etc they all have skirts and blouses that can be used to build your wardrobe.
Check out second-hand stores for good deals on old skirts and dresses. You can often find what might seem to be ""out of date"" dresses that will fit in perfectly with the style. Plus you'll save lots of money.
When picking out your clothes be aware of the silhouettes that are prevalent in the fashion and the flow of the outfit.;
, Basic party, church or summer dresses are all effective for pulling off a basic Lolita style. It's about looking classy in an almost Victorian fashion, taking inspiration from the floral patterns, and the sense of elegance from that era. It's a cute or elegant look.


The most common type of Lolita blouse is a button-down shirt with a peter-pan collar, which is a round type of collar. Though any type of blouse can be used but it shouldn't expose the skin too much. Think elegance.
The classic Lolita skirt or dress are the bell and A line shapes. This shape is achieved thanks to the petticoats and bloomers beneath. A Lolita skirt can be longer then knee length and shorter by only 2"". If you are short and petite size, its best if the skirt is slightly above the knee. It will make you look a lot taller. It works with any look, not only lolita.
It is common for this style to involve details in complementary or contrasting colors, such as black and white.

, A Lolita shouldn't leave the house without putting a cute little bow or clip into their hair. Cute little hairclips, headbands, and flowers can be used to provide a little accent for the hair. This is one of the hallmarks of the style.


Headbands are also popular, which may come in all shapes and sizes.
Large bows are also very common. Smaller bows such as on barrettes may also be used if one wants a less overpowering look.

, Petticoats are often necessary to achieve that bell shape that is so essential to the Lolita silhouette, while bloomers are also often used to add some layers and warmth to the outfit. It's somewhat elaborate, but in keeping with the Victorian nature of the look.


Knee-length socks, over-knee socks, stockings, and opaque tights are often a part of a Lolita look as well. Sheer tights are sometimes thought to be too ""sexy"" for Lolita, while ankle socks aren't quite elaborate enough for the style.

, Mary Janes are perfect for this look. Think of the types of shoes a little girl might have worn to church. A proper Lolita shoe should feature a closed, rounded toe as well as chunky, thick heels or platforms. A lower heeled tea party type shoe is also popular.


Boots are common too in some goth or punk lolita styles. Another good type of shoe is the Vivienne Westwood Rocking-horse Shoe, which features a mary-jane style top with a large chunk of wood at the bottom to add height and often features a curved front and a part cut-out of the back.

, A good Lolita look can be even better with the right accessories. Depending on what specific look you want to try to build up, you can augment it with some side-items that will make it really pop. Use any of the following, and learn more about crafting specific looks in the next section:


Parasols
Canes or walking sticks
Old-style pocket watches
Clutches or handbags

, A Gothic Lolita outfit is the most popular one out of all the Lolita styles. It's pretty modest, characterized by a bell-shaped skirt and puffy sleeves, and a dramatic mysterious make-up and hair style. Dark Lolita outfits can usually be black or any nice rich dark colors such as purple, dark red and navy.


'Guro' Lolitas try to portray a ""broken doll"" sort of look, gruesome yet innocent. White clothes with blood splats is the best choice. How gory is always up to you, and can range from anything to some bandages, a sling, or some blood splatters on your clothing. Just be sure to use materials that will not rub off onto your surroundings.
Punk Lolitas wear deconstructed fabrics, fishnets, chains and studs. Layering is the key to this style, and adorning your basic knee-length skirts with other basic punk accessories. Pink hair and studded belts? You got it.

Guro and Punk styles have waned in popularity and it may be difficult finding items for those looks.



, Sometimes called ""Sweet"" Lolita, this look is like the good queen to the goth's dark queen. It's filled with many bows, hair clips, and ruffles. This outfit is usually pastel colors can include pink, creamy white, and powder blue, and light lavender but an outfit can be any pastel or plaid or any color at all as long as it is not neon. Hair is typically curly and bouncy.


Give it a ""country"" touch with straw baskets, hats, fruit, and gingham patterns. Most Lolita outfits require a blouse under a jumper skirt to pull of the Lolita look, but it can get away with-out a blouse.
Some ""Princess"" aka ""Hime"" Lolitas accent their look with miniature crowns, tiaras, and extravagant or large hair, and dresses.
This look should involve lots of white, or a single notable color-scheme. Sometimes Shiro and Kuro lolitas match black and white twin-style apparel to go out as a team. Light and dark is a common play in the Lolita world.






""Wa Lolita"" introduces traditional Japanese clothing into the look, using kimonos, long 'sode' or, sleeves, and 'obi' or sashes that are taken from Kimono outfits. The patterns and accessories are usually covered in detailed Japanese flowers and prints. (Note: this is a very difficult to pull off style without it looking costumey. Its generally not a popular look)
""Aristocratic Lolitas"" incorporate western romantic styles into the genre. In general, there are no cutesy prints, lace, over-the-top frills, or bows. Skirts are often worn long, and corsets may be used and high corseted waists on skirts is common. Fitted jackets with tail coats are popular, so are frilly shirts, top hats, and veils.

, While Lolita is often thought to be pretty ""girly,"" some looks incorporate masculine styles and ""boy clothes"" into the look. It can be a cool way to shake up people's expectations and play around with your style.


Some Lolitas do a sailor or nautical theme. Sailor collars, dark blues, and whites is what makes this style. Nautical symbols such as ship anchors and wheels make very cute additions. Like most Lolita styles the same bell-shaped skirt is expected, quite often this skirt may be pleated, and the outfit may often include a puffed-short-sleeved blouse with pockets.
Kodona or ""boy style"" is another common sub-genre of Lolita fashion. This has feminine touches, such as feminine shoes and accessories with short capri-style pants that cut off at the knee and usually have details on them such as lace-edged cuffs or ruffles.
Other common additions to butch-up your look are suspenders, ties, bowler caps and long socks. The more extravagant styles can include things like spats, canes, top hats, and other Victorian accessories.

, Most Lolitas don't use a particularly elaborate make-up routine, but generally a pale foundation look is paired with dramatic highlights in terms of eye-shadow and lipstick, used to create that Victorian look.Darker goth-style looks should be made up accordingly, with dark purples, or deep red lips and very dark eye shadow. Sweet Lolita looks should focus on skin tones and lightening up the cheeks to create a rosy look.
Make-up isn't always necessary for a Lolita look. If you don't want to wear make-up, it's fine to leave it off and let your clothes do the work of the style.

, Depending on your particular interest in creating a goth look, a different hairstyle will be appropriate for each. In general, sweet Lolitas need to have bouncy curls, while darker or goth Lolitas will want to have dark, straight hair with bangs.


Cute styles often have colorful highlights, as well. Pink streaks and super teased-out styles are very indicative of Lolitas.
Darker styles will sometimes have deep purple highlights, or other types of color thrown in. But a bleach-blonde look could be just as goth as dark hair. Experiment some to see what you like, and try to stand out from the pack.

, It would be tough to dress up like a Lolita every day, but if you want to really ""be"" a Lolita and not just costume-up for a cosplay or Anime convention, you can learn to integrate more basic elements into your look for a day-to-day Lolita style. There are various toned-down versions of the basic Lolita style, while still retaining the basic elements of the look.


Find a simple skirt and simple hair accessory to pair with regular t-shirts and shoes. Taking the time to throw a single little ""girly"" element into your look will help to make it more pronounced. Mostly, you'll want to avoid long pants.
Take the time to do your hair and make-up up, as if you were dressed in your most elegant finery. Even if you're just rocking a t-shirt, your Lolita spirit will still be on display.

, There are a variety of ""Bibles"" for Lolitas, first published in Japan in the early 2000s, which have more recently been translated into a variety of languages, English included. Featuring photographs, style descriptions, and a variety of lifestyle guides, these books are common and popular among Lolitas and those interested in the style.

, Lolita meet-ups are common in some areas, which often cater to ""Lifestyle Lolitas,"" who are interested in incorporating more traditional home-making skills into their lives, as well as a more traditional or Victorian style.


Likewise, Anime conventions and cosplay conventions are often places to meet fellow Lolitas. To some, though, this is more of a ""costume"" to be distinguished from a ""real"" Lolita. Still, it can be a good place to get some fashion tips and meet some new and interesting Lolitas.

, In addition to being a fashion, some people enjoy living a ""Lolita Lifestyle"" in which one sees Lolita as more of a philosophy of living beautifully and elegantly. For some, traditional home-making skills like baking, embroidery, and sewing are embraced as part of the elegance of the style. While it's not necessary if you're just looking for a new clothes style, these are ways to embrace the Lolita lifestyle. Check out the following articles for some traditional homemaking skills:

, The term ""Lolita"" comes from Vladimir Nabokov's novel of the name, which is about a relationship between an adult male and a young girl, named Lolita. The term is sometimes used to refer to a sexually attractive young girl, but the fashion seeks to distinguish itself from this interpretation.For most Lolitas, the look is emphatically not about being ""sexy"" or appealing to men's ideas of what a woman should look like. it's about reclaiming a traditional version of elegance and femininity. Lolita fashion should be empowering.

Look at some Visual Kei themed magazines or websites to get inspiration for your own take on the style.,
Wear eyeliner -- it can be very important to pull of the Visual Kei style, but it's not mandatory.,
Make your bangs long (below eyebrow) and try to cut it unnaturally straight.,
Wear proper attire.,
There are many subsets of Visual Kei fashion.",How to Be a Japanese or Visual Kei Style Goth Girl," Some good magazines to buy are Shoxx, Cure, Kera, or the Gothic-Lolita Bible. You can find many of these in places such as Barnes & Noble, Hot Topic, Walden Books, etc. Cure features a special ""Style Council"" section with step-by-step makeup/hair tutorials.;
, Eyeliner is usually worn heavily on the top lid, and it stops halfway along the bottom lid.

, You can also have your bangs choppily cut, or pointed in the middle. Dying your hair different colors is definitely encouraged. Waka from Danger Gang is a good reference because she has a varied style and her look is worth trying to emulate.

, The typical American ""goth"" styles will not do if you're really serious about this. Try to mix punk and goth fashion into one. Visual Kei is a very ""crowded"" and ""full"" style, so all kinds of fashions are incorporated. Visual Kei style usually has a variety of color. So wear colors!

Avoid cheap, synthetic, and overdone lace.,
Avoid looking sloppy or awkward.,
Avoid cheap dresses.,
Be careful where you buy Lolita clothing.,
Be modest.,
Avoid looking Ita Lolita.",How to Avoid Lolita Dressing Mistakes," It makes you like a doily, not a Lolita. Wearing too much lace is often considered being a 'lace monster'. Lace should not be synthetic, scratchy, or uncomfortable to wear. If it is, it is not good quality.


Avoid dresses that have way too much lace. The lace will overwhelm the whole look and spoil it. Do not wear a lace dress paired with another print or lace item.
Avoid synthetic lace. It is not pretty, and is very obvious. Even if it doesn't seem that way to you, it will to others.
Have the lace in proportion with the dress. Smaller, petite lace is always the best option for the over-the-top Lolita fashion. This would create more overall balance to the look.
Avoid wearing dresses or skirts that contain ruffled lace on ruffled fabric.
Include corset lacing if you are wearing socks with lace. Make sure that the lace matches.;
,


Check for neatly trimmed and arranged corset lacing. Sloppiness here will undo the whole look.
Be careful with collars. High collars don't look good a lot of the time and should be treated with care.
Graduate the color so as not to have an undefined look.

, Just as with the lace, you won't be doing yourself any favors by purchasing a cheap dress. Look for quality from the fabric to the adornments of lace, lacing, and ribbons.

Avoid buying fabrics such as crushed velvet, satin, or synthetic fabrics.
Instead, use cotton, organza, chiffon, and other natural fabrics.






Be careful with colors and patterns. Combine them appropriately.
Avoid using too many conflicting colors, patterns, or prints together. Too much can make the entire outfit look too busy and displeasing to see. A tartan Punk Lolita Dress may not look good with horizontally striped socks, checkered shoes, and a polka dot purse.

, If you buy it from an online auction, the quality may be poor unless the seller has an excellent, renowned reputation for Lolita dresses.

Never buy a dress that looks too shiny in the pictures or is designed to be a cosplay outfit. Read the descriptions of the product carefully to avoid being cheated.
Always read reviews that are both good and bad from multiple buyers.
Make sure that the picture is the seller's' own. If it has the logo or name of another seller, is missing a section, or missing a watermark, it was most likely stolen from another place. If the pictures look as if they were recolored or pasted onto another background, then the seller may be tricking you as well.
Make sure that your dress is made of the proper materials. Too-thin cotton, shiny satin fabric, excessive satin ribbon, excessive bad quality lace, and costume-like fabric are not quality Lolita dresses.
Never buy any outfit from a costume or Halloween store.

, Wear proper undergarments and don't show much skin. If the neckline is low, wear something underneath such as a blouse or a cutsew. If a skirt is too short, make sure that you wear bloomers and tights. However, avoid sheer tights or fishnets, which can be too ""sexy"" for some Lolita styles. In some styles, shorter skirts and sheer tights are fine, such as in Punk or Ero Lolita. Still, you should generally you need to be careful to avoid skirts that are more than two inches above the knee.

, This look is also called ""Cosplay Lolita"" and refers to improper attempts to look like the Lolita style. It may take lovable items of Lolita such as bows, aforementioned lace, and frills and push them to the extreme, removing the classy image of the fashion. It may include misconceptions of the Lolita fashion style as well.


Don't wear leg warmers or ankle socks, and generally stay away from striped socks, unless you are doing a style such as Sailor or Punk Lolita. Lace is Lolita, and so are gloves, but lace gloves are not Lolita.
Stripper-esque stiletto heels, sneakers, and stompy goth boots are definitely no-nos.
Don't use bad quality costume wigs, or the stereotypical ""goth"" makeup of white foundation, heavy eyeliner, thick, dark eye shadow, and black lipstick.
Never wear cosplay outfits as Lolita. Chii's outfits, or Utauloid outfits may look like Lolita, but cosplay and Lolita are very different.
Never wear animal ears, tails, or maid-like dresses.

, For one example, ""Lolita"" has been a nickname for ""Dolores"" in Spanish for centuries. For another example, the Gothic Lolita style is not as famous in the English-speaking world as the novel Lolita (narrated by the main character, a middle-aged man who married a middle-aged woman in order to seduce and rape her 12-year-old daughter Lolita while claiming he's in love) by Nabokov is. In fact, this is where some Japanese speakers got the idea of a ""Lolita complex"" (abbreviated as ""lolicon,"" now a word in Japanese) from. If you're a girl calling yourself a Lolita (or a woman calling yourself a bitch, or a gay guy calling yourself a queer), that's one thing if you're aware of the negative connotations and determined to take back the term...and that's another, stupider, thing if you're oblivious to the negative connotations of ""Lolita"" (or ""bitch"" or ""queer"").

, Learn about the Gothic literature of the 1800s, the Gothic architecture of late medieval Europe, the Gothic tribes neighboring the Roman Empire, etc.

, These provide an excellent source of information. If you can't get your hands on one, try researching Gothic Lolita on the internet. Many sites will take you through the style and history of Gothic Lolita, as well as the entire Lolita fashion.

, Do you want to be a Gothic Lolita because your friends think it's cool? Because it's the ""in thing"" at your school right now? To adapt to the lifestyle of any type of subculture, you need to be doing it for the right reasons. You should be reading this article because you appreciate the style and culture of Gothic Lolita and want to be a part of it -- not because your peers are doing the same. If Gothic Lolita is not who you really are, it will show and you'll get labelled a poser.

, Chances are, your parents aren't ready to see you decked out in the full Gothic Lolita uniform, and neither are your friends. This is okay, as it gives you time to explore your clothing style and tastes. Firstly, try to imitate the Gothic Lolita style, but using ordinary clothes. This can be done by wearing the following:


Little girl blouses- your parents shouldn't object to these, as they are decent and rather like school uniform shirts. Try to get these in pastel, lighter colours to begin with. Later, move on to more complex blouses, like ones with peter pan collars and cap sleeves.
Knee length skirts. Your parents also are not likely to object to these. Try to get fuller, ""poofier"" skirts that sit on your actual waist. The colours can be pastel and light to start with, so as not to get too drastic. If you're looking for patterns, try delicate prints and embroidery.
Long socks. These are usually in white or black, just above or sitting on the knee. You can also try stockings. Wear these with the skirts and blouses.
Ballet flats. These can be considered Lolita when purchased in the right style and colour- again, light, pastel colours, perhaps with little ribbons. You can also try Mary Jane shoes.
Simple hair accessories. These include ribbons, plain alice bands, or alice bows.

, This may not be difficult at all, because this style works on some hair types and does not raise any eyebrows. Straight hair is easy to maintain if you have it. You could also try ""properly"" curled ringlets. Medium or long length hair is supposedly perfect. If you are allowed to, try dyeing your hair a dark or wild colour, such as black, dark brown, or auburn red. If you can't dye your hair then don't panic- just leave it as it is. Some good hairstyles are to just leave your hair loose with a headband or bow, or pigtails with ribbons. Bangs are also supposedly perfect. Take good care of your hair and keep it clean and healthy.

, Gothic Lolitas do not wear a face full of makeup- in fact, the bare look is considered quite beautiful by some people. Look after your skin- wash and moisturise daily, and don't sleep with makeup on. If you have fair or pale skin, this is supposedly perfect. If you have darker skin, don't worry. You could try using a powder that is just a shade lighter than your skin colour in order to make yourself look closer to the same race as Japanese Gothic Lolita teens, or better yet simply leave it. If your eyes need enhancing, use a little eyeliner and mascara. Lip gloss is good, clear or pink. If you want to wear lipstick, try natural colours such as bronze or dark brown.

, When you think your family and friends have adjusted to the style, you can start hunting down the actual Gothic Lolita clothes. Firstly, you need to get your hands on the essentials. These include:


Money to buy the clothes, or to buy material to sew the clothes.
A couple of white or black blouses. Make sure that these have a peter pan collar. The sleeves should either be blouse sleeved or cap sleeved.
A petticoat. Make sure the petticoat is a good shape- usually a bell shaped or A-lined.
A couple of full skirts. Be sure to purchase knee-length skirts, that are full enough to fit your petticoat underneath. The skirts should sit on your waist, not above or below, or the shape will become odd.

Boots. If you've eased enough into Mary Janes and ballet flats, try boots with wedge heels. Make sure they aren't fetish shoes though, as this will either ruin the style or appeal too much to guys with Lolita fetishes (depending on which fetish the fetish shoes are for). Or you can simply to stick to the shoes you had before.

, Try to keep your image sweet, doll-like, and elegant. This means no revealing clothing, no heavy makeup, no baggy clothing apart from the skirts, and no messy hairdos. Make sure you're well groomed all the time- from keeping your nails pretty to making sure your hair is clean.

Wear a frilly blouse.,
Try on a bell-shaped skirt.,
Look for a jumper style skirt.,
Try on frilly single-piece dresses.,
Cautiously consider petticoats and bloomers.,
Go with muted colors and floral patterns if you’re trying for a ""Classic Lolita"" look.,
Stick with black for a ""Gothic Lolita"" look.,
Go for pink, white, or baby blue if you’re aiming for a “Sweet Lolita” look.",How to Add a Simple Touch of Lolita to Your Everyday Outfit1," Most Lolita styles include a blouse with puffy sleeves and ruffles. The sleeves can be long or short, but for a traditional approach, they should cover the shoulder. The most traditional blouses also have a button front and rounded collars.;
, The ideal silhouette for the Lolita look is the bell, though some voluminous A-line skirts may also work. It should fall no shorter than two inches above the knee. Look for skirts that are decorated with frills, lace, ribbons, or bows.

, A jumper skirt has a full skirt at the bottom and a top portion that comes over a separate blouse worn underneath. The upper portion should have a low enough neckline to reveal the blouse beneath it, and the skirt should flare out in a bell or full A-line shape.

, If coordinating blouses and skirts seems like too much hassle, or if you're committed to something with a little more Lolita flair, consider wearing a frilly dress. The skirt portion should still retain a bell shape, and the top should still cover your arms with poofy sleeves and ruffles.

, While these pieces are necessary to create a full bell shape in your skirt or dress, they may take your style over the top. Instead of adding a “simple touch” of Lolita to your clothing, petticoats and bloomers add a very noticeable touch. If you opt for these pieces, consider toning down your accessories and staying away from ruffles and lace on your outer clothes.

, Classic Lolita is the tamest and easiest to wear for everyday purposes. Many skirts in this branch of Lolita fashion stick with a classic A-line skirt, rather than the extensive bell skirt. Consider a fancy garden party dress with a rose print or other pastel floral design.

, Gothic Lolita mixes the darkness of Gothic fashion with the frilliness of Lolita fashion. Look for frilly pieces that are all black or a mix of black and white. Alternatively, you can also look at other dark colors like burgundy, deep purple, and navy.

, Sweet Lolita is the most doll-like and extravagant in nature, and it may be difficult to incorporate small amounts of the style into your everyday outfit. If you want to try, however, gravitate toward light colors with white accents. Pink and baby blue are especially common. Also look for pieces with subtle heart designs, cherries, candies, or fairy tale themes.

Mix and (mis)match different fashions.",How to Dress Harajuku Style1," What is now known as Harajuku (like Halloween in Japan every Sunday) style started as teens in the district began to integrate traditional Japanese attire, especially kimonos and geta sandals, into their wardrobe. Before, they wore primarily clothes that were influenced by the West, but by mixing the traditional with the modern, they created a new style. Other examples of mixing and matching including the punk look with the schoolgirl uniform or a goth look with designer clothes. In Harajuku, mixing different styles and mismatching colors and patterns is encouraged - you can do anything you want, as long as your outfit is a thoughtful expression of your individuality (see Tips).

Wear Mary-Jane shoes with knee-high socks.,
Look for a frilly, rectangular headdress.,
Opt for an Alice bow.,
Try smaller bows for a less overwhelming look.,
Consider a hair corsage.,
Wear a maid-style apron.,
Stick with pearls and ribbons.,
Keep your make-up fair and youthful.",How to Add a Simple Touch of Lolita to Your Everyday Outfit2," Mary-Jane shoes are the quintessential Lolita footwear. The shoes can be flat for a simple touch, or you can opt for high platform Mary-Janes if you want a more authentic and bolder style choice. Stick with black or white shoes for the most versatility, and pair the shoes with white knee-high or over-the-knee socks. Avoid sheer tights or ankle socks.

, The headdress should arch over your head like a headband. You can even opt for a headband, but look for a fabric band with lace or ruffles to mimic the Lolita style.

, An Alice bow refers to a large bow that sits at the center top of your head, based on the look of the titular character in Alice in Wonderland. You can also vary this style by wearing a large hair bow tilted off to the side, which may help the style blend more easily into your everyday attire.

, Small hair bows also call to mind Lolita fashion. Wear your hair in high pigtails and tie them up with fancy bows. Alternatively, look for a small, lacy hair bow to pin on the side of your head, regardless of your hairstyle.

, A hair corsage is a fancy flower arrangement you pin or weave into your hair. The flowers are usually made of cloth, and one or more cloth flowers can be used. Choose a more ladylike flower, like a rose, over a girlish flower, like a daisy.

, Find a decorative apron with frills, ribbon, bows, or lace. You can select a half-apron that only covers your skirt, or a full apron that also comes up over your torso. It should be decorative, however, and reminiscent of a stereotypical “French maid” apron, so ordinary kitchen aprons may not work.

, Pearls have an old-fashioned, classic aura to them, and ribbons call to mind a sense of demure femininity. If you wear jewelry, look for large pearl or mock pearl pieces held together by glossy satin ribbons. Make it stand out even more by choosing ribbons with a lace edging.

,


Brush a pale foundation over your face.
Dust your cheeks with a light pink blush.
Make your lashes stand out with a light coating of mascara.
Add a light pink lip gloss to your lips to complete the look.
Alternatively, skip the blush and outline your eyes in black eyeliner to create a Gothic Lolita look. Instead of pink gloss, opt for red lipstick, instead.

Become familiar with variations of fashion in the Harajuku district.",How to Dress Harajuku Style2," It's impossible to pinpoint one ""Harajuku style."" Many styles have originated or developed on the streets of Harajuku, and many Harajuku girls (and boys) integrate one or more of these somewhat more defined styles into their outfits.










Gothic Lolita involves wearing gothic, feminine and elegant clothes, to the extent that you look like a living Victorian doll.
Sweet Lolita is heavily influenced by the Rococo era more so than any of the other subcultures of Lolita. It focuses much more too on the child like aspects and uses light colours and child like fantasy themes. Alice in Wonderland, fruits, sweets and classic fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood are recurrent themes in Sweet Lolita.
Japanese punks, inspired by the punk movement that began in London in the 70s, magnify rebelliousness with over-the-top clothes, accessories, makeup, and piercings.

Cosplay entails dressing up like your favorite cartoon/anime or computer game character.
Decora style favors bright colors, flamboyance and accessories from head to toe. You decorate yourself with plastic toys and jewelry, and it's not uncommon to have so many that you can hear them click together when the person moves.

Kawaii (literally translating from Japanese to ""cute"") places an emphasis on childlike playfulness--anime characters, ruffles, pastel colors, toys, and so on.
Wamono refers to mixing traditional Japanese attire with Western fashion.

Dress in layers.,
Customize your clothes.,
Accessorize.,
Go wild with your hair and makeup.,
Wear whatever looks good to you.",How to Dress Harajuku Style3," One of the hallmarks of Harajuku is layering. Sweaters, vests, or jackets over blouses over t-shirts, dresses worn with leggings, and so on. Layering clothes (or giving the appearance of layering by wearing ruffled dresses, for example) allows you to mix and match a wider variety of different styles, and adds more dimension to your outfit.








, Secondhand clothing and do-it-yourself styles are popular ingredients in a Harajuku outfit. Like that flowered skirt but think it would look cuter with a ribbon pinned on it or with a more uneven, angular hemline? Get out the scissors and glue and make your store-bought clothes uniquely yours. Or, go even further and make your own skirt. Cutting the fabric to create bold angles and lines can make even a plain black dress appear remarkable and fun.








, Add any wild accessories you have, such as belts, earrings, hair clips, jewelry, and handbags. Remember, accessories can be colorful and loud, and they don't have to match your clothes. Speaking of loud, in decora, a particular Harajuku style, accessories embellish an outfit from head to toe, and objects such as bells are sometimes used to add an aural dimension to the wardrobe.








, The Harajuku style doesn't have to stop with your clothes. Pigtails and other ""cute"" hairstyles are particularly popular, as is dying your hair. Creative, even theatrical makeup can be a fun addition.








, It's been said that the Harajuku style is not really a protest against mainstream fashion and commercialism (as punk was), but rather a way of dressing in whatever looks good to you. If you think mismatched rainbow and polka-dot leggings look good with a plaid dress, go for it!

Throw away your prejudices.,
Explore Lolita types.",How to Be a Gothic Lolita1," Lolita style has nothing to do with pedophilia. The fashion and the lifestyle do not contain sexual connotations. Instead, most adherents present themselves as young Victorian, Edwardian, or Rococo children and strive to look modest and reserved. Gothic Lolita, or GothLoli, style in particular values a sober and elegant presentation.

, There are many different styles of Lolita. There's Sweet Lolita, which uses bright pastels, lace, and overall sweet and ""kawaii"" themes; Gothic Lolita, which uses more blacks and whites and tends to be a darker, more elegant style of Lolita; and other less common subsets such as Classic Lolita, which favors a more refined and subtle fashion, or Punk Lolita, which might include accessories such as spikes and chains. Some Lolitas like to blend more than one style in their looks; however, this article will focus primarily on achieving straightforward Gothic Lolita dress and attitude.

Know how to build a Lolita outfit.,
Build your wardrobe.,
Wear naturally appealing makeup.,
Dress to impress.,
Incorporate Lolita into your everyday clothing and environment.",How to Be a Gothic Lolita2," A Gothic Lolita look has many parts you can vary or alter as you like, but there are a few basic rules. One of them is that Gothic Lolitas favor dark colors, with the exception of white or cream accents - you probably won't find one wearing pink or other bright colors prominently. Here's what else you need to know, arranged in the order in which you'd get dressed.


Start with undergarments. The most identifiable part of a Lolita look is the bell-shaped skirt that falls two inches above the kneecap or lower. Buying a petticoat, or pannier, built specifically to fill out Lolita skirts is essential. In order to maintain modesty in case the petticoat blows up in the breeze, Lolitas wear bloomers underneath the petticoat and over their regular underwear. Gothic Lolitas can also wear a corset, provided it's laced or buttoned properly. (Wearing a corset or bustier alone as a top falls into the Ero Lolita category.) Bloomers and petticoats should never be readily visible in the finished look.






Wear a refined, well-made blouse. Gothic Lolita blouses often feature fine tailoring, such as pintucks, embroidered details, and embellished cuffs or necklines. A slim, close fit is ideal; the blouse should never be baggy or saggy.






Put on an embellished skirt, JSK, or one-piece dress. Gothic Lolita skirts commonly include ruffles, elegant patterns or bustles. They should sit at the natural waist and no lower, as well as almost covering your knees when standing. A JSK, or jumper skirt, is one you ""jump"" into, applied from the feet up. It usually includes some part that will cover part of the blouse. A black JSK over a white blouse is a typical Gothic Lolita look. For fancy events, Gothic Lolitas will sometimes wear one-piece dresses without a blouse. These garments are designed to fit closely through the torso and flare appropriately to accommodate the petticoat.






Wear modest stockings or tights. Some Lolitas wear socks or tights that hit below the kneecap, but Gothic Lolitas tend to prefer those that go over the knee. Wear garters under your bloomers to hold them up, if necessary. In general, Gothic Lolitas eschew sheer nylon or tights, favoring an opaque look instead.






Choose dark shoes. Lolita style overall usually demands Mary Jane shoes, with perhaps a ""Lolita heel"" at the back. For Gothic Lolita, your shoes should be black or otherwise dark. If you choose to wear boots or another embellishment on Mary Janes, make sure they keep to a slim, natural leg silhouette - chunky combat boots would be out of place on a Gothic Lolita.






Use hair accessories. An iconic Gothic Lolita accessory is a dark, large Alice bow, modeled after that of the heroine of Alice in Wonderland. You can also wear embellished headbands, combs or clips, as well as fascinators, period-appropriate hats or tiny top hats.






Find a jacket. During colder months, Gothic Lolitas bundle up in well-tailored jackets. Choose black or another dark color, such as burgundy, navy, dark purple or hunter green.






Finish up with other accessories. Some Gothic Lolitas carry parasols to shield themselves from the sun; others wear jewelry focused on elaborate crosses or carry purses in the shape of a coffin. Be creative with your accessories to make the Gothic Lolita look uniquely yours.





;
, A well-made Gothic Lolita piece can last you a long time, but it will probably also be more expensive than your casual clothing. Invest in your wardrobe carefully, purchasing items you adore and that are constructed from quality materials. Start with bloomers and a petticoat, and build from there.


Pay attention to fabrics. Gothic Lolita culture favors cotton, wool, organdy, lace and other generally high-quality textiles. Satin and crushed velvet are regarded as costume-like, and frowned on for everyday use. Additionally, cheap lace that features heavy netting is also disdained, as it can look gray and ratty from a distance.







, One point at which Gothic Lolita culture diverges from American Gothic culture is makeup - Gothic Lolitas don't use whiteface or particularly dark eye and lip colors. A slightly smoky eye or red lip is acceptable, but generally Gothic Lolitas strive to wear natural-looking makeup.

, Wearing a Gothic Lolita look should be an event. Make sure everything is cleaned and ironed appropriately, and put effort into your hair and makeup - looking half-done while wearing such beautiful clothing would be tragic. Plan ahead.

, If you can't wear full Lolita outfits everyday incorporate details that you like and go with your usual clothing: maybe that lace choker will go well with your business suit, or that cute purse is nice for a trip to the mall. Things like that that make you unique and identify you as a Lolita, even if you can't wear your outfits everyday.

Practice good posture.,
Mind your manners.,
Indulge in antiquated hobbies.,
Look for sources of beauty or inspiration in everyday life.",How to Be a Gothic Lolita3," Gothic Lolita clothing is shown off to the best advantage when your posture is erect, with straight shoulders and a high head. Try walking in light, measured steps instead of shuffling or dragging your feet.

, Because Lolita style harkens back to the 19th century, try emulating the socially acceptable manners of the time period. Speak politely and crisply, without relying on contractions or slang. Do not use swear words as well. Be courteous to everyone, and acknowledge strangers or new acquaintances with a slight tip of your head or a small smile. Be confident without being rude, and courteous without being a doormat.

, Bring some old-fashioned beauty into your life by learning Victorian arts or skills, such as sewing and/or embroidering (it will help you with your clothing if you are on a budget or don't want to buy off Japan), cooking, calligraphy, painting or sketching, and collecting things like antiques or stamps.

, A Lolita lifestyle is, to a certain extent, about maintaining a childlike sense of innocence and wonder. Try seeing your life through fresh, less-jaded eyes and watch your attitude improve!

Know what you're expected to be.,
When you're at a club, or a party, or at a show, the scene girls are the ones who look stunning and are bold, over-confident, and at times random.

,
However, if you're not comfortable with standing out, you could aim to be the cute, shy scene girl.

",How to Be a Scene Girl1," Most ""scene"" girls don't call themselves scene. They're just bubbly, and have the style. They're very outgoing and have big hair most of the time.;
,,"
"
Dress like a scene girl.,
Wear flats like ballet shoes and even metallic/designer flats.,
Skinny jeans.,
Tight fitting, graphic tees are a must.,
Wear merchandise from Hello Kitty, Gloomy Bear, Care Bears, Elmo, etc.,
Wear bright random T-shirts with funky designs on them.,
Cartoon characters are very popular.,
Get a gray hoodie, and wear it all the time with your hood up.

,
Pyramid stud belts, and classic white belts are good.

,
Huge sunglasses are a must, and the bigger the better.,
Over-sized pearl necklaces or other long necklaces are a must.,
Remember all those kiddie bracelets that you had when you were five?",How to Be a Scene Girl2," Clothes are very important, and you must dress the part in order to be successful in this venture.

, Tutu-like skirts are a must. Slip-on Vans are very popular among scene kids, as well as most other Vans. (Warning: wearing Vans too much if you aren't a skater could result in you being called a poser.) You could also try some checkered or colorful shoelaces.

, Dark ones such as black and torn are good, but things like bright neon colors, leopard, zebra or checkered are good too.

, You have to have at least 3 of these. Anything with cute monsters, fun sayings or just cool stuff works. Don't buy just black. Scene is a mix of black and neon colors. Wear any pattern you want. Animal print, checkers, plaid, stripes - anything that describes your personality.

, Brand tees are a must. Colorful skinny jeans, tutus, jean skirts, and Vans and Converse are awesome. Wear cool leggings with bold colors or stripes. Leg warmers too.

, Or you could go with the plain bold colour like red. Some very scene designs are: Alice in Wonderland, stars, hearts, lightning, skulls, bats, Anything to do with bands or childish stuff like ice cream and lollipops.

, Pokémon, Power Rangers, Keroppi, and especially Hello Kitty are all big parts of scene style. Printed T-shirts with cartoon characters or cute pictures on them are a must.

,,, The newest edition to the scene girls sunnies are the old fashioned ""cop"" style sunnies (Ray-Ban Aviators). Horn-rimmed glasses with no lenses are super-popular in the scene world, and they look super cute too.

, There are a number of ways you can wear them that will make you look like a mature young person.

, It's time to dig them out from under your bed. Don't wear too may though - you want people to see your arms.

"
"
Get piercings if you like.,
Septum, Monroe, Snakebites, Spiderbites, Angelbites and Browbreakers are acceptable piercings; since your ears will probably be hidden under your voluminous hair you can either wear big earrings or none at all.",How to Be a Scene Girl3," They are automatically considered scene. So go for it as piercings are very popular among the scene kids.

, You can try pearl earrings for a dash of preppy style. Gauges are also popular among scene girls.

"
"
Wear bright eye makeup.",How to Be a Scene Girl4," Pink, purple, blue, green, and red would do just fine. Remember to use black/silver/blue eyeliner. The makeup can be plain black eyeliner depending on how scene you would like to be. Do not go to overboard with your black cause you could come off as an emo. Just some eyeliner maybe a little thicker then usual is accepted. It is also scene to add a little design to your makeup, such as wings. There are loads of different colours of eyeshadow you could use, but black or bright neon are very scene. Although you can also go for the clean, pretty scene girl look with just lots of mascara and some pretty eyeshadow.

"
"
Get a new hairstyle, but keep it classy.,
Short, choppy layers are very scene.

,
The scene mullet is popular, and is seen sported primarily by Asian scene girls.

,
A hairstyle that is quickly becoming popular with scene kids is straight hair with bangs.,
Try using a straightener.,
Another classic scene style that will not turn heads as fast, and therefore is more acceptable to sport around your parents and other non-scene people, is tying the back of your hair in a ponytail and allowing chunks of hair to fall down where your sideburns would be.

,
Slightly long hair with ultra layers and choppiness right at the ear, below the ear slightly, or above the ear is considered extreme scene.

,
If you want, you could clip in hair bows with bright colors, headbands with skulls or bows, or skull hair clips.

,
Color your hair.,
Even brunettes can be scene without dying their hair any more than blond highlights.",How to Be a Scene Girl5," The most important thing you should do with your hair is part it to the side, with bangs sweeping in front of your face instead. Little girl clips and dying your hair multiple colors are the classic style, but new styles are emerging, such as brunette Scene hair which I think is amazing! Also,you don't have to have long hair to be scene just tease the top of your hair and put your bangs to the side.

,,, It is very simple to do if you want something not too extreme. You want long straight hair, of any color, and bangs that go straight across your forehead hanging in front of your eyes some.

, They sell for very cheap at most stores. Straighten your hair so it doesn't have any waves, and then make it look like it's layered. Your bangs can either be off to the side, of hanging down straight over your eyes.

,,,, Dye it black or platinum blond. Or you can do an unusual or rare color like red. If you go completely black be careful, because you could come off as an emo. So if you go black put some neon colored chunks in it. Any other dark color will do (maroon, purple, or red). You can also have dark chocolate brown hair (it works just as well).

, Extreme colors have gradually become more popular so don't be afraid to try a risky move.

"
"
Get the hair.,
Get the makeup.,
Go for bright, flashy clothes.,
Rock the accessories.,
Get your clothes at stores with bright colored clothes and flashy stuff.",How to Be a Scene Kid1," Scene hair can either be short or long, but often the longer hair has a bit of volume to it. Scene hair has to resist being bland. It's one of the most important aspects of your appearance.


Dye it and/or put some color into it. Dye your hair black or blonde, or maybe both: blonde streaks inside a sea of black. Add flourishes of pink or purple to round out the look.
Tease and/or straighten it. Tease it (especially in the back) to add a lot of volume to your coiffure. Straightened hair is a must for those with curly or wavy hair. The straighter the better.
Don't shy away from hair extensions if you feel you need them. Some scenesters think that hair extensions are a must.
Add a little flourish like a hair band, beret, or flower, especially if it has some color.;
, Scene makeup is characterized by bright, daring colors contrasting with the ever-present black or dark-blue eyeliner. Maybe you have glittery eyeshadow; maybe you darken the outline of your eyebrows. Whatever you do, don't forget the eyeliner!


Your makeup is your big opportunity to ""feminize"" your appearance. Because dressing scene won't distinguish you too much from guys, don't be afraid to go a bit overboard here. Dramatic, bold makeup is definitely what's called for.

, Striped clothing is definitely in style, as is plaid (although try not to get too boring). Don't abuse the thrift store racks (you're not a hipster), but don't shy away from used clothes. Some different options that you might consider wearing:


Striped black and pink top; a tight pink skirt with a blue bandana wrapped around your waist; ripped electric blue leggings; and pink flats (ballet shoes work well).
Purple leopard print top; white overall shorts with the strap(s) undone; black tights; and scuffy, white slip-on Vans.
Handmade silk-screened band tee; skin-tight purple (or black) skinny jeans; pyramid stud belt (although they are slowly becoming too popular); and huge sunglasses.

, The accessories really complete the scene look, so be sure not to forget them. Oversized is really part of the fashion. Accessories include:


Sunny-Gs. Your sunglasses will come in two sizes: big and really big. In fact, the bigger the better. Aviator glasses are acceptable.
Jewelry. Bracelets, necklaces, body art, and piercings are all the rage. Stick with jewelry that has an edgy, ironic, or cartoonish feel to it.
Hats. Hats look great on scene girls (although not so much for scene guys). Choose big hats that don't necessarily match with the rest of your outfit. Special props goes to hats that no one has yet.

, Try Rue 21, Banana Republic, Aeropostale and even others similar. Don't try Hot Topic unless you search for musical merch or find some bright clothes. Scene people wear bright colors and preppy clothes. They don't wear dark clothes and pocket chains.

Feel free to listen to just about whatever you want; after all, the scene culture was originally based off of music.",How to Be a Scene Girl6," To get you started, here are a few genres and bands that are commonly liked among scene kids:

It will show you some similar bands that you may not have heard of yet. You can explore the genres tabs, also on 'radio'. You can find all sorts of music that you might like.

"
"
Use scene lingo, and adopt certain words into your vocabulary such as ""hella"", ""rad"", ""stellar"", ""pimp"", ""hot"", ""dank,"", ""The sex"", etc.",How to Be a Scene Girl7," Hip-hop slang is also popular on the scene.

"
"
Become active on social-networking websites.,
Add as many people as you can on Myspace, but save your Facebook for people that you know personally.,
Try sitemodeling.,
Add a cute, simple background to your page (preferably something like Hello Kitty or a Victorian wallpaper), upload a few flattering pictures of yourself, make a playlist of some of your favorite music, and send friend requests to other scene kids.,
YouTube is also an important part of social networking.",How to Be a Scene Girl8," Start out with, of course, MySpace and/or Facebook.

, After that, try branching out to other sites that tend to be ""scene-popular"", such as Twitter, Stickam, thescenekidz.grouply.com, Buzznet, formspring.me, and Model Mayhem.

, This is where you can ""model"" for different ""agencies"" run by other people, and it can earn you some major scene points. You can often find these sites as profiles on Facebook and Myspace. After a while, you can even go elite and apply for the elite agencies.

, Having a catchy screenname, although totally optional, will also raise your scene-point quota.

, Have an account and maybe make some videos on ""How to Style Your Scene Hair,"" etc., because they are becoming increasingly popular in the scene world and will increase your scene image. If you become more popular on YouTube, you could even start a video blog about anything you like.

"
"
Be really nice to everyone you meet.,
People may confuse you to be Emo but that's okay just correct them.",How to Be a Scene Girl9," Scene girls often come off as rude teens. Most people would be pleasantly surprised if a scene kid came up to them and was super nice, because most people immediately think that Scene kids are going to be arrogant and full of themselves because of the stereotype.

, Be sure you are very peppy sweet and happy. Don't act like you hate everything. Hating everything is not very Scene-like.

"
"
Dress like you mean it.,
Have straight hair.,
Pull off the clothes effortlessly.,
Put on some sunglasses.,
Get a piercing or tattoo.,
Try on some ear gauges.

,
Get your clothes at stores with bright colored clothes and flashy stuff.",How to Be a Scene Kid2," Scene guys, let's face it, spend a lot of time perfecting the look. They care about fashion, and about their fashion making a statement. They don't want to look like your average Joe on the side of the street. Their unique dress is part of their overall mentality.

, Hair should always be pin straight, and possibly teased. You're lucky if you have straight hair! If it isn't straight, blow-dry it after showers and brush it. Make it dry after showers so curls are prevented. You could use a straightener, but many guys don't do it, so don't feel forced to do it.


Get the bangs. If it's one thing that epitomizes the scene look for boys, it's the shaggy, layered bangs. They are absolutely essential. Look around for inspiration.
Start off with natural hair colors, and dye around it. You probably want the base of your hair to be dark or blond or brown, so dye the whole mane a dark color and fill in highlights (maybe blonde, maybe platinum, maybe purple) around it.

, You're going to be dressing quite differently from how most guys dress, so you have to pull it off with confidence and verve. The clothes that you'll fit into your standard rotation include:


Tight jeans or slim-fit jeans. Wearing jeans is good, but they should be tight or even slim. If you can't fit into skinny jeans, just wear tights. Don't force yourself to fit into something to skinny.
Bright shirts, cartoon shirts and striped shirts. These are the staple of your tops. Brights and stripes really rule the day here. The occasional plaid isn't too bad.
Skater shoes like slip-on vans or chucks. Bright colors are a good idea. Chucks might be a little over-worn at this point, so think about getting some vans.

, Guys usually will get party shades, like what Brokencyde wear.

, Get some ink or piercings in visible places to let people know that you are hardcore and/or a deep person. Note that many scenesters choose to get henna tattoos or ""make"" their own using permanent marker; if you're unsure about getting a tattoo, remember that it's permanent and that you can't change your mind afterward.

,, Try Rue 21, Banana Republic, Aeropostale and even others similar. Don't try Hot Topic unless you search for musical merch or find some bright clothes. Scene people wear bright colors and preppy clothes. They don't wear dark clothes and pocket chains.

"
"
Type like you don't care.,
Create the perfect xX""SceneName""Xx.,
Become friends with everyone you know, and then some.,
Set a profile picture of ""yourself"".,
List as many bands as you can under ""music"" as you can.,
Go to a lot of ""shows."",
Update your status.,
Get the attitude.",How to Be a Scene Kid3," Add extra letters to the end of words. Typing like a scene kid has no grammar or spelling rules. Use unusual amounts of emoticons and <3's. Some example include: D= :3 ^_^ and c:


Some examples of how you might type:

""ZOMG dats HxC."" = ""Oh my god, that's hardcore.""

""Srsly, i don't caaaare if he liks me. hes got to shutup."" = ""Seriously, I don't care if he likes me. He has to shut up.""



, This point of your name is to convey that you are both scene and creative. Scene names do not follow any spelling or grammar rules that regular names do. This doesn't mean that they don't follow their own rules, guidelines and/or basic themes:


Play with a phrase. Take a fantasy story like Alice in Wonderland and change it so that people believe you are cultured and clever, like AllisonWonderland.
Make an alliteration. Think of an adjective you would like associated with you like brutal, homicidal or catastrophic, and add it to your name. If it's not an alliteration, force it by misspelling the adjective, like KatastrophicKatie.
Add some X's. It's just a xXfunXx way to look more scene. But always balance out the x's so that there is the same number of x's on both sides of your name.
Ignore grammar rules. Try adding incorrect punctuation!, avoiding spacingwordsproperly, and using upper and lowercase letters intErchAngEably.

, Social media profiles are judged by sheer volume of ""friends"" someone has. That means: If you met someone briefly, add them. If you went to middle school with them, add them. If you have a mutual friend, add them. If you like the same band, add them. If you have the same pose in your profile picture, add them. If you are from the state, add them. And so on.


Flirt with everyone you friended. If someone adds you, be sure to thank them for the add. Then be sure to mention that they are cute and that you are interested, whether it is through a comment on a picture, a wall post, or in a private message.

, The photo shouldn't actually be a picture of you, so much as a picture of part of you. Here are some typical picture tricks to get the perfect scene profile photo:


Cut yourself out of the photo. Don't feel the need to include your entire face or body. Just your eye and bangs, just your body or just your mouth is enough of a photo to help someone identify you.
Use a mirror. Extra scene points are giving for using your iPhone to take the picture. This lets everyone know that you: 1) Took the photo yourself, and 2) that you spent a lot of money on your camera or smart phone.
Rotate the camera/photo. A basic straight on shot isn't creative. Everyone takes pictures like that. Angle the camera, or move it so that people have to struggle to find your in your hair. It makes your profile picture so much more interesting.
Set the camera on a table and bend over/sit at your computer. Ever bored and have nothing to do at the computer? Take pictures. This is like the exact opposite of suggestion 2, so much so that it's ironic and creative that you didn't rotate the camera.
Don't look at the camera! Look down, look up, look to the left, look to the right, just don't look at the camera.

Hide behind your hair. Unlike other people, scene kids care about two parts of their bodies: their eyes and their hair. This should be the focal point of the picture. So don't distract people with your face.
Filter your pictures. Change your picture to black and white, faded-vintage, blurred or color tinted settings to achieve the scene look.
Write on your hand. Write a quote, your name, or a heart on your hand and hold it up for the camera. Everyone thinks this is cute.
Do a creative face. Smile, stick your tongue out, look like your contemplating, just be creative! Don't do a boring smile, everyone smiles in pictures!

, If you have even heard a song by that band, add them. It's important to showcase your wide taste in and vast knowledge of music. The more music you include, the more ""scene"" you will look.


Go for obscure, not-yet-popular music. Scene kids, like hipsters, adore the idea of having liked a band before they were cool. It means they're on the cutting edge, a trendsetter. If this means resurrecting a once-popular band that has since fallen into obscurity, that's ok too.

, Music shows are important to the scene culture. Go to as many as you can. If there is a concert within a 60 mile (97 km) radius, try to go. Update your status to let people know that you are really into music. Don't forget to take pictures to prove that you went. Pictures should be of the stage and mob pits. It's not important that you are actually in the pictures.

, Constantly update your status to tell people that you are bored, what's bothering you, that you feel like chatting, or that you are off to a show. People wouldn't have become friends with you if they didn't want constant updates on your life.

, The right scene attitude will do a lot to help you fit in and distinguish yourself as a true scenester. Because you dress the way that you do, expect to get a lot of grief from other people, especially older folks. Brush it off. A scene kid isn't interested in getting approval from random haters, much less from adults (although s/he isn't that rebellious). To master the attitude:


Be carefree. You are who you are and you know it. You're happy with yourself, so you wear your badges with confidence and style.
Don't be rude. Scenesters don't really have a chip on their shoulders like some hipsters do. Whether it's to someone's parents or a friend in your circle, you seek to be pleasant and easy-going, even if you're being teased.

"
"
Wear the clothes.,
Style your hair.,
Your accessories should include one facial piercing (preferably nose or Monroe), ear piercings, a belt, bracelets, a necklace, and makeup.",How to Be a Preppy Scene Kid (for Girls and Guys)1," Very tight jeans, sometimes with holes, are very scene. Flat shoes with bows or vans-one colored are basic shoes. Also maybe invest in some black Converse. Band tees, old TV show tees, hollister tees, striped shirts, or shirts with poetic words or animals on it; anything that looks fun or expresses your personal style. Jackets would probably be a tight black or gray sweatshirt with a hood. An example outfit would be dark wash skinny jeans, Converse, a graphic T, a graphic hoodie, and neon accessories.;
, Short choppy hair with many layers, multi-colored with bangs sweeping across one eye, mainly with red, blonde, or pink highlights. Keep it straight. You can also have long choppy layered hair with side bangs.

, Your facial piercings should be a simple silver or diamond stud. Your ear piercing should be neon studs, hoops, or dangles. Belts should be studded and in bright colors. Bracelets should be charm bracelets with assorted cartoon characters. Your necklace should be one cartoon character or a sweet little kid food. Makeup can be bright eyeshadow, bold eyeliner, lots of mascara, light blush, and lots of pink lip gloss.

"
"
Listen to ""scene"" music.",How to Be a Scene Kid4," ""Scene"" music includes Dot Dot Curve, Brokencyde, Owl City, Blood on the Dance Floor, Millionaires, Scene Kidz, Breathe Carolina, 3!OH3, Family Force 5, I Set My Friends on Fire and Jeffree Star.


Other than the likes of 3!OH3 or Breathe Carolina, try electronicore, too. Electronicore fuses electro-pop with melodic metalcore and stuff. Try stuff like Attack! Attack, I See Stars, Memphis May Fire, Enter Shikari, Woe is Me, Capture the Crown, Make Me Famous and Abandon All Ships. You can also try bands like Pierce the Veil if you want. Electropop and dance-pop is recommended, too. Even these artists and groups sometimes cite pop stars as influences or even appear on a compilation series called ""Punk Goes Pop"". Try Katy Perry, Carly Rae Jepsen or Nicki Minaj. You could also try dubstep and house/techno/dance/etc like Skrillex, Knife Party and deadmau5.
There are many bands or artists mislabeled as scene. Many people think deathcore, for example, is scene. It isn't. Deathcore is a hybrid of death metal (Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, Brain Drill, Dying Fetus) and metalcore (Hatebreed, Converge, While She Sleeps). Metalcore fuses metal music with beatdown hardcore (Death Before Dishonor, Madball, Comeback Kid). Metal, death metal and hardcore punk all have nothing to do with the scene style. Many think this because of the appearances of a few deathcore bands. However, a band that shows the typical image of a deathcore band would be Rose Funeral, Oceano, The Red Chord or Despised Icon. Also, here is some other music mislabeled as scene:
Hollywood Undead - Obviously rap rock
Asking Alexandria - Metalcore/synthcore
iwrestledabearonce - Experimental mathcore
Falling in Reverse - Glam metal/easycore
The Devil Wears Prada - Melodic metalcore
Suicide Silence - deathcore
Black Veil Brides - Glam rock
Of Mice & Men - Metalcore
All Time Low - Pop rock
Paramore - Emo pop

Have the same hair but less poofy and choppy.,
Your jeans should be less tight but still skinny.,
You can wear lacy shirts, polo shirts or poetic words on the shirt.,
Jackets consist of hoodies and tan, navy, and black cardigans or sweaters.,
Your accessories should consist of big, funky, neon jewelry.,
Shoes should be flat, almost like ballet shoes, but with a small pattern and a tiny bow.",How to Be a Preppy Scene Kid (for Girls and Guys)2," Less multi-colored-ness in the hair and tease it less. It should be a natural color with one or two neon highlights or a natural color with blond, red, or black highlights (blond if you are brunette, black if you are blond, red if you are a redhead). Or, just leave it plain and natural.

, Don't wear multicolored jeans too often, only wear dark wash, black, and white jeans, with colorful jeans occasionally. Don't wear tutus too often, don't really wear skirts or dresses. Also, don't wear ripped jeans.

, The should preferably be tight fitting or slightly loose. Wear them in pastel and bright colors, like pale and bright pink, blue, green, purple, black, white, yellow and orange. Make sure to layer graphic T's underneath your polo shirts. For the shirts, the necessary colors are pink, white, black, green, and purple. Red is also good.

, The hoodies can either be loose and long or tight and long. Your cardigans should be tailored and only worn over very scene shirts. Same with sweaters.

, Also, cartoon characters are great. Have at least 2 scene necklaces, one preppy necklace, and a few charm bracelets with scene and preppy charms. Earrings can be anything. Hair accessories should be black, don't wear much else that is black when wearing black in your hair. Belts should be chunky.

, You should also have Converse sneakers, Vans, and one pair of topsiders (worn occasionally).

Be male scene.",How to Be a Preppy Scene Kid (for Girls and Guys)3," Tight plain girl jeans, sometimes they are shrunk a few times in the wash, checkered vans, a black or white studded belt (white is more scene), tight band tees, black or gray tight zip-up hoodies, lip ring and gauges, short choppy hair with bangs. (Scene boys mostly buy chick apparel.)

Act the part.,
Don't be a clique racist.",How to Be a Preppy Scene Kid (for Girls and Guys)5," Remember, these are cliques, you dress the part; then act the part, you dress emo, you're emo, you dress scene, then you're chill as in no ""oh my gawd!"" or squealing, because that's just annoying. Now if you're into the preppy scene chick look, there are three things to remember:


Preppy scene chicks must NOT act like dummies, judgmental, or stupid. That's not cool and no one likes people who act that way. You can switch your hair and wear pink in your hair, but be laid back.
Don't disown others out of your group, even if they're not your clique/scene, because the style sticks out, so that others can fit in.

, Meaning, do not criticize other cliques or types of people when you are one. No clique is any better - or more original - than another. Most scene kids dress the same, as the same with preps, emos, hipsters; you get it.

"
"
Read up.,
Get the hair.,
Get the makeup.,
Get the style.,
Consider piercings and body jewelry.,
Making friends and maintaining your style of living.,
Music taste, now that's important.",How to Be a Natural Scene Girl," Read some Wikihow articles for scene looks and trends. Find out how scene kids look, act, and talk. Also, Urban Dictionary is a good website for some ideas about what a scene girl is. But note that many of Urban Dictionary's definitions for scene kids are stereotypes, that are often offensive and written by people who make fun of scene because they don't understand it. So be careful.;
, Scene hair is often choppy, slightly roughly cut and full of layers. You can go to your nearest salon and show them a picture of your favorite scene hairstyle and ask them to cut your hair like that. Bangs are always a part of a scene haircut, whether it's straight across or a side ""fringe"". Also, make sure you have the tools to work with your new hair after you get it styled. These tools include: heat protectant to keep your hair from frying when using hot tools, a ceramic flat iron to straighten and give your hair that choppy/feathery scene look, hairspray in case your hair is frizzy, and a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to make sure your hair stays healthy throughout the styling process. Keep your hair a pretty, natural color instead of dying it bright (remember, you're going for a natural scene look).

, Scene makeup varies from very light, to very edgy and heavy. For a natural scene makeup look, go easy on the colors. You'll want to keep your makeup nude and natural. Use a light cover up and foundation for blemishes and making sure your skin tone is evened out. Eyeshadow should be light or natural as well. Instead of using black for a smokey scene eye look, blend dark brown (it looks better anyway) shadow into the outer corners of your eyes. Apply a light cream eyeshadow or eyeliner to the inner corners of your eyes to make them look brighter and more awake. Use eyeliner sparingly and only on the top and outer bottom corners of your eyes to give you a sexy cat-eye look. Use mascara only on the outer corners of your lashes. Remember, the idea is to keep it dark but not too dark. Scene makeup tends to look too goth when you use colors like black, red, and harsh white. Use a color of blush that matches the color you naturally flush after running or blushing. Keep your lips nude with chapstick, rosy pink, or clear/nude glossy. When doing your eyebrows, it's best to go with a powder rather than a gel or a liner. Using a flat angled brush, lightly fill in your eyebrows with a shade of eyeshadow or brow powder that's three shades lighter than your natural hair color if you're dark-haired, OR three shades darker if you're blonde or fair-haired. Also for a really natural look you could try just wearing a light color eyeshadow, with mascara and a rosy or clear lipgloss.

, Places to consider shopping at are: American Apparel, Forever21, Urban Outfitters, and thrift stores (yes, even Goodwill). When browsing the clothing selection, try to pick out colors that emphasize your eye color and skin color. Stay away from anything too gaudy (i.e. Hello Kitty, rhinestones, glitter) and remember that basics are always trendy, simple, and inexpensive. For pants, go with skinny jeans or cigarette skinny jeans. Also, keep in mind that when you pair natural/bohemian with scene, you border on indie. Shoes to consider purchasing are: Converse, Vans, Keds, flats, flat-heeled boots, gladiator sandals, and ankle boots.

, Trendy facial piercings include: lip rings, monroes, septum piercings (bull nose ring piercing), and nose rings/studs, nose piercings being especially popular. Often times, other facial piercings receive bad rep and can make you look trashy. Keep the actual piercing itself small and minimal using a small silver ring or a small silver stud. Scene girls also often have gauged ears. Google pictures of gauged ears to browse different types of gauges and plugs.

, What images do you get when you think of scene girls? Partying? Tons of friends? Great style? When you get the look, often the friends come with it. People are naturally attracted to others that have good style. Don't try too hard when trying to make friends. Start out by talking about similar music interests or similar fashion interests. When you are at a party, have fun and don't drink or smoke too much. Everyone loves a party animal but no one loves a sloppy drunk.

, You can still listen to artists you may like that major scene kids like, but your music should kind of go along with your style. Some artist you may like are The Ready Set, Owl City, Miniature Tigers, etc. Maybe some light screamo here and there.

Go shopping for clothing.,
Accessorize.,
Get the hair.,
Know your music.,
Be happy with yourself.,
Don't start drama.,
Find the people who matter.,
If you do want to participate in a social networking site, try bebo, facebook, or even vampire freaks.,
Another important thing is to not be afraid to be random from time to time.",How to Be a Scene Kid Without MySpace," Delia's, Wet Seal, Zumiez and PacSun have really awesome stuff, but Hot Topic is by far the best. Be willing to spend a fair bit of money ($200+) on clothing over a 6-month period.;
, Cell phones and kiddy jewelry are all the rage right now. Buy tons of 'lee lightning' lightning bolts, these are huge in the scene. Dig through your old stuff to see what you can find. Claire's and Hot Topic are great for finding accessories also, but it can be a bit pricey.

, You don't necessarily have to tease your hair to make it Scene, just make it yours, and make it unique.

, Get a last.fm account, and start doing research. Most scene kids are into alternative, techno and hardcore these days. Some scene kids even like avant-garde dadaist noise like Merzbow and Passion Pit. Just listen to what you like, but avoid gangsta rap, drone-doom, and country. iTunes also has good free downloads sometimes, but just don't do anything illegal.

, That's the number one step. If you aren't happy with who you are, it's going to be really hard to fit in anywhere. You just have to find your niche.

, If you're already the most hated person in the school, know you're not automatically going to become popular by being scene. If you're a huge gossip, stop immediately! It's not right to say things about other people.

, Talk to your friends and family a lot. Having a tight knit group will make up for not having social networking. This is SO important so you won't go down the wrong path later. Even though you may think it's not the ""scene"" thing to do to be close to your family, it will be really good in the long run.

, GaiaOnline is another good site that you can freely express yourself online without resorting to Myspace.

, Dancing in the middle of a huge crowd at the mall-not uncommon among scene people. You can buy scene accessories online. You don't have to blow off everyone else's opinion to be scene, but you do have to let it not affect you as much.

Confidence: Scene girls are often known as very confident, random,bold,& sweet.,
Social Networking: Be active on social networking sites such as Myspace, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Tumblr, etc.,
Clothes:Clothes are a big part in scene clothing.You have to wear graphic tees!,
Accessories!!,
Hair: Classic scene hair is easy.,
Makeup: Eyeliner, neon or natural eyeshadow, blush, foundation/ concealer, and lip gloss or lipstick is a must

,
Music: Make sure you love music being Scene means you love music, that's what its all about the music.,
Your attitude: Your attitude is just as important as the music.,
Confusion: Face it people are gonna confuse you with emo, goth, and hipsters, but you aren't and you need to tell them, for the love of all things gold and cheesy don't say "" No, I'm Scene"" If you say this ask them to kindly punch you in the face, and make sure you tell them to do it hard and kindly.",How to Be a Scene Girl at Age 11,";
, Add a cute background and some cool scene music to your page. Take tons of pics and edit them in a good software. ONLY UPLOAD THE FLATTERING ONES. Also, an optional thing is to have a cute scene name. Make sure you ask your parents. Remember, you're still 11 and need permission first.

, ""Zumiez"",""Rue21"",""Bluenote"",& ""5below"" have really cute shirts.You MUST have skinny jeans! Don't spend $100 on skinny jeans,Ross,Target,Walmart TJ Maxx have really good ones. You could also wear tutus with leggings or over jeans.

,: Cute necklaces, a couple of jelly bracelets, pyramid stud belts, huge sunglasses, and tiaras are all good ideas for accessories. Also, you can punch the lenses out of 3D glasses for dorky glasses, as those are popular now. You can wear ""kandi"" (beaded bracelets) .

, Go to the salon and ask for short, choppy layers and a fringe (bangs).

,, Not all the make-up, pictures, clothes, and hair. I don't mean mainstream music like Drake, Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, and artist like that. I mean the music that speaks to your soul, music that makes yo wanna get up and dance every time you hear it. You can listen to any music you like, just as long as it isn't mainstream.

, Scene kids are thought of as rude, impolite, selfish,immature, because of the stereotype. Scene kids today who are trying to be a scene kid are acting like the stereotype and not even knowing it and are giving Scene a bad name. If your going to be scene youMUST BE NICE Your are representing the scene community and your fellow scenery. Don't run around screaming about how scene you are,Because only posers call themselves scene. And scene girls know their scene, so they don't need to talk about it.

, Instead say "" No I'm not (insert what they called you here) I can't really label myself, but I would fall under the category of Scene"" if you say that you will sound more mature and not like a poser.

Adopt a new attitude.,
Always have good hygiene.,
Start incorporating colors like pink (lots of it!,
Get kawaii scene hair.,
Get kawaii scene makeup.,
Listen to music.",How to Be a Cute Scene Girl," You don't need to completely change who you are, but if you're the gloomy or rude type, know that this is not acceptable in the kawaii scene society. Also know that, since you are trying to have an innocent personality. Your attitude needs to have one or more of the following attributes: cuteness (of course), sweet as sugar, playful, child-likeness (aka- child-like wonder, child-like happiness, child-like giddiness, child-like mischievousness etc.) If you are more of an introvert, you can go for the ultra shy/sweet type. You MUST be kind toward everyone you meet. Yes, even your worst enemy. But don't be fake or too overly nice or goody-goody as this might annoy people. Be an optimist. Have a positive outlook on life, like that of a child. Always remember to look for the best in people.;
, Brush your teeth, have a shower regularly, clean your nails, keep them dirt free, never let your hair become greasy (it looks trashy and gross), etc.

,), blue, purple, and some yellow into your wardrobe and accessories. Some red can be good too. Pastels, and bright colors are great. You should think of white as your fashion foundation. A certain amount of black is fine, but try not to have too much of it. Rainbow is also very good.
When it comes to fashion, besides going for the ""young"" look, the main thing to remember is to do anything you want. Anything unique is great. Mismatch colors and patterns. Layer things. Wear giant boots with high furry socks peeking out of the top if you want to. Do something no one does. Do something that expresses your individuality.



Tops: You must have at least one amazingly cute, mega-over sized jacket. Remember that you are a scene kid after all and don't forget about band shirts. These are very important in the scene community. Make sure that your tops are skin-tight. Try some ribbed tank tops in various neon/bright colors or animal prints. Get some hoodies: branded, animal print, or just solid colors. Cartoon characters are sometimes worn. Such as Invader Zim, Pokémon, and Hello Kitty. Don't wear to much of them, though. And, don't stock up on Hello Kitty. Some Hello Kitty is good. Anything else from the Sanrio company is great. Disney princess shirts are good. Tinker Bell is especially good. Cartoon characters are good. Especially anime. Any top that has a young, cute, or girly style to it is what you're looking for.

Pants: Get many pairs of colored skinny jeans. Try colors like dark blue, purple, hot pink, red, etc. but make sure you get one pair of black and one of white. Skinny jeans with patterns or animal print on them are amazing finds. The same goes for leggings and tights. Tiny shorts are very cute.

Dresses and Skirts: Dresses galore. This should be the main ingredient in your wardrobe. Ruffles, frills, lace, bows, anything feminine or cute will do. Lolita dresses are highly acceptable. White dresses are wonderful. Pastels are fine too. Whatever dress you can find that looks like it's more suited for a porcelain doll than for you, GET IT! Skirts should be fairly short. You can wear your leggings or tights underneath. Tutus are NICE. Neon colored is perfect.

Shoes: Vans, converse, flats, ballet shoes, giant black boots, go-go boots, any shoes with thick, chunky heels, uggs, flip flops (only if they're ultra cute), Japanese geta (wooden sandals), and doll style shoes (black or white) are all kawaii scene. As long as they're cute, you could even get away with tennis shoes. This is only a guideline; wear whatever shoes feel right for you.

, Two ponytails, braids of any size, and any ""cute"" hair style is good. Your hair needs to be layered up top and either slightly or majorly teased. Use hairspray to hold your hair in place. Make your hair look ""messy"" and like you just rolled out of bed. Don't ask why, just comply. It's sexy in the book of scene. Also, you'll need either bangs, long side bangs, or a fringe. You can dye your hair black, platinum blonde, or an ""anime"" color such as red, pink, blue, dark blue, purple, etc. You can also dye colored streaks or chunks through random sections in your hair. Coon tails have become quite popular. For the kawaii look, colored coon tails are best. Finish your hair off with a little girl headband and/or a giant bow. Ribbons, clips, and other accessories are also good.

, For eye shadow, any bright color in the rainbow will do. Black is a popular shadow. Pink, purple, or blue, are especially good for the cute look. The best way a kawaii scene girl can do her eye makeup is to wear the doll-eyed style. It's rather simple, but the results are adorable. YouTube.com has good videos on how to do this. You can make your eyes look rounder and bigger by making eyeliner above your pupil thicker. Extend the eyeliner beyond the outside corner of your eye with a slight flick to make your eyes look longer. For mascara, apply lengthening mascara to all of your lashes and volumizing mascara to your outer corners, do this on both top and bottom lashes. You may want to consider false eyelashes. Make sure that they look realistic. Apply just a touch of blush. If you want, you can go for the anime look and brush little horizontal ovals on the tops of your cheeks. Lip color should be either pale (if you want to look sexy) or pink (bright or natural).

, Listen to anything that you like! Sweet, soft music to hard rock. Hip-hop to techno. Japanese rock (J-rock) to classical. It's up to you. Get white, huge headphones for your iPod, (if you want) and pull them down around your neck with the volume still on while talking with people. You should probably keep up to date with the music world.

Just because you shop at one place doesn't mean you are any less Scene. Also, if anyone decides to make fun of you for shopping somewhere, they aren't ""jealous"" or anything like that; they're just a closed-minded idiot who doesn't know how to find a good bargain. Speaking of which...;
, If you are on a budget, or tight on money for any reason, that means you may not be able to afford to drop $20 on a single t-shirt, or $15+ on a pair of jeans. Start looking at second-hand stores, and start looking for good deals and sales, regardless of whether or not the place is targeted toward the Scene crowd or more edgy, alternative folks. For example, Old Navy has comfy tank tops in basic colors, and they tend to sell for $2-$6 each. Goodwill usually has a deal going on where clothing with a certain colored tag is marked down. So, if you have $6 jeans with a green tag, you may be able to snag them for, say, $4.50 or so. Neat, huh?

, The best colors would be grey/black, but navy blues and any other color will do fine. Make sure it's not baggy, but fits well and can last for awhile.

, Fear not, you don't have to spend $15+ on just one pair. Yikes. Look for your nearest secondhand store or consignment shop and you'll find some great skinny jeans for under ten per pair. Look for some darker colors, like black or dark blue. For the destroyed look, take a razor to them and then wash them.

, Again, don't be afraid to look at a secondhand store for graphic tees and band shirts. Consignment shops and any secondhand place geared toward the alternative crowd should have them. (It feels great to support local businesses, doesn't it?) As stated above, Old Navy will have some cheap tanks in basic colors for about $6, so stock up. JC Penny's Junior section also has graphic and foil-print tees, as does Wall Mart.

, This is a MUST for someone on a budget. Learning to sew is a great place to start so that, if something gets a hole in it, you don't have to worry about it. Sewing also comes in handy if you need to make something fit better, or even want to make your own clothes. Gothic Beauty Magazine has some fun patterns, and Dollar Tree sells sewing kits. You should also learn to make your own jewelry, be it a simple plastic beaded bracelet or a pair of earrings. You can find plastic beads and cord at places like Michaels and Jo Ann's in the kids' section of the store. Just stay away from their more plastic-y cord, as the knot won't stay as well, and it breaks easier. DIY parties can also be a fun activity for some of your friends, as you can trade the bracelets that you make, and even have access to other beads if they bring their supplies.

, For starters, a 20 minute trip to Claire's and Icing will yield great results. They have some cute jewelry, makeup, and nail polish. A trip to a Sanrio store, or a place that sells keychain plushies can give you something fun to put on a beaded necklace. Just remove the keychain part, put the plushie on a cord, then add your beads. The same goes for glow sticks, which can be found at Dollar Tree.

, Converse are already very popular in the scene fashion world and are very low in price. Buy some Sharpies and go wild with colour! You can also wear Vans; since they're skater shoes, they'll be able to last awhile. Doc Martins and Airwalk (the Ugg knockoff) are also a good choice if you're looking for boots.

, All you need for the eyes is eyeliner, colourful eyeshadow, and mascara. For skin, apply moisturizer, then some foundation, then a little powder. Just powder or foundation can work too!

, Hair is very important! The first step is straightening it, then, simply tease layers and add hairspray. Side bangs are a must. You can learn how to give yourself a scene haircut on in about 10 minutes, just search 'how to get scene hair'. Also, you can buy clip in hair extensions in Claire's or any hair care store, such as Sally's or Mid K. Some stores sell hair extensions for less than others, but if you are going to get them, try to get real hair extensions because they'll hold up longer, and they'll be easier to blend in with your hair.

, Be creative!

Make it clear that there are ways of adopting this style that are not permanent and that won't interfere with your school uniform presentation or other things that might worry them.;
, Try to work out in advance what is likely to worry them and have good, sensible solutions to offer them. Don't backchat or dismiss their concerns though; be open to discussion and ask nicely.


Your parents might be worried about what being scene means. You will need to explain this clearly to them. Perhaps use internet resources to help you explain it better.
Your parents might be worried about hair dyeing. Inform them that there are ways around this, such as using colored extensions or temporary solutions such as chalk or wash-out color spray.
Your parents might be worried about the cost of clothing. Reassure them that you can make your own or repurpose thrift store finds.

, If they say no outright, ask that they think about for a while and that you'll ask again later. If they're unsure, don't badger them. Instead, occasionally raise the matter again, asking them if they've had a chance to think about it.

, You can use these suggestions to explain what you can do to turn scene without permanent changes, high costs and major changes. Some of the suggestions can also be implemented as a way of getting around parental disapproval but be aware that this carries a risk of getting into trouble.

, One day wear a scene top, (a bright shirt with a simple slogan on it is good), then the next day maybe wear converse sneakers or high-tops.

, While, most scene girls get off with band tees and such, Hot Topic can be expensive. You can definitely get away with any shirt that isn't name-brand. Walmart? That works. Goodwill? Even better.


Avoid wearing band shirts featuring grotesque graphics, considering your parents don't necessarily support the change.

, If for some reason, you can't get skinny jeans, try to go for a dark boot-cut jean.

, Can't forget the shoes: ballet flats, Converse or sneakers.

, If your parents don't want you dyeing your hair, try colored hair extensions. Find these in the dollar stores or cheaper beauty outlets for a low cost. Use colored hair chalks as another alternative or in combination with the hair extensions.

, At least you can have the hairstyle.

, If all else fails, use hair accessories as the last option. These can also be worn with a change of hairstyle and in extensions.

, If you honestly can't convince your parents to let you get a cool side fringe, ask for straight-across bangs then let them grow out. By the time they're straight across your nose, you should be able to push them to a side and you'll have cute scene bangs.

, If your parents object to you wearing darker colors like black, simply go lighter. Go with colors like blue, purple or green, for that bright and colorful look. Those are colors they might let you wear. However, if your parents don't really let you wear makeup, you could probably get away with a doll-like look: just do a light shadow, a little mascara, and a touch of lip gloss.

, Start by using one shade of green or purple or something, then two shades, then three. Stop at three. Don't go thick with the eyeliner at first. And if you use colored liner, don't use shadow. Use clear lip gloss, or pink.

, Got kids at school who are rude or mean to you? Saying you're stupid? That's not true. If people call you that, just think to yourself that people that are mean are just trying to cover up themselves.

, Because everyone else is already taken.


If you are shy or rebellious or anything else, enjoy it. Don't change yourself just because that's what someone else is.
Be nice and friendly.

, It'll make people think you are a poser.

, Some examples are Cameron Catastrophe or Daniella Disaster. Some good ideas for for the last part could be Cannibal, Crisis, Killer, Venom, Beastly/ Beast, and Horrible. You could take one of these or make up your own but it can't be like say your name was Hannah. It couldn't be Hannah Happy. Or something bright sounding.

, Be sure you're well-balanced in music tastes and when you talk to people about music, be sure to tell them you like everything and that you'll check out any band they mention when you get home.

, Write down what you like about each scene girl: maybe you like her haircut? Maybe there's a certain outfit she has that you think you'd look stellar in? You're not copying unless you do everything the same as her; you're experimenting.

If you like metal, listen to Death-core/Metal-core bands like Bring Me the Horizon, Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Asking Alexandria, and the Acacia Strain.
If you're more interested in pop, listen to something still electronic-based and danceable but edgier than a soccer mom would listen to like Panic At The Disco, Hellogoodbye, Lady Gaga (Yes, really) and deadmau5 if you like Dubstep.
Want something mellow/soft? Try indie like Death Cab For Cutie, Ellie Goulding, LIGHTS, and Foxtrot.
If you're looking for something in between, try post-hardcore & Screamo. Examples include A Sky lit Drive, Sky Eats Airplane, Escape the Fate, Breathe Carolina (electronic), Attack Attack, etc.
A good website to go on to find bands is www. taste-kid.com. It has you type in a band you already like, and it'll give you even more suggestions.;
, The most important part of the scene look is the hair. You can get away with any clothes as long as your hair is perfect. The typical scene hairstyle is unisex and works for all lengths/hair types. Just make sure you have short layers at the top and side bangs. Cut them yourself if you can. Girls can also have straight bangs. Don't forget to get your hair thinned out.

, Straighten your hair completely flat. If your hair seems frizzy, add shine serum. If you're a boy with longer hair, stop here because you're done. Everyone else, grab those teasing combs. Only tease the uppermost shortest layers if you have short hair. If you have long hair, tease the upper half of your head. Everybody also don't forget to hairspray! Obviously, don't tease your bangs.


Guys should never ever wear a ponytail. Short haired girls are allowed to skip the teasing step and wear a deer tail.Girls with long hair can wear a ponytail with all of the hair tied to either side of you, directly behind your ear, and your bangs remaining in their original place. Girls with any hair length can wear pigtails.
When styling hair, it is important that all hair on the front part of your head remain flat. Use your ear as a guide. Nothing in front of it should be moved when creating your hairstyles.

, Sure, you can go ahead and dye your whole head green but it's a lot easier/healthier/trendier to add a few streaks of any color into your hair using extensions. Fashion core needs to be up to the minute, so this is the way to go. At the moment neon is in style, but check out hair on the runways to see what's in the next season. Also, some people add coontails to their hair, which will probably be on the outs by the time you'll read this. Either go to your local hair supply store and buy the extensions or go to Sally's or even buy them on Myspace. You can glue them to your hair or clip them in. Just make sure to trim the extension to the length of your actual hair when doing streaks. Make it look real. Its not that difficult.

, Buy tightest pants possible. Add tight graphic tee, band tee, or v neck. Go to next step. Ladies have the real options. Here are a few looks a scene girl could try out:


A casual look can be skinny jeans in a black/light wash/ripped/neon variety with a tight graphic or band tee.
You could substitute t-shirts with other tops like beater tanks or regular tanks in the summer. Try one white or black tank with a neon color underneath.
Another idea for the summer is to swap out the skinny jeans for shorts or Bermudas in black and white with prints.
A more glam look can be leggings with an oversize graphic or band t shirt. Just make sure the shirt is large enough to cover your crotch but not so large that it is actually a dress. Find the perfect medium between thug tee and baby doll.
Dresses are also becoming more popular in the 2010/11 scene. The most popular at the moment can be found at Rue 21 and Delia's.

, This is a unisex look.


In colder climates, bomber jackets and fur puffy vests are OK.
Limit hats because they crush the hair. If one's needed, choose something bright, beanies, or berets. Scarves and earmuffs are acceptable.

, Seriously, no guy-liner unless you're actually a rock star. You will still need to be flawless. Drink 8 glasses of water each day. It really does clear up skin, even better than Proactiv. (You should still wash your face every night!) Wear colorful nail polish. Really, anything will do. Black is acceptable but overused and expected. Guys should not paint their nails as that is way too 1992 to function. Girls should follow the following makeup guidelines:


For the casual look, start with whatever you usually use to cover blemishes. Add blush and cheek highlighter. Smooth a white eyeshadow underneath your eyebrow and above your top lash. Then apply a black eyeliner on top and bottom and follow with 2 coats of mascara.
When getting dressed up, use a color eyeshadow on your lids and follow the rest of the directions for the casual look. The eyeshadow can be black or neon. Use whatever colors compliment your eye color. Use blue for blue eyes, pink for hazel, lavender for brown, and purple for green eyes. Or wear any color, as long as you look amazing!
When leaving the house without makeup, it is mandatory you wear sunglasses to cover this fact up.

, Unisex shoes are great for casual looks. These include Converse, (although Converse have become far to much of a fad - it's best to steer clear of them.) Vans, Reebok Freestyles, and Nike Dunks. Girls can wear ballet flats or pumps with any outfit and probably get away with it. Flats are getting more and more popular. It's mandatory to own at least one pair of black flats. It's also good to have silver or white. Collect tons of different colors to wear with different outfits. TOMS shoes and moccasins are also becoming more popular. Don't wear boots unless they're flat.

, Girls can wear these for a casual look as well.
Girls also wear necklaces with over sized pendants as well as bangle bracelets. Light, dressy scarves are acceptable as well. Pearl necklaces and silver necklaces with random pendants on them are great too. Don't wear those gummy or rubber band bracelets as they are truly passe. An actual rubber band that really does tie things is an acceptable piece of jewelry for both sexes.
Girls should also wear a hair bow or a headband. Tiaras are for birthdays only.
Girls can wear those 3 in 1 belts if they want to glam up. Only wear the ones with snaps instead of the ones that loop through a buckle.
Also, if you need to wear glasses, they should be plastic. The current trend is to get your grandma's old huge plastic frames and get them filled with your prescription. If you don't have those, get prescription Ray Bans.

, You could do something creative with your pictures like give yourself porcelain skin or purple eyes.

, Facial piercings, plugs, and tattoos are scene too. When getting a tattoo, just make sure not to get any tribal tattoos. Nothing in this step is mandatory though.

, Try not to do the hold-the-camera pose, the ""oops"" face, or the peace sign. Using a self-timer, take pictures of yourself outside, in looking out of a window, or write your best friend's name on your palm. Upload! Get a high-quality camera instead of just using the camera on your phone.


Create your own Myspace and be famous with lots of friends. Create proof of yourself using a picture or video. For example, you could have a photo of yourself holding a piece of paper with your URL or a video telling your URL.

, Have you added everyone in your area in your age range? That's a good start, but if you want fame, which you DO, you're going to need a higher friend count than that. Go to friend adding sites. Add kids who look scene. Myspace only lets you add 400 people a day, so hop to it! Strive for a six figure friend list. Nothing in this step is mandatory. Fashion-core is about fashion. NOT about having a bazillion friends on Myspace. This actually has NOTHING to do with it, but it may help.

, Add all the bands you liked on Myspace and find what dates they are coming to your town. Go to every show you can even if its local. You need to be seen to be Scene. Make sure to post bulletins telling people what show you're at and tell people to say hi to you if they see you. Bring a friend so you don't look lame and make sure you look your absolute best. Learn to do the dances you see at the shows. If you have a band, talk to the band after the show. They probably know people who can get you gigs. Again, nothing in this step is mandatory. If you're not overly obsessed with music and going to shows, you don't have to. Be yourself. Don't try to be something you're not, or you will be labeled as a poser.

, An iPod touch works well too. Decorate it by adding small rhinestones, using Sharpies, and adding cell phone charms. The more cell phone charms, the better!

, Doing this ensures that everyone knows where all the action is at. After a fun night, post a blog detailing all the upscale things you did. They don't need to be upscale, just make them seem like they are. For example, if you go to McDonald's, say you went to a restaurant with friends. Don't divulge every detail of your life. Make yourself seem mysterious.

, If you do it too often or too little, people will find you boring. Try to post pictures with your hot friends, but just make sure you are the best looking one in the picture.

, Try not to watch television if possible. Go to coffee shops, techno clubs, shows, the mall, the movies, whatever. Just don't be boring.

, Also read NYLON and Miss Behave magazines.

, Just because it's scene to listen to a certain band does NOT mean you have to if you don't want to.

Realize (and make a list of) things that are out of style for scene kids.,
Save up a good bit of cash and invest in some more modern scene clothing as they tend to very pricey.,
Pick a good-looking scene hairstyle.,
Get involved with the Internet (but not too involved).",How to Be a New Age Scene Kid," This includes items such as leopard hair, guyliner, and the finger-gun-pointed-to-head pose in Myspace pictures. Try to avoid doing any of these.;

General fashion: Plaid shirts, or flannels look good on either gender and in virtually any color. Plain-colored skinny jeans (black, grey and white) will always be considered scene. Band shirts are still as popular as ever. Piercings, like skinny jeans, are one of those perpetually scene attributes.

Guys: Boys, you have it fairly easy in this aspect. Buy lots and lots of V-necks; they're simple yet stylish and can be bought almost anywhere. As far as shoes go, Vans, Converse, Combat boots (Doc Martens) and sometimes even flip-flops are common scene footwear.

Girls: Make leggings—preferably full-length ones—your best friend. Pick out some black, white, neon, Zebra, striped and torn/tattered leggings. These look great worn underneath miniskirts, shorts or skinny jeans with holes. Combat boots are also worn by scene girls as well as scene guys. Single-colored flats or slip-ons still add that classic scene touch. As far as shirts are concerned, just about anything goes. Try taking a crew-neck band tee and cutting it into a tank, one-shoulder or tube top.

Accessories: Long, fringed scarves have made their place alongside bandannas as the preferred neckwear for scene kids; in that same way, Ray-bans without lenses have recently claimed their place next to large, bug-eye-like sunglasses. Pyramid stud belts are still popular amongst the scene crowd (particularly white ones), but some scenesters have ditched those for plain, white belts with a cartoon character belt buckle. Sex bracelets are fine, but don't wear so many that your arm is completely covered.

, Make it fit your budget, lifestyle, and personality. For example, if you want all of your hair bleached white-blonde but can't afford to get it redone every few weeks (or simply don't have the time), then that color probably isn't the one for you.


Multi-colored hair is still fairly popular, but one color, usually black, bleach or blue is the preference.
The popularity of large, teased hair has waned in the last year or so in favor of more sleek and classy hairstyles, but is still a major player in the scene. Many new-age scene girls have long, straight or crimped hair, while the guys basically have the same hair as before except for that the over-the-eye look just isn't cool anymore.

, If you're reading this, then you probably already have a device with an Internet connection--a good start. Facebook is pretty much mandatory. Start with only adding people you know on Facebook, then start adding other scene kids. Buzznet and Stickam are also fairly scene-popular social networking sites while Tumblr is gaining popularity. Myspace isn't quite the ""scene haven"" that it once was, so it's not required (or suggested) that you be extremely active on this site; in fact, many scene kids have gone so far as to delete their Myspace accounts altogether, though it is never too harmful to still have one.


Upload some decent photos. When choosing a picture to put on your page, pick one that's a flattering shot of you. This means no awkward ""scene poses"" or hair in your face. It is somewhat popular, to have photo effects that look vintage.

"
"
Do not say ""I'm scene!"",
Do not go up to random scene kids and follow them.,
Listen to the music.,
Get a good hair-cut.,
Shop at just about any store you want for your clothes.,
Do your makeup right.",How to Avoid Being a Scene Poser," That is the most commonly done thing. If you're a scene person, you will know and you don't have to say something about it. If someone asks you, just simply say, ""I don't label myself,"" or just brush it off. A good idea is to not freak out whenever someone calls you scene. If someone mistakes you for another style, just say ""no."";
, Also, don't go up to scene kids and say, ""Wow, that shirt is so scene."" Scene kids can be nice, but like most people, will get annoyed when followed everywhere.

, Seriously, listen to it, don't just say you do because you've heard a couple of songs by that artist. Here's LOADS of music that many scene kids listen to:


Electronic/Powerpop/Crunkcore: Blood On the Dance Floor, Lady Gaga, Breathe Carolina, Ke$ha, Jeffree Star, T. Mills, Electric Valentine, Dot Dot Curve, BrokeNCYDE, Paramore, Rediscover, Kill Paradise, J Bigga, Geoffrey Paris, Scotty Vanity, The Millionaires, All Time Low, Tila Tequila
Metalcore/post-hardcore: Asking Alexandria, Eyes Set to Kill, Greeley Estates, Escape the Fate, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Hopes Die Last, Black Veil Brides, A Day to Remember, Alesana, Inhale Exhale, Destroy the Runner, Get Scared, Emery
Metal/Nu-Metal/Rock: The Faceless, Dope, Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, Danzig, Twisted Sister, Bullet For My Valentine, Black Sabbath, Flyleaf, Aerosmith, AC/DC, The Rolling Stones, Korn, Deep Purple, Alice Cooper, System Of a Down, Iron Maiden, Guns N' Roses, Slipknot, Bon Jovi, Avenged Sevenfold, Black Label Society, Scorpions
Indie/Acoustic/Soft Rock: Modest Mouse, Neon Trees, Never Shout Never, Lexia, The Almost, Nickasaur!

It's completely okay if you don't like all of those artists, especially the older, 80s ones. They're good to know though, because of the musical knowledge it gives you. Listen to anything you like here, and whatever else you like.









, Get a good hair cut, not a bad one. For girls, the typical scene haircut is choppy layers on the top with longer layers on the bottom. The top is usually teased & it often has a fringe. You can accomplish this look by using hairspray; most use Rave or BedHead. For guys, the hair is simply layered and brushed to the front. Both genders usually straighten their hair, although scene girls with long hair can be seen curling a few strands on the bottom, un-teased part. Hair can be any color, but if you're a ginger, simply color in your eyebrows at least 3 shades darker so your hair looks dyed that color.

, Thrift stores are good, but try going to a Plato's Closet, Buffalo Exchange, your local consignment shop, or Goodwill. You can go to anywhere that you like the clothing in general.


Shoes: For girls, pretty much anything goes here. However, if your grandmother would wear it, it's best to avoid. Most scene girls stay true to Converse, Vans slip-ons, and ballet flats. Any color works here, as long as it goes with the stuff you wear. Guys usually stick with Converse and Vans, although flipflops are sometimes worn. Some guys wear Toms shoes, as well.
Pants: Skinny jeans, skinny jeans, skinny jeans. That's pretty much what you'll be wearing everyday. For girls, any color works, but very wildly-patterned ones are best to avoid. (Think: Abbey Dawn brand printed pants.) Denim is by far the best, and dark washes and very light washes look great. Rip them, draw on them; anything that makes them YOU.girls can also wear cute skirts,tutus and cute tight or leggings. For guys, the skinny jeans should just be denim, but the occasional red looks amazing.
Shirts: For both genders, band tees and graphic tees are basically the norm. If you're just getting into the scene, graphic tees are your best option, because many girls wear them. You can get these at most stores. Try going to Kohls at the end of the season, because there are sales on the cute, funny ones all the time then. JC Penny and Buffalo Exchange are also good places for graphic tees, and Buffalo Exchange has great retro (1970's-early 1990s) band tees. Wear band tees of bands that you actually listen to. Most articles suggest knowing at least 3 songs, but that's not enough. You should at least know an entire album by an artist if you're going to wear a tee with their logo, or have seen them live and own at least one album. Do this because people will often ask what your favorite album is by them, and you don't want to be clueless. Know the members, too. You can also wear tank tops and v-necks if you want.
Jackets: You'll be wearing mostly hoodies. You can wear these any time of year, unless you can't tolerate the heat in hotter seasons. Wildly patterned is actually good here, and black hoodies are a must. Band hoodies are great if you can find them. Girls can look for hoodies with ears & faces on the hood itself. (Hello Kitty, Gir, etc.) The brand So So Happy also sells hoodies with cute monster faces on the front. Bomber jackets and even dark peacoats are good for regions that get very cold.
Accessories: Go light on this one. A common mistake that most people make is wearing too many accessories. It honestly makes you look like a poser. For girls, it's alright in pictures, but never go out wearing that many. 2 or 3 bracelets, a necklace, a bow, and a belt is more than enough. Silly Bandz are okay, but only wear a few at a time. Try getting those thick rubber ones that have band names or sayings on them. Don't wear ""Save the Boobies/Tatas/etc"" bracelets/merch if you aren't sincere about the support of breast cancer research. If you wear Kandi, don't overdo it. Only wear a couple at a time and don't call them Kandi unless you attend raves, or know what kandi is and what it stands for if you DON'T attend raves. If you go to raves, it's alright to wear a lot, but then you're more of a raver. You can also wear Sex Bracelets, but again, don't overdo it, and be prepared to explain to people what they stand for and that you don't actually play the game (if you don't). Pendant necklaces are your best bet, and Hello Kitty is a basic scene girl necklace. Bows shouldn't be too big; just don't buy ones that are as big as your head. Belts are commonly white or checkerboard, but any bright, fun belt passes. Guys usually wear a few bracelets and a belt. They usually wear the same bracelets that girls wear. Belts are commonly just simple, white ones.

, Girls should only really wear makeup, although guys can put a little, tiny bit of eyeliner on if they know how. Girls commonly make the mistake of putting on too much makeup. Simple makeup is more popular now. Put on a liquid base and foundation that's your skin tone or a shade lighter. Make your face look as flawless as you can, but still realistic. Put a white base of eyeshadow from your crease up to your eyebrow, but not too heavy. It's just to lighten it up. Eyeliner is probably the most important part of a scene girl's makeup. Don't put it on too thick. Black or brown/black is the best; avoid color eyeliner unless you're good at applying it and can successfully pull it off. You can use pencil, auto, or liquid eyeliner, although most prefer liquid. Go all around your eye, with a thin line in the inner corner, getting slightly thicker in the outer corner. Wing it out if you want to. Don't wear eyeshadow unless it compliments your eye colour. Black is okay too, because it matches any eye. Wear a little blush if you want. Pink lipstick is alright, as long as it's a very light pink. Don't wear nude lips; you'll look sick. Coral color lipstick can go with just about everything, as it can stand out while still looking nice and classy. Red is a risky color as it can only go for a select few people, and anything too dark can look odd/out of place or downright trashy.

,

Wear makeup.,
Be yourself.",How to Look Emo," Scene and emo hair can sometimes be similar, although scene hair tends to be more colorful while emo hair tends to sweep across your face and eyes more. Whether teased or straightened, most emos have it choppy and covering one eye. If you want to dye your hair, some good colors would be white-blond, black (streaked with purple or red), or dark brown. Alternatively, you can use clip-on extensions, which work almost as well but are better for scene, not emo.;
, The top half of your outfit should definitely be layered. For example, you might wear a checkered top over a plain top or a waistcoat over a white tee. Other tops to include among your layers are tanks, black slogan tees, ironic tees and hoodies. For the true emo effect, make sure tees are tight - but not so tight that it's uncomfortable or immodest. You should also wear a cheap hoodie over your shirt - it can be of any colour.

, Emo music (originally called Emotive hardcore or Emocore) is a huge part of the subculture and started in the 80's when hardcore punk bands began writing more emotional lyrics. Rites of Spring, Embrace (U.S), Moss Icon, Indian Summer (U.S), Twelve Hour Turn, Heroin, Cap'n Jazz, American Football, Drive Like Jehu, Sunny Day Real Estate, Senses Fail, and Texas Is The Reason, are all good examples of emo bands. If you’re a fan of emo music, be sure to dress accordingly.

,, Emo is about being emotive, so be sure to express yourself through accessories that show off your interests, feelings and tastes. Studded belts, pins and patches, band bracelets, messenger bags, charm necklaces (with emo-esque charms), and studded bracelets, or even piercings are all good places to start.

, Complete the outfit with Vans, Converse, Hot Topic shoes, plimsolls, flats or trainers. Break your shoes in to make them look well worn; having shiny new kicks isn’t very emo.

, To make your features more expressive, wear dramatic shades like charcoal eye shadow, dark mascara, black liquid eyeliner and a dark nail polish. Accentuate the darker tones with a red lipstick or stain. Many emo guys wear a little eyeliner as well.

, The emo subculture is all about being emotive and the most important part of that is expressing who you really are. If that person happens to like emo styles and appreciate emo music, great! However, if not, trying to assimilate into the subculture will not bring you happiness.

Look for prints like polka dots, plaid or a checkered design.Look for 70’s style jackets. Those are very popular amongst emo girls, and they go with everything from jeans to dresses.Also look for 50’s style vintage dresses, especially halter dresses or dresses in an A-line cut.;
, Look for understated colors, rather than flashy neons or pastels. Black is usually a big component in an emo wardrobe, but you can still wear color. Look for classic primary or jewel-toned items. There really are no hard and fast rules about colors, though, so if you like something, get it. You can always accessorize to include different colors, too.

, Emo dresses usually come in two different cuts: jersey or tunic dresses or fuller, A-line dresses. Try to buy dresses that fit into one of these two categories.


Dresses can and should include cool details, like a corset bodice or shoelace detailing.
If you prefer skirts, try to buy them short and pleated.

, Wearing dresses can be hard, especially in the winter. To make your look more seasonally appropriate, add leggings or tights. These should be brightly colored or striped and can include cool textures, like fishnets.


If your tights or leggings have a tear in them, even better!
You can also wear leggings or tights under cut-off shorts or miniskirts.

, Emo girls love to express themselves, and graphic tees are a great way to do this. Buy a t-shirt with a band you like or quote that is meaningful to you. Hoodies are also a great (warm) way to express yourself.Tees and hoodies should fit well and should not be oversized to the point where you’re swimming in them.
Pair your tees and hoodies with a slightly faded, fitted pair of jeans. To add a bit more flair, wear a pair of striped socks over your jeans.

, A pair of Converse shoes are the perfect touch to complete any emo kid outfit. Converse are the most popular shoes for emo girls, but Vans are a close second. Either pair of shoe is great to wear with pants or skirts and dresses.


Ballet flats are also a good option if you want to go a little more girly.
To make your shoes more fun, try switching out the original laces for something more colorful.

, Emo style is all about mixing cute with hardcore. Buy a headband with a bow on it, or a studded belt. For maximum effect, wear more than one belt at a time.If you have piercings, feel free to rock them.


Chunky bracelets are also very popular in the emo girl community.
If you’re wearing denim, try ironing on or sewing on patches to give your look a little more flair.

, You don’t have to change your hair color just because you want to start dressing emo, but if it’s important to you, there are lots of colors to choose from. Most emo hairstyles center around jet black hair, bleached blonde hair or some combination of the two.If you have naturally dark hair, try adding some very light highlights. If you have naturally light hair, try adding very dark lowlights.
You can also experiment with dying your hair different bright colors. Purple, red and pink are currently very popular, but you can dye your hair any color you’d like.
If you aren’t ready to commit to a big color change right now or if your parents say you can’t, try experimenting with wash out dye.You can also try streaking your hair, so the color is less aggressive. Or buy colored clip-ins and layer them amongst your natural hair color. The possibilities are endless!

, There are certain haircuts that are strongly associated with emo culture. These haircuts include, straight hair with very sharp cuts or hair cut with very dramatic layers.If you have short hair, try a sharply angled bob cut.
If you have long hair, try adding long layers on both sides.There is a misconception that you can only be emo if your hair is straight. This is not true. Curly haired girls can be emo too.

, This is a popular emo hairstyle you can pull off even without getting a haircut. To do this, take a section of your hair from the back. Using your comb, back comb or tease the bottom of this section until the crown of your hair has a little more volume.Be careful not to tease too hard, or you might damage your hair.
When the back of your hair is fully teased, wear your hair down, or throw it up into a casual ponytail.

, Bangs are a signature emo look for women. Bangs should be heavy and thick or styled into a fringe. Regardless of how they are cut, you’ll want them long enough to touch your eyebrows or possibly to hang over and cover part of your eyes.This will allow you to hide behind your bangs when you feel sad.

, Your eyes are the windows to your soul, and for emo girls, you want them to be a focal point of your face. Use eyeliner or kohl to heavily line your eyes, almost to the point where you look like a raccoon.To apply liquid eyeliner, start at the top of one eyelid and draw a line from one corner of the lid to the other. Try to draw your line at ½ a centimeter and allow it to air dry so it doesn’t smudge.Draw over the liquid eyeliner with a black crayon or pencil eyeliner to make your eyes extra dark and dramatic.
If you’re not allowed to wear makeup to school, don’t worry! Save it for a special event or Halloween. You can still dress like an emo girl without all the makeup.

, Because the eyes are such a focal point in emo makeup, the rest of your face should be left relatively untouched. Try adding pale or neutral lipgloss to make your lips pop a little. You can also add a little blush to give your cheeks a little color., Nails are a big deal for emo girls, so go crazy here. Paint them dark or bright colors or alternate between the two. If you have a little money laying around, splurge for a gel manicure so they’ll last a little longer.


Try making your fourth finger on each hand a different color than the rest.
Use nail decals or stickers to attach fun images like cartoon characters or skulls to your nails. Mix and match for a cool combination."

Smudge the black eyeliner on the upper lid.,
Apply black mascara to upper lashes.,
Use matte lipstick.",How to Do Emo Makeup1," Always apply makeup on fresh, clean skin.


Use a mild soap or cleaner to avoid drying your skin out.
Pat your skin dry.
You may want to apply a makeup primer at this point to help all of your makeup adhere to your skin.;
, The stick form of concealer is preferable as it applies the most evenly and hides blemishes well.


Use a liquid foundation and blend it well.
Make sure your concealer and foundation are the right shade for your skin tone.The wrong tone can make your skin look washed out, yellow or orange.
Use a foundation brush to apply your foundation for the most even application and polished look.

, Use blush sparingly, as the Emo look focuses on the eyes and less on the colors of the skin and lips.


If you are going for a pale look then try not to use blush as the goal of Emo makeup is to accentuate the eyes.
Keep the shade only slightly pinker than your skin tone.
Apply in circles to the cheekbones.
Avoid putting blush on contours or cheek hollows.

, Use a smokey eye effect.


Start by applying a matte slade shade of eyeshadow across the eyelid.
Add a small touch of black eyeliner towards the outer 1/3 of the eyelid.
Blend the darker eyeshadow to create a smokey effect.

, Since Emo make up is typically dark and heavy, make sure to get a lot of black makeup.


For eyeliner, get a black eyeliner pencil.
Apply black eyeliner on the lash line.
Extend the eyeliner a little bit on both sides of the eye and inner and outer corner to create a 2-way jacketed effect.
Thicken the eyeliner. Go over the eyeliner again until you are satisfied with it.
Make sure the eyeliner ends meet up at the corners of your eyes. On the outside, the effect should be somewhat catlike, with the line slanting upwards towards your temples.

, You can do this using a sponge applicator.


Define the edges of the eyeliner with a liquid eyeliner for a smooth effect.
You can also add a coloured eyeliner here if you want to add some more vibrancy. Repeat the eyeliner application on your top lashes.
Try to keep the eyeliner consistently smooth on both the top and bottom lash lines.

, Remember, the eyes are the focus of the Emo look, so it is important to emphasize the eyelashes.


Take care not to smudge mascara onto the eyelid when applying.
Some people apply mascara to their lower lashes, too. Take care when doing this as it can smudge easily.
For a more dramatic effect, use false eyelashes. Use these carefully as applying eyelash glue can be challenging and you are working close to your eye.

, You want to focus to be on your eyes so don't overdo it with the lips.


Be sure to use a lip moisturizer such as lip balm. This helps your look to not wear away as fast, so you don't have to re-applicate it often.
Avoid dark or bright colors on the lips, as that is more a trend with Gothic style makeup.
A light lip color in a slightly pink or natural shade is best for the Emo style.
Lip liner isn't typically used in this type of look.

The best way to ask...is to show them!,

If you don't want it as long as in the picture...or you want the bangs to the left instead of the right or something, make sure you specify that.;
, The basic emo haircut is just long hair cut in layers that are long on the bottom, and as you go up, shorter. Of course, this is optional, like all others, but you need at least a few of these to have emo hair. A traditional hairdresser may strongly advise you to go for less layers because it will become more ""poofy"" but that's kind of the point.

, It's supposed to 'hide your tears', but most just think it looks cool. Its also a great place to dye your hair.

Apply foundation or concealer sparingly.,
Apply stick eyeliner.,
Use eyeshadow sparingly.,
Apply mascara to the upper lash line.",How to Do Emo Makeup2," Only use enough foundation or concealer to hide imperfections. Don't make it look obviously done. Emo makeup on boys is usually a bit more subtle than on girls.

Straighten your hair.,
Get a haircut with jagged ends.,
Dye your hair black.,
Get side bangs.,
Highlight your hair.",How to Be Emo at a School with Uniforms1," This is a simple thing you can do that most likely won’t be against your school’s rules. Emo people typically have super straight hair. Pull up the top half of your hair and put it in a bun. Then, start on the bottom half of your hair. Simply clamp the flat iron over sections of hair, moving from the bottom to top half, until all of your hair has been straightened.The hair can be completely flat and straight all the way around, or you could tease the top of your hair. Go with whichever style makes you feel the most confident.
Use a heat protectant spray so that you don’t end up with damaged hair.;
, A lot of emo people like to cut their own hair, but it doesn’t make you any less emo if you decide going to a stylist is best for you. If you decide to cut your own hair, use a razor cutter. Make the ends of your hair appear jagged. Start with the tips of your hair so you haven’t made too much of a mistake if you mess up.Start by cutting your ends jaggedly, then move to your bangs (if you have them) and sides of your hair.
Be really careful when using a razor cutter. Either put one mirror in front of you one behind you while you cut, or have someone cut the back of your hair for you.

, It isn’t in the emo rulebook that you have to have black hair. Of course, there isn’t a rule book at all. You can have any color that you like. Black hair is just a popular emo color. You can dye your hair at home, or have it done by a stylist.Keep in mind that it’s pretty difficult to come back from black hair. For example, it would be a very long process to get to blonde from black.
It might be a good idea to ask for your parents’ permission first before dying your hair—especially if they’re pretty strict.

, Bangs are part of the typical emo style. The bangs aren’t the typical blunt bangs though. Instead, they should be side bangs that pretty much cover half of your face. If you can’t see out of one eye, you’re doing it right.


Having trouble seeing through your bangs may be a problem during class. Pin them back with cute, colorful hairclips.

, Get creative with your hair by putting a few streaks through it. Streaks around your bangs are the best place for emo-style hair. Choose to have a few platinum blonde streaks. Or, go with hot pink, blue, or fiery red highlights. Just be sure your school doesn’t have a rule against unnaturally colored hair, or all that work on a cool style could go to waste. "

Take time for yourself.",How to Be Emo in Middle School," Before you can become emo, you have to understand exactly what it means. “Emo” is short for emotive, and people who consider themselves to be emo are usually in touch with their emotions. They don’t feel the need to hide how they feel, even when they are sad or angry.While music, clothing, hair, and makeup can play a large role in being emo, being comfortable with your feelings and expressing them is the most important part.
If you’re emo, you never feel the need to pretend that you’re feeling something that you’re not. For example, if an emo person is sad, they won’t try to convince everyone around them that they’re actually happy. They express the true emotions that they’re feeling.;
, Music is very important to emo culture, so it’s important to know the right bands if you want to fit in. Emo music started out as a subgenre of punk , and the “emo” name is actually shortened from “emotive hardcore punk.” The music originally featured a fast sound and shouted vocals, though it’s evolved to also include a softer, more melodic sound. The common trait in emo music, though, is always emotional lyrics.Some early emo bands that helps establish the genre in the mid-80s include Rites of Spring, Embrace and Dag Nasty.
In the ‘90s, emo music experience a revival with bands such as Texas Is The Reason, Sunny Day Real Estate, Jawbreaker, American Football, and Braid.
In the 2000s, emo pop was born pioneered by bands like Jimmy Eat World,The Get Up Kids and The Promise Ring. Later, other bands like My Chemical Romance, Paramore, Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco became part of the fusion genre. Most of these bands have moved away from their emo pop rootsso listen to their early work if you're looking for this particular style. Bear in mind this is what's known as emo today when really, emo refers to the emotive hardcore sub-genre. Emo pop is a fusion of emo and pop punk.

, You shouldn’t decide to become emo just because all of your friends are. Instead, think about whether the culture really fits with your personality and interests. If you’re not comfortable acknowledging and expressing your emotions, including darker feelings such as depression and anger, then it’s probably not the right fit for you. Don’t try to force yourself to become emo just because you think it will make make you cool.If you prefer lighter, more “feel good” music, the emo scene may not be right for you either. You shouldn’t have to talk yourself into liking the harder edge of emo music.
If the emo culture does seem like a perfect fit for you, you shouldn’t worry if your friends are emo too. Be true to yourself, and your real friends will respect your choices and interests.

, While the emo look does sometimes include pops of bright colors, it is usually made up mainly of dark shades. Black is an obvious choice, but your parents may not want you to wear head to toe black. Instead, work some other dark colors, such as navy, eggplant, and forest green, into your wardrobe to go along with black.If your parents don’t want to buy dark clothing for you and encourage you to wear light and bright shades, try to compromise with them. Ask them if you can buy black and other dark colored clothing if you earn the money for them yourself. You might babysit, mow lawns, or do extra chores around the house to make the money you need.
While black and other dark shades are the main color palette for emo clothing, you can work some small bits of bright color into your look. For example, you might wear a black tee shirt that features artwork with some red and white touches, or you might add a bright blue studded bracelet to an otherwise dark outfit.

, Loose clothing is a big no-no in emo fashion, so sweatpants and baggy jeans aren’t the best option if you want to dress emo. Instead, both girls and guys should opt for skinny jeans that fit closely to the body. Girls can also go with slim-fitting skirts, and pair them with dark tights or leggings underneath.It’s best to choose black or dark denim skinny jeans to fit the emo look.
Skinny jeans that feature rips, tears, or studs are perfect when you want to dress emo.
If you aren’t comfortable in skinny jeans, you can swap them for straight leg jeans that are a little looser. Just be sure to avoid baggy jeans that you constantly need to pull up because they won’t fit the look at all.

, Another common trend in emo fashion is dressing in layers. In most cases, that means wearing a tee shirt under a hoodie. Just make sure that the tee and hoodie are both slim-fitting, so you don’t look so bulky. You can also swap the hoodie for a denim or leather jacket or layer a short-sleeve tee over a tight long-sleeve tee to mix up your look.Vintage band tees make great layering pieces under hoodies and other jackets.
Solid hoodies in dark colors work well for an emo outfit, but you can also opt for patterned jackets. Skulls, stripes, stars, and checkerboard designs are all ideal emo patterns.

, For an authentic emo look, forget about wearing any shoes with a high heel. Instead, wear flat shoes -- that can be any flat tennis shoes, boots, or slip-on shoes that you are comfortable in. However, the most common type of flat shoes in emo fashion are Converse or Vans style tennis shoes.You can’t go wrong with black shoes when you’re going for an emo look, but you can also go for a colored pair in shade such as red or purple. Patterned tennis shoes also work in emo fashion -- try a checkered or striped design.

, Just as with your clothing, you should avoid bright or light colors when it comes to your nail polish. Black is the obvious choice, but if that feels too extreme for you, you can go with navy blue or even a dark red. Emo guys should feel free to wear dark polish if they’re comfortable with it too.Complement your dark nail polish by keeping your nails short and square-shaped.
Don’t worry if your nail polish gets a little chipped. That actually works with the emo look.

, Another staple of the emo look is a heavy, dark eye makeup. You can achieve the look by applying a lot of black eyeliner -- use a pencil to line your upper and lower lashlines and then use a cotton swab to smudge it slightly. Finish off with a couple of coats of mascara to make your eyes look a little more dramatic.Make sure that you have your parents’ permission to use makeup before you start wearing eyeliner, mascara, or any other cosmetics.
Even if your parents allow you to wear makeup, you should check your school’s dress code to make sure that you can wear eyeliner and mascara to class.

, While there isn’t any one specific emo hairstyle, strong bangs are a common feature. In most cases, they’re a long side-swept style that fall over one eye. Your bangs should have a shaggy look too, so they move easily when you’re dancing to your favorite emo band.In addition to bangs, most emo haircuts also features layers.
To make sure you get the right style when you go to get your haircut, bring a couple of photos of emo hairstyles that you like to show your stylist. That way, you’ll know that they understand exactly what you want.

, While the clothing, accessories, and makeup are usually dark, one place that bold color does often show up in the emo look is the hair. Streaks of bright pink, purple, blue, and green in your hair can give you the perfect emo look. Your parents probably won’t want you to permanently dye your hair, though, so ask them if you can use temporary dye to add a few streaks. Temporary dyes eventually wash out, but the length of time that it takes depends on the product.If your parents are uncomfortable with the idea of you temporarily dying your hair during the school year, you may want to ask if you can do it during your summer vacation or another extended break from classes.
If you parent are still reluctant to allow you to use even temporary dye, you can purchase clip-in hair extensions in bright colors so you can put in some bold streaks for day and easily remove them.

, In order to become emo, you have to become aware of your emotions so you’re able to recognize them. Throughout the day, ask yourself how you’re feeling. For example, you might tell yourself, I’m angry, after you have a fight with your friend, or I’m sad, after you don’t do well on a test. Name your emotions as you experience them, and allow yourself to fully feel them.It’s also important to notice the intensity of your emotions. For example, you might be annoyed after a friend is late to meet you, mad when your sibling calls you names, and fuming when someone at school spreads a false rumor about you. Try to identify the full range of emotions that you feel from day to day.
If you’re having trouble getting in touch with your emotions, it might help to keep a journal. At the end of each day, jot down the emotions that you felt and what caused them, so you can start to understand them better.

, When you’re emo, acknowledging your feelings doesn’t just mean crying when you’re sad or yelling when you’re angry. Try to find a creative outlet to express your emotions. Depending on your interests and talents, that might mean writing, drawing, painting, singing, or dancing. Find the most satisfying way to express how you feel, and do it regularly.If you want to use writing as a way to express your feelings, try your hand at writing poetry, short stories, and even songs.
If you want to use art to express your feelings, draw or paint a scene that makes your emotions visual.
If you enjoy singing and dancing, you can use the music of your favorite emo bands for inspiration.

, Emo teens tend to be introverted, which means they are drained by social interactions with other people. If you feel that way, it’s important to spend time by yourself so you can build your energy back up. Spending time alone also gives you more time to get in touch with your emotions and engage in creative pursuits, such as writing and drawing, that allow you to express your feelings. Don’t be afraid to tell your friends that you don’t feel like hanging out, or asking your parents if you can skip out on family TV night to spend time alone in your room.While some time for yourself is good for you, don’t assume that you should spend all of your time alone just because you’re emo and introverted. Spend time with friends and family who you’re comfortable sharing your feelings with when you feel up to it.

Mix and match your clothing styles.,
Experiment with color combinations.,
Own several different kinds of zip-hoodies.,
Try out different hair colors.",How to Be Emo and Scene1," Emo and scene are quite different in terms of dress - emo clothes tend to be dark colors, such as black or red, and tight-fitting.Scene clothing consists of bright colored t-shirts, tight neon-colored jeans and bold accessories. Emo clothing tends to be minimal in prints, and if the shirt does have a print, it’s usually a band's logo or album. Scene clothing is extremely flashy and usually features bold prints.Decide which type of clothing you want to wear, and try mixing and matching the different styles.
Wear a top that’s emo with bottoms that are scene and vice versa.;
, Emos’ wardrobes are almost exclusively limited to black and dark colors. In general, they aren’t trying to stand out. For scene kids, the opposite is true – they like to wear head-to-toe neon and tons of accessories. The goal is to be noticed. If you mix up your color combinations, you can fit into both crowds.Scene kids love bright, flashy colors – you can wear neon shirts, shoes and accessories with a pair of black drainpipes and fit into both groups comfortably.
Consider doing the opposite, as well – getting a few pairs of neon drainpipes to wear with black shirts, shoes and accessories.

, Both scenes wear a lot of zip-hoodies. Emos consider dark colored zip-hoodies to be a crucial clothing item. Often these garments are plain, but occasionally they will feature graphic icons that are characteristic of emo fashion – bleeding hearts, skulls, ribs, stars and broken hearts.Naturally, the scene kids gravitate toward eye-catching neon versions of the zip-hoodie that feature loud graphics and bright prints that repeat, such as stripes or checkers.


Have a few in each style and alternate them.Look for versions that straddle both tastes. You could also get neon zip-hoodies and screen-print them yourself with emo icons like skulls and stars.

, Hairstyles from both cultures are very similar, with the major differences being in the colors. The common hairstyle features a long fringe (bangs) brushed over to one side of the head, covering one or both eyes.Emos usually have their hair dyed jet black and style their hair to be straight and smooth. Occasionally a few bleached blonde stripes are dyed in. Scene hairstyles are very similar, except they dye theirs in all colors of the rainbow and backcomb it to look much bigger and fluffier.Consider merging the concepts – style your hair in an exaggerated scene way, but dye it all black.
Conversely, you could style your hair to be emo-smooth and straight, but dye it bright colors.
You could also keep your emo cut and dark color, but dye in a streak or two of bright color. You could make the streaks wider than what's usual for the emo look, so that the style definitely has both an emo and scene vibe.
If you need to get the basic haircut, ask your stylist for choppy layers and side bangs. Bring in a picture so that what you want is very clear.

Express yourself.,
Be spontaneous.,
Repeat movements.,
Move faster.",How to Dance Emo1," Emo, which is short for “emotional” is considered a lifestyle and way of dress. It stems from emo music, a less angry version of punk rock music with emotional lyrics. Makers and listeners of this type of music use it to express their feelings. Lyrics usually convey non-metaphorical messages about happiness, sadness, depression, death, anger and despair.Lovers of emo music maintain that it is difficult to define because it’s ambiguous. Popular “emo-esque” bands such as the Sex Pistols use heavy punk chords, while emo bands such as the Cure, have more melodic elements. Emo bands run the gamut with the common element being an expression of pure raw emotion. Sometimes emotions are expressed with gut-wrenching screams, yelling, crying and even sobbing. There is a bit of confusion about exactly what is classified as emo. Music with lyrics that discuss crying because of despair are labeled emo. Metaphoric lyrics and lyrics that leave the listener wondering exactly what is being expressed are not considered emo. Emo music expresses feelings straightforwardly and sometimes explicitly. Often, the lyrics are confessional. Some popular emo bands include Fugazi, Texas Is the Reason, Suicidal Tendencies, Cat Power, Further Seems Forever, The Promise Ring, Benton Falls and Army of Ponch.Emo bands often can be heard live. Some bands travel here and there -- usually on a very low budget. As part of the emo culture,commercialism is highly frowned upon. Live “emo shows” are very cheap -- usually around $5 or less. Technology also is somewhat frowned upon. Recordings of emo music tend to be low budget, and copies of the music tend to be analog or sold on outdated media. True to the non-commercialism ideals emo bands sell their music very cheaply around $5 or so, and most bands do not sell t-shirts.
Live emo bands often play with their backs to the audience during the slow parts of the song. Then they explode by screaming and jumping around during the faster-paced parts, usually knocking things over as they go. These antics obviously have an affect on the audience as the audience responds in dance. ;
, The basis of emo is that you can express yourself in whatever way you wish through dance. Really feel the music, and then move in whatever way your body wants. “Freestyling” is spontaneous by nature, so nothing needs to be well-thought out, planned, or choreographed. Just move. If you are having trouble “letting go” so that you can move spontaneously, let the music drive you. In “emo dance” quick jerky shoulder, leg and arm movements are common. So, if your movements seem off-beat or spastic, don’t worry about it.Think about your frustration or angst. Stop for a moment and tune everything out but the music. Think about all you’ve endured and move your body. It’s better if you don’t let your mind get in the way and think too much.
You may incorporate some elements of slam dancing and moshing. What most people think of as hard-core violent slam dancing, as its name implies, doesn’t really occur in emo dancing. Some would say that slam dancing shouldn’t be violent at all. Back in the 70s and 80s when it was created, slam dancing was basically jumping around without doing any real dance moves. It was never purposely violent.”Mosh” in the pit. ”Moshing” is the new term for slam dancing, but it’s actually different. Slam dancing is jumping around. Moshing is dancing and jumping aggressively in a tightly-packed group of people at a live event. Since people are so close together, bumping into other people is inevitable. “Moshing” to emo music is generally less dramatic than at heavy metal and traditional punk rock concerts., Once you started dancing, repeat the movements. It’s not necessary to switch dance steps or movements. Freestyling is often awkward and repetitive. As you begin to feel the music and move, if you find yourself rocking back-and-forth or jumping on your toes -- common “emo dance” movements -- keep going. Think of your movements as an expression of your feelings. It’s kind of the way that a child might scribble on a page without staying in the lines -- back and forth. The back-and-forth movements are an expression of the child’s energy and emotions whether sad or happy.For you, your entire body is a tool to create those gestural, often rapid repetitive movements that are generated by emotion. These movements should be carefree, expressive and intense. So, keep doing it until you feel like doing something else.Point your index fingers. Emo dancing often involves finger pointing -- both at yourself and others.
Don’t feel that you have to limit yourself to standing up or any other position. Since this is freestyle, anything goes -- even laying on the ground and shaking.

, Dance harder. In emo, the more you feel the music, the faster you should be moving and the harder your movements should be. So, if you’re feeling it, let those emotions transmit through the body. Bob your head faster on beat with the music -- or not. Bounce higher on your toes as the music moves you. Throw your elbows. "

Apply dark eyeliner.,
Wear bright eye shadow.,
Put on black mascara.,
Use a pale lip color.,
Choose a matte foundation.",How to Be Emo at a School with Uniforms2," Usually, when people think emo, they think a lot of black eyeliner. Yeah, you can go against the stereotype, but you could also choose to rock it. Take an eye pencil or liquid eyeliner and go all the way around your eyes. You could also go for a cat-eye if you’re feeling it that day.It’s common for emo men to apply eyeliner—just make sure it’s not against school rules.
It’s also an option to line your top lid with black eyeliner and your bottom lid with neon eyeliner.

, Just because your hair and eyeliner are dark, doesn’t mean that your eye shadow has to be! First, apply a layer of pearl, silver, or light beige eye shadow to all over your eyelids. Then, go with a pink, green, orange, or blue eye shadow. You can also stay on the dark side if you want. If so, use a shade of plum, black, or navy., You can wear black mascara no matter what your gender is. One part of the beauty of being emo is that makeup is encouraged for all. Apply a couple of layers of mascara. Make it as thick as you want. You can finish with an eyelash curler if you want to., All of the attention should be on your beautiful and heavily lined eyes. Apply a pale or nude lipstick. Or, to make it easy, leave your lips bare., A matte look is really popular in emo style. Use a sponge to apply a powder or liquid foundation to your face. If you feel like you’re looking a little too pale, you can use apply a little bit of a light blush to your cheeks."
"
Make slight adjustments to the basic uniform.,
Wear a studded belt.,
Put on several rubber or bangle bracelets.,
Decorate your backpack.,
Wear glasses with thick rims.",How to Be Emo at a School with Uniforms3," Yeah, you have a uniform, but unless your school is really, really strict, that doesn’t mean you can’t slightly alter it to your liking. If you wear a polo, wear a feminine cut or tight polo. Wear skinny pants instead of regular or loose fit pants. Put on Converse, Vans, or skate shoes if the type of shoes you’re supposed to wear isn’t specified in the dress code., Studded belts are a pretty easy way to declare your style. They can be found at stores like Hot Topic. If you can’t wear a studded belt, look for a belt with a big buckle. Wear two belts if you want to take it to the next level., Wear a few bracelets, or enough to cover almost half of your arm. Just be sure you don’t wear so many that your arm feels five pounds heavier! Bangle or multi-colored rubber bracelets are great. You can also wear wristbands with your favorite brand, band, or movie logos., Whether you carry a traditional backpack or messenger bag, don’t be afraid to decorate it so that it reflects your interests. Pierce it with safety pins. Find patches that show off your favorite bands, movies, and books. This is also a good way to attract like-minded people., If you wear glasses, consider updating your frames to show off your style. Black, thick-rimmed glasses would be a good way to go. You could also choose horn-rimmed glasses. Even if you don’t need to wear glasses, you could find a pair of frames that don’t have a prescription."
"
Listen to emo music.,
Be upfront about your emotions.,
Think deeply.,
Get in touch with your artistic style.",How to Be Emo at a School with Uniforms4," Unfortunately, you can’t blare your music for everyone to hear during class, but it doesn’t hurt to listen to emo music during breaks between classes. Armor for Sleep, Comeback Kid, My Chemical Romance, and Coheed and Cambria are some examples of emo music. Find other students that like the same music. You can show off your musical taste through your accessories without saying a word.More bands include Mallory Knox, Lower Than Atlantis and of Mice and Men.

, You don’t have to be depressed or sad to be emo. Being emo means that you’re not afraid to show your emotions. It means that you are open to vulnerability. This can be kind of difficult when you’re a kid or teenager, but don’t listen to the bullies. Being upfront with your emotions actually shows that you’re mature, and of course, emo.It’s great to show your emotions, but that doesn’t mean you have to display them dramatically. Just show and tell people how you’re feeling.

, No one (hopefully) can read your thoughts, but deep thinkers are noticeable to other people. To be able to show your emotions, it’s important to think about them first. Thinking deeply will often make you seem like a quiet person (which is a very emo trait), but it will also make you seem even more interesting when you speak., Emo people are often really creative. It’s completely fine if you aren’t the creative type, but don’t be afraid to indulge in your art form if you are. Write poetry, create music, paint, or draw anime characters. Get as deep and dark as you want."
"
Listen to the music of both scenes.,
Investigate music that merges the two styles.,
Represent both musical styles openly.",How to Be Emo and Scene2," Both groups put a lot of emphasis on music, but for emos it’s a way of life. Since music is important to both, if you want to be both emo and scene, you’ll need to listen to music from both sides. Emo music is loud, emotional, guitar-centric and often angsty.Scene music is pulled from the genres of electro-pop, dubstep, dance-pop, and house/techno.


Popular emo bands are Rites of Spring, My Chemical Romance, Get Up Kids, I Would Set Myself on Fire for You, Saetia, Embrace, Moss Icon, Sunny Day Real Estate, Drive Like Jehu, Fugazi, Jawbreaker, Dashboard Confessional, Jimmy Eat World, The Promise Ring, Brand New, Hawthorne Heights, Black Veil Brides, Bring Me The Horizon and Fall Out Boy.Popular scene bands are Millionaires, Blood on the Dancefloor, Breathe Carolina Master of Death, 1800 Zombie, J Bigga, Owl City, Family Force 5, Brokencyde, Scene Kidz, Dot Dot Curve, Skrillex, Knife Party, deadmau5 and Jeffree Star.

, Look for bands that feature the guitar-centric and emotional sounds of emo music while also including some of the electronic and pop elements championed by scene kids. There are plenty of bands that fall neatly into one genre or the other, but there are definitely groups out there that straddle the line between the two.


Both cultures seem to be embracing bands that have elements of pop and punk in their music. Some examples are: State Champs, Sleeping With Sirens, We Are The In Crowd, and Against The Current.You may have to do a little digging and exploring to discover these new bands, but that’s part of the fun.

, Because music is so important to these subcultures (especially emo culture), you will have to openly like both kinds of music to fit into either camp. Wear band t-shirts that feature names from both sides. Attend concerts that are both emo and scene. “Like” the different bands on Facebook and follow them on other social media.


When you’re in the car with friends, alternate the genres. Make some mixes that feature both styles equally.
Defend bands on both sides if provoked or asked to choose.

"
"
Vary your moods.,
Make friends in both circles.,
Have an online presence recognized by both sides.",How to Be Emo and Scene3," Scene kids place emphasis on socializing, partying and generally having a good time. On the other hand, emos are very introverted and emotional. If you want to be both, you’ll need to heavily vary your moods so that you will fit the characteristics of each side.


If you tend toward being more emo, work to balance it out by being friendlier and more outgoing.
If you are more on the scene side, learn how to tone done your personality occasionally. Practice introspection and spend some time alone every now and then.

, Emos tend to hang out with other emos exclusively. The same goes for scene kids – they usually stay with their own crowd. There’s no rule that you have to do that! Make friends with people that are in both cliques.


Don’t spend too much time with one or the other.
Try to divide your time equally between the two and enjoy the activities and conversation on both sides.

, An online personality is an important part of scene culture, especially via social media and networking platforms. They document their daily activities publicly, usually in great detail. Profile images of scene kids are usually highly stylized and frequently posted. Emos have a social media presence, but it’s usually more understated and often focuses on music. They like to post music videos and quote song lyrics in their status updates.You’ll need to alternate representing one side or the other, or mix it up so that you fit in with both.
Post music videos of both emo and scene bands.
Make sure your profile images are ambiguous – no one should be able to easily place you into one camp or the other, because you’ll be sporting the hairstyles and clothing styles of both.

Clasp your hands together.,
Lean forward and bounce on the balls of your feet.,
Move your torso up and down.",How to Dance Emo2," Either you can interlock your fingers together or you can clasp them together by forming the fingers in each hand into a claw shape and then cupping them together. Traditionally, this described as a hand gesture that people make when they are nervous or anxious., You don’t need to bounce in any particular way. Just shift your weight to the balls of your feet and bounce up and down. Do this the same way that you would tap your knee or foot when you like a certain music and your body seems to automatically respond. Same here: bounce.


Remember that you should be feeling the music and moving in a carefree manner as you move in true emo fashion.

, If you have already leaned forward, move your torso back. Then, move it forward again, and continue to repeat this motion. The movement should be done energetically and intensely -- not without emotion or feeling. Some people appear to rocking back-and-forth almost violently when they do this."
"
Start to bounce to the music.,
Bend your elbows so that your arm forms an L-shape.,
Point your fingers.",How to Dance Emo3," Bend your knees a bit, but shift your weight to the balls of your feet. Let the energy flow from your feet and explode out as you bounce up and down. In other words, this should be an energetic bounce, not a calm and casual bounce., Or, you can bend the arm even closer to the body so that the arms makes the shape of a triangle. Swing your arms with energy and gusto to the beat. This can be in tempo with your bounce, but it can also be off-beat and to its own separate tempo. In other words, the two movements don’t need to be in sync with each other. It can be wild and chaotic., With your index finger, start to point at yourself or point outwardly away from the body. Repeat the movement. Keep pointing as you bounce and swing your arms. Increase the pace, and point more rapidly and energetically. The more you are feeling the music, the more enthusiastic and quick-paced the pointing should be."

""Emo hair"" usually refers to a particular layered haircut in which long bangs are swept and styled to one side, usually held in place with mousse. Emo hair is usually dark or dyed, sometimes featuring a bright highlight of blonde or other punky colors.


To get emo hair, start growing out your bangs, but still getting clean-up cuts on the back of your neck. Pull the bangs over evenly across above your eyebrow and use mousse or hair gel.;
, Featuring Rivers Cuomo-style cardigans and horn-rimmed glasses, this look popularized emo in the mid-90s as it ascended toward the mainstream. It's basically a cool-looking smart-kid look. To cultivate this look, you'll need:


Thick or horned rimmed glassesMessenger bagsStudded belts
Skinny jeans, in dark colours
Eyeliner
Plaid patterned or black band shirts of your favourite bands (do not wear band shirts of bands you don't listen to or have never heard of).
Converse or VansBlack wrist or sweat bands
Leg and warm warmers
Dresses and skirts, usually paired with striped tights
Fingerless gloves, usually checkered in colours like red, pink and purple, The genre that rose in the mid-2000s brought with it a patented hairstyle and way of dressing. Mostly in black. To rock this look, you'll need:

V-Neck black or white t-shirts
Skate shoes, like Vans or Airwalks
A swooped-bang hair cut, typically dyed black with some bright highlight
A mouth piercing
A studded or white belt
Your keys on a carabiner

, Style is largely similar for both male and female emo kids. The haircuts, dress and use of make-up tend to cross the sexes, resulting in a distinctive and androgynous look.


If you wear eyeliner, it should be preferably thin and trace your eyes. Take it easy on the make-up. Dark colored lipstick is also common for girls.

, Nearly all emo styles involve in some way or another the best old-friend of the wardrobe: the hooded sweatshirt. It's possible to give that hoodie a distinctively emo flair, however, which doesn't need to take more than a little extra effort to pull off. Most emo hoodies will be black, sometimes featuring band patches or a small amount of white trim.


Cut a hole for your thumbs in the sleeves of your hoodies. Wear it with your thumbs sticking through to keep yourself warm in the winter months.

Contrary to popular belief, emo stands for ""emotive hardcore punk"" and is a sub-genre of hardcore punkand post-hardcore. The term was first said to be used Flipsize magazine with Ian Mackaye.describes hardcore punk bands in the DC area that wrote more confessional, self-questioning and personal lyricsthan more traditional hardcore punk bands. Influenced by pioneering hardcore bands Minor Threat and Black Flag, bands like Rites of Spring and Beefeater both wrote confessional and personal lyrics in their hardcore punk songs that led to the coining of the term ""emotional hardcore"" and eventually ""emo"". However, emo was also an insult given to these bands and their fans. Punks who stayed true to the scene used to go to emo shows and shout insults at the bands. So, originally, emo was a fairly small local scene in the DC area that gained some attention.

Check out the roots of the emo tree.
Revolution Summer 1985. An attempt deliberately sought by bands like Gray Matter, Beefeater, Dag Nasty and Soulside to break the limitations of hardcore punk in favor for a fresh idea of creativity.In the early 90s, bands like Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate began flying the emo flag, except these bands sound basically nothing like early DC emo. Influenced by California pop punk and indie rock, these bands have big catchy hooks and personal lyrics, writing songs with sweeping structures and loads of melodrama.
Recognize more recent developments in the sounds of emo. Emo broke out huge in the 2000s, with Jimmy Eat World's The Middle and Victory Records bands like Taking Back Sunday, Thursday and The Used, patenting a particular brand of ""screamo"" music that returned somewhat to emo's hardcore roots. It was big, loud and extremely popular.

,

This can help you identify which type of emo music you'll enjoy. If you hate one style of emo, try others. Here are some genres:

Emocore: Short for emotional or emotive hardcore, emocore is a subgenre of hardcore punk from the 1980s. It began in Washington DC with bands like Rites of Spring and Embrace. It blended punk with emotional lyrical content.
Indie emo: Indie emo began in the 1990s when emo changed its roots and broadened from just punk rock. These emo bands are more indie than punk. Bands include Dashboard Confessional, Further Seems Forever, Sunny Day Real Estate and Mineral.
Emo pop: Emo pop began in the 1990s during emo's regeneration and blends emo with pop punk. Bands include The Get Up Kids, Fall Out Boy, Jimmy Eat World, Paramore and The Starting Line. Emo pop is what most emos listen to, and there's nothing wrong with it. But a term that would be more relevant to them is ""emo pop"" rather than ""emo"" (because they are two different genres).
Screamo: Screamo is a subgenre of emocore that derives from hardcorewhich involves screaming and usually fast tempos, loud-soft dynamics and sometimes unconventional song structures. Bands include The Saddest Landscape and Orchid and the first record to be considered ""screamo"" is Tin Cans with Strings to You by Far. A lot of screamo bands also played ballads. An example of this would be the last song on the record, named Sorrow's EndScreamo is not metal, and doesn't have metal instrumental so make sure not to get confused on this! (see: tips)

,

From Thursday to Jimmy Eat World, Weezer to Brand New, Empire! Empire! (I Was a Lonely Estate)to Paramore, all people who identify as emo have an active and passionate interest in emo music. Test out different bands to see what you like. If you like what you hear, keep exploring sub-genres like screamo and emocore to see what you like best. If you don't like the music, that's okay too. You can still express your emotions through fashion and lifestyle. Here is a short, incomplete and imperfect primer on some emo bands to get started. You might not like these and still be a passionate emo listener. That's alright. If you want to get a foot in the door, check out:

, Some other subcultures that get confused with emo are scene and goth.

Emo is a subculture that is based around music. It has a longer history than scene and deals with emotions, self-expression and self-exploration. Being emo means you understand your roots, listen to emo music and participate in the community.
Scene is a subculture which emerged from members of the chav subculture in England experimenting with alternative fashions.Scene is a mixture of several styles including emo, indie pop, rave and punk fashions.Scenes tend to wear brighter colours, and have teased/back combed hair which may feature ""cool tails"". Scene kids tend to listen to music genres like metalcore, deathcore and crunk coreopposed to emo kids who listen to emo genres.
A subculture which emerged from the British post-punk scene in the late 70s / early 80s. Goths primarily listen to goth rock, cold wave, deathrock and darkwave music. Bela Lugosi's Dead, the 1979 single by Bauhaus was said to be the birth of the music genre, and the Batcave, a nightclub opened in 1982, the birth of the subculture.

, Generally speaking, all emo music has two things in common: big, sweeping, extremely melodramatic guitar-based music, either aggressive and harsh or acoustic and gentle, that contain confessional or explicitly personal lyrics, often about heartbreak and loneliness. The Used doesn't sound much like Death Cab for Cutie which doesn't sound anything like Jawbreaker. So what? They're all emo bands. Pick the sounds you like and don't listen to what you don't like.


If you want to dress emo and listen to Sunny Day Real Estate, go for it. If you also have Lady Gaga, Johnny Cash, and Cannibal Ox on your iPod, that doesn't make you any less emo. A real ""emo"" is someone who listens to emotive hardcore music and genres surrounding it, so as long as you're into emo, you are emo.
While a guy with dark hair and guyliner listening to Dashboard Confessional in Columbus, OH might be considered emo by a lot of people, the California blonde who surfs and listens to Dashboard Confessional might consider herself emo as well. Treat this as an opportunity for everyone to appreciate the music as appearance doesn't matter.

, For tips about music, definitions of ""emo,"" and fashion, check out the guys and gals making the music for advice. See who they listen to, who they're influenced by, what they read, and what they recommend. Learn straight from the source.

, Originally, emo was a small local scene that attracted national attention. In this way, a movement started that's now global. Get back in touch with that original impulse by hanging around the local shows in your own backyard. It's one thing to go to the Warped Tour and check out the national bands you hear, but it's another to check out and support local emo bands who are trying to get started.


Volunteer to help out at all-ages shows and DIY clubs to put on gigs. Hand out fliers and befriend other bands. Check out local zines and participate in the scene.

, In general, the emo subculture values the arts. Painting, making music, writing, and expressing yourself creatively are all important ways to participate in the emo subculture. Find a way to express yourself and devote your free time to perfecting your art. Write poetry and turn your words into songs. Write reviews of emo music and start a music blog.

, Being able to play music by yourself or in a band would give you huge credibility and would be a fun way to engage with emo more directly. Start writing your own songs and playing your own music and you'll be actively participating in the creative culture.


Try playing the bass or guitar, or perhaps even the violin, which sounds amazing in emo songs if you invest enough time in it. The drums might also be a very good instrument, because drummers are in regular demand for all sorts of bands.

, Emo is a subculture that prides itself on self-exploration, intelligence, and feeling.Start reading up on contemporary and classic emo novels and books:

, Research is one of the most important things you could ever do when trying to learn about something, especially about something as controversial as ""emo"" (which shouldn't be controversial at all). The first mistake a lot of people trying to get into subcultures do is not research the term and go off mainstream media definitions and what their friends say. This is your chance to find out completely what emo is, through reliable resources. Some basic facts about emo are:

Emo stands for ""emotive hardcore punk"" and it's out growth of hardcore punkand post-hardcorewhich originated out of Washington D.C in the mid 80s.
Emo was a reaction to the heightened violence in the hardcore punk scene, as the music had strayed from the original topic of politics and rebellion.The first emo band is considered to be Rites of Spring, even though they reject the term, and second, Embrace (US). In 1984, Guy Picciotto, who was a Minor Threat fan, formed Rites of Spring and broke free of hardcore's self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and deeply personal, impassioned lyrics creating ""emo"".Emo was originally an insult given to people who listened to this type of music.People who stayed true to the hardcore punk scene used to go to show and scream insults at the so called ""emo"" bands.

, Listening to emo music is one of the most important things of enjoying and being involved in emo culture, so without it, you cannot be considered ""emo"" as the music ties everyone together. Throughout the decades, emo has been reinvented several times, so here are a list of bands that are considered ""emo"":

, If you were to primarily listen to emotive hardcore then you would be an old school emo. If you were into indie emo, you would be a 90s emo and if you were more into emo pop punk then you would be considered emo pop, which technically isn't a genre of emo as it combines emo and pop punk, making it something different. This is why it's important to understand where emo came from and what's truly emo. Screamo is a subgenre of emo that emerged in the early 90s, that was pioneered by San Diego bands like Heroin and Antioch Arrow but developed further by East Coast U.S bands like Pg.99 and Orchid. Lyrical themes usually include emotional pain, romantic interest, politics, and human rights, which differ slightly to emo lyrical themes.,

Don't buy an off the rack complete emo outfit straight away, ease into the fashion by buying single garments. Characteristics of emo fashion include:

Band shirts (before you buy, make sure you know the band inside out otherwise wearing the band shirt of a band you don't listen to would make you a poseur)
Skinny jeans
Sweat/wrist bands
Eyeliner
Converse or Vans
Hoodies (can feature band logos, too)
Black rimmed glassesStudded beltsPlaid shirts

, This is important because since punk is DIY, it means emo is too, so it's important to show your creativity when putting your outfits together. The statement ""they claim to be individuals yet listen to the same music and dress in the same clothes"" comes about because people have been going to malls and getting all their clothes from chain stores like Hot Topic. There isn't any creativity in that. It just means you and thousands of others have the same outfits, when the idea in a subculture was to take inspiration from your idols instead of directly copying them. Try buying patches of your favourite bands Etsy.com, eBay.com or another creativity website and try sewing them on.,

Make sure what you want to do doesn't clash with the school uniform rules and regulations, but that's only if you go to a school that has one. Emo hair tends to be dyed a dark color, usually black and choppy. Bangs are swept across one eye and straightened.Don't be afraid to dye it different colors; there are thousands of online pictures you can use for inspiration.,

Some people still don't understand what emo is, and continue to poke fun at those who are. People in middle school especially often tease others because they are insecure. If someone bullies you, it's most likely because they are insecure and shouldn't get away with it. Report these people to one of your teachers or someone of higher authority."

Now that you know about emo and scene, make sure you know the difference.,
The music


There are bands like Blood On The Dance Floor, Hollywood Undead, Black Veil Brides, Millionaires, Dot Dot Curve, and BrokenCYDE who are clearly scene, but even if you like these bands, try to explore some other types of music as well, because if you say you only like these it might make you seem like a poser.,

Check out some bands from the late 90's through early 00's. This is when emo music became popular.;
,


It might seem like you already know what scene is all about, but it's good to learn all you can about it!
Scene is not like emo. It is a life style, a fashion, and even sometimes a personality.

,


Emo isn't goth either.

,
Try listening to some bands like Suicide Silence, Bring Me The Horizon, Bullet For My Valentine, The Devil Wears Prada, Skillet, Asking Alexandria, Fall Out boy, Yellowcard, and other bands like that. Those would be considered Screamo, Hardcore, Emocore, or Pop-Punk.

,


Get your hair styled by a professional. Do not do it at home unless you are experienced.
Ask if there is anyone who is good at cutting layers and alternative hair styles, if there isn't then go somewhere else. Hair stylists who just do bland hairstyles will almost never do your hair right.
If someone looks alternative there, ask the front desk if you can see that guy/girl.

, Even though they're emo, emo and scene hairstyles are the same for scene guys without going overboard.
A Faux Hawk hair style is great for a emo guy that doesn't look good with long bangs, or is 17+.
Get your hair cut by a professional. Try to get it done by a girl, guys will try to make your hair more manly looking, and emo hair is quite feminine.
Red and black or blue and black look super scene without trying too hard. Blonde looks great for people that are on the pale side, black looks good for both skin tones. Buy manic panic colors, and streak your hair, those sections you want to dye to be bleached in order for the color to stand out.
Try getting some hair wax or a pomade. Two you'll need : A clean cut look one, and a messy style/bed head one. Use the clean cut one to slick your hair down and then use the messy style for the bangs and the bottom of your hair to show off your edgy style.

, Find a photo you like and get it ready.
Is her hair overly teased? You might want to get a new photo. (Overly teasing your hair makes you look poser like, overly teased hair is when it sticks out more than an inch from your head.)
Rainbow hair is cool, but I suggest only using up to 3 colors in your hair. This doesn't make you go overboard.
Make sure you're bangs aren't covering cover both of her or your eyes.
Blunt bangs are a good way to go but..
Asymmetrical hair styles and side swept bangs look 100% scene. Look up asymmetrical scene hair on Google if you're unsure of what that means.

, This gives your hair the teased look without damaging your hair a lot. This is best for girls with naturally wavy hair. You'll need four things for this hairstyle : A straightener, baby powder or dry shampoo, styling wax or a pomade and Powder Play by Big Sexy Hair. Got2b's messy look is one of my favorite pomades. Straighten your hair, get the pomade/styling wax and put about a penny size drop in your hand. Put it slicked down all your layers, one at a time. Put some baby powder or dry shampoo in your hand and fluff your hair up. Add extensions if you want.
Straight scene hair. This requires less work and is pretty easy to obtain, but will only look scene if you have bleach blonde, black, or bright colored hair. If you have a medium tone blonde to dark brown hair, the first one is for you. What you'll need : Heat protection spray, ( my favorite is guardian angel flat iron balm by got2b) a messy pomade ( my favorite is got2b playful pomade ) and a straightener. Wait about a day till after you wash your hair so your hair can have a natural grease and make it easier to get it straighter. Apply the flat iron balm all over your hair to where your hair is a little damp, straighten all your hair, use the flat iron balm again all over your hair and pull each strand down. Slick it all down with the pomade (each strand, not the whole head at once) and there you go! These are the best ways to do your hair without it being damaged.

,
Straight leg jeans are awesome, and are emo/scene.

,
Colorful hoodies are amazing.
Check out the brand Tokidoki, almost everything they sell is scene.
Never ever, use BIG bows. Cute small ones are adorable, avoid big ones that'll make you look like a poser.

, Parents won't allow you to wear heavy makeup? That's okay! There are lots of styles of scene makeup that aren't over the top.

, You can apply it like genard way, but it might make you look like a poser.

,


Scenes have funny, cute personalities. Some scenes are shy and some are outgoing. Either way, they're nice people. Being mean isn't scene.
Bullies aren't good people and aren't fun to be around. Some scene people are very rude, just ignore them. They might call you names (poser, weird, ugly, fat, etc.) just to get on your nerves because they want to be the scene kid around there. As stupid as it may seem, it really does happen.

,


If you're being scene for other people or to get attention, then don't become scene. People will think you're a poser, because that's what posers are. Wait a little bit and see if you still want to be scene later on.
Only become scene if you think scene is you. If you're not ready to go all out, then maybe wait a little or dye your hair and not go full on yet.

Be yourself.",How to Be a Christian Emo1," Emo is short for emotional or emotive hardcore. “Being emo” involves acting according to your emotions and being a part of the whole subculture or lifestyle.In order to act emo, you don’t necessarily have to be moody or sad, but just be more thoughtful, quiet, and expressive through art and style rather than words.


Despite the stereotypes that you may have heard or read, emo does not mean inflicting self-harm or being depressed. These are serious medical conditions that need to be addressed and treated and do not make you more authentically emo.;
, The emo genre of music originated in the 1980s punk music scene in Washington, D.C. Some of the earliest emo bands out of D.C. are Rites of Spring and Embrace. Then there are bands out of the 90s like Sunny Day Real Estate and The Promise Ring, followed by Jimmy Eat World, Dashboard Confessional, and The Get Up Kids. More recently, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, and Panic! At the Disco are popular emo bands.There are Christian emo bands too! Try listening to bands like Further Seems Forever, Underoath, The Almost and Living Sacrifice.
You don’t need to listen only to emo music. Listen to Christian music too, and whatever other genres you like. The emo subculture is all about being passionate and emotionally invested in whatever you want, so having a varied taste in music is a good thing.

, Guitar, bass, and drums are great choices, and could allow you to join or create an emo band yourself. If you have a youth group that worships to Christian Rock, try to get into the band. You can also get into creating art or starting a journal to write poems, stories, or just thoughts. Getting into any art form is emo, because emo is about expressing feelings and emotions.

, The emo lifestyle is all about expressing your emotions, and you can’t do that if you’re not being true to yourself. Own your identity as both Christian and emo.


If someone asks you about your religion, feel free talk to them about Jesus. The Bible says, “always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have” (I Peter 3:15).If someone asks you about your emo identity or emo music, tell them about the bands or other things you’re into. Many people just don’t understand and want to know more.
If someone asks you about being Christian and being emo at the same time, let them know that you can be both! As long as you are putting Jesus first and living by His word, you can choose whatever styles and music make you happy.

Stay alert.",How to Survive on a Runaway Horse," Whether your horse has started racing the others in the ride or has been suddenly spooked, you need balance before you can think about slowing your horse down properly. Balance in the saddle will help to assure you are not thrown off.


If you have lost your stirrups, do your best to get them back. Having your feet planted in the stirrups helps with both balance and control of the horse.
Try to relax your muscles, including your arms that are holding the reins. Let your body feel the rhythm of the running horse. Otherwise, you will bounce in and out of your saddle and may fall off the horse.Leaning forward might give you better balance, but when you need real pulling power lean back slightly.;
, You are responsible for the damage your horse causes (or the damage caused to it) so look out for joggers, cyclists, dogs, corners, holes, fences, sharp rocks, other horses, terrain that can damage your horse's feet, terrain that can cause it to jump and obstacles that can scare it further (including seemingly benign things like a sprinkler or a flag) or encourage it to speed up. Be aware and try to steer clear of them.


If there are cyclists, joggers, or other pedestrians nearby, scream ""HORSE COMING! MOVE OUT OF THE WAY!"" for a warning and do your best to steer your horse away from people or other obstacles.
If you need to distract your horse for a second while you pass an object that you know will scare it, jiggle the reins roughly. Try to annoy him with the movement by flicking the reins excessively rather than yanking and encouraging resistance. Turn their head away slightly if you can.

, As you make quick mental notes about the severity of the situation (factoring in details like why your horse is bolting, what hazards are around, and your own experience level), you have to make a snap decision about whether to stay on the horse. Should you abandon ship or will you be able to stay on and slow down?


Remember, jumping off can injure you. You will almost definitely have severe bruising and scraping, and you could break your arms, legs, or even your back or neck. You should only jump off of a horse if the risk of staying on is greater than the risk of jumping off.

, If you do decide that the danger of staying on your horse is too great, jump off. If possible, choose a place with a soft landing (a bush rather than a rock).


Kick your feet out of the stirrups first, unwind the reins from your hand, and tumble.
After you are off and in a safe place, you will have to find your horse.

, If you are in a safe place (like a big, flat, open field), your horse is likely to run for a bit and eventually calm herself down. Just stay on, stay calm and let them get it out of their system.


Hold on tight, and put your body in a proper position for galloping.

, Horses can't run fast uphill, so doing this will slow the horse's run and help you regain control.


Avoid downhill if you can. It is jarring and can unseat you, and can cause a horse to tumble.

, This is one strategy that you should only use slowing a running horse. It works by applying leverage to the horse's mouth.Tighten the rein in your non-dominant hand so that it has no slack. Your hand should be centered on the horse's main with your knuckles against the horse and the rein completely taut. This will prevent the horse from jerking his head away from you.Keeping a tight grip with your non-dominant hand, lean forward as far as you can on the horse's neck and reach up on your dominant side and grab the rein as close to the horse's mouth as you can reach.
Pull back with your dominant hand as hard as you can, using all of your body weight and leaning back into the saddle. This pulls the horse's head down and forces a stop.Ease your hold on the reins as soon as the horse stops or you risk the horse falling over and crushing you., This will only work if she is going slow enough, as otherwise it can be very dangerous, so judge whether your horse is moving slow enough for a safe turn.


Shorten your inside rein dramatically and yank-yank-yank. Very Hard. Turn in the smallest circle you can manage, and when he sufficiently drunk step out of it on a tight rein.

, This is a last resort, but might be necessary if all else fails. Twisting a horse's ear (pulling the tip down to the ear's base and squeezing the fold) releases hormones that chills the horse out. The same principle is used in a twitch (on the horse's nose) and twisting an ear helps in an emergency (like a horse that has cast himself).


Lean forward and grab an ear. Fold it and hold it. Don't do this straight through (he might just stagger) hold a while (no more than five seconds should do it) release it for ten, hold it five and so forth.

, Better yet, until you are very experienced at riding, never go for a ride alone. Ask an experienced rider to go with you.Another rider can help you slow a runaway horse, or can get help if you are injured in a ride.

, Particularly if you are inexperienced at riding, do not ride a horse that is untrained or not fully broken.


You should always ride a horse that is at your skill level, and you should get to know the horse and its personality before riding. Some horses startle easily or exaggerate their responses to a pull on the reins or a tap on the sides.Riding a laid-back, well-tested horse is the safest way to avoid your horse bolting unexpectedly.

, Horseback riding, like any sport, carries some potential for injury no matter how cautious you are. Wearing a helmet will protect your head from injury if you happen to be thrown from your horse or if you have to make an emergency jump from a running horse. One study found that horseback riders not wearing helmets were four times more likely to die due to injuries from riding than those who wore helmets.Attractive riding helmets are easy to find if you ride English style. While less common for Western-style riders, helmets are still important for safety; you can wear an English style helmet or another helmet approved for riding. Look for the letters ASTM-SEI, which indicates the helmet has been safety-approved., Although it seems like this would increase your grip and make you less likely to fall, it can also lead to a severed or disjointed hand if there is a true emergency.Hold the reins securely with one hand, and hold the saddle horn with your other hand. NEVER let go of the reins and horn while riding.
Wearing riding gloves can increase your grip on the reins and make it less likely that they will slip from your grasp., Just as you should do while driving a car, an alert horseback rider should stay alert and constantly rehearse scenarios in her mind of what she would do in case of emergency. As you ride, think about what you would do if your horse suddenly bolted at any given point in the ride.


Watch your surroundings for safe routes, avoiding areas that would be hazardous if your horse suddenly bolted (for example, avoid riding your horse near vehicular traffic or near cliff edges).

Get the clothes.,
Get the hairstyle.,
Know the difference between emo, scene, and goth.",How to Be a Christian Emo2," The emo style of clothing typically includes wearing band t-shirts or ironic t-shirts, sweaters and hoodies, skate shoes like Vans or Converse, and accessories like piercings and a messenger bag. Black eyeliner is also popular on guys and girls.


If you can’t or don’t want to spend a lot of money, you can find a lot of simple emo clothes and even band shirts at thrift stores. A more worn-in look on your clothes and shoes is better than new anyway.
A Christian cross also looks great with this style too. Don't forget your relationship with your Lord!

, Grow out bangs (the hair around your face) and then part your hair far to one side, so that the bangs fall partly or fully over one eye. You can use gel or mousse to style the bangs or slightly spike the rest of your hair. You can also buy hair dye in a dark color to add to the look.

, These are three separate subcultures that are associated with slightly different types of music and fashion choices. While emo is generally characterized by sideswept hair, hoodies, and sweaters, the scene look usually has brighter neon colors and the goth look is generally all black.


If someone confuses you for scene or goth, don’t get upset or defensive, just explain why you identify as emo. It’s good to know the difference between these three styles, but it’s not worth an argument. All are valid, and everyone has a different definition of what it means to be emo, scene, or goth.

Address negativity at church.",How to Be a Christian Emo3," Being a “good Christian” is not so much about performing any specific actions as it is simply believing in God as a higher power and growing in love for Our Lord Jesus Christ, allowing Him to transform your life.The following steps are all good activities for Christians, but the one thing that makes a true Christian is simply loving and trusting in God.


Talk to a pastor, your parents, or other Christians if you have any questions about your belief in God.

, Find a church you really like—maybe it’s one that your parents, relatives, teachers, or friends go to—and attend services regularly. Church is a place where you can worship God, but also, connect with other Christians to help grow your faith and better understand Jesus’ message through sermons and Bible readings.


Find out when your church holds other events and activities in addition to weekly services, such as Sunday School, charity events, or other ways to get involved with fellow Christians and the community.

, Talk to God daily to thank Him for his guidance, ask questions, confess sins, and pray for others to follow Jesus Christ in order to lead better and more fulfilling lives.Start by picking a time and location to pray every day. Whether you kneel, stand, or walk, there is not one way to pray, so find what is best for you., Start reading on your own or join a Bible study group. Take notes on what you find interesting, and write down questions about what confuses you. Talk to someone at your church or another Christian you trust to deepen your understanding of the scripture.Try reading just one passage every day and seek to understand it fully by asking all the questions you need to.

, Remember that even if you adopt another lifestyle like emo, as a Christian you worship God first and foremost. Being emo isn't the greatest commandment; loving the Lord is.


The Bible says, “Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.” (Proverbs 16:3), If other people at your church or in your Christian community approach you with negative judgment or untrue stereotypes about the emo way you act or dress, kindly talk to them about how being emo is just a way of expressing your personality and doesn’t interfere with worshipping God.


The Bible says, “But the Lord said to Samuel, ‘Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.’” (I Samuel 16:7)Use this and other Bible verses to help you explain self-expression and why your identity as emo doesn’t interfere with your identity as a Christian.
You can even introduce others in your church to Christian emo bands to help them see the crossover between these two identities and share what you like.

Get someone to catch the runaway horse.",How to Recover from a Fall off a Horse1," If you are shivering, sweating, confused, feel dizzy, or otherwise “out of it,” you are likely in a state of shock. You may also experience shallow breathing, weakness, clammy skin, and a rapid, weak pulse.If you see any blood coming out of your body, you know you will need emergency assistance. You should dial your local emergency phone number if you are experiencing either shock or bleeding., Since falling off a horse can result in serious bodily harm, you should dial the local emergency telephone number. Neck and head injuries are common in horseback riding and will be made worse if you try to move immediately after a fall, so stay where you are and call for help.In North America, dial 911.In major Chinese cities, dial 999.
In Hong Kong, dial 999.
In Israel, dial 101* (112 from a cell phone).
In Iran, dial 110 (112 from a cell phone).

, If you are riding with other people, you should try to wave them down or otherwise call them for help. If you have a whistle, blow it! If you have a cell phone, give them a ring and ask for emergency assistance.When help arrives, they will try to keep you in a stable condition until the ambulance arrives:They may check your pulse.
They should make sure your airway is clear.
If necessary, they may administer CPR.
They may bandage an open wound.
If you feel even slight pain, don't move until help arrives.

, Since you will likely be in a state of shock, you don’t want to move prematurely. You could easily make an injury worse be moving prematurely, such as a neck or head injury. Keep your helmet on and stay where you are until help arrives., Although you don’t want to move to catch your runaway horse, you can always ask a friend or fellow rider to catch them! All too often, riders will try to catch a runaway horse and make an injury, such as a concussion, worse. Instead, request help in catching your loose horse.Don't feel that you need to jump right back on your horse.
Take care of your injuries before worrying about riding again.

"
"
Never mount your trusty steed without the right safety gear.,
Once you realize falling is inevitable, try to look for a soft patch of ground to land on.,
As you begin to fall, try not to tense up.,
Kick out of the stirrups.,
Ideally, you should land on your feet, bending legs on immediately on contact.,
Don't jump up as soon as you're out of the way.",How to Survive Falling off a Horse," A riding helmet could save your life. Wearing long jeans and a tough, long-sleeved shirt will protect your arms and legs from being scratched by low branches or being grazed if you fall on rough ground.;
, It is better to fall off sooner onto sand soil or grass than to fall off later on to gravel or pavement.

, Keep your limbs as loose as possible. Resist the temptation to throw your arms straight out in front of you to break your fall. The only thing you will break is your bones. The more relaxed your body is, the fewer injuries you'll sustain.

, Don't hang on for dear life. Let go of the reins to ensure you aren't dragged to your death.

, Then, curl up into a ball and slowly roll away. Protect your vital organs, head, and neck.

, Test each body part, especially your neck, for damage. If all seems OK, then slowly get up.

"
Try to stop him.,
If the horse does not slow down after pulling on the reins, keep your heels down and use one rein to pull your horse into a tight circle.,
If you have a whip, use it gently but firmly on their neck to get their attention.,
If he does slow down again, don't dismount.,
Stay calm.,
If you think you're in trouble and your horse won't listen to any cues (especially on trails), assume a safety seat.,
Situation 1: other people in the arena:;
,
This step is the most important step because it keeps everybody in the arena safe.,
Ask people to walk or halt so that your horse can see that everyone except him is walking of stopped.,
Sit back in your seat and make your bottom the heaviest thing on you so you're not coming to your horse and he's coming to you.,
With your reins if you do a pull and release it with be more effective because it annoys him so much he is not going to gallop off with you pulling on his mouth.

,
Pull him in a tight circle.,
Situation number 2: jumps in the arena:

,Do everything from situation one

,
Let him/her over the jump, and make sure to do 2 point.,
Have fun, but remember these safety steps!

,
To stop the problem immediately, take one rein and pull it to your thigh, which gets the hind end over.",How to React when the Horse You're Riding Starts Galloping Unexpectedly," Don't tug desperately at the reins; this will just scare him/her even more. Firmly pull back, then release, being careful not to lean backwards yourself. Keep repeating the pull and release. If a horse is leaning on the bit he will find it difficult to keep pulling if there is nothing to pull against. You will feel as if he is dropping his front end when you release the reins. Command him to stop, but don't shout.

, Horses cannot buck or run when being pulled around like that, so small circles are almost always a good thing to do.

, Be careful when doing this, you don't want to encourage the horse to run faster, you just want them alert to your signals.

, Stop, talk to him in a soothing voice and start to walk again, gradually regaining your original speed.

, Horses can sense things like fear, and if you get nervous and scared, your horse will too.

, This will make it harder for you to fall. Do this by putting your legs forward and leaning back slightly. Falling from a gallop can be very dangerous, so you should avoid it at all costs. Keep talking to your horse and asking them to stop while you do this.

,, Call out where you're going because if you take off and you're in somebody's blind spot, how are they supposed to know? While you're galloping, call out things like 'coming up behind you!' to alert riders where you are in the arena.

, Horses are herd animals and if they sees all the other horses standing calm, he/she will likely do the same with a bit of convincing.

, Also, if you lean forward your legs go back on his/her side and when that happens, you kick your horse in their soft spot, and end up telling them to go faster.

,, Horses can't go fast in a little circle. The faster the gait the larger the circle needs to be to maintain that gate, so pull hard. You may feel a bit off balance, and that is why you MUST sit deeply in the saddle. If you need to, grab the saddle or a bit of mane. But DO NOT let him/her win. Doing so will teach them that taking off is a way out of work, and that's not what you want.

,,, Just because the horse is acting up doesn't mean you want them hurt. Jump like you normally would, but as soon as you've landed, steer away from the jump. Next time the horse is running at the jump, end the approach as soon as you can. Letting them run the jump over and over will reinforce what they are doing.

,, If the horse continues then repeat until he stops.

Get riding lessons.,
Go riding.,
Stay alert of traffic and cars.,
Keep to the inside and, if possible, ride on the verge, walk or trot.,
Thank drivers who slow down.,
If you want to change direction, warn drivers by signalling.,
If you see something that may spook your horse, wait until the road is clear and try to pass it.,
If you are leading a horses on the road, keep him on the inside, away from the traffic.

,
Wear a reflective green or orange vest or bright colours so drivers can see you through their flashlights.

,
Always keep to a track or bridleway where there is one, and ask for permission before riding over private land.,
Open and shut gates without dismounting.",How to Ride a Horse in a Safe Area," Taking lessons at a riding school is a good way to learn to ride or to improve your technique. You will also meet other people who like riding. It's important to pick a good school, so get advice from someone knowledgeable. If you can find somewhere approved by a horse society, look around the school to see if it is a well-run school and what the lessons are like.;
, Riding out in the countryside is a really fun way to practise your horse riding skills, whether you go hacking, trekking or trail-riding. You can hacking from a riding school. Treks and trail rides are offered by trekking centres and horse ranches. Again, it's a good idea to get a recommendation.

, Make sure your horse is listening to your aids.

, but don't canter, even on the verge.

, Raise one hand or nod and smile.

, If you are turning left, take out your left arm. Same with the right. If turning right, hold out your right arm.

, Cars may also spook your horse, which causes it to run out the road and get injured by a car.

,,, Avoid riding over crops and plants in a field, if you really need to go through the garden, ride near the fence. Be considerate. Pass people a walk, especially if they have kids. If you come across other animals, pass them at walk and don't disturb them wild or not. Shut any gates you open.

, Walk up to the gate, stopping with your horses shoulder against the latch. Reach down and open the gate being careful that it doesn't touch your horse. Ride through slowly, keeping one hand on the gate to stop it from swinging. Turn back, your horses neck should arch over the fence and close it gently.

Find out what caused the fear.,
Talk through your fears with someone.,
Read some books about horses.,
Consider seeing a horse up-close.,
Spend some time around horses.,
When you feel ready, find a stable or riding school.,
If you feel confident enough, assist the owner with caring for the horse.,
When you are ready, get on and ride.",How to Overcome Your Fear of Horses," Everyone has a reason on why they have a fear of something. Is it their size? Did the animal do something bad to you in the past? Discovering this piece of information brings you one step closer to getting over you're fear of horses.;
, Accept and think about the reasons on why you are afraid of horses. This will help you understand your fear and possibly conquer it.


Focus on the positive instead of negative. Instead of thinking of all the things that can go wrong when being near horses, think about all the good things.

, The book content will teach you to be cautious, but will also explain clearly how to have a good time with horses. You will learn how great horses are through learning about their habits, their physiology, their needs and their behavior. Understanding horses better is an important way to conquering the fear.

, This is a big step so do not rush it; only attempt this if you feel comfortable with it and know you can do it.

, Go to shows, or just hang out or volunteer at your local barn. Being around horses will help you to see that they are not so bad. When a human is training a horse not to spook, the constant exposure is what eventually makes the horse realize that there's nothing to fear. You will find the same thing can calm your fear too.


If you are afraid of a specific horse, ask the instructor if you can lead the horse, help others tack him up, or give him a bath. Doing things other than riding the horse but still involving interaction will help you to gain confidence in you ability to handle the horse.

, Explain that you are trying to get used to horses, and they will pair you with a gentle, reliable horse or a pony. If you are not ready to ride, don't let anyone force you. Just pat the pony and realize that he will not hurt you.


Bring a close friend or family member along. They will most likely encourage you and take your mind off your fear. If you have a friend or family member who has experience with horses (or has rode a horse before) then take them along too! At least then you will have someone who knows what its like to ride a horse.
Observe the horses. It is perfectly fine to keep your distance and to be scared of certain movements, but understand that most horses that people own are very friendly and not dangerous at all.
Ask questions about the horse. Don't hold back as understanding a horse is very important and the owner of the horses will most likely be very happy to answer them.

, You can groom the horse, feed it and more importantly, bond with the horse. Do not let any movement discourage you, this is perfectly normal as some horses are sensitive to brushes.


Feed the horse a treat (with permission of course). Lay your palm flat with the treat in your hand, even try to pet or stroke the horse.
Pet and offer the horse treats. This will boost your confidence and make you bond with the horse, you might even get attached.
Lead the horse with the rein. Remember to stay on the left side of the horse and to hold the reins securely and tight in your hands.

, Have someone supervise you, in case you lose your nerve. Ask for a quiet horse that is known to take care of beginner riders; most stables will have at least one such caring horse.


Only do this if you know you have the confidence to do this. Be sure that the owner is assisting you whilst riding. He should be leading the horse rather than you riding on your own for the first time.

Learn how to restrain your horse's rear leg.",How to Stay Safe on a Trail Ride," If you're planning to ride alone, you should be an experienced trail rider. If you are inexperienced, it's important that you avoid going alone, and either ride with an experienced rider you know or as part of an organized trail ride. Riding alone puts you at risk of injury, getting lost, or getting exposed to the elements., Regardless of your level of experience, it's important that you know the route that you're planning on taking. This will help reduce the risk of getting lost. You should purchase a map of the area in advance, study the route you intend to take, and bring the map with you for reference.Bring a map that is waterproof. That way, if you get caught in a downpour, your map will still hold up.
Don't rely on technology like smartphones or GPS for navigation. If you're riding on a trail in a wilderness area, anticipate the likelihood that you will not have good reception.
Familiarize yourself with the animals and insects that are native to the area you'll be riding. Know in advance whether any animals may show up that would startle your horse, and be aware of the insect situation to make preparations (like long sleeves and bug repellent). You can find this information by searching online for the area you'll be riding in.
Tell others where you're going, what route you'll be taking, and when you expect to return. That way, if anything should happen, your friends or family members will know both where to look and when to start looking.

, Before you head out for a trail ride, you should anticipate any conditions you might encounter on the trail. That means planning for the weather, of course, but it also means planning for issues like riding in the dark if you plan to be out late.Wear comfortable clothes that will keep you warm if it's cold out, or cool if it's hot out.
If there's a chance of rain, bring a rain jacket.
Bring and wear bug repellent.
If there is any chance at all that you may be out at night, bring reflective clothing (especially if the trail crosses any roads) and a flashlight or headlamp. You should also slip an extra set of batteries into your pocket, just in case.
Remember that your horse will get warm on a hot day, too. For a quick and easy way to cool him off on the fly, simply tie a long rope around one or two rectangular sponges. When you cross a stream or other source of water, dip the sponges in the water and wring them out on your horse's neck and shoulders., In addition to dressing for the weather and environment, it's important to wear the right safety gear. A hard hat should absolutely be at the top of your list, no matter how experienced a rider you are. You may also want to consider wearing a protective vest, which will help protect the organs and bones in your abdomen if you fall off your horse.If you're riding with an organized trail riding service, they may provide you with some equipment, but not other pieces. Some services may require you to provide your own gear. Find out what is offered, and what you'll need to bring.


Wear bright orange if there is any chance you will be out in the woods near hunters.You should also wear sunglasses, no matter what season you'll be riding in. Too much exposure to the sun can cause long-term vision problems, and being unable to see where you're going can make it unsafe to ride.Opt for rider-friendly sunglasses that will not shatter (those made with polycarbonate materials are best) and will fit comfortably under your helmet., If you're out in a wilderness area, there's a risk that both you and your horse could become injured. Be sure to bring a first aid kit that can treat you both, should an emergency arise. A proper first aid kit should include:


cotton wraps/dressings
surgical tape
gauze pads in various sizes
a sharp, clean pair of scissors
antiseptic wipes and/or rinse
saline solution
latex gloves
clippers
a rectal thermometer
the phone number for your horse's veterinarian, If you're a new rider, you should avoid trail riding on a high-energy, athletic horse, as his drive matched with your inexperience could cause an accident. Similarly, if you're an experienced and adventurous rider, you may have a hard time riding a slow, elderly horse with no sense of curiosity.If you're not sure how to choose a horse that will fit your needs and experience level, talk to a trainer at the stable or someone who works with a trail-riding group.
Choose a horse that is capable of carrying someone with your height and weight. Again, if you're not sure how to size up a horse for your body, talk to someone who does know.
Make sure your horse is physically conditioned for the kind of riding you intend to do., If you are riding your own horse, you should get him used to riding around other horses and animals before entering a wilderness area. Conversely, if your horse has only ever been on rides with other horses and will be riding solo with you for the first time, gradually build up his comfort and confidence levels by taking short rides together on a regular basis.Introduce your horse to new riding situations gradually and over time. Don't expect a horse that's never been on a trail to suddenly ""get it"" while in the woods.
Make sure you have mastered the basic skills of riding with your horse before hitting the trail.
Do not bring a wild, unruly horse onto a riding trail. It endangers your safety, the horse's safety, and the safety of anyone else who might be on that trail., If you're riding with a group, it's important to know whether any other horses that will be on the trail with you have any issues. For example, a horse that is prone to kicking could endanger the rider(s) directly behind him, which would affect how closely the subsequent rider(s) would follow behind.If your horse kicks, tie a red ribbon to its tail. This is generally seen as a universal marker of kicking.
If you are riding behind a horse with a red ribbon, give extra space. Remember that any rider should put at least one horse length between their horse and the horse directly in front. If the horse in front has a red ribbon or is known to kick, you should double that distance and make sure your horse doesn't tailgate.

, Many horses puff up their chests when riders fit cinches in place. This can lead to loose cinches as the ride progresses. For this reason, it's generally a good idea to check the cinches after you've mounted the horse, and again about 5 to 10 minutes into the ride. You may also want to check the cinches around halfway through the ride, just to be sure.Loose cinches can lead to accidents and injuries.
Checking the tightness of the cinch above the horse's elbow can give you a false sense of that cinch's status. For a more accurate measure, check how tight the cinch is where it crosses the horse's sternum, between his front legs.
To check the cinch, slide your finger underneath the cinch from the back moving forward (to ensure that when you remove your finger, the horse's hair will lay flat). You should be able to fit a single finger up to the first joint on that finger. If you can fit anything more, the cinches may be too lose. If you cannot fit that far, the cinch may be too tight., If you're on private land, you'll probably only encounter other riders, if you encounter anyone at all. On public lands, however, you may cross paths with hikers, bicyclists, and even off-road vehicles. Because of this, it's important to know the trail protocol to help ensure everyone's safety.If riding in a group, form a single file when another rider is approaching from either the front or the rear.
If you come across hikers or bicyclists, reduce your horse's trot to as slow a walk as possible and stay to the side of the trail so that they can pass if they need to.

, Out on the trail, there are many situations you cannot control. There's no way to change the trail conditions, but you can change how your horse approaches those conditions.


If the trail becomes rocky, slippery, or otherwise slick or unstable, approach slowly and with caution. Try to keep your body centered in your saddle to reduce the chances that your shifting body weight might make your horse lose balance.Use caution when crossing any streams. In swiftly-moving water, a horse can easily have his legs swept out from under him, causing him (and you) to fall. The risk of this happening greatly increases the deeper you wade in, especially once the water gets approximately halfway up the horse's side.Even muddy trails can cause a horse to slip and fall, potentially pinning you underneath him.If you are riding through a terrain where you cannot clearly see the ground (through tall grass, for example), slow down and approach carefully. Even if the ground is stable, you may encounter rodent holes that could cause your horse to stumble or trip.

, Obviously it would be best if you did not have to fall at all. But if your horse does rear back and knock you off, or if you simply lose your balance, it's important that you try to use a controlled fall to minimize the risk of serious injury.Do not stick out your arms to break your fall. This will likely result in a broken wrist, arm, or both.
If you cannot turn in time, try to use your shoulder or thigh to absorb some of the shock when you fall. If at all possible, you may want to cover your face before you hit the ground (and the rest of your head, if you're not wearing a hard hat).
Try to tuck and roll as soon as you hit the ground. This will reduce the impact in any single part of your body, and instead will spread the blow out as much as possible. It may sound strange trying to spread the injury out, but remember that a lot of small scrapes and bruises will be a lot easier to recover from than one big, hard impact.

, If your horse gets stuck by a porcupine or otherwise injures his hoof, he may not be able to make it back to the trailhead. Treating an injured rear leg is difficult, as you can easily get kicked by a nervous, flailing horse. The easiest way to restrain a horse for such a procedure is by tying up one of his rear feet.You may never have to restrain a horse, but it's good to know how to do so, should the situation ever arise. To restrain your horse:


use a soft cotton rope so that you do not cause chafing or brush burn
make sure the rope is long enough for your horse's body so that you will not be in a position where you might get kicked
place a length of rope in a loop around the base of the horse's neck, and tie the loop with a bowline (this knot will not tighten up, reducing the risk of your horse choking)
take the loose end of the rope down along the horse's body and feed it between his hind legs and out behind his rear (but stand to the side so that you do not get kicked)
gently put the rope's end around the back of the horse's pastern (aka the forelimb, roughly equivalent to the shin)
bring the rope back alongside the horse, retracing the path that the rope took on the way to the rear leg
slide the rope through the ring you tied around the horse's neck
use this rope system as a sort of pulley to lift the horse's rear foot off the ground"
"
Stay still and assess your situation.,
Stand up slowly if you are not in shock and feel okay.,
Get back on your horse if you feel up to it.",How to Recover from a Fall off a Horse2," Rather than jumping right back up on your horse, you’ll be better off if you take a minute to assess your situation. Take note of any symptoms of shock, such as sweating, weakness, and dizziness. If you experience any symptoms of shock, bleeding, or feel any pain or weakness, you should call your local emergency phone number. However, if you feel fine, you can take five minutes to relax and catch your breath., If you are not in shock and have not experienced any major injury, you can slowly get back up. Feel your limbs to make sure you haven’t sprained anything. Take note of any bruises or scrapes. If you feel up to it, you can go and retrieve your horse.If you feel okay but not quite up to retrieving your horse, you could ask a fellow rider to do it.

, If you aren't injured, consider getting back in the saddle right away. By getting back on the horse and finishing your ride, you can end the ride on a good note!If you are working with a green or difficult horse, it's important for them to understand that throwing you will not get them what they want.
If you aren't going to ride any more, spend some time walking with your horse, removing its tack, grooming, and talking to it after the accident.

Use progressive relaxation to reduce anxiety after a fall.,
Do strength training to improve your confidence.,
Visualize yourself doing what you should have been doing on the ride.,
Sign up for a class on how to fall gracefully.",How to Recover from a Fall off a Horse3," Lie down on a carpet or an exercise mat. Put your arms on either side of your torso. Tense your toes for ten seconds, and then relax them completely. Gradually, work your way from your toes to your head, tensing and relaxing each muscle group in your body.By learning to relax, you can improve communication with your horse.
Progressive relaxation can help reduce anxiety after a fall.

, Although you may not be ready to get back on your horse yet, you can prepare by doing some strength training. Work on strengthening your core muscles and legs, so that you feel strong and confident when you get back on your steed!, Ask your trainer for advice on how you could have avoided falling off the horse. If your fall was partly due to a technical mistake, you may benefit from visualizing yourself performing the riding skill correctly. However, you should only use visualization if you know specifically what you could have done to ride better and avoid the fall.If you know what went wrong but not how to fix it, you should skip visualization.
Don’t try to visualize yourself “not” doing whatever went wrong, since it is very hard for your brain to process a negative visualization.

, One way to get over a fear of riding again is to practice falling. Once you are completely recovered from the fall, you might want to sign up for a class on how to properly fall off a horse. You’ll learn how to bend properly, keep your head tucked in, properly absorb the impact, and avoid injury to the head and neck.See if your local equestrian center has an upcoming workshop on how to fall off a horse.

To slow your horse from an unsafe or uncontrolled gait, gently pull one rein until the horses head is pointed towards his tail and he stops completely.,
Once the horse stops, you may dismount as normal if necessary.

,If turning the horse is not safe (such as on a narrow trail) you may need to perform an emergency dismount

,
Remove your feet from the stirrups as you would to dismount normally.

,Lean forward and hug the horse around the neck

,
Swing your right foot over the horse's haunch like a normal dismount.

,
Land with both feet together next to the horse's left shoulder, facing away from the horse's head towards the saddle.

,
This should be practiced frequently in the area at all gaits so that you and your horse are comfortable with the motion.

,
Caution!",How to Perform an Emergency Stop on a Horse," This causes the horse to lose his forward motion and slow down. Pulling too hard and too quickly will cause the horse to trip and fall. This should be practiced at all gaits until you and your horse are familiar with the procedure Don't wait until you are on an out of control horse to practice!;
,,,,,,,, It is always safer to remove BOTH feet from the stirrups before swinging the right leg behind you to the left side. If your horse spooks while you are trying to dismount, and your left foot is still in the stirrup, you may get stuck. Even though it feels easier to stand in the left stirrup to swing the right foot over, there is ultimately more risk of getting caught, dragged, and broken. This is especially true if you are a beginning rider who has not yet mastered positioning the stirrup on the ball of your foot, instead putting more of your foot deeper into the stirrup. Play it safe: remove BOTH feet from the stirrups before dismounting, emergency or otherwise.

For example, can you go to the farm of a family member or friend? Or is it a known evacuation place suitable for horses? Large animal shelters may be able to accept your horses but you'll need to know and confirm this well before an actual emergency situation ever occurs. Get their agreement in writing if possible.
What are the costs involved in transporting your horses there? Do you have an emergency fund set up to cover these costs?
What are the insurance implications of evacuating (or not evacuating) your horses?

, It is no good leaving as the hurricane descends. To get your horses to safety, you'll need to leave at least 72 hours before the hurricane is set to arrive in your location.

, They may wish to join your plan if they have horses or they may simply appreciate knowing what you intend to do and offer to look out for your house and ranch if you do have to go away.


If your neighbors have horses, you might like to plan a shared group transportation fleet to help get all of the horses out in time.

, This will help you to catch things that you haven't planned properly for, as well as giving you a sense of the timing involved and what sorts of things you must watch out for under pressure.


Time the evacuation drill, to see how much time it takes to do everything.
Obviously, don't drive the horses off your property during a drill; do as much as possible in the drill up to the leaving stage. You can't replicate the conditions of being on the road during an emergency event, so it's not worth the effort and expense.

, In this pack, include all of the needs for your traveling horses, including medicines, first aid items (bandages, etc.), and food and water. Halters, saddles and any other gear you know you'll need should be easily locatable, or spares placed near the emergency gear pack. Pack whatever you can pack ahead of time in an easily identifiable bag or series of bags, including spare horse gear.


Place an easily located and legible list of what to grab in the event of an evacuation. This will cover items you can't add to an emergency pack because they're in everyday use, such as saddles, bridles, blankets, etc. Having a list can help calm any sense of panic, and allows you to refer to it methodically as you prepare to leave.
Keep a record of the local authorities and businesses you might need to contact, including the police, animal control, stock feed suppliers and your local veterinary clinics (not just your own, but all of them).
Mark packed emergency gear clearly. In some cases, you may need to send someone else to grab this gear and you'll need to be able to direct them to the precise items.

, This means having some form of permanent identification (microchip, tattoo, etc.) and something less permanent, such as a tag or spray paint.

, Tetanus and encephalitis vaccinations should be current, along with any other relevant vaccinations pertinent to your location.


Make it easy for people to locate you if they happen to end up with your lost horse. Add your cellphone number and an email contact as well.
Keep copies of the microchip numbers and other relevant digital information in the cloud, so that it is easily retrievable. For example, email yourself a copy or upload it to your form of cloud storage, such as a permanent online account.
Have digital images of your horses stored as well. If your horses do go missing, images can be very helpful, especially for people more inclined to look for patterns and colors than for microchip data or tags.

, This includes tools, generators, fuel, food and water, medications, etc.; prepare whatever is needed for all persons remaining on the property.


Have sufficient lighting (flashlights, etc.), batteries and a battery-powered radio as part of your household emergency kit.

, In particular, ensure that items that might present a danger during a hurricane are appropriately stored away or tied down during the hurricane season. Doing this can help to reduce the amount of debris flying or floating around during the storm.

, Will this be in a barn, in a particular field or in some building not usually designated for the horses? If you aren't sure, ask people who do know to help you scout out the best locations to keep horses on your property during the emergency event.


If your property is likely to be flooded, do not keep the horses in a building. They will be more likely to survive if they can run to higher ground of their own accord.
If using a barn or building, remove all hanging items and anything that could cause a threat to the scared horses. Keep the area as clear as possible. Keep the barn in a safe condition; replace anything loose or broken immediately upon discovery––regular maintenance is essential when living in an environment where emergency events are always possible.

, It is advisable to always have an additional three weeks of food stored for emergencies, as that may be the length of time before help can be obtained for your livestock and horses, whose needs are often ranked more lowly than those of people.


When storing food, choose a dry, high and safe location to keep it. Do a regular check to ensure that it is not being enjoyed by rats or other animals during storage and replace it every few months with a fresh batch of food, so that no food ever goes to waste.

, Have emergency water tanks installed and only use these when necessary. Arrange several large plastic garbage cans with secure lids for filling with water in the event of an emergency. These can be slowly drawn on as the horse's water supply if needed. Always secure the lid carefully to ensure that no water is lost if the can accidentally tips over.

, Realize that texting is a good option as it is less likely to overload the phone systems and is less drain on your phone's battery. Texts also tend to eventually get through, if there are initial delays. By staying in touch, neighbors can help each other during and after the emergency event.

, This may require doing some asking around your neighbors if your horses have taken off anywhere––use that cellphone tree you'd already set up as a way to keep an eye out for each other's livestock and horses.

, As soon as it is safe to do so, clear away debris and start making the property safe for your horses and for people as soon as possible. Use appropriate caution around anything electric and if any item on your property has been submerged, take great care until you know what is under the water. Do not touch if you do not know––wait for the professionals to come and asses it.


Water-damaged items are likely to need replacement and/or removal, so be prepared for this.
Get your insurance documents out and ready for processing.

, Try to avoid keeping your horses in wet, damp or moldy environments after the storm. These environments are unhealthy and could be the source of infections or diseases that stressed horses may be more susceptible to. If possible, rig a dry temporary shelter for them until their usual places have dried out. In terms of planning, it might be useful to store some wood for a temporary shelter in a high-up place.

Squeeze the saddle with your thighs.,
Put your heels down and keep the stirrup on the ball of your feet.,
Keep your reigns short enough.,
Watch where you are going.,
Sit up straight.,
Stay calm.,
If you lost your stirrup you have two choices.,
Rearing.,
Take action.",How to Not Fall Off a Horse," This will help you keep yourself on the saddle and you will be able to stay balanced.;
, This way if the horse spooks and you DO fall, your foot is less likely to go through the stirrup and you are less likely to get dragged.

, All so you can feel the horses mouth on the other side-- not to the point where you're choking it... You will keep them short while trotting, cantering, galloping, jumping, ect. (Hopefully you weren't walking and fell off....)

, If you bump into anything, the horse might spook and bolt. So keep a close look out for thinks you could hit.

, You want your belly button, to be in line with the front of the saddle, and the back, so you don't put the horse off balance.


If your horse takes off or goes too fast SIT BACK! Lean back and steer your horse in circles-- big at first, then smaller, and smaller, and smaller. Some people try to run their horses into fences to stop them. DON'T do that! Your horse is likely to slam on the breaks (sending you flying over his neck) or swerve (sending you over the edge). By leaning back you slow your horse gradually until he's under control. Don't turn him in too tight circles so he doesn't trip. If this doesn't work, you can half halt, or pull your hands back to your waist(not up), and slowly say in a deep tone, 'Whoa'. This can get them into a slower gait and or stop them completely in a timely manner.

, If your horse seems spooky stay calm. Don't get nervous. Horses can sense how we feel, so if you are nervous so is your horse. If your horse DOES spook, remain calm. Don't scream or panic. 'Whoa' or 'Shh' in a very soothing voice. It will calm you AND your horse. If there is a potentially scary object ahead, start to turn your horse away from it and start heading in another direction. Make them concentrate on you and the reigns opposed to the scary thing and your horse will eventually calm down.

, Either stop your horse and regain your stirrup OR do an emergency dismount if needed. DO NOT search for your stirrup while going at a fast gait, this will only handicap your ability to squeeze with your legs to hold on.


If they buck. Disengage their hindquarters, this is done by sharply pulling the reins to the left or the right and having its nose to your leg. This only allows them to move in a tight circle. You can also scrunch the reins, doing so by gathering the reins in one hand, and using the other to move along the reins, creating a tight 'scrunch' around the horses neck, this triggers a vertebrae in the horses neck, making them unable to buck.

, A horse usually backs up before he rears, so if he's been acting frustrated or is known for rearing and starts backing up-- kick him forward! If he does rear, DO NOT pull the reigns; that could potentially make the horse topple over and land with all weight on you. Put all your weight forward and the most accurate result is no fall.

, If you are around another horse who is bolting, bucking, rearing, or is just plain out flipping out, stay a good lengths away, but if possible, try to help get the horse under control before it hurts itself, another horse, or a person.

Use old towels and paper napkins to soak up as much of the urine as possible.,
Lay a fresh set of old rags and/or paper towels over the affected area.,
Place the wet towels in the area that you want your pet to do its business—be it outside or in a litter box.








,
Rinse the area with clean, cool water.,
Alternately, apply a pet stain remover to the affected area.,
Try a basic vinegar solution.,
Use baking soda or cornstarch to neutralize the urine smell.,
Try a bit of stain remover coupled with borax laundry booster for oriental rugs.,

, Cover with newspaper. Stomp around on the newspaper for at least a minute to bring up as much of the moisture as possible. When you are finished the area sound be almost dry.








,, Do this frequently, and remove as much of the water as possible each time using either towels or a wet vac.








, While it may seem like the urine should be cleaned up at this point, there are still traces in the carpet that may entice your pet to use the same spot again. Using an enzymatic eliminator will break down the odor compounds, minimizing your pet's attraction to that spot.








, Fill a small spray bottle with white vinegar. Spray the affected area and then work in with a scrub brush. Let stand. Once the solution has penetrated the affected area, go over with a steam cleaner or wet vac.










Never start with vinegar. Vinegar, although effective as a cleaner, will ""set"" the stain like it sets the color of dyes on Easter eggs.Try vinegar after exhausting other options, and especially if you're only trying to neutralize smell, not stains.

, Pour as much baking soda or cornstarch over the affected area as it takes to cover it up completely. Work the baking soda or cornstarch into the area with a scrub brush. Allow to soak up as much of the urine as possible for 24 hours. Revisit the scene of the crime after a full day and vac up any of the remaining baking soda or cornstarch.









If the damage is particularly bad, create a baking soda or cornstarch paste by mixing it with a bit of water and then scrubbing into the affected area. Let the paste dry overnight and then vacuum up as much as possible the next day.

, Use a gentle stain remover, like CitraSolve, to soak a clean rag. Apply the rag to the carpet, using the back of a spoon to work the stain remover into the rug.Once the stain remover is applied, dust a little borax over the stain, cover with paper towels, and weigh paper towels down with heavy books. After a day, vacuum up any remaining borax.








, Rinse the area with water and, if necessary, make another pass. Some stains will require multiple passes, although most should crumble under the weight of these powerful but gentle home solutions.

Use a black light to identify any stains.,
Use lukewarm water to wet vac the affected area.,
Use a mixture of peroxide, baking soda, and dish detergent to quash the smell.,
Use a pet stain remover.,
Try an ammonia solution before using the hydrogen peroxide/baking soda cleaner.,
Shampoo your carpet using a wet vac.,
Rinse the area again if necessary.",How to Remove Urine Odors and Stains Permanently2," Outline the ones that cannot be seen with the naked eye with chalk to ensure that you don't miss anything.








, Do not use hot water or any sort of steam treatment. The heat will cause the proteins in the urine to bind to your carpet, rendering them almost impossible to remove. If you do not own a wet vac, you can rent one at a place like Home Depot.








, Hydrogen peroxide and baking soda are both famed detergents. Mix together with a few drops of dish detergent and you're ready to go. Pour into a spray bottle, spray on, and work into the urine stain with a brush or sponge. Let set for 10 or 20 minutes and inspect the site. To create the hydrogen peroxide solution, mix into a spray bottle:









8 fl oz peroxide
3 Tbsp baking soda
2-3 drops any dish detergent, This should be used in the same way as it would be for wet stains.








, If stains are your real problem, try priming the area (be it carpet or clothing) with a little bit of cool ammonia water first. For each cup of cold water, mix in 2 tablespoons of ammonia.Using a spray bottle, spritz the area until it is fully covered. Hit the area with a brush scrubber. Wait at least 45 minutes before attacking with the hydrogen peroxide cleaning solution above.








, There are a number of shampoos meant specifically for removing pet stains. Be sure that you hit the area thoroughly, and that when done, you've gotten all the shampoo out of the carpet.








, You should be finished with cleaning. Your stain should be gone and your odor eliminated.

If you are riding when the downpour begins, be sure to keep your horse under control.,
Watch your horse's ears carefully.,
If your horse seems fairly calm, lead or ride him slowly.,
When you finally reach home, use a sweat scraper to dry your horse.",How to Keep Yourself and Your Horse Safe in the Rain," Bring him to a halt and reassure him with kind words. Always stay in control, especially if it is thundering, because there is a chance he might bolt. Remember not to let him sense your fear if you are afraid or nervous, because the horse will become afraid or nervous, too. Stay confident.If you are leading your horse, bring him to a stop and wait. Do Not tie him up! If he spooks while tied up, he could seriously hurt himself, or worse, you. If the horse rears or bolts while you are leading him, let go of the lead rope. There's no point in getting dragged and/or injured by a scared horse. Just as if you were riding, don't let him sense your fear.If your horse is in a paddock with other horses at the time of the storm, you need to get him out before he gets hurt without getting hurt yourself. As you approach him, don't look him straight in the eye, as he will see that as a threat. If he is head-shy, use extra caution. Try to halter him, but be careful! If he tries to kick, bolt, or bite, leave immediately and let him take his chances. If you do manage to halter him, lead him to a stall, or smaller paddock with no other horses (the stall is preferred).;
, They can tell you a lot about what he's thinking. If they are turned slightly back when you are riding, that means he's somewhat calm and is listening to you. It also means that he trusts you to lead him to safety, so don't let him down! If they are pricked forward, he is curious about something, possibly the distant lightning. And if they're slapped back against his head and you can see the whites of his eyes, watch out! He may bolt, kick, or rear.

, If he is not completely at ease, moving may help him relax and calm down. Don't go faster than a walk in bad weather, as your horse could slip or spook. Remember to watch his expression. Keep a firm grip on the reins or lead rope, but don't yank on the horse's head. If you are leading him, walk to the side, not in front. If you are walking in front of him and he bolts, he could step on your heels. If you are carrying a flashlight, take it out, especially if it's dark. Be careful not to shine it in the horse's eyes!

, If you have time, give him a good grooming. Check his feet for stones, and put a blanket on him. If his tack got wet during your ride, dry it so the leather won't rot. If his halter was soaked, switch it with a dry one until it dries. Hang your saddle pad over the stall door to dry. Before you leave the stable, give him a carrot for being so good!

Follow your veterinarian's treatment recommendations.",How to Remove Urine Smells from a Pet," Removing the urine smell from your pet will require giving him a good bath. When you are at the pet store, you may not find a shampoo that is specific to removing a urine smell. Fortunately, a thorough cleaning with a mild, good-quality shampoo will likely be effective in getting the smell out of your pet’s skin and fur.


Deodorizing shampoos are available that contain baking soda or citrus to neutralize bad odors.Oatmeal- or aloe vera-containing shampoos are usually a good choice, since they will not dry out your pet’s skin.If your pet has a skin condition (e.g., allergies, dry skin), your veterinarian can recommend a shampoo that is specific to your his medical needs.
Do not use a human shampoo (even baby shampoo). Although human shampoo is not toxic to your pet, it can contain ingredients or fragrances than can irritate his skin.In addition, human shampoo has a pH that could lead to a skin reaction.Consider purchasing a pet-safe conditioner that will help replenish the natural oils in your pet’s skin and coat.;
, If you do not have one already, purchase a brush from your local pet store. The brush will be needed to smooth out your pet’s coat before bathing him.The type of brush you need will depend on the texture of your pet’s coat. The staff at your local pet store can help you pick out the type of brush that would work best for your pet.


For your cat, a metal comb and a bristle or rubber brush are useful for smoothing her coat and removing dead and loose hair.If your dog has a short and smooth coat, bristle and rubber brushes will loosen and remove dead skin and dirt. If your dog has long hair, slicker and bristle brushes are most useful., You will probably need at least a few towels for the bathing process. If you are bathing your pet in your tub, you will need to put a towel in the bottom of the tub to create a non-skid surface.At least one or two more towels (depending on your pet’s size) will be needed to dry off your pet after his bath.


Super-absorbent towels are available at your local pet store.If you have a cat or very small dog, he’s probably small enough to be bathed in your sink. However, since he smells like urine, it is advisable to bathe him in your bathtub instead of your kitchen sink.
Pet-specific blow dryers are available at your local pet store if you prefer to dry your pet with a blow dryer. They can be especially useful for long haired pets. Make sure that your pet is comfortable with the noise of a blow dryer before using it to dry him off., Dogs and cats are not particularly fond of being bathed. The experience will be even less enjoyable for them if you have to keep running back and forth to get the shampoo, towel, etc. Having everything in one place will make the bathing process easier for you and more tolerable for your pet.In addition to the aforementioned bath supplies, you may also need some cotton balls that you would place in your pet’s ears to keep protect them from water.A small washcloth will be needed to clean your pet’s face. Pouring or spraying water directly on your pet’s face would be a very unpleasant experience for him.Nail trimmers could also be helpful if you want to trim your pet’s nails before you bathe him. Trimming your pet’s nails may keep you from being scratched when you are bathing your pet.It is important not to get shampoo in your pet's eyes, so you may want to consider purchasing an pet-safe eye ointment.Ask your veterinarian for recommendations on which ointment to purchase.
If you are bathing your pet outside, you may want to purchase a pet-specific tub (available at your local pet store) or kiddie pool to set him in.If you are bathing your pet in your tub, it would be helpful to place a piece of steel wool in the drain to keep his fur from clogging your drain.Keep plenty of treats on hand. The treats will help your pet make a positive association with bath time.

, If you have a dog, it is important not to call him to where you are. He will be expecting something positive when he comes to you, and may be very disappointed that you called him for something as unpleasant as a bath.It is preferable to either pick him up and carry him to the bathing spot (if he’s small enough), or walk him there.You can pick up your cat, but he may run and hide from you if he knows that you are about to give him a bath. Entice him out of his hiding spot with a treat.
Do not be surprised if your pet becomes resistant once he realizes where he is going. If this happens, do not raise your voice.Be gentle yet firm with him, since bathing him will be necessary to remove the urine smell.
Once you get to the bathing area, it may be helpful to give your pet a treat or two.
If you are bathing your pet in the tub, place a towel in the tub before he gets in.

, Brushing your pet will remove any tangles or matted fur. Doing this before you bathe him is very important—trying to brush through tangles or mattes is next to impossible when your pet’s coat is soaked with water.Start from your pet’s neck and slowly work your way down to his tail.

, If your pet’s nails have not been trimmed in a while, your pet could easily use his nails to scratch you while you are bathing him. If you are comfortable with doing so, trim your dog’s or cat’s nails. If you have to use styptic powder on any of the nails to stop bleeding, wait until the bleeding has stopped before bathing him.

, Keeping water out of your pet’s eyes, ears, and face will be important when you are bathing him. If your pet will let you, place one or two cotton balls in each ear.If he doesn’t like having cotton balls in his ears, use extra care to avoid getting water in his ears.Remember to take the cotton balls out of his ears when you have finished bathing him., If you are using a hose or handheld shower head to bathe your pet, make sure that the water pressure is not too forceful. You can also use a large plastic pitcher to pour water over him.If you are giving your pet a bath inside, make sure that the water is no hotter than lukewarm.You may not be able to adjust the temperature of the water if you are bathing your pet outside.
To get your pet comfortable with the sensation of getting wet, put the water on his back and shoulders first. Once he has relaxed, wet his neck and work your way back to his tail., Place a generous amount of shampoo in your palm and use your fingers to gently work the shampoo into your pet’s coat and skin, starting from his neck and working your way back.By working back from his neck, you will prevent any fleas from moving up his body towards his face and head.You will probably need to shampoo your pet more than once to get the urine smell out. Keep in mind that shampoo has the tendency to strip the skin and coat of natural oils,so you do not want to shampoo him too many times.
Use a washcloth dampened with plain water (no shampoo- bold) to wash your pet’s face.Talking with your pet in calming voice and offering him occasional treats will help make the bathing process more enjoyable for him.
Be careful not to get the shampoo in your pet's eyes.

, Shampoo residue can make your pet feel itchy, so you want to make sure that you rinse out all of the shampoo before drying him. If you are bathing your dog, be mindful that your his hair is thicker than your own, so you will need to take extra time to work your fingers through his hair when rinsing out the shampoo.You will know when you have rinsed out all of the shampoo when you no longer see any suds in the water that you are using to rinse him.
Consider giving your pet a quick sniff after you have finished rinsing him to see if you can smell urine. If you still smell urine, consider shampooing and rinsing him again.
If you placed a piece of steel wool in the bathtub drain, remove and discard the steel wool after you have finished rinsing him off.

, If you are bathing your cat, wrap her snugly in a towel and dry her off in a warm, draft-free location in your home.You may need more than one towel to dry off your dog, depending on his size. If you know that your dog is going to want to shake as soon as you finish rinsing him off, you can try gently holding his muzzle with your thumb and forefinger—a dog cannot shake his body if you hold his muzzle still.You can let go of his muzzle once he is at least somewhat dry.
If you are using a blow dryer to dry your pet, set it on one of the cooler settings to prevent thermal damage to his skin.Your dog may be tempted to bolt and rub on something (e.g., furniture, carpet, ground) as soon as you have finished drying him off. Consider keeping him in a relatively confined area, such as the kitchen, until he is completely dry., Reward your pet with a generous amount of positive reinforcement. This can be a combination of treats, new toys, verbal praise, and extra playtime., Your pet could smell of urine because of medical problems that make it difficult for him to control his urination, such as urinary incontinence or a recurrent urinary infection.For example, your cat may continually urinate outside of litterbox because of a urinary infection that makes it unable for him to get to the litterbox in time.


Your dog may not be able to hold his urine until you can take him outside for a walk, which may cause him to urinate inside the house.

, If you clean your pet but notice that the smell of urine keeps coming back, and see a change in your pet's urinary habits, it is time to take your pet to your veterinarian for a thorough examination. Your veterinarian can perform various diagnostic tests, such as bloodwork and a urinalysis, to determine the cause of your pet smelling like urine.


If your cat has arthritis, he may smell like urine because his arthritis prevents him from adequately grooming and cleaning himself.An obese cat would also be unable to groom and clean himself.

, If your veterinarian has diagnosed your pet with a urinary tract infection, he or she will likely recommend an antibiotic to clear the infection.If your cat is arthritic, your veterinarian will probably recommend an anti-inflammatory medication to help ease the joint pain. More complicated medical problems, such as kidney failure, may require more extensive treatment and dietary changes.

Introduce your pets in a neutral space.,
Heap praise on your pets equally.,
Demonstrate that good things happen when the new pet is present.,
Maintain your routine.",How to Prevent Jealousy in Current Pets when Getting a New Dog1," Instead of introducing your new dog to pets inside your home, allow them to meet in a neutral space such as an off-leash dog park. This can allow the new pets to get used to the new dog without feeling like their space is invaded.Let your pets meet the new dog in a neutral space in your home if they don’t go outside. For example, an empty garage or the laundry room are more neutral than a living or bedroom.
Have your pets gradually get used to each other in the neutral space. Then move to your yard or another shared space. If your pets and new dog have trouble as you move to different spaces, take them back to the last place they got along.;
, Once you bring all of your pets into the same spaces, you may discover new tension between them. One way to reduce this tension and prevent jealousy is by heaping praise on the older pets and your new dog.Give your pets praise when you’re giving the new dog attention. This reminds your older pets that you haven’t forgotten them. For example, “Come over here, Sam. See, Todd is a really nice puppy. You both like being pet! What a good boy you are!”
Distribute your attention evenly between all of your pets. For example, give your jealous pets a treat and then quickly give the new dog some love. After that, return to your older pets and show them the same love., Your new dog probably wants as much attention as your older pets. This may be especially true if the other pets are shunning the new dog. Turn this into an opportunity to show both of the pets some love by providing your older pet a treat or something else it loves.Give your older pets a treat, a toy, or some other form of love when the new dog approaches you. This helps the older pets realize that the new dog isn’t a threat, but something that comes with delightful treats. For example, if your cat is sitting on your lap and the new dog approaches you, pet your cat on the head and give it a treat while greeting the new dog.

, Animals love routines and any interruption to it can make them lash out, especially if it involves a new dog.One of the main sources of jealousy in older pets is food resources. Incorporating your new dog into the older animals’ routine can keep everyone happy and may prevent jealousy that the new pet has disrupted the daily flow.Avoid making exceptions for the new dog, which can increase jealousy towards it. For example, don’t let the new dog sleep with you if there is a “no dogs on the bed” policy.
Keep up with old habits including going for a walk, playing the same games, and feeding them at the same time every day. This can help strengthen your pets’ bond.
Make any absolutely necessary changes to your routine as slowly as possible. This allows your older pets to adjust and get used to the new dog.

Think about your pet's personality.,
Examine your pet.,
Be careful and choose wisely.,
Think, do you want a common name?,
Get a name book.,
Get inspired by your own life.,
Avoid names that may be too long.",How to Name a Pet," Does he/she remind you of a person, character, object, or s personality. Is there an activity he/she loves to do? Is there a character trait that he/she reminds you of? Any of these could suggest a good name. For example, is Star Wars a popular thing in your family? Maybe name your pet after Chewy or Leia!;
, Lets take a dog for example. The dog is dark and reminds you of something you like. You may name him/her Smoky or Stormy. Maybe he/she smells a lot, so you could name him/her Stinky. If you like cartoons, you may name him Pluto.

, If you are naming a puppy or a kitten, pick a name that can grow with the pet as he ages. Names such as Baby, Pups, or Bae for a child animal seem cute at the time, but when they grow to an adult, no so much. Is your dog skinny or fat? Just because it is at the time you name it, does not mean in the future it will not loose/gain weight, so don't name a pet Boney or Chubs. Also avoid names that might alienate people, such as ""Cujo,"" which could remind others of the killer dog from the movie, ""Cujo."" It's also smart to nix names that are tongue twisters and that can be confused with training cues or everyday words. ""Mo,"" for example, can be confused with ""no,"" ""Tom"" can be confused with ""come,"" and ""Trey"" can be confused with ""stay.""

, Maybe you think a common, usual, name will work bets for you dog. Think of some names like Grace or Riley. Max or Macy. Jack, Tina, Biscuit, Kipper, Skipper, Noddle, or Bubbles.

, A name book that is used to help pick baby names can help you find a name! Search through some names in the book. Hey, who knows, you could find some very interesting names!

, Maybe name your pet ""Joker"" if you like comic books. Do you collect or have interest in coins? Maybe name your pet Lincoln after the penny.

, Example, the name Princess Peanut Butter is cute, but to long to say to your pet every minute or two. Unless you plan to call the pet with the long name some quirky nickname like PPB, choose a name that is simpler that you could call the pet.

Be patient.",How to Introduce New Pets," In addition to predator/prey relationships, some animals can be very territorial and aggressive towards members of their own species. Learn what you can beforehand and you'll have a better idea of how much peaceful interaction you can expect your animals to have.;
, Think about how your pet acts around you and around other animals.

, Moving into a new home is enough of a challenge without the added stress of meeting your other pets. If you can, set aside a room for your new pet to stay in for the first few days.

, If you are going to house your new pet in a separate room to start with, restrict the current pet's access to that room well in advance so the change can feel more gradual. Make sure your current pet still gets all the time care and attention he or she is accustomed to.

, Give each animal items with the scent of the other animal on them. Allowing the animals to smell each others' scent before they actually meet can help make the face to face meeting easier.

, Use a crate, child gate, or a leash to control the animals during the interactions. Try to keep the animal who has the most potential to hurt the other one under direct control, either through a leash or a crate. Give the animal that is more likely to be frightened a safe haven where the other pet cannot reach him or her.

, Remember that not all animals are going to be friends, so even disinterest is positive. Offer praise, treats, toys, and affection to promote good interactions

, Don't just throw your animals together and go watch television. Pay attention to the way they interact during different times of the introduction.

, Animals need time to adjust to each other, especially if your old pet is older and the new pet is a baby. It might take months before your animals really begin to accept each other.

Recognize signs of jealousy.,
Practice basic obedience.,
Separate pets as necessary.,
Reduce sources of stress.",How to Prevent Jealousy in Current Pets when Getting a New Dog2," Pets show their jealousy in different ways. Some pets may growl or sulk. Knowing the signs of jealousy in a pet can help you more quickly deal with it. Signs of jealousy include:Change in appetite
Growling or making other noises at the new dog
Misbehaving, such as chewing up things or going to the bathroom in the house
Clinging to you more often, such as nudging or standing right by you
Sulking

, New dogs walking past or towards you or even sitting on your lap can cause a lot of commotion and jealousy in older pets. Practicing basic obedience such as telling the new dog to stay can prevent any jealousy in your other animals.Tell your new dog to sit or stay when another pet approaches you. Then give your other pets some attention. If your new dog doesn’t listen and fights for your attention, ignore it until its calm and then immediately offer it a pat on the head and some praise.

, In some cases, your pets may continue to be jealous of the new pet. This can happen even with basic obedience. If this is the case, separate your pets during the day. This gives you the chance to spend time with each animal individually until they are used to each other.Spend time with each of your animals individually. For example, give your new dog a bone to distract it while you pet a cat or another animal. You can also put your new dog outside for a few minutes while you and your other pet

, Reducing any behaviors that cause other pets stress may dissolve tension and prevent any jealousy between them and your new dog.Make sure each of your pets has some personal space and that the new dog doesn’t invade it.
Watch to see if your new dog takes other pets’ toys or teases them. Minimize this behavior with basic obedience training commands such as “sit,” “no,” and “give.”
Keep an eye out for dominant behaviors or attempts by pets to scare each other. Separate them until they calm down and then reintroduce them with treats and praise.

Set up separate spaces for each animal.,
Teach family members to handle different situations.,
Work with a professional trainer.,
Consult your vet.",How to Prevent Jealousy in Current Pets when Getting a New Dog3," Your other pets may feel like your new dog is invading their space. As a result, setting up separate spaces for your pets can help minimize jealousy and prevent conflict if they are just not getting along. Placing each pet in crates, within baby gates, can help each pet settle down before a conflict starts over territory.Avoid “punishing” your dogs with separate spaces. Simply step in and say, “Ok, Sam and Ally, you’re going to your crates until you can settle down.”
Make sure the separate spaces are big enough for each pet. These spaces should also be comfortable and have toys or other items that your pet enjoys.

, It’s important that your family participate in preventing jealousy and conflict between your new dog and other pets. Make sure that each family member knows ways to positively interact with each pet as well as how and when to separate them.Make sure your family members involve both pets when paying attention so that neither feels left out.
Tell small children that they shouldn’t get involved in conflicts with pets. Instead, let them know when they should tell you if there’s a problem or conflict.

, Animal trainers and behavioral specialists can identify problems with your pets’ interactions and behaviors. Working with an animal behavior specialist may minimize jealousy and conflict in your pets. It can also teach you how to effectively resolve issues.


Consider hiring a professional who works using only positive reinforcement. This can help your pets associate each other with positive experiences.
Let the professional know any behaviors that concern you. Ask questions during sessions so that you can effectively deal with problems.

, If your new dog and other pets are not getting along despite your best efforts, schedule an appointment with your vet. They can observe the pets together and make suggestions on how best to prevent conflict and possible injuries.


Tell your vet all information related to each pet’s behavior when they’re alone or together. This can help the vet figure out what may be causing the jealousy and/or conflict.
Incorporate any suggestions your vet has into your pets’ daily routine. If this doesn’t help, contact your vet again.

Find the soiled spot as quickly as possible.,
Soak up the urine with newspaper or paper towel.,
Soak the soiled area with enzymatic cleaner.,
Cover the area while the cleaner takes effect and while it dries.",How to Remove the Smell of Cat or Dog Urine from Upholstery1," It can become extremely tricky to remove urine if your pet's urine soaks deep into the upholstery and even into the wood frame. In most cases, you can spot the urine spot right away. If not, you can try:


Using your nose. Pet urine has a very distinct smell and often smells like ammonia.Using a blacklight. Because of its chemical properties, pet urine shows up under a blacklight, specifically its scent-creating chemicals even when the stain has been dried or are days old. Outline these area in chalk or mark then with a sticky note to help you clean then when you turn on the lights.;
, Soak up as much urine as you can by pressing newspaper or paper towels against the upholstery with gloved hands. Press down hard and deep.


You can place the soaked up newspaper or paper towel where you'd like your pet to urinate. This is a positive way to help let them know where to urinate as you'll be transferring their urine smell to the appropriate location.

, Leave it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes and then blot up as much cleaner as you can with newspapers, a towel, or paper towels. Finally, leave it to dry.


You may need to repeat this step again if the enzymatic cleaner doesn't get rid of the odor or stain the first time.
Urine is composed of things that require enzymes to break down its chemical bonds.For example, when a pet pees, urea in their urine breaks down into a bacteria that produces the distinct scent of urine. As the urine is left longer to decompose, the smells become worse. Fortunately, most chemicals in urine are easily removed by water and other household detergents. However, uric acid is the only component that is not water soluble and must be broken down by enzymes.

, Some pet owners will cover the area loosely with aluminum foil or lay their laundry basket upside down over the stain to prevent their pets from urinating in the area again. It also helps to remind family members not to step or sit on the stain while it dries.


It can take a long time, even days, for the stain to completely dry, especially if the stain is particularly deep and more enzymatic cleaner was needed.
Aluminum foil is a great deterrent tool to use to discourage your pet from urinating in the upholstery again. The crinkly sound and feel of foil when your pet steps on it is not pleasing to your pet or might even scare them off of the upholstery completely.
For pillows or cushions, you can leave them out in the sun to dry as long as you can.

Create a water and fabric softener solution.,
Wet the area with the solution.,
Rub the seats with your gloved hand.,
Vacuum the loose hair.,
Remove hair with a balloon.",How to Remove Pet Hair from Your Car1," You can either use 100% water or create a solution that consists of equal parts fabric softener and water.The ingredients used in fabric softener help to loosen hair and will make it easier to clean the pet hair from your car.;
, Once you have created the solution, you need to wet the upholstery or carpeting in your car. You can do this by wearing a pair of rubber gloves and dipping the fingertips into the solution, or by filling a small spray bottle with the solution and spritzing the desired area., While wearing a rubber glove, brush your hand along the desired area. The hair should collect on your glove. Every so often dip your gloved hand into the solution to remove the hair and keep your finger tips wet.


Alternatively, you could scrub the area with a pumice stone to collect the hair.

, Vacuum over the area once it has dried in order to collect any excess hair. For the best results, use a vacuum attachment that has small rubber bristles., You can also blow up a balloon and rub it across the desired area. The balloon will create static electricity and as a result, the pet hair will stick to the balloon. Once the balloon is covered with hair, use your hand to collect the hair and throw it in the garbage."

Train your dog.,
Visit your veterinarian.,
Talk with a trainer or behaviorist.",How to Keep Small Pets Safe Around a New Dog1," Properly training your new dog is essential to ensuring your smaller animal’s safety. Making sure that your dog responds to verbal commands will enable you to have complete control over your animal. When it comes to introducing your animals, your dog needs to be able to respond to “sit” and “stay.”, You should visit your veterinarian before introducing any new animals into your home. You will want to make sure that the animals currently residing in your home can handle the stress of a new dog. Conversely, you want to make sure that your new dog will be okay mixing with the animals in your house.Some breeds of dog are incapable of living with other animals. Make sure you research dog breeds before bringing home a new dog.
Smaller dogs, like Chihuahuas, tend to be very territorial and may not get along well with other animals.
Golden retrievers, Anatolian shepherds, great Danes, and other large dogs tend to get along well with other pets., A dog with behavior issues may need some professional help before you introduce it to the smaller animals in your home. A behaviorist or a trainer may be able to correct your dog’s behavior issues. However, some dogs are unable to adapt to life with smaller animals and should not be kept in close quarters with pets that they may hurt.If your dog has some behavior issues, be sure to talk with a professional before introducing it to other animals.

Understand only enzymatic cleaners can get rid of urine odor completely.,
Use baking soda and vinegar.,
Combine hydrogen peroxide, dish detergent, and baking soda.,
Use Listerine as a deodorizer.",How to Remove the Smell of Cat or Dog Urine from Upholstery2," Uric acid can only be broken down by enzymes. Unfortunately, cleaners like baking soda, soap, and vinegar will only mask the smell temporarily. These alternative methods are good to use if you don't have enzymatic cleaner on hand at the moment of the incident. Eventually, you will need to clean the area with enzymatic cleaner.


In time, the smell of urine will surface again and your pet will be able to smell it and associate the location as an appropriate place to urinate.

, When baking soda and vinegar are combined, they create water and sodium acetate (or salt).The sodium acetate acts as an abrasive to to scrap away stubborn residues. Separately, baking soda helps to eliminate odors while vinegar sanitizes and removes deposits. There are several steps to using this cleaner:


Soak up as much urine as possible from the upholstery before you use any cleaning agent.
Sprinkle baking soda on the stain and let it sit for 5 minutes. The baking soda will work to deodorize the stain.
In a spray bottle, mix equal parts of water and distilled white vinegar. Alternatively, you can just use a container or a bowl.
Spray or pour the water and vinegar mixture directly onto the baking soda-covered stain. Let it sit for another 5 minutes.
Blot the stain with a towel or paper towel to dry.

, Hydrogen peroxide helps to break down certain chemicals within urine through oxidation. There are several steps to using this cleaner:


Soak up as much urine as possible from the upholstery before you use any cleaning agent.
Sprinkle baking soda on the stain and let it sit for 5 minutes. The baking soda will work to deodorize the stain.
Mix half a cup of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 1 teaspoon of dish detergent in a bowl.
Pour the hydrogen peroxide mixture onto a towel and blot it on the stain.

, Concentrated, Listerine has a strong smell that can help mask the odor of urine. Pour some Listerine in a spray bottle and spray it on any urine stained area.


This method does not clean or remove urine stains. It only helps to add a fresh smell to your home.

Locate the stained areas.,
Vacuum the area thoroughly.,
Pre-treat the badly stained areas.,
Steam clean the area.,
Fill the solution compartment with the cleaning solution.,
Fill the water compartment with hot water.

,
Select the CLEAN setting on your machine.,
Follow the instructions that were provided with your cleaner.,
Let the carpet sit for about 15-20 minutes.,
Rinse the carpet using only hot water.,
Let the carpet dry completely.",How to Remove Pet Stains and Odors from Carpet with a Steam Cleaner," Often the stained areas are also home to odors caused by uric acid, bacteria and yeast colonies, so that is the place you need to concentrate your cleaning effort. To achieve a finished appearance that is uniform and odor-free, though, you will need to clean the whole carpet methodically, expending just a bit more time and effort in the badly stained areas.;
, Be sure to remove as much loose debris as possible.

, Do this just before you start the steam cleaning process. Use a single commercial degreaser/cleaning agent that will not discolor the carpet. If you are unsure of the action of the selected cleaner, test it in an inconspicuous place, say in a closet or under a couch. A carpet remnant is a perfect test ground.



It is best to use a pre-treatment that is formulated to work with the cleaning solution you will use in the steam vac. The pretreatments and cleaning solutions will have been thoroughly tested to ensure that no untoward chemical reactions between the two will occur.
Gently work the chemicals into the badly stained spots using a moderately stiff bristle brush. Work the chemicals down into the carpet fibers, but do not overdo the scrubbing to the point that the strands start to fray or unravel.
Do not let the spot-treated carpet dry out. Instead, proceed directly to the steam cleaning step.
Stick to one pretreatment chemical. If you mix chemicals, you may get unexpected results: generation of dangerous or lethal gases, creation of harmful acids, generation of harsh caustic solutions.

, Steam cleaners for the home are a good investment, especially if you are a pet owner. If you do not have a machine, rent one from a local hardware store, a grocery store or home improvement center.

, Most cleaning formulations will contain a surfactant which serves to break the stain-carpet fiber and odor-carpet fiber bonds and lift the offending chemicals to the surface. In addition to removing stains and odors, the cleansing agents kill bacteria and other micro-organisms and bind chemicals that are the source of odors. A properly formulated cleanser will act to loosen existing bonds by replacing them with strong bonds which float the offending chemicals to the surface where they are picked up by the vacuum action of the steam cleaner.

,, The steam vac cleaner draws the solution from the tank and mixes it with water as you slowly run the machine over the carpet.

, Typically, you will use methodical, overlapping strokes. Many will specify a forward and return stroke dispensing the cleanser/water mixture and a complete forward and return stroke over the same area to pick up the loosened stain and odor particles. Make sure to take your time in the cleaning process and do not get in a big hurry. It takes a while to loosen and pick up particles that have been in place for a long time. Allow the machine to do its work by moving slowly and methodically in the recommended pattern.


For odor-filled carpet, dispense additional liquid so that the pad becomes saturated. This will require that you spend additional time removing the moisture from the carpet and pad. Extra drying time will also be required. It is best to plan on using air conditioning and strong fans to ensure that drying is completed as quickly as possible. Any moisture that is left will create the perfect environment for mold growth.

, This will allow the solution to get deep into the carpet, break down all the stains, and deodorize the carpet and padding.

, Do not add any more cleaning solution at this time. By rinsing, you are flushing the carpet of everything that has been loosened.


Rinse until the return water begins to come back clean. Be patient. It may take as many as eight or ten rinse passes. You are pulling up everything that has been trapped below the carpet.

, Use your air conditioner in conjunction with available dehumidifiers and fans to assist the drying.

Collect hair with a lint brush.,
Gather hair with tape.,
Replace the tape periodically.",How to Remove Pet Hair from Your Car2," Purchase a lint brush from your local drug store. Remove the protective layer and then roll the brush along the desired area of your car. Your pet’s hair will stick to the lint brush and can easily be removed from your vehicle.

, Wrap a piece of duct tape or packaging tape around your hand with the sticky side facing outwards. Then pat the area of your car that is covered with hair with your taped hand. The hair will stick to the tape and be easily removed from your car., Check the tape periodically to make sure that it is still collecting hair. Once the piece of tape is completely covered with hair it will lose its adhesiveness. When this happens, throw that piece of tape in the garbage and resume the process with a new piece of tape.

Brush your pet before each car ride.,
Cover your seats with a blanket.,
Crate your pet in the car.",How to Remove Pet Hair from Your Car3," In order to prevent your pet’s hair from getting all over your car, you should brush your pet thoroughly before each car ride. This will remove any loose hairs from your animal and can help to decrease the amount of hair your pet leaves behind.Depending on your pet and the breed, you should brush their hair regularly to manage shedding.

, Place a blanket or towel on the seats or floor of your car. This can help to reduce the amount of hair that will get into your upholstery. It is also much easier to remove the blanket from the car to wash it once it is covered in your pet’s hair., Keep your pet contained in their travel carrier while you are in the car. This is not only safe for you and your animal, but it will also help reduce the amount of pet hair in your car.Place the crate on the floor or secure it to a seat using a seatbelt so that the crate can not roll around while you are driving.

Designate a room for each animal in your home.,
Place each animal’s food and bedding in its designated area.,
Rotate which animal gets to roam around.,
Keep both animals confined if no one is home.",How to Keep Small Pets Safe Around a New Dog2," Before you bring home your new dog, you will need to make a space for each animal. This space should have a door that you can close to keep the animals away from each other. If you cannot use a room with a door, consider putting up guards, like puppy or baby gates, to keep your animals away from each other.If your small animal is already residing in a room that can be isolated, you should leave them in there. The familiar surroundings will make adjusting to the arrival of the new pet easier.
If you have multiple small animals, you can consider keeping them in a room together as long as they get along with each other. However, if you have a small dog and a small cat, you will likely want to give them their own rooms.
If your animal spends most of its time in a cage, you should keep its cage in a separate room and place it up where a dog cannot get to it.

, Once you have designated a safe space for each animal, you should put each animal’s food, water, bedding, litter box, toys, and other items in that area. This will ensure that your small animal has all of its needs met while staying safe from your new dog. It also keeps the new dog from destroying or eating your animal’s things.You especially do not want your new dog eating your smaller pet’s food or waste. A dog will eat the other animal’s food, which is not formulated for it and can make it sick. Dogs will also get into your cat’s litter box and eat the animal’s feces.
This is particularly important if you have a big dog and a small dog. If you feed them at the same time, the two animals will fight with each other over the food. This can lead to a smaller dog getting hurt by the bigger one., When you are home, you will want to let your animals out of their respective safe spaces at different times. This will allow them some time to exercise and familiarize themselves with each other’s scents. Let them explore your home and investigate each other’s scent.You might also consider rubbing your small animal’s scent on a rag and letting your dog smell it. This will help it become familiar with your small animal’s scent before you do a leashed introduction.If your dog paws at the door of the area where you are keeping your smaller animal, you will likely need to visit trainer before introducing your animals.

, When you are away, make sure that you securely place both animals in their safe space. You do not want to come home and find that your new dog has destroyed your home while chasing your smaller animal, or worse, injured or killed it. Make sure that you shut doors and lock any gates before leaving.This is also a great opportunity to crate train your new dog.

Set up an introduction.,
Secure both animals.,
Allow both animals in the same room.,
Reward both animals for good behavior.,
Repeat introductions until both animals are calm.,
Let the smaller animal explore.,
Phase out the leash.",How to Keep Small Pets Safe Around a New Dog3," Once your dog has calmed down and become less obsessed with the other animal, you can begin planning an initial introduction. Pick a nice neutral space that both animals are familiar and comfortable with. Be sure to feed and exercise both animals before the meeting so that they are both relaxed.If you have not trained your dog to respond verbal cues, you should do so before initiating an introduction. It will be difficult to control your dog without some training.

Introducing a new puppy to your cat may be slightly easier considering a cat can usually handle itself with a smaller dog. You may not need to be as cautious when introducing a puppy.

, Because your new dog will likely get excited and possibly attack your smaller animal, you will want to have it on a leash so that you can control its behavior. You should also put the other animal in its carrier or cage. These added levels of protection will ensure that neither animal gets hurt.If you are introducing your cat to a new dog, consider trimming your cat's nails so that it does not scratch the dog’s sensitive nose.

, Once you secure both animals, place them in the same space. Your dog will likely be very curious about the other animal and want to sniff it. If your dog is particularly excited, restrain it using commands or the leash. Try to limit the initial interaction to only a few minutes.Birds, hamsters, and rabbits may run away from a particularly rambunctious dog. You will likely want to keep them in their cages initially.Do not be surprised if your cat hisses at the dog.
Use verbal cues, like “sit” and “stay” to keep your dog under control.
You should never leave the animals unsupervised during introduction sessions.
Consider having a someone else hold the smaller animal during initial introductions. Controlling both animals may be difficult on your own.

, As the animals interact nicely with each other, provide verbal praise and treats. This is particularly important for reinforcing the dog’s good behavior. During the introduction sessions, it is also important that you maintain an even yet firm tone. This will help both animals stay calm.Constantly scolding your dog during introductions may lead it to become aggressive towards the smaller animal.

, In order to familiarize both animals with each other, you will need to hold introduction sessions regularly over the course of a month or two. Initially, you will want to keep these introduction sessions short. However, as the animals become more familiar with each other, you can increase the length.Go for multiple short introductions instead of fewer long sessions.
Try to bring the two animals physically closer together each session. If either animal is excited or fearful, move back a little and take a break.

, After a few sessions or when your dog calms down, let the smaller animal explore on its own. Use verbal cues, like “sit” and “stay” to keep your dog seated and calm. Reward the dog with treats and praise if it responds to your commands and plays nice with the other animal.


Make sure that the animal has an escape route in case the dog gets away from you.

, Once your animals have had consecutive days without an incident, you should let go of the dog’s leash. However, be prepared to grab it in case your dog goes after the smaller animal. After multiple sessions of good behavior with the leash released, take your dog off the leash and rely on verbal cues. Gradually increase no-leash sessions until there are no incidents and both animals are comfortable.This final step should not be rushed and pursued with caution. It can take weeks or even months to introduce your animals to each other.

Run your vacuum over the urine spot again.,
Sprinkle baking soda over the urine spot.,
Mix hydrogen peroxide with dishwashing liquid.,
Spray the hydrogen peroxide mixture on the urine spot.,
Allow the area to dry completely.",How to Neutralize Dog Urine Odors1," Using the vacuum, suction all of the urine from the carpet or flooring. Doing this will help to prevent the urine from getting absorbed into the carpet or flooring’s deeper layers. Urine that has been absorbed into the deeper layer will create an odor that will be very hard to get rid of.If you do not have a vacuum cleaner, lay several sheets of newspaper or paper towels down on the spot. This is best to do right after the dog has urinated. Remove the soaked paper and replace with new sheets until it seems like the paper is not soaking up anymore urine. This will help to keep the urine from sinking deep down into the carpet.;
, If you were unable to soak up the urine right when it happened, and you’re not sure where the smell is coming from, you can use a cheap UV blacklight to find the spots where your dog has urinated. Once you’ve found the spots, mark them by placing an object next to them so you don’t lose them again.


Cheap UV lights can generally be bought at your local home goods or hardware store.

, The solution should be 50% vinegar and 50% water. For instance, if you use two cups of water, you should mix it with two cups of vinegar. The amount of liquid you use will depend on how large the spot where your dog urinated is., You will want to use a generous amount to make sure that the solution absorbs into the deeper layers of the carpet, eradicating the urine odor along the way. The solution will help to soften and neutralize the hardened, deeper layers of the urine spot.

, Use a new sponge or washcloth to scrub in the vinegar mixture. Doing this will help to remove the hardened layers of urine in both the superficial fibers of the carpet (the surface of the carpet), as well as the deeper layers of the carpet or flooring.

, Once you have scrubbed in the vinegar, run your vacuum over the spot again to pull up the vinegar mixture and the urine that is has broken up and neutralized.


Again, if you don’t have a vacuum, use paper towels or newspaper to soak up the vinegar and broken up urine.

, Once you have dried the area, pour baking soda over the entire affected area. Make sure that the baking soda covers all of the affected carpet or flooring. The baking soda will help to ensure that the urine gets neutralized.

, Mix 250 ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide with 5 ml of plain dishwashing liquid in a spray bottle. Make sure that the hydrogen peroxide you use is 3%. Anything higher may damage your carpet or flooring. You should also make sure that the dishwashing liquid you use does not contain any bleach, as this may also stain your carpet., Lightly spritz the area covered in baking soda. Once you have sprayed the mixture on to the spot, put cleaning gloves on and give the spot a good scrub with a new sponge or a brush that you don’t plan on using again (unless it is for this same activity).

, This may take several hours. Once the spot it no longer damp to the touch, run your vacuum over it again to pick up any excess baking soda that may not have gotten mixed in with the hydrogen peroxide mixture.


Be aware that old urine spots most likely discolored your carpet.

Try a vinegar baking soda mix.,
Apply stain-removing detergent.,
Rent a carpet shampooer.",How to Remove Cat Hairball Stains from Carpet2," Pour baking soda over the old stain. Combine a tablespoon of clear dish washing liquid, a tablespoon of white vinegar and two cups of warm water. Dab the mixture onto a brush and scrub the spot for a few minutes. Let it sit for an hour, then blot the spot to remove the stain.Repeat the process if the stain remains after the spot has dried.
You can let the mixture sit on the stain overnight for older stains.

, If residue remains where your cat left a hairball, you can use a laundry stain remover product to get rid of it. Generously apply the stain remover product to the spot, scrub it with a clean towel, and dab it dry., Most hardware or grocery stores will rent out carpet shampooers. Buy a steaming soap that specializes in pet stains and follow the directions to the afflicted spot.


Choose the machine size based on the area you need to cover. If it is only a small stain, you can rent a small cleaning machine but may want more with a wider cleaning area if you anticipate doing your entire floor.

Heat up a clothing iron.,
Treat the stain with a stain remover solution.,
Heat the stain.,
Remove the iron and towel.",How to Remove Cat Hairball Stains from Carpet3," For some very old stains, it might be difficult to remove them using a cleaning solution. Applying heat from an iron can help loosen the stain. Make sure the iron is filled with water and heat it to warm on a low setting.Take precautions to avoid burning the carpet. Do not heat the iron to a medium or high setting, as this could melt the fibers in your carpet.

, You can use carpet cleaner, stain remover, or a simple mixture of dish soap and water. Saturate the stain before applying the iron.

, To protect the carpet, you can fold a towel in half and place it over the spot. Place the iron on top of the towel. Keep the heat setting on low and do not press on the carpet like you would clothes, as this could burn your carpet.


Check on it often. Keep the heat low and do not make direct contact with the carpet.
Keep the iron in place for one minute.

, The idea is that the iron and moisture should be able to pull the stain up into the towel. Check under the towel to make sure the iron is working or whether it needs more time. Once the stain appears to be gone, you can remove the towel and iron.


You may want to dry the spot thoroughly with a paper towel, but you shouldn't need to do anything else to remove the stain.

Use water to dilute the urine-stained area.,
Use an enzyme-neutralizing cleaner.,
Launder or replace any items that retain traces of spray.",How to Remove Cat Spray2," If your cat’s urine stain has set for a long time, you will first need to dilute the stain. Get a bowl of warm water, and use a two clean towels to alternately dampen and blot dry the stained spot. Do this several times to dilute the stain as much as possible.Remember to only dampen the area. Getting it too wet could cause the stain to spread.
You may want to wear rubber gloves for this.
Your towels may start to take on some of the odor. However unpleasant, this is what you want, as it indicates you are drawing the stain out of the soiled area. Swap out your towels and continue diluting the stain as much as possible.

, Once you have diluted the stain as much as possible, use an enzyme neutralizer, such as Nature’s Miracle, Odoban, or Zero Odor. These cleaners break down protein-based molecules in cat urine. After doing a test for colorfastness on a hidden area of your carpet or upholstery, spray the area so that it is completely saturated with the cleaner, and allow it to air-dry.Air drying can take multiple days, so it may be helpful to cover the area with plastic to keep the cleaner in place and away from your cat and other household members.

, If stained areas remain after using the enzyme neutralizer, remove slipcovers from any soiled items and launder with cool water. Air dry to avoid shrinkage in the dryer.


If your cat has sprayed a carpet, consider replacing the rug pad beneath. These can contain synthetic materials that are more difficult to clean.

"
"
Start by cleaning the area with a damp cloth.,
Try a hydrogen peroxide mask.,
Use an enzyme-based cleaner formulate for wood floors.,
Sand the wood down and refinish.",How to Remove Cat Spray3," Remember that cats spray vertically, so you will need to clean the whole area including the floor, baseboards, and lower part of your wall. Start by cleaning the area with a damp cloth to remove any wet spots or visible traces of the urine. From there, you can apply a stronger cleaner as necessary., This method is particularly useful if the urine left a stain. Soak a clean facecloth or hand towel in 3% hydrogen peroxide until it is saturated but not dripping. Wring the towel if necessary, and place the towel on the sprayed area. Let the towel sit for 2-3 hours to clean the offending spot.If you need to press the towel against a baseboard, use something disposable, such as a Tupperware, to wedge the towel against the wall.
If the floor or baseboard is still damp when you remove the hydrogen peroxide towel, wipe the area dry with a clean cloth., An enzyme-based cleaner is the best way to help you remove odor from your floors, but wood floors need a gentler formula than carpet. Use an enzyme-based cleaner formulated for wood floors by wetting the sprayed area with the cleaner and allowing it to air dry.

You may want to test the cleaner on a small area of your floor before applying it to a highly visible place to ensure it won't cause any damage.
Enzyme-based cleaners should not be used directly on untreated wood or subflooring, as this could cause damage.

, If the stain is not dissipating, you have the option of sanding down your wood floor. This is not to be undertaken lightly because it is expensive and time consuming, but it may be the best option to remove very deep staining. Sanding removes the top layer of wood and will effectively polish out the spray by buffing away the surface layer it lives in. Contact a professional contractor for a quote to perform this work without damaging your floor.Sanding is simpler to do with unfinished wood (a deck, for example) but can be accomplished with finished hardwood inside. A professional can help you match your existing finish properly.
A contractor can replace and paint a piece of your baseboard if necessary. If the spray sunk deep into the wood, a contractor can also help you replaced smelly or damaged areas.

Spay or neuter your cat.,
Address any stressful changes in the environment.,
Get your cat checked at the vet for any underlying health problems.,
Look for litter box-related issues.,
Use repellent products as necessary.",How to Remove Cat Spray4," Spraying is a natural mating behavior in intact cats. The easiest solution to problem spraying is to neuter or spay your cat before 5 months of age if you haven’t already. Your cat’s urge to spray should drop off dramatically., Changes in your cat’s environment, such as a new cat or new baby, may seem small to you but they could feel upsetting for your cat. Try to address any new environmental shifts by providing slow introductions to new people and keeping your cat’s routines as close to normal as possible., If your cat’s urination problems persist despite its being neutered and your addressing environmental issues, you may want to take them to the vet. Some health problems, such as neutering complications or urinary tract infections, can cause your cat to urinate more frequently outside the litter box.Make a note of where your cat goes in the house, how often, and when your issues started so you can relate them to your veterinarian.

, Cats are naturally inclined to use a litter box, so if your cat is avoiding theirs, there may be a reason for it. Try changing the location of the litter box or the litter you use. If you have multiple cats, make sure there are enough litter boxes so that each cat has one., Certain repellent products, such as Four Paws Keep Off! and Nature’s Miracle Pet Block Repellent, can discourage your cat from spraying in the house. Test your materials for colorfastness, and then spray the repellant thoroughly on the area your cat urinates.

Purchase epsom salt or potassium alum.,
Make your cleaning mixture.,
Combat urine spots.,
Soak up the mixture.",How to Neutralize Dog Urine Odors2," Both of the products can be found at your local grocery store or pharmacy. The product you use is up to you--both epsom salt and potash alum have the same effect on dog urine--the get rid of bacteria in the urine spot that can be increasing the bad smell, and they absorb any leftover liquid., Dissolve 200 grams of Epsom salt or potassium alum in 800 ml of water to make a liter of solution. Transfer the solution in a spray bottle to make applying the solution to the affected area easier., If the urine is fresh, soak up the urine with paper towels, newspapers, or a wet/dry vacuum. After you’ve soaked up as much urine as you can, spray the cleaning mixture on to the affected area. Let it soak into the urine spot for several minutes.


If the urine spot is old, spray the affected area and then let the solution soak into the spot for 30 or more minutes. The longer you let the solution sit, the more effective it will be in breaking up and dissolving the urine that has dried in the carpet.

, Once three or four minutes have passed, wipe it off and soak it up with paper towels or a wet/dry vacuum. This will ensure that you remove all of the dissolved urine that the mixture broke up. Once you have gotten the spot relatively dry, spray the solution on the spot again. This time, let it dry. The dried solution will continue to fight against bacteria in the affected spot."
"
Try enzyme products.These products contain enzymes that decompose urine into molecules that can be eaten by specific non-odor causing bacteria present in their products.,
Give oxidizing products a try.,
Make sure you use the right amount of neutralizer.,
Apply the neutralizer.",How to Neutralize Dog Urine Odors3," Examples of these products are:


100% Natural Pet-Dog-Cat Urine and Stain Odor Remover by Nature’s Secret Weapon ™, Stink-Free ™ Urine Odor Remover, Roco & Roxie Supply™ Pet Stain and Odor Remover, Best Carpet Enzyme Cleaner by Bubba’s Rowdy Friends Pet Supply Inc., and Urine-Off™

, These products can be directly sprayed on areas with remnant urine odors. These products neutralize odors by killing odor-causing bacteria, and can prevent remarking. They also contain substances that remain after application that continue to neutralize odors, bind to waste products, and prevent bacterial and mold growth.


Examples of these products include Oxyfresh Pet Deodorizer with Oxygen and Shout Turbo Oxy Stain & Odor Remover., When using either enzyme or oxidizing products, it is important to use more product than the amount of urine that your dog expelled. A medium-sized dog can usually pass half a cup of urine, so in that case, you would use a cup of neutralizing agent.

, For this step, it is best to read the instructions on the bottle or package that the neutralizer came in. However, most neutralizers need to be applied to the spot and then let to soak for a certain amount of time. When they have soaked into the carpet, it is best to vacuum the spot or soak the liquid up with paper towels, newspaper, or old fabric towels.


When washing urine off of concrete, use three times the amount of neutralizer. For instance, if your dog passed roughly one-fourth a cup of urine, you would use three-fourths cup of neutralizer.
When treating carpets that have been heavily soiled with urine on multiple occasions, it is best to lift the carpet up and clean the floor as well. If you do not, there is a good chance that the odor will continue to linger.
If you are treating a car seat, use double the amount of neutralizer to account for the fact that the foam in car seats is much more absorbent that most carpets and floorings.

Distract your pets when they’re outside.,
Supervise your pets when outdoors.,
Keep your pets indoors.",How to Stop Your Pets from Eating Cicadas1," When cicadas emerge, they seem to be just about anywhere and everywhere you look. Plus, they’re easy targets for pets, since they fly slowly and stay low to the ground. Try distracting your pets to keep them from eating the cicadas.If you’re out walking your dog, give it treat or gently redirect it away from the cicadas.
If you see your dog snooping around outside in your backyard during cicada season, distract it with a game of fetch or by giving it a command.;
, If you usually just open the door and let your dog outside by itself, consider going out with your dog during cicada season. This is particularly important if you have recently sprayed your yard with pesticides.Because the cicadas would have the pesticides on them when they emerge, your dog could become very sick if eats them.


If you see your pet getting close to some cicadas, use distraction strategies to prevent your pets from eating the cicadas.
If you have an outdoor cat, it may not be practical to supervise it all the time.

, Except for walks and supervised time outdoors, keep your pets indoors as much as possible during cicada season. If you have an outdoor cat, consider keeping it indoors until after cicada season. Below are some strategies for making an outdoor cat an indoor cat:Make the transition slowly. For example, feed your cat indoors and keep it indoors for increasingly longer periods of time after it finishes its meal.
Make the indoors playful and inviting. Give your cat lots of toys and spend a lot of quality time with it when it’s inside.

Limit your pet’s intake of cicadas.,
Look for GI symptoms.,
Watch your pet for an allergic reaction.",How to Stop Your Pets from Eating Cicadas2," Despite your best efforts, your pets may insist on eating cicadas, even though they have a disgusting taste. Since cicadas can make your pets sick, don’t let your pets eat more than one or two of them at a time. While your pet is busy munching on a cicada, try to shoo away other nearby cicadas.If you’re lucky, your pets will try to eat one cicada, then spit it back out because it tastes bad.If your pet doesn’t like the taste, it probably won’t try to eat anymore.

, A pet who eats cicadas can suffer from vomiting or diarrhea. If your pets get sick after eating cicadas, you will likely see cicada parts in the vomit or diarrhea. Seeing this might make you feel sick, too!Fortunately, the vomiting and diarrhea are temporary and can easily be treated with medication.Rarely, a pet who eats a lot of cicadas may suffer from intestinal blockage.If your pet’s intestines are blocked, your pet may start vomiting frequently.Intestinal blockages require intensive veterinary treatment.

, Rarely, pets can have a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylactic shock, when they eat cicadas.Anaphylactic shock occurs within a few seconds to minutes after exposure to an antigen (substance that causes an allergic reaction). Signs of anaphylactic shock include pale gums, cold limbs, breathing trouble, and excessive drooling.Anaphylactic shock is an emergency. If your pets have this severe reaction to eating cicadas, take them to your vet right away.Call the vet when you’re on your way so they can be prepared to treat your pets as soon as you arrive.

Install barriers around your garden.,
Make the soil undesirable.,
Grow plants your pets don’t like.,
Create a separate garden area for your cat.,
Teach your dog where to urinate in the yard.,
Use deterrent devices near your garden.",How to Stop Pets from Urinating in Your Plants1," Physical barriers will prevent your pets from getting near your outdoor plants. Examples of barriers are chicken wire fences and wire cages.These materials are available at your local home improvement store. Talk with the store’s staff for advice on building a fence or cage according to the specific size of your garden.


To build a chicken wire fence, pound metal stakes into the ground and attach the chicken wire to the stakes.A chicken wire fence does not need to be very high. A fence about two feet (0.6 meters) tall will probably be high enough to keep your pets out of your garden.A wire cage would be useful if you think your pets may climb or jump over the fence.
A fence or cage could be unsightly.;
, If installing barriers is not practical for you, try different strategies to keep your pets out of your garden. Making the soil undesirable applies to cats, since they are sensitive to how a surface feels when they urinate or defecate. The cool, damp soil in your garden feels good to your cat, so you will need to make the soil feel uncomfortable.Below are examples of items you can use:Chicken wire
Rough-textured mulch
Prickly pine cones
Chop sticks or plant stakes, placed about 8 inches (20 cm) apart
Large, flat stones
Citrus (lemon, orange) peels

, If your pets don’t like the plants in your garden, they probably won’t urinate there. Examples of plants that cats dislike are rue (blue foliage that has a bad odor), geraniums, and various herbs (such as thyme).Neither cats nor dogs like prickly or thorny plants, such as rose bushes, barberry, and hollies. If you want to plant a prickly plant, choose one with short thorns that won’t damage your pets’ eyes.The coleus plant has a strong odor that dogs and cats dislike., If your cat likes to be in your garden, create a separate garden area that is just for your cat. To make the garden, plant some catnip and place some sand on the ground so your cat can sleep comfortably.In the area where you don’t want your cat to go, continue to make it inaccessible or undesirable.

, If your dog has made a habit of urinating in your garden, you will need to train your dog to urinate in another part of the yard. When your dog needs to urinate, take it outside on the leash to a spot in the yard away from your garden. After your dog urinates, immediately reward it. Take your dog to this same spot each time.


The immediate reward will teach your dog to associate urinating in a certain spot with something good.

, If nothing seems to work with keeping your pets out of your garden, consider using commercially available deterrent devices. For example, install a motion-activated water sprinkler.Anytime your pets go near the garden, they will get sprayed with water. After getting sprayed a few times, your pets will learn not to enter the garden to urinate.


Other deterrent devices use light or sound to scare pets away."
"
Put the plants out of your pets’ reach.,
Spray repellent on the plants.,
Make the plants undesirable to your cat.,
Give your dog an alternate activity.",How to Stop Pets from Urinating in Your Plants2," If your pets can’t get to the plants, they will not be able to urinate in them. For cats or small dogs, place the plants on the tops of tall pieces of furniture. For larger dogs, you may have to move the plants to areas of your home where your dog is not allowed to go.If you have large plants, it may not be practical to move them.
Be aware that your cat may be able to jump on top of furniture to get to the plants.
If moving the plants is not practical or doesn't work, you will need to use other strategies to keep your pets away from those plants.

, Repellent sprays are available at gardening centers that can keep pets away from plants. However, the repellent can wear off and become less effective over time.If you decide to try a repellent spray, follow the label instructions carefully.

, If you can’t block your cat’s access to the plants, make them undesirable. For example, place chicken wire on top of the soil, bending it upwards so your cat can’t easily step on it. Other ideas for undesirable items are:Aluminum foil or irregularly shaped pebbles placed on the soil
Double-sided tape or citronella spray around the top of the pot
Citrus peels around the plant

, If your dog is urinating in your indoor plants, especially if you have a male dog, it is likely marking its territory. If moving your plants is not feasible, give your dog something positive to do in the area with the plants, such as eating or playing. Once your dog associates that area with a positive activity, it will be less likely to urinate on your plants.Dogs will also urinate indoors if they feel stressed. If you know which stressful event (a visitor to your home) triggers the urination, distract your dog with another activity when that event occurs. For example, if you have a friend come over, give your dog a food puzzle toy to play with to keep it busy and less stressed."
"
Discipline at the right time.,
Spray your cat with water.,
Interrupt your dog.,
Do not use harsh punishment methods.",How to Stop Pets from Urinating in Your Plants3," Despite your best efforts, your pets may continue urinating in your plants. Disciplining your pets will help them understand that urinating in your plants is unacceptable. To discipline your pets effectively, do so at the moment of the bad behavior. If you discipline after the fact, your pets will not know what they’re being punished for.If you don’t see your pets urinating in the plants, do not discipline them.

, If you see your cat urinating in your garden or in an indoor plant, use a spray bottle to squirt your cat with water.The sudden spray of water will startle your cat, but won’t physically harm it. After a few times of getting squirted with water, your cat will learn not urinate in your plants.


Use only one or two squirts of water.
Be aware that, if your cat’s outside on a hot day, it may enjoy the spritz of water., When your dog looks like it’s about to mark (lifting leg, sniffing around), interrupt it by saying ‘Oops!’ or some other firm word (no, stop). After you get your dog’s attention, give it a command, such as sit or lie down.Giving your dog a command will shift your dog’s focus to doing something that’s incompatible with urinating.

, Even if you’re frustrated with your pets urinating in your plants, do not yell at or physically abuse them. This is especially important if your dog is urinating in your plants because of emotional stress. Yelling at your dog would just make the stress worse, rather than stopping the bad behavior.Harsh punishment would make your pets fearful and wary of you.

Clip your horse’s coat.,
Keep your horse healthy.,
Recognize the signs of heatstroke.",How to Cool a Horse," When it’s warm outside, it is especially important to cool off your horse after a ride or workout. To start cooling down your horse, find a shady area where you can walk him at a leisurely pace. Walking helps your horse cool off by creating a small breeze and keeping his blood circulating through his muscles and skin.The blood circulation helps remove waste products, such as lactic acid, from your horse’s muscles that accumulate during exercise.How quickly a horse cools down can depend on several factors, such as age and overall health. Although there is no set amount of time for you to walk your horse, plan to walk him for at least 10 to 15 minutes to start the cooling down process.;
, Your horse’s heart and breathing rates will have gone up during exercise, so he will need some time to bring them back down to normal. While you are walking your horse, find his pulse by placing three fingers on the blood vessel that runs underneath and inside of his lower jaw. To calculate his heart rate, count his pulse for 15 seconds, then multiply by 4.A horse’s normal heart rate is 30 to 40 beats/minute. After exercise, your horse’s heart rate could be as high as 140 to 200 beats/minute.Watch your horse’s flank rise and fall to count the number of breaths/minute. Count the breaths for 15 seconds, then multiply by 4. Your horse normally takes 8 to 16 breaths/minute.
Right after exercise, your horse will likely be taking big breaths, but his breaths will become more shallow as he cools off.Those big breaths allow excess heat to exit through his lungs.A breathing rate that is faster than the heart rate could signal a serious health problem.Call your veterinarian if this is the case for your horse.
Monitor your horse’s heart and breathing rates throughout the cooling off process so you know when they return to normal.

, In a process called evaporation, your horse will naturally sweat to release excess heat. If you exercise your horse on warm days, though, sweating probably will not be enough to cool him off sufficiently. Running cold water over your horse, with either a sponge or hose, will be a tremendous help in cooling him down.On hot days, or after a particularly vigorous workout, start with running cold water over your horse’s chest, the large jugular grooves running down his neck, and his lower legs. These areas have small blood vessels that can carry cooled blood to the rest of his body and help him cool off more quickly.You can also hose off your horse’s large muscle groups first (e.g., back, glutes), since they tend to hold a lot of heat.The cold water helps your horse stop sweating earlier, which can prevent him from becoming dehydrated.It is a myth that hosing down a horse with cold water will harm him.If you choose to use a sponge, you may want to have someone help you so you can sponge more of your horse’s body more quickly.
Alternate between applying cold water for about 30 seconds and walking your horse. It is important to keep your horse moving throughout the cooling off process.You will know your horse has cooled off sufficiently when the water running off underneath his body feels cool to the touch., An alternative to sponging or hosing down your horse is misting him with cold water. When moisture is absorbed from the skin with misting, that moisture takes some of your horse’s excess heat with it. If you already have a misting system set up, you can use this to cool down your horse.You may find that frequent misting is more effective at cooling off your horse than hosing him down.If you do not have a misting system, consider adding a nozzle to your hose that has a ‘mist’ setting.
You may want to consider installing a sprinkler system just outside your pasture that can periodically mist your horse with cool water to keep him cool., During exercise, your horse’s digestive system slows down. The blood that would normally go to his gut to fuel digestion instead goes to his muscles. As your horse cools down, his digestion will still be on the slow side, so gulping water quickly would not be a good idea for your horse.If he drinks water too quickly, he may develop colic or muscle cramps.As you are walking your horse, offer him small sips of cool water from a bucket. Keep in mind that, if he’s still breathing hard, he may not be ready to drink water. Continue to offer it to him, and he will drink when he’s ready., Although sweating will help your horse cool off, the sweat contains important electrolytes, such as salt and potassium. Electrolytes help maintain your horse’s nerve and muscle functions, so it is very important for you to replenish these electrolytes after he exercises. One way to replenish them is to give your horse a pre-formulated electrolyte paste via a dosing syringe.Since your horse’s digestive system will still be a bit slow right after exercise, you may want to wait until he has fully cooled down before offering him the paste.
Electrolyte powders are also available that can be added directly to your horse’s water.Your horse may not like the taste of ‘electrolyte-laced’ water. If this is the case, offer him plain water instead.Follow the label instructions carefully to avoid overdosing your horse on electrolytes. Speak with your veterinarian if you are unsure about the most effective way of replacing your horse’s electrolytes.

, Even when it’s cold outside, your horse can still work up a sweat when he exercises. His thicker winter coat will trap his body heat, though, making it harder for him to release that extra heat through sweating. After his exercise session, walk him for about 10 to 15 minutes.Offer your horse frequent sips of water during the walk., A cooler is typically made of wool or fleece and helps keep your horse warm and dry as he cools off.When you dismount from your horse after your initial walk, place the cooler on his back without removing the saddle. Removing the saddle too soon would expose your horse’s back muscles to a rush of cold air and potentially cause them to cramp.Loosen the saddle instead of removing it.Walk with the cooler on your horse for a few minutes, then remove the saddle. With the saddle removed, place the cooler back on your horse and continue walking him to let him cool off., Thatching your horse means stuffing a thick layer of hay or straw underneath the cooler to help your horse dry off. It is useful for horses that typically take a long time to dry off after exercise. You could also use a blanket instead of a cooler.In addition to thatching, you could rub your horse down with a clean, dry towel to dry him off more quickly., With the cold weather, you may think you are doing your horse a favor by putting multiple blankets on him to keep him warm. Since a horse’s body temperature does not cool down as quickly as a human’s body temperature, all of those extra blankets could cause your horse’s muscle to warm up all over again. He would then start sweating again, making it take even longer for him to cool down., Place your horse back in his stall only after he is completely dried and cooled off. Your horse could catch a chill if you return him to his stall too soon after exercise.If you can still feel sweat on his body, or if his heart and breathing rates are still elevated, it is not yet time to put him back in his stall.


If your horse is used to being covered with a blanket in the winter, cover him with a clean, warm blanket when he is completely cooled and dried off.Call your veterinarian if your horse has not cooled down after an hour.He may have an underlying medical problem that is making it harder for him to cool down.

, In addition to cooling off your horse after he exercises, you should also make sure he stays cool during his normal, non-exercise activities in the summer. One of the best ways to do this is to give him unlimited access to fresh, cool water. The average horse can drink more than 25 gallons (6 liters) of water on a warm day, so you will need to replenish your horse’s water buckets frequently.Your horse’s water intake will increase in the summer because he is losing more fluid through sweating.Grass and commercial diets typically provide most of your horse’s water requirements, but he will still need access to fresh water at all times.
Although it may be tempting to set some buckets out in the pasture when your horse is grazing, the water can warm up and even become stagnant.You may want to keep the buckets in a cool, shaded area when your horse is out of his stall. Keep buckets of fresh water in his stall as well., During the summer, it would be too hot to turnout your horse during the heat of the day. Instead, pick times of day that are cooler, such as the early morning or after the sun has set. If possible, consider turning out your horse overnight., If your horse has a thick coat, he will have a hard time keeping cool when it is warm outside. His thick coat will trap in heat and make it harder for him to release excess heat through sweating. Keeping a short coat is especially important for horses with Cushing’s disease, since this disease can cause a horse to develop a long, thick coat.Do not make your horse’s coat too short, since his coat protects him from the damage of the sun’s rays.Consult with your veterinarian if you are unsure about the particular coat thickness that would best suit your horse.

, Your horse’s health can affect his ability to regulate his body temperature effectively. For example, intestinal parasites can increase your horse’s likelihood of developing heat exhaustion. In general, if your horse is sick or injured, he may not have enough internal energy to use his natural methods of cooling off.Maintain your horse’s deworming schedule to keep his intestinal parasite burden low.If your horse has a chronic illness like Cushing’s disease, manage his disease according to your veterinarian’s recommendations. The better you manage his disease, the better he may be able to keep cool when it’s warm outside.

, Heatstroke occurs when your horse’s natural cooling systems cannot overcome his body’s excess heat. It is a very serious medical condition that requires immediate veterinary care. The sooner you can recognize the signs of heatstroke, the sooner you can get him the care he needs.With heatstroke, your horse will be sweating profusely, or not sweating at all. In addition, his heart rate will remain elevated even after he has had sufficient time to cool off.Your horse will also look very depressed and lethargic if he has heatstroke.If you examine your horse’s gums, they will feel dry and sticky to the touch. The capillary refill time (the amount of time it takes for his gums to turn pink after you press on them) will be greater than three seconds.Horses with heatstroke will have a temperature above 106 degrees F/41 degrees C."

Find a credited riding instructor.,
Have lessons bi-weekly, at a minimum.,
Have the right attire.,
Wear a riding helmet.,
Wear the appropriate pants.,
Wear appropriate footwear.,
Keep hair out of your face.,
Add other items as needed.,
Know your limits.,
Put the helmet on for every single ride.,
Learn how to perform an emergency dismount.",How to Be Safe on a Horse," Find a horse riding school, barn or farm that specializes in the type of riding you want to learn. Once you find the credited instructor that teaches the kind of riding you want to do, start taking lessons.;
, For the lessons to be effective it is recommended for lessons at least once every other week, but ideally at least once a week is best.

, This depends on the type of riding you want to do, but there are a few staple things every equestrian needs to wear whilst riding.

, This is the most important part of your riding attire. It must fit properly and be certified to the helmet standards relevant for your country. (For example, ASTM/SEI certified.) Remember that the helmet must be replaced every time you have a bad fall, except for a few special helmets. Don't skimp on the quality of a helmet because a helmet can save your life––they regularly prevent severe injuries to many riders.

, Wear thick pants, jeans or breeches. This is to protect your legs from saddle sores and to help you grip the saddle.

, Wear hard toed shoes with a 1-inch heel; this will prevent your foot from slipping through the stirrup.

, Wear your hair back with a hairband and perhaps a hairnet as well.

, You may find some of the following help:


belt
chaps
gloves
crop.

, Don't try anything on your horse that you haven't done with your riding instructor. Until you can be considered an advanced rider yourself, it just isn't worth the problems that might arise for you when it's unfamiliar.


Don't push yourself too hard, or you'll end up getting hurt.
You know yourself when you're at your limits. If your instructor asks you to do something and you're uncomfortable doing it because you don't think you're ready, don't do it. Just tell your instructor that you feel unsafe doing it yet.

, Even if it's just a short ride from one end of the yard to the other, put that helmet on. Horses can get spooked by anything. Even if you think your horse is bombproof its not. You can't predict a gunshot, or a deer jumping out of the woods. Also, don't ride without a helmet because you think you have a ""bond"" with your horse. Horses are flight animals and they run at the first sign of danger, regardless of that special bond.

, This is important because if you stay on the horse, you could end up getting more hurt than had you dismounted as safely as possible, rather than getting bucked off and thrown into a wall.


If you do fall off, make sure that you're out of the horse's way. However, stay down for a few minutes to make sure you're not hurt too badly. Then, slowly assess yourself, first wiggle your fingers and toes. Next, your hands and feet. Then feel your head, check for any blood. Next slowly, slowly, sit up. Sit for a minute, then try moving your legs. Next slowly stand up and retrieve your horse.

Seek veterinary attention.",How to Avoid Poisoning Your Horse," You may have indoor and/or outdoor housing for your horse. How you manage the housing is important to maintaining your horse’s health and wellbeing. Examining your horse’s stall, barn, and any connected buildings for potential poisons can minimize the risk of poisoning your horse.Examine the floors for any matter that may poison your horse. This includes manure, urine, sewage runoff, or bathing water. A horse may accidentally ingest it or it could mix with the animal’s water source.
Look at surfaces such as tables, dishes, or anything else that may contact your horse.
Remember to check your horse’s trailer for potentially dangerous substances including old hay.;
, Most horse owners keep hay, haylage, or other types of organic matter in a horse’s stall and barn. It’s important to remove old or soiled organic matter regularly. If you don’t, it can expose your horse to botulism-causing toxins than can lead to general weakness and paralysis.Be aware that horses are especially susceptible to botulism-causing toxins. This can occur through ingestion or contact with an exposed wound. Typical symptoms of botulism poisoning in horse are: inability to eat, drooling, nasal discharge, muscle tremors, difficulty getting up, and difficulty breathing. It can also cause death.

, Just as organic matter can poison your horse, so can inorganic substances that may be around the barn. Chemicals used to kill rodents, birds, snails, slugs, ants, and weeds can also poison your horse. Making sure that these chemicals are stored securely from your horse’s housing can minimize the risk of poisoning your animal., They should be stored separately from horse feed, water, and horse equipment.
Keep the chemicals dry and temperature-controlled, too. Store substances that might react together separately.
Recognize that many rodenticides and pesticides contain sweet flavoring or grain bases to attract pests. They may also taste good to your horse, so it’s important to make sure you keep these securely closed and away from the reach of your horse. Follow label directions when setting baits so that you don’t use an amount that could poison your horse.
Keep herbicides securely closed in the barn or in your garage. You probably use them to control weeds outside, which can cause changes in a plant that make them attractive to horses. Your horse may have diarrhea or colic if poisoned by herbicides.

, Although rare, food sources may also contain potentially toxic substances for your horse. The most common form of food poisoning is through moldy corn. Changing your horse’s food and water at least once daily may reduce the risk of injury or death from potential toxins.Remove any moldy corn immediately. It can carry a fungal toxin known as mycotoxin. This can cause equine leukoencephalomalacia (ELEM), a rapidly progressing, often fatal neurologic disease. The symptoms of ELEM include head-pressing, circling, muscle tremors, weakness, or strange, sometimes violent behavior.
Make sure your horses have adequate grazing area, as well. If not, supplement their pasture with clean, dry, and fresh hay.

, Pollution and human carelessness can lead to environmental buildup of heavy metals such as lead or mercury. Determining if your horse’s housing or pasture is exposed to heavy metals can prevent poisoning. Signs of metal poisoning include cause lack of appetite or diarrhea. Ask local authorities about heavy metals present in your home area. You can also have your property professionally tested for the following heavy metals:Arsenic
Cadmium
Fluorine
Selenium
Lead
Mercury
Molybdenum
Sulphur

, Let your horse graze or run in your own pasture or those known to you. This can reduce exposure to potentially poisonous plants, water sources, and animals.Avoid over-grazed pastures. Horses will usually eat around toxic plants and weeds, but may eat them in an over-grazed area because they’re available.
Contact your local county extension office to ask about plants and water sources in areas you don’t know. This can help you decide whether or not to try new grazing or exercise pastures, woods, and fields. You can find your local county extension at http://npic.orst.edu/pest/countyext.htm.

, The best way to avoid poisoning your horse with plants is by inspecting the pasture or training areas for toxic species. Also look at the trees around the pasture and buildings, whose leaves could blow into grazing areas. There are a variety of toxic plants that can cause symptoms in your horse such as irritation or weight loss and even death.The ASPCA provides a comprehensive list of plants toxic to horses at http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/horse-plant-list. Common toxic plants to horses found in or near pastures include:Buttercups
Jimsonweed
Nightshades such as horse nettle, bittersweet nightshade, tomatoes and potatoes
Pokeweed
Japanese yew
Wild cherry
Black walnut
Maple trees. Red Maple leaves only become toxic once they’ve been shed, for example.
Poison hemlock
Water hemlock
Alsike clover
Rhododendron
Azalea
Mountain laurel

, Many people like to run their horses outside of pastures. This can provide you and your horse a lot of enjoyment, but can also present potential poisons beyond plants. You may find a pond or stream that looks like a potential drinking spot for your horse. But even the clearest, and cleanest-looking water source can poison your horse. Stick to water sources that you know to reduce the risk of poisoning your horse.Avoid any water sources that have obvious blue green algae. This often grows in ponds in hot, dry weather and can cause diarrhea, muscle tremors, convulsions, liver failure, and even death in your horse.
Look at the color of water or smell it. If it has an unusual color or odor, it’s best to avoid this source.
Test well water on your property often to ensure it doesn’t contain harmful bacteria. Water with blue algae means a high level of organic content, usually from nearby runoff. Consider testing unknown water sources outside of your property to reduce the risk of poisoning.
Pay attention to where you let your horse drink while on trail rides or camping. A good rule is to avoid standing water, which can have pathogens, and to let the horse drink from moving water sources.

, Some live and all dead animals present a potential risk for poisoning for horses. Bugs such as flies and mosquitoes are pests to horses, but the blister beetle can cause death. Dead and rotting animal carcasses also often contain toxins that can cause conditions such as botulism. Avoiding blister beetles and animal carcasses can minimize the risk of poisoning your horse.Keep your horse away from dead or dying animals. This is especially important if your horse has open or exposed wounds. Remove any dead pests, such as rodents, from stalls and barns as well as food and water sources.Protect your horse from blister beetles by purchasing alfalfa hay from growers who take precautions during harvesting. The most common way alfalfa hay poisons horses is through ingestion of blister beetles crushed during the drying process., If your horse is exposed to a toxic substance, it may begin to exhibit symptoms of poisoning. Symptoms may not appear immediately or may develop quickly. In some cases, sudden death can occur. Watching for the symptoms of poisoning in your horse can help you get prompt and potentially life saving treatment. Common symptoms of poisoning include:Abdominal pain
Constipation
Diarrhea or straining
Weight loss
Restlessness
Unsteadiness
Blindness
Breathing difficulties
Head pressing
Problems swallowing or excessive salivation
Lethargy
Tremors
Twitching and fitting
Collapse
Loss of appetite
Colic
Depression
High temperature
Laminitis, which is the inflammation of tissue that attaches the bones and tendons in the hoof to the hoof wall.

, If you suspect or know your horse has ingested a poisonous substance, call an animal poison control center. Experts at these centers can advise you the best way to proceed with your horse, be it home treatment or seeing a vet.Recognize that there are many different animal poison control centers, some of which may charge you a fee for the consultation. Different poison control centers you may want to contact include:


State organizations, such as the Florida Poison Information CenterNational Animal Poison Control CenterASPCA Animal Poison Control, You should seek veterinary help in nearly all cases of suspected poisoning. If you know your horse ingested a toxic substance and/ or is showing symptoms of poisoning, contact your horse’s vet immediately. The vet will usually pass a stomach tube and give the horse activated charcoal or magnesium sulfate to absorb the poison. The vet may also have to give the animal intravenous fluids and other treatments to minimize the risk of long-term damage or death.Avoid watching and waiting for symptoms. This may increase your horse’s risk for lifetime injury or death.
Inform the vet when, where, and how the poisoning happened.
Your vet will also be able to advise you on what to do before they can arrive to help. Do not treat your horse for suspected poisoning without consulting the vet first.

Bring your pets inside immediately, if possible.,
Find pets shelter elsewhere if you are not home.,
Take large animals to a safe location.,
Keep your pet on a leash or in a carrier.,
Make your pet as calm and comfortable as possible.",How to Take Care of Pets During a Hurricane1," During a hurricane, it's important to remain under cover. Once there has been a hurricane warning issued in your area, or you suspect that a hurricane is building, you should bring your pets inside your home. Giving them shelter alongside your other family members is key to taking care of them during a hurricane.If your pet is hesitant to come indoors, pick them up if you can or put a leash on them and pull them inside. It is better to use a little bit of force with your pet than to leave them outside during a dangerous hurricane.
Don't let your pets leave your shelter. Keep doors and windows closed, and restrain your pets if necessary.;
, If you are not home during a hurricane you may need to find it shelter somewhere other than home. Find someone nearby, such as a neighbor, who is willing to take in your pet if you are away from home.If you live in a hurricane-prone area, it is a good idea to plan ahead with a neighbor who would be willing to take your pet in an emergency situation. Make sure this person has your phone number, instructions for your pet's care, and a signed authorization from you that they can seek veterinary care for your pet.

, Not all pets can fit in your home during a hurricane. If you have nowhere to shelter a large animal, such as a horse, at home, you will need to find it shelter elsewhere. Contact neighbors or family members to see if they have room to shelter your horse, or other large animal.

If moving your animal to a safer location is not possible, you will need to decide between moving large animals to whatever shelter you have or turning them outside., While you are in a sheltered area with your pet, it's a good idea to keep a hold on them. Letting your pet run free will increase the risk of it getting loose or that you won't be able to grab it if you need to evacuate quickly.

If your pet is used to being on a leash, such as most dogs are, then that may be your best option. This will allow you to bring your pet along with you without having to carry it. However, if your pet has never been on a leash, such as is the case with most cats, then a carrier is probably your best option.
Even after a disaster you may want to keep your pet on a leash for a few days. Your pet may not recognize its normal areas and could run off due to confusion., It is important to try and keep your pet comfortable and calm while you are taking shelter. Try petting it, talking to it, and giving it items that it is used to, such as a blanket or bed that it typically uses.

Your reassurances can go a long way towards lowering your pet's stress in this type of situation.

Take your pets with you if you evacuate.,
Evacuate early.,
Put your pet in a carrier, if possible.,
Keep your pet calm.",How to Take Care of Pets During a Hurricane2," If a location is not safe for you, it is not safe for your pets. Any pets left behind may not survive a serious hurricane and it is not likely that you will be allowed back into an evacuation zone to get your pets later.This may mean that you cannot go to a shelter, as most emergency shelters do not allow pets. However, you may be able to go to a friend or relative's home, or to a motel that accepts pets.

, If you are concerned about a storm and the safety of your pets, it is better to be safe than sorry. In addition to erring on the side of caution, getting pets loaded into carriers and then loaded into cars will be much easier when a storm is not at its strongest.If you do wait for a mandatory evacuation, you may be told by officials to leave your pets behind.

, If you have a container to put your pet in, then you should use it. Keeping your pet in a crate or carrier will allow you to more easily move it when you need to and it will minimize the risk of it running off due to fear.

If you don't have a crate or carrier for your pet but they are used to using a leash, then put one on them. Having some way to control your pet's movements is important in an emergency.

, In addition to keeping your pet safe and healthy during an evacuation, you should spend some time reassuring it and calming it before, during, and after the hurricane. While you have a general sense of what is going on, your pet doesn't. Pet it and reassure it so that the stress of this unusual experience is not overwhelming."

Make an emergency evacuation plan.,
Have emergency supplies gathered.,
Make sure your pets are wearing identification tags.,
Bring pet supplies if you evacuate.,
Put pet supplies in your sheltered area.",How to Take Care of Pets During a Hurricane3," Before a hurricane warning is issued, you should have an emergency evacuation route planned out. In addition to a route, your emergency evacuation plan should also include how you will transport your pets and what supplies to bring with you in an emergency evacuation.

This is especially important if you have large animals, such as horses, because they cannot be brought into typical shelter areas, such as basements or hurricane shelters., If you live in a hurricane-prone area, it's important to have emergency supplies gathered before an incident occurs. An emergency supply kit for your pets includes:One week supply of food and fresh water
Medications, if your pets take any
Vaccination records and other medical records
Pet insurance policy, if you have one
Photos of your pets, for identification if they get lost
Cat litter and pan, if necessary
Manual can opener, for canned pet food
Food dishes
Pet carrier
First aid kit and other supplies

, It is important that your pets are always wearing id tags so that if they are lost during an emergency, like a hurricane, they can be identified by anyone that finds them. This makes it more likely that they will be returned to you if they are found.Consider also getting your pet microchipped, if possible, so that there is a secondary way for them to be identified in case they get lost.

, When evacuating it is important to bring along some supplies for your pet. It may be hard to find your pet supplies in the aftermath of the storm, so bringing them along is important for their survival. At minimum, you should bring:Enough food and water for a week
Medications, if your pets take any
Vaccination records and other medical records
Pet insurance policy, if you have one
Photos of your pets, for identification if they get lost

, While packing away food and water for your family, include pet food and water as well. Place it all in the basement, cellar, or whatever other low-lying spot you are using for shelter.

Also make sure that you have a way to keep your pet contained, if necessary. This may mean that you bring a pet crate into your shelter area if you have a cat or you just keep your dogs leashed during the storm. This will also help you to keep control of your pet after the storm, when its usual areas may be full of hazards."

Choose a horse-riding helmet certified by a safety organization. Have helmet fits correctly before you mount. Ideally, have it checked professionally when you buy it, and return periodically to have it re-padded.


Don't use a bike riding helmet instead of a riding helmet. Bike helmets don't offer the same protection as riding helmets.
Keep some spare riding helmets at the barn. This way if somebody forgets their helmet you're prepared.;
, Wear ankle length zip up riding boots. Other types of shoes and tie up riding boots can get trapped in the stirrups, which will drag you along and cause serious or fatal injuries. Wear long trousers such as jeans or jodhpurs, riding gloves, reins with safety clips, half chaps so that you'll stay in the saddle, and a jumping vest to protect your ribs and organs.

, Harsh bits are often used to encourage a horse to slow down. However, unless they are being used by a very skilled rider, all they do is cause the horse pain when the reins are pulled, and therefore cause the horse to open his mouth to escape the pain. If the bridle has a noseband which stops him doing this, he will likely rear up or bolt instead. Therefore, unless you have been riding for many years, do not ride a horse in a severe bit as these usually make horses misbehave and act dangerously, increasing your risk of falling.

, The horse could be uncomfortable or in pain, for example because the saddle does not fit properly or is too far back or forward, or any of the tack rubs or digs in. The horse will learn to associate being ridden with pain/discomfort and begin to fear being ridden, and therefore may misbehave (e.g. by bolting, rearing or bucking) in order to try and escape from the painful tack. Painful tack is an often overlooked, but very simple way of resolving many behavioural issues well as ensuring your horse is happy so you have a good relationship.

, Safety stirrups come in various designs, but all are meant to prevent your foot from becoming trapped in case of a fall.


Even with safety stirrups, make sure you keep your heels down. It's better to be safe than sorry.

, Confirm that the tack fits properly before you get on the horse. Check all equipment for worn out areas, and for straps that are too tight, too loose, or rubbing against the horse. These problems can cause bad behavior in the horse, increase the chance of a fall, and may make a fall more dangerous. After you mount up re-check your tack. This will prevent any accident from happening.


Pay special attention to the girth, or straps around the horse's belly. If the saddle is not tightly cinched, it can slide and dump you off the horse. Always tighten your girth before mounting.

, If your horse is acting up or displaying unusual behavior, take some time to examine him. Rub your hand all over your horse's body. If he shows signs of pain anywhere, have your vet check it. If your horse continues the unexplained behavior, ask for help from an experienced rider.

, The nonslip girth and nonslip saddle pad are designed to keep you and your horse safe. If your saddle slips while you're riding you'll fall and break your pelvis.

, It's just as important for your horse to be safe as it is for you to be safe. Use some Bailing Twine to install your Safety Cross Ties. Bailing Twine will last longer than chains and it will help your Safety Cross Ties fit your horse.

, The boots will protect your horses legs. If you can't find any boots buy some polo wraps to protect your horses legs. The polo wraps will work just as well as the boots.

, This skill is essential in all horse riding, and will help keep you safe when the horse spooks or attempts a difficult maneuver. Be conscious of your posture as you ride, keeping this advice in mind:


Your shoulders should remain perpendicular with your toes, and pushed back so you are sitting up straight. You will need to move when turning or perform another maneuver, but you should return to this position.
Maintain even weight on each foot in your stirrups, except when intentionally putting weight on them.
Never bounce around in the saddle or intentionally ""mess around."" Besides losing your balance, this may cause the horse to rear, buck, or increase speed suddenly.

, Never jerk on your reins with more force than necessary. A sudden pull may surprise the horse and cause dangerous behavior.

, When in the saddle, push your heels down and keep your stirrups on the widest part of your foot, just before your toes. In this position, you can easily slip your feet out of the stirrups. Do this if the horse starts bucking or acting dangerously, to avoid catching your feet and being dragged behind the horse.

, If the horse isn't listening to you, you will have a harder time controlling him when he spooks. If you suspect the horse isn't paying attention, try ""sponging"" the reins by squeezing them in alternate hands. The bit will wiggle slightly, and alert the horse to pay attention.

, If your horse gets nervous when another horse passes by, when a plastic bag drifts by, or any other reason, stop the horse. Let another rider know what's going on, and attempt to calm the horse before moving.

, If you react quickly, you can prevent the horse from rearing. As soon as it starts to spook, pull the head to one side and push the hindquarters out to the other side. Now the horse's weight will be on its forequarters, ""disengaging"" its ability to push off its hindquarters and rear.


Never pull down and back. This can cause you or the horse to flip over.

, If you lose control of the horse, do your best to stay with the horse's motion, and to gradually slow and calm your mount. Hold on mostly with your thighs, using your own balance to stay with the horse's motion.


Holding on with your calves can cue the horse to increase its speed.
If there's no way you can stay on the horse, start planning to jump as described below. A more practiced rider can perform an emergency stop.

,, This is very important. If you hang onto the reins, they could tangle your legs or the horse's legs, often with fatal results. Holding on can also pull the whole bridle off your horse, which Is dangerous as the horse will be much harder to catch. Finally, pulling the reins pulls the horse toward you, and potentially on top of you.


Never wrap the reins or lead rope around your hands or your wrist. If you fall off and your horse starts running while the reins are like this, you could be dragged to death or break a bone.

, As you fall, try to bring your arms and legs in to your body, almost into a ball shape. Your instinct will be to stick your arms out, so you must fight this with advance planning and conscious decisions. Bent elbows and knees are less likely to break, and less likely to be caught on tack. Curling up also reduces the chance that the horse will step on you.


While falling in this position, attempt to land on your upper arm.
It is possible to learn how to land on your feet, bending your knees to cushion the impact. This may be safer if you are falling from a tall horse, but it's best to practice this with a trainer beforehand.

, Try to relax your body as you fall. Tensing up your muscles will severely limit your body's ability to absorb impact. It may take many falls (real or practiced) to learn this habit, but pain and injury will be reduced once you do.

, Roll as you land to lessen the impact and move away from the hooves. Keep your arms up to protect your head.


Learning to somersault can help you with this motion.
If you see another horse coming towards you, do whatever you can to get out of the way. Do not yell or scream, as this may make the other horses spook.

, After you are out of the way lay completely still and flat on the ground. Be still for at least 30 seconds to catch your breath and assess the situation. Check yourself for injury as follows:


Slowly move your toes, then ankles, then fingers, then wrists. If you feel any joint pain, and people are nearby, lie still until help comes. It may be dangerous to move.
If all seems well, slowly prop up both knees as if doing sit ups or crunches.
Slowly move your hands to your head and feel for any blood. If there is blood, do not panic. Ask nearby people for assistance. If no one is around, leave the horse and focus on finding help without overexerting yourself.
If your head isn't bleeding and you've caught your breath, sit up very slowly. If at any moment you feel like you'll pass out, slowly lay back down and try again in a few minutes.
Once you can sit up completely, check for cuts and scrapes and make a note to treat them later. Slowly stand up.

, By now your, horse should have slowed to a walk, and hopefully another rider has grabbed the reins. Slowly walk up to your horse with a calming tone and take the reins.

, Many riders say you should get back on the horse right away, before a fear of riding can take hold. However, this is not worth the risk of serious injury from pushing yourself too hard. All of the following must be true for your to mount immediately:


You do not have a headache, and you do not feel queasy or lightheaded. (If you have any of these symptoms, seek medical assistance immediately. Do not remount.
The horse did not fall.
You don't have any broken bones or a concussion.
You do not see or feel any injuries apart from minor scrapes and cuts.
You did not land on your head or feel any impact to the head.

And there is another rider accompanying you.

, Palpate your horse, and walk him for a bit if he is still unsettled or if he fell. Watch for signs of injury before you try anything more intense. Even if the fall was minor and you got right back on, stick to walking and a little trotting until you are certain everything is all right.

, Attempt to analyze the situation so you can avoid it in future. You may need to work on your own balance or cues, or train your horse. If you know what spooked our horse, try to stay away from similar situations in future, or learn how to desensitize your horse to prevent this happening again.

Apply lotion or cream to your pet when they’re tired or sleeping.",How to Stop Your Pet from Licking Lotions and Creams1," An Elizabethan collar is a cone-shaped collar that fits around your pet's neck. Elizabethan collars are designed to impede and prevent your pet from licking themselves, messing with stitches, or other similar activities.


Consult your vet before using an Elizabethan collar.
Make sure the collar is a proper size for your vet.
Secure it snugly, but not too tight.
Apply the cream or lotion.
Monitor your pet to make sure they’re not hurt by the collar and that it works.;
, The best way to prevent your pet from licking lotion or cream off themselves is to cover the area of skin with a bandage. Make sure to:


Apply the cream or lotion to your pet.
Wrap the area with a bandage or some other fabric.
Consider applying extra lotion or cream since the fabric might absorb some.
If your pet needs to have lotion or cream applied regularly, you should change the bandage often. Using the same bandage for more than a day might promote the growth of bacteria or worsen an already bad infection., You should also consider applying lotion or cream to your pet when they’re too tired to lick it. While this won’t always work, it is a good way of preventing your pet from licking themselves. Consider:


Applying lotion or cream shortly after your pet has settled into sleep for the night or even for a nap.
Make sure everyone around the house or around your pet has also settled in and are not doing anything to awake or distract them.
Under the advice of a veterinarian, you may also consider applying lotion or a cream in conjunction with a medication that may make your pet sleepy. This will most likely be the case if the pet has had some sort of severe injury and is recovering from surgery or something similar."

Try verbal commands.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Use negative reinforcement.,
Consult a trainer or vet.",How to Stop Your Pet from Licking Lotions and Creams2," Spend a little time teaching your pet to obey verbal commands not to lick themselves or you. Verbal commands, once you teach your pet, will prove very effective.


When your pet is licking you or themselves, say “no lick!”
Move away from your pet slowly as you give the command.
Only repeat the command once or twice.
Don’t yell at your pet.
Training with verbal commands may take several weeks or longer. Have patience., Positive reinforcement is a great way to stop your pet from licking you or themselves. Remember, the point of positive reinforcement is to reward the pet for doing (or not doing) the intended behavior.


Pair your positive reinforcement with verbal commands. When the dog obeys your verbal command, reward them.
After the dog obeys what you’ve said, reward them with a treat and/or by saying “good boy.”, If verbal commands and positive reinforcement have not worked, you may want to consider negative reinforcement. With negative reinforcement, you’ll essentially train your pet by punishing them for licking the cream or ointment.


One of the gentlest ways to use negative reinforcement is to simply touch or tap your pet lightly when they lick lotions or creams. This is best paired with a verbal command such as “no lick!”
If you want to escalate negative reinforcement, you can try using a spray bottle. Simply spray your pet lightly when they lick you or themselves.
Never hit your pet. Hitting is not an effective way of training and will alienate your pet from you.Also, be aware that negative reinforcement may not work when you aren't in the room. Many dogs will associate the owner with the punishment, rather than the activity. This means they don't lick when the owner is there, but will happily return to licking once they've left.

, You can also consult a trainer or your veterinarian for ideas about training your pet. Ultimately, as pet care professionals, they'll have access to the latest information about how to stop your pet from licking lotions or creams.


Consider enrolling your pet in a training program.
Schedule a consultation with a trainer about your cream or lotion licking problem. Tell the trainer that you have serious concerns about it.
Mention the licking problem to your veterinarian at your next visit. Your vet may have some really good ideas about how to stop your pet from licking.

Keep your pet occupied doing something else.,
Add a flavor that might discourage your pet from licking.,
Apply a scent that will repel your pet.",How to Stop Your Pet from Licking Lotions and Creams3," Whether you’re trying to discourage your pet from licking themselves or you, you can try to keep them occupied doing something else. By offering them something more enticing to do, you’ll stop your pet from licking lotions or creams. Many prescribed creams or ointments are rapidly absorbed, so by distracting the dog and playing with him immediately after application, this can give the cream enough time to sink in. Consider:


Offering your pet food or treats to distract them from the lotion or cream.
Playing with your dog after you apply the lotion or cream. This will be especially helpful if you’ve applied it to your pet.
Taking your pet on a walk or traveling somewhere with them. This way, your pet will focus their attention on their surroundings rather than the lotion or cream.

, You can also consider mixing a particular flavor that your pet doesn’t like into the cream or ointment. This way, you’ll turn your pet off to it.


Think about pre-made store-bought formulas used to repel cats or dogs. You'll probably just be able to spray the formula onto the cream or ointment. Make sure that the formula is safe for consumption.
Consult your veterinarian about what flavors or additives might discourage your pet from licking creams or ointments., A really effective way to stop your pet from licking cream or ointment is to apply an additional scent that they may not like. Such scents can often be applied via a spray bottle onto the ointment or cream. Ultimately, your pet won’t want to lick a cream or ointment that smells bad to them.


You may not even need to apply the scent onto the ointment or cream, but just on the general area of the body where the lotion or cream is applied.
The scent may conflict with the natural scent of the cream or ointment. Experiment to make sure you’re comfortable with the scent mixture before you use it.
As with adding flavors, consider using citrus to repel your pet from licking creams or ointments. Most dogs and cats dislike the smell of citrus."

Handle the horse safely after riding.",How to Be Safe Around Horses," If a horse steps on a steel-toed boot, the metal in the front could slice into your toes. To protect your feet from a horse possibly stepping on you, choose boots made of firm leather. Soft leather boots, or tennis shoes, won't protect your feet at all. If you are riding, make sure your boots have a heel (usually about 2"" high). Don't wear lace up boots. The hooks will get stuck in the stirrups.


Weight varies widely depending on your horse's size and breed, but typically falls between 880 to 1,870 pounds (400 to 850 kg).Having a quarter of that on your toes is still rather heavy, so take care when choosing safe boots.;
, Choose a riding helmet with a retaining harness, and evidence that it's met safety requirements made no more than ten years ago.Look for labels from the SEI (Safety Equipment Institute), American Society for Testing & Materials (ASTM), or Kitemark.


Some SEI-approved helmets include large ventilation holes that would not pass other tests, due to a possible increase in harm from penetrating injuries.
Replace the helmet at least once every five years, and whenever it receives a major impact or shows signs of wear.

, Avoid baggy clothing, which can get tangled in the horse's equipment. Most importantly, make sure you are easily visible before riding near roads. Fluorescent vests are recommended, especially during heavy rain, fog, or low light conditions.


If you are a beginning rider, learning to jump, or entering competitions, wear a body protector. The protector should fit comfortably, be less than five years old, and be approved by a safety standard organization.
Comfortable gloves and seam-free underwear and legwear can prevent sores and discomfort.

, Anything dangling or removable can startle the horse or catch on his equipment. Take the following precautions:


Use Peacock Iron Safety Stirrups. The safety stirrups will prevent you from hurting your feet and getting dragged. The stirrups include a break away band. Make sure you have extra bands as they break easily.
Remove all jewelry. Even tight rings and bracelets can get snagged.
Tie back loose hair.
Have non slip stirrup pads, a non slip girth, and a non slip saddle pad. The non slip girth and non slip saddle pad will keep your saddle from slipping. The non slip stirrup pads are designed to keep your feet from slipping while you're riding.
Wear a jumping vest. The jumping vest will protect your ribs and organs if you fall.
Safety Cross Ties and a Breakaway Halter are a must. It's just as important for your horse to be safe as it is for you to be safe. You can use baling twine to attach your Safety Cross Ties to your barn. The baling twine will last longer than chains.
Always ride on a lunge line with a riding buddy to hold the lunge line. The lunge line will allow you to have extra control. This way if something goes wrong you'll be able to get off right away.
Never ride alone. Riding alone will put you and your horse at risk for getting killed.
Don't ride at night. It's harder for you to see in the dark.
No riding in the road. You or your horse could get hit by a car.
Check the weather before you ride. You don't want to get caught in a storm. It's too risky to ride if it's too hot or too cold.
Go to the bathroom before you ride.

, Check that all tack is the correct size and shape for the horse. Check all tack for wear and tear. This includes any cracking of stretching of the leather and the quality of the stitching. Anything that is close to breaking or snapping is a safety risk. Check before you mount, then again after riding a short distance.


The cinch should be tight enough to prevent the horse catching its leg, but not uncomfortably tight. Check again after mounting, after a few minutes of riding, and every few hours afterward during a long ride.You should be able to hold the reins without draping them over the horse's neck, or wrapping them around your hand.
Keep all tack clean.
Make sure that you have your stirrups set at the right length. When riding, you should be able to let your weight fall onto your heel.

, During a jump or sudden movement, a neck strap is easier to hold onto than the horse's mane, particularly if the mane is braided. While neck straps are most often used for beginning riders, there is no harm in an additional piece of safety equipment. Nowadays, they are even used by some professionals., Keep at least one of each in your stables, and an extra one in the trailer if your horse is often on the road. Add a sturdy piece of paper with the contact information for a nearby veterinarian, human hospital, and (if possible) horse ambulance.Make sure someone in the area is trained in basic human first aid and equine first aid.

, Check that all gates are closed before you let a horse into a field. Never let your horse loose near dangerous areas, such as roads or areas of treacherous ground.

, Many horses learn how to undo simple latches and sliding bolts. Consider an eye bolt and/or a commercial ""horse proof"" latch. For very bored or intelligent horses, add additional latches and/or a wooden shelf to block the horse's access to the latch.If your horse is constantly trying to escape, she may need more companionship, exercise, or time spent outdoors.

, Beginners should not be around horses without close supervision. As you grow in confidence and skill, you can handle a horse by yourself, but there should still be people close enough to hear or see if something goes wrong.

, Horses have blind spots directly in front and directly behind. Approach from the side so the horse knows you're coming.


Even in a small stall, try to get the horse to turn around. If the horse is tied up, approach from an angle, not directly behind.Speak to the horse calmly as you approach, to get the horse's attention.

, Your hands are your primary communication tools with your horse. When grooming or tacking up, rest your hand on the horse's shoulder or hindquarters. This tells the horse you are there even if he cannot see you. It also gives you the best opportunity to push yourself away should the horse choose to kick. As you groom or tack up the horse, stand next to the horse's side with one hand on the horse whenever possible.


Pay attention to a sudden increase in tension. This may lead to a kick or lunge.

, Tie the rope at the height of the horse's withers (the base of his neck), and make it no longer than your arm.Use a quick release knot so the knot can easily be undone. Never put your finger in the knot as you tie, since the horse could pull it closed.


Ideally, you should tie the horse to a ""panic snap,"" not directly to a tie ring.The panic snap is a length of twine or string that the horse can easily break with a strong pull. Without a panic strap, the horse may fall if it gets startled, potentially injuring itself or you.
Never tie the horse using its bridle reins.

, Moving behind a horse makes you vulnerable to a powerful kick. If there is no room to walk outside its kicking range, walk right next to the horse, with one hand on the rump, and keep talking so the horse knows where you are. At this short distance, a kick will have much less force., Moving or standing in front of the horse is safer, but there are still risks. Never duck under the horse's belly (barrel), neck, or tie rope. This is almost guaranteed to spook him as your movement is quick, low and out of his sight. Both actions leave you wide open to being kicked and trampled on. From the front, he is also liable to rear and kick down on you.

, Don’t grab the halter itself, or you could be pulled off your feet when the horse startles. Never coil the rope around your hand or other body part, or let it drag on the ground where it could catch your feet. If this happens, the horse could pull the rope tight and cause major injury.


Fold the rope back over itself instead to reduce its length. Hold the rope by the middle of the folds, so you can easily drop it.
Never loop extra lead rope around your hand––your hand can be broken or even taken off if the horse spooks and tries to bolt, or you could be dragged behind the horse.
Don't get into a pulling contest with a horse. The horse is much stronger than you and could easily pull you off your feet.

, If the horse is very excited, put the food in a bucket instead. It may not be a good idea to feed the horse by hand regularly, as it may encourage nipping., If you need to examine the horse's hoof or leg, let the horse see what’s happening and adjust to it. Put your hand on horse’s shoulder or hindquarter, then move it slowly toward the leg. Squeeze the fetlock gently to get the horse to lift its foot, saying “up” at same time to teach this command.While holding horse’s leg or foot, do not kneel or sit. Squat instead so you can easily jump away.

, Pay attention to other horses nearby, not just the one you’re handling. Don't walk behind other horses, or stand too near their feet.


In particular, avoid carrying food to the middle of a group of horses. They may crowd around and trap you in their excitement., Training a horse to enter a trailer for the first time can take weeks of patient communication, convincing the horse enter on its own first. Even when handling an experienced horse, make sure to tie or untie the horse with the trailer door closed. This prevents the horse from trying to exit before you are finished.

, Beginning riders should always ride with a more experienced rider, although they do not need to share a horse. Riding in company is also a good idea if you are practicing jumps.

, If a horse is acting wild or full of energy, have an experienced rider lunge (longe) the horse first.

, Speak and behave calmly in the presence of horses. Horses work best with patient, quiet people. Never shout around the horse, as he may spook at the noise.

, Check your surroundings constantly for possible sources of fear. This may include running children, an approaching car, or even a plastic bag blowing in the wind. If the horse's eyes widen and its ears point straight up, it may be scared. If this happens, calmly talk to the horse and try to move somewhere the horse can calm down.



Desensitize the horse in a familiar setting if it is easily scared.

, Horses are not always friendly when they meet for the first time. Touching their noses together can cause them to bite or strike.

, Let the horse pick the pace when traveling over slippery ground, including ice, snow, and mud. When riding up or down a steep hill, keep the horse to a walking pace, even if it wants to go faster.Sticking to a walk is also a good idea at night or during low-visibility weather.

, When near other riders, either ride abreast or stay far enough apart to avoid kicks. When looking between your horse's ears, you should be able to see the hind hooves of the horse in front of you.That said, when riding with a group, don't allow a horse to lag so far behind it has to gallop to catch up.A red ribbon on the tail is a sign of a kicker in some areas. Stay well back from these horses.
When at the front of a group, shout back to inform other riders of possible dangers. These include broken glass, poor footing, and branches at head height.

, Losing control of your horse can be a dangerous occurrence, especially if you don't know what to do. In most cases, the safest course of action is to stay on the horse and let it run until it calms down or tires out.Pulling back on the reins can limit the horse's vision and cause it to lose its footing.


If you practice with the horse beforehand, you can train it to step to one side, slowing it down. Without this training, pulling back on one rein may just limit the horse's vision and balance, or cause it to turn without slowing down.Do not jump off the horse unless it is headed to a road, cliff, or branches too low for you to safely pass under.

, Since both you and the horse are a little more tired after a ride, it's helpful to follow a post-ride checklist to make sure everything gets done. Try this one:


Slow to a walk before approaching the stable.
After dismounting, tie the horse with a quick release knot.
Give the horse a wash and groom.
Lead the horse back to the pasture or stall. Teach him early on to not rush off, but to stand calmly beside you with the halter on.
Remove the halter. Pat and praise the horse for calm behavior. He should be able to remain standing by your side until you turn to leave.

Try not to stutter, or mumble. Speak loud and clearly. IF you stutter, mumble, etc, you will indicate to your teacher that you are so scared that you can barely talk. Make eye contact while speaking to your instructor. Otherwise, you are telling them that you are nervous and afraid without even speaking.;
, Walk like you are on a runway. Meaning, walk with your eyes and head facing up, shoulders back, tall posture. Since this is a new horse, hold the lead rope closer to the mouth, but not too close. You have no idea if the horse can bite or nip at your hands.

, Check the girth to see if it needs to be tighter, and most of all, look to see if your teacher is watching you in case your horse spooks. But don't be scared if your horse does spook while hopping on, as long as you have your helmet on and someone watching you.. you will most likely be fine.

, If you hop on wildly, the horse will maybe react differently then your old horse.

, Pick up the slack in your rein, tighten your girth, adjust your stirrups, and lower your spurs (if so).

, When the time comes and you need to trot, ask the trot very quietly. No response? Ask for the trot a little harder and harder. You should get the trot now. Explain what you feel while trotting to your teacher.

, To ask for the canter, Sit to the trot, squeeze with your right leg, wrap your left leg around the horse's body, shorten the reins a little bit and you should be cantering by now. Keep your calves on the horse's body so your horse doesn't slam the breaks.

, Grab the slack in your reins, heels down, and take one leg out of the stirrup, then the other, and slowly go down from the saddle.

, Talk to other riders that have ridden the horse you have. Maybe there are some problems that both of you dealt with. But always tell your instructor if something is bothering you.

",How to Approach Your Horse," It's very important to be able to tell the difference between a happy, inviting horse and an alarmed or frustrated one when you approach the animal. Look for the following signs:



Comfortable signs (if you see these, proceed):



Having relaxed, ""soft"" eyes that aren't staring at you
Turning his head or front quarters toward you
Licking his lips
Ears pricked towards you.
Having a peaceful, relaxed overall body position





Uncomfortable signs (if you see these, back off and do not approach):Moving or running away from you as you approach
Having, intense, wide eyes or eyes that are staring at you
Pinning his ears (moving them back against his head)
Bearing his teeth or trying to nip at you
Rearing up on his legs or kicking
Flicking tail repeatedly in aggressive fashion, often with back legs stomping.



;
, It takes only a moment for a horse to run up behind you and possibly rear up on you. Make sure you can see where the horses are and keep watch. Horses can get startled by almost anything. If a horse seems to be running towards you, to make sure you don't get trampled raise your arms to appear larger and say in firm calm, voice ""whoa"" or ""get"". This will help with getting the horse to head another direction.

, With horse behavior, there is an idea of pressure and release. Horses are herd animals, and will most likely not stand in an area waiting for you to approach them. Simple things, such as making eye contact, is actually putting pressure on the horse, cueing him to move away from you.

, The number one rule for approaching horses is to make sure that they know you're coming. This is easiest (by far) if you come at the horse from the front and slightly to the side (to avoid the blind spot right in front of it). If you can, approaching from the front-left of the horse is even better: many horses are trained specifically to work with humans on their left side and as a result are most comfortable with this.It actually is a myth that horses prefer one side over the other. It is us humans that over the years have developed a habit of doing everything from the left, training and desensitizing to the left, but forgetting about the other side. A horse will approach one another in the wild without a care in the world about which side they are approaching. You do, though, want to make sure you are setting both you and the horse up for success.
Use a gentle, even walking pace. Try to stay relaxed, as horses are good at picking up on subtle signs of tenseness. Make no effort to hide yourself or the noise of your feet.
Don't stare the horse in the eyes. This can be interpreted as a threat. Instead, look at its knee as you approach.

, Note that this should be avoided by anyone but experienced trainers with knowledge of drive lines. Approaching a horse from a direction other than from the front isn't ideal — just like it can be uncomfortable for someone to approach you from the rear, this can be unsettling for the horse. To make the animal as comfortable as possible, come at the horse from an angle (not from directly behind it). The wider the angle, the better: horses have monocular vision, which means they can use each eye separately to see you on their sides.As mentioned above, the horse's left side is generally preferable to the right.

, To first-time riders, hearing an experienced horse handler talk to her horse constantly can seem unusual. However, this serves an important purpose: it lets the horse know where the human is at all times. As you approach the horse, call to it at a gentle volume.You can say basically anything you want here as long as it's in a non-threatening, even tone, but most riders simply say things to the effect of, ""Hey, horse, are you ready to ride?""


You should do this no matter what direction you approach the horse from, but it's even more crucial if you're forced to approach the horse from a direction besides the front. Since the horse may not see you right away, it's important to let it know you're coming with your voice.

, Like dogs and many other animals, horses use their powerful sense of smell to identify other animals and detect threats. When you reach the horse, hold your hands out for it to smell. Don't thrust your hands right into its nose — instead, stand a step or two in front of it and gently move your hands (palms pointing down and held flat and open) to about a foot in front of it.


If the horse doesn't seem to want to smell your hands, don't continue to bother it. Instead, just withdraw your hands and continue to the next steps.

, This isn't required, but it's helpful for getting an unfamiliar horse to ""warm up"" to you. One of the greatest dietary dangers for horses is bloat, which can often become fatal, so it's good to err on the side of caution and check with the horse owner before offering their horse a treat.


Bloat can be created by several factors, some of which include even small amounts of foods that horse is not used to eating, foods that the horse could be allergic to, or, foods that are eaten at the wrong times. A few processed foods, or even some wild plants growing in the area, can be poisonous to horses too. Another consideration is that the owner may have the horse on a specialty diet or medications, and some treats can interfere with with absorption of certain medications or supplements. These are all good and valid reasons to check with the owner before giving their horses a treat.
Offer your treat to the horse by placing it in your palm, keeping your fingers completely flat. This keeps the horse from accidentally biting your fingers.Let the horse take the treat from you. Don't insist on giving it the treat if it doesn't seem to want it.
Note that treats make some horses snappy - some will become rude very fast if they get treats for no reason, it has to be given immediately after a desirable behaviour AND accompanied by the verbal cue to eat it. It can also lead to horse's refusing to go with you unless you have a treat, not great.
Small amounts of many common fruits and vegetables make great treats for horses. For example, most horses will enjoy a carrot or a few apple slices., Before proceeding to whatever task you have planned for your horse, take the opportunity to show your affection and get it comfortable with you. Move to the horse's shoulder, talking to it as you do so. Make sure it can see you and that it is displaying soft, peaceful eyes. Gently nuzzle it around the neck, shoulder, and mane. You can move down the body to the rump once the horse is comfortable with you. Stay away from sensitive areas like the eyes, nose, and mouth.


Use a rubbing or a gentle scratching motion — never a slapping or patting motion, which most horses do not like., Once you've approached a horse and gotten it comfortable around you, you may want to be able to move it where you want. This is easy with a device called a halter that goes over the horse's nose and mouth. A halter allows you to control a horse's head, leading it where you want it to go.


Most halters have a small loop that slips over the horse's muzzle with a larger loop that latches either behind the horse's ears or underneath its jaw. Slip a lead rope around the horse's neck before you get started so you'll have something to hold on to if it won't cooperate.

, A saddle lets you ride a horse by acting as your ""seat"" on its back. This is something you shouldn't do if you're inexperienced, so don't be afraid to get an instructor's help. Set the saddle down gently and keep the stirrups out of the way so as not to surprise the horse. The saddle should be secured with a girth that allows you to slip two fingers underneath, but not much looser. Don't forget to lay a blanket under the saddle to protect the horse's hair and back.


There are two popular styles for saddling a horse: Western and English. See the link above for directions on both.

, Mounting the horse just means getting on top of it so that you can ride it. You'll need a horse with a saddle, halter, and set of reins for this. Traditionally, horses are mounted from the left side. Put your left foot in the stirrup with the reins in your left hand. Grab the saddle with your right hand and use a gentle bouncing motion to swing your right leg up and over the saddle. Put your right foot in the other stirrup and grab the reins.


Have an elevation above the ground for new riders when getting on the horse, like steps or something of the sort.

, This is it — the moment many horse lovers have been waiting for. Horseback riding is something that entire books have been written about, so we won't even try to explain it all in this article. Click the link for WikiHow's article on how to ride horses, which has detailed instructions for beginners and experienced riders alike.



This guide is also a great place for beginners to start.

, No matter how much experience you have around horses, there's always the small but real chance that something outside your control may spook the horse. If this happens, you will not want to be within range of the horse's extremely powerful kicks. Most horse handlers do this one of two ways:


Staying a generous distance away when they are behind or to the side of a horse. Depending on the size of the horse, this ""safe distance"" can vary, so give the horse plenty of room, especially when directly behind it.
Staying close to the horse and maintaining contact. Keep a hand on the horse and speak to it with a gentle tone of voice. If you are very close to the horse, it will still be able to kick you, but it won't have enough space to use its full force, so the potential for injury is lower., Keep in mind that it's possible to startle a horse even if it knows exactly where you are. Sudden, violent motion can make a horse think it's in danger and provoke a spook response, so you will want to avoid it at all costs. Specific things to avoid include:


Thrusting anything into the horse's face (remember that it has a blind spot in front of its nose)
Running towards the horse
Slapping or striking the horse in any way

, Just like unexpected noises can frighten humans, they frighten horses as well. Don't make loud noises around horses, especially if they're not used to hearing the noise you're about to make. If you do have to do something that makes a loud noise, move away from the horse before doing it. Specific things to avoid include:


Loud clapping, yelling, or screaming
Guns being shot
Loud music
Loud machines (chainsaws, dirt-bikes, etc.)
When possible, loud natural noises (e.g., thunder)

, Like many animals, horses can be very defensive about their food. However, this is more of a personal tip for a particular horse than a part of a general guideline. If the horse is sensitive about eating, give it plenty of space when it is feeding — even a horse that is normally very docile may get agitated if you interrupt it while it is eating.You should especially avoid putting your hand or anything else near the animal's face or mouth, as this can be interpreted as you trying to steal its food.

If your horse tries to run away with you, stay calm.,
Grip with your thighs and keep your lower legs relaxed.,
Sink your heels down into the stirrups; this will push you down into the saddle and keep you on the horse.

,
Shorten one side of the reins, using your other hand to keep a strong grip on the leather as you slide the first hand forward.,

If you need more stability, grab onto the saddle.,
If you lose the reins, sit back, hold on, and wait for your horse to come to a stop.",How to Avoid Falling off a Horse," Sit back in the saddle - think of it as sitting on your back pockets. Don't lean forward. This way, if the horse veers, you won't keep going over the top of his head.;
, Try not to let your legs flop around or nudge the horse with your calves. He will think you want him to go faster.

,, Let the short-rein hand sit on your thigh and pull the horse into a turn. The horse will have to slow down. Keep pulling, forcing him in small and small circles until he stops. You'll have more power if you keep your arms close to your body.

, Find it with your toes.

, On an English saddle, there is often a little strip of leather called a bucking strap. On a Western saddle, grab the horn and press your seat down into the saddle. You can also hold onto the horse's mane at the withers - the little crest at the base of his mane. It won't hurt the horse.

, Whatever he's got in mind, he's not going to keep going forever. Just concentrate on keeping your seat, and you'll be all right.

Getting an animal is a long term commitment. Animals live for years and years. Ask yourself some questions to see if you truly want to be a pet owner.Do you have other extra-curricular activities (e.g. sports, music, dance class, etc.) that take up your time?
Are you willing to wake up early to care for your animal before you go to school?
How will you fit your pet into your current schedule?
Are you willing to use your allowance or chore money to help pay for your pet?;
, There are so many options when it comes to pets. Some pets require very little maintenance while others will take up quite a bit of time. Also consider how much space you have in your home for a pet and how your pet may affect your family. Is anyone allergic to the pet you may want? Is a family member afraid of a pet you may want?The lowest maintenance pets (e.g. fish, snakes, lizards, and turtles) require about 15 minutes a day for feeding and one hour a week to clean the tank. These animals will be fun to watch, but they will not interact and play with you like other animals.
Low maintenance pets (cats, rabbits, canaries, parakeets, guinea pigs, gerbils, hamsters, mice, and rats) require about 15 to 30 minutes of daily maintenance and weekly cage and litter box cleaning.Dogs are medium maintenance pets that require one or two hours of care every day. They will require much more attention than cats, and you will need to walk them every day.
The highest maintenance pets (horses, parrots, pot belly pigs) require a lot of time and space, and your parents will probably not agree to this.

, Once you have chosen a pet, learn as much as you can about the animal. Figure out the supplies you will need to take care of your pet. How will your pet get along with other people? How will your pet behave? How much will it cost to take care of your pet?How long will your pet live?
Why do you want a pet?
How much will your pet cost?
What type of food your pet will need?
What type of accommodations (e.g. tank, aquarium, cage, kennel) will your pet need?
How you will help pay for the pet?
What time will you wake up in the morning to feed your pet before school?
Who will take care of your pet when your family goes on vacation?
What type of exercise will your pet need?
How big will your pet be when it is full size?
When does your pet like to sleep?
What areas can you take care of the pet yourself (e.g. walking the dog, feeding your pet)? What areas will you need some help with (e.g. giving your dog a bath, cleaning the cage, taking your pet to the veterinarian)?If you have any friends that have a pet, talk to them about their responsibilities. They can give you some good advice.
The more information you know, the more your can impress your parents.
Take notes as you learn all of this information. You can use your notes when you talk to your parents.
Read about your potential pet in books, magazines, and the internet. Watch any television shows or videos about the animal.

, If you show your parents that you are responsible, they will think you are ready to have a pet. Do your chores on time. Help your parents around the house. Do your homework before your parents tell you to. Wake up on time to go to school.Keep your room clean and take out the trash.


Always complete your tasks on time. If you can get your chores done earlier than your parents expect you to, you will win extra points.
If you have done all of your chores, ask your parents, ""Is there anything I can help you with?""
If you do not do your chores and show your parents that you are responsible, they will not think that you are ready or mature enough to take care of a pet.

, Telling your parents that you are ready for a pet is not enough. With all the reading that you have done on your choice of pet, you can demonstrate to them that you clearly understand the responsibilities involved in keeping the pet. Write or type out a plan that details all of the research you have done.Giving your parents a plan will let them know that you are serious and have put a lot of thought into this.
There are online resources to help your organize the pet information,pet expenses,and weekly pet care schedules., Volunteering at an animal rescue organization, shelter or humane society is a good way to show your parents that you are serious about having a pet. You can also use this time to learn about animals and decide what type of pet you would be interested in having. Lending a hand with your friends' pets can be helpful too.


Make a mental note of the things you like and you do not like when you are spending time with the animals.
You can visit the Petfinder website to find an animal shelter in your area.If you are not old enough to volunteer at an animal shelter, try to pet sit for someone you know or bring home the class pet.

, Make sure your parents are in a good mood when you talk to them about getting a pet. Also, make sure that your parents have time to talk and will not be in a rush. For example, talking to your parents right when they get home from work or when they are driving you to school is not a good time.Before you start the conversation, you may say, ""Mom/Dad, do you have a minute?""
You will probably have to talk to your parents more than once about getting a pet. Always try to choose a good time to start the conversation.

, Now that you have your parents attention, you can make a presentation about your desire for a pet. Tell your parents the pet that you would like to have, the research you have done, how you plan to take care of the pet, and how you would like your parents to help you. You should also give your parents the written plan that you created.


At the end of your presentation, tell your parents, ""Please don't say yes or no right now. I want you to think about everything I said before you answer."" This will show your parents that you are patient and willing to wait for an answer.Your parents will probably ask you some questions. If you take the time to plan for a pet before you talk to your parents, you will be prepared.
Don't forget to tell your parents about all the benefits of having a pet., Your parents may say no when you ask them. Do not get upset, angry, or yell. A bad response will show your parents that you may not be ready or mature enough for a pet. Accept your parents answer and continue to show your parents that you are responsible. They may change their mind.If your parents say no, ask them if there is anything you can do to turn the ""no"" into a ""yes.""Think about what you can do to address these concerns.
Try to understand your parents reasoning and thank them for explaining things to you.Do not whine or beg your parents for a pet after they tell you no.
Wait a couple of weeks before you bring up the topic of a pet again., Your parents may suggest a different pet than the one you asked them for. Your parents may also ask you to continue to be responsible for a certain time period and then they may allow you to get a pet. Be open to your parents suggestions.


Have a positive attitude when you are negotiating with your parents.
It may take awhile before your parents decide to let you have a pet. Be patient throughout the process.
If your parents say no at first, always answer with a simple "" Okay"" rather than a ""yes sir"" Or A ""yes ma'am"" so that they don't think you are kissing up to them for a pet!

Talk to a veterinarian or an animal care specialist at a shelter.",How to Decide Which Pet to Get for Your Kid," Many experts recommend children be at least six years old before they are given a pet or a pet is introduced to the household. As a parent, you are the best judge of your child’s maturity. Note if your child demonstrates self control and discipline when he interacts with other children and other adults. He should show he understands the word “no” and the importance of being obedient, as one of the major elements of being a pet owner is instilling obedience in the pet.If you have family friends or relatives who own pets, watch how your child interacts and behaves around the pet. He should be easy going around the pet and eager to help take care of the pet.;
, If you are looking for a pet for a younger child, you may think a kitten or a puppy might be easier to train and more adaptable to a new household than an older pet. But puppies and kittens require lots of extra care and attention, which can be demanding on a younger child, and they are prone to rough play like scratching and biting, which can be dangerous for a younger child. A friendly, calm older animal who is comfortable around younger children may be a better choice for your household.For an older child, learning how to raise and take care of a younger pet can be a good way to instill a sense of responsibility and purpose. This also means the younger pet can grow with your child and your family, leading to a strong and lasting bond. But if your child is already busy with school and extracurricular activities, and if you do not have a lot of free time to devote to the pet, a younger animal may not be ideal for your household.
Consider your child’s daily schedule and your lifestyle, as well as the lifestyle of your spouse or other children in the home. If your family has a jam packed schedule, you may want to think about getting an adult animal that is easier to take care of and requires less of a time commitment.

, Once your child has let you know he would like a pet, keep in mind as the adult you will need to put in the time and effort to help care for the pet as well. Pets are not something you can try out and then return if they do not work out. The pet could potentially be in the household for the duration of her life, so be prepared to adjust your schedule and time to accommodate the new pet.Over time, your child should assume most of the responsibilities of caring for the pet. In the initial stages, when the pet first arrives, you will likely need to help your child adjust to caring for the pet and will need to set aside time in your schedule to do so.

, The costs for taking care of the pet will vary depending on the type of pet you get your child. But every animal will require a certain level of financial investment to pay for food, maintenance, and vet check ups.


On average, taking care of a cat can cost $350-$400 a year, and a small or medium dog can cost $400-$500 a year to care for. Be prepared to spend money on the pet and do not select a pet you do not think you can afford to maintain and take care of., If you’re looking for a pet that requires very little care and will not cost a lot to maintain, a goldfish may be the right pet for your child. Goldfish are also hardy pets, as they can live for several years in cold water in a fish bowl with no filter or extra habitat requirements.The most important thing about maintaining a goldfish is feeding him properly and consistently. If your child wants a pet he can cuddle, a goldfish may not be the ideal pet.

, A small, cage bound pet like a guinea pig, a hamster, or a gerbil are good options for children five years and older. These small pets require minimal maintenance and can be good first pets to give your child a sense of responsibility. Popular small cage bound pets include:Guinea pigs: These smaller pets are easy to tame and handle. Though they are happiest when in pairs, they require only a small amount of space in a cage and are social creatures. They require supplemental Vitamin C to remain happy and healthy, so you will need to feed them lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, or Vitamin C tablets.
Rats: Despite their dirty image, domesticated rats are actually very clean, quite intelligent and do not often bite. They are social animals and enjoy being held and cuddled. They are best kept in pairs, and they require a large cage so they can run around. Most rats are larger than mice or dwarf hamsters, so they won’t slip out of your child’s hands and are easier to handle.
Hamsters: There two popular hamster breeds: the Syrian hamster and the dwarf or Russian hamsters. Hamsters are solitary creatures and are happy in smaller cages. They are fairly easy to take care of, but they are nocturnal and have a shorter lifespan compared to other pets.
Gerbils: These animals are very social and can be active during the day or the night. They are easy to tame and fun to watch, especially for children. Most gerbils will only bite if they feel threatened and if someone grabs their tails unexpectedly.
Mice: These animals are good, inexpensive pets and are easy to care for. However, they live best in groups, preferably with like-genders as this will prevent multitudes of mice babies. They have a shorter life span and have potentially troublesome habits like chewing and gnawing on objects.
Leopard geckos: If your child is interested in reptiles, leopard geckos may be a good option. They are among the easiest reptiles to care for, as they are naturally docile. However, they are nocturnal so they will be awake at night and require a small habitat to be happy and healthy. Though you can hold leopard geckos, they aren’t as into cuddling as other small cage animals like hamsters or gerbils.

, Birds are highly intelligent and very social. They are also good pet for small living spaces like apartments and condos. Most birds are easy to care for and fun to train. However, they are more fragile pets than a dog or a cat and require gentle handling, which may be tricky for children. If your child doesn’t want to be too hands on with the pet, and doesn’t have the patience to train the bird, you may want to go with a different pet.Birds living in a household with children are likely to be more vocal than birds that live in households without children. Birds are flock creatures, after all, and tend to imitate the atmosphere around them. If you might be sensitive to chirping, squawking, and other loud bird noises in your home, you may not want to get a pet bird.
Budgies and cockatiels are popular bird choices for household pets. Parrots are entertaining and fun to train, but they will need a high amount of interaction from their owner.

, Though rabbits are seen as the classic docile pet for children, in fact they tend to dislike being touched, cuddled, or held. Rabbits are also sensitive to loud noises and are easily stressed out in noisy environments. Consider getting a rabbit if your household is calm and quiet and your child is older and not interested in holding or cuddling with the pet all the time., Dogs are great for cultivating a strong animal-human relationship and can become your child’s best friend. But dogs are one of the most high maintenance pets and require daily feeding, walking, and attention. Before you get your child a dog, remind your child that the dog will be a big time commitment and your child will need to be willing to follow through on promises to walk and feed the dog. Most dog breeds require extra attention like play sessions and socializing with other dogs. You and your child should discuss who will be in charge of caring for the dog on a daily basis and all the responsibilities required to provide adequate care for a dog.You can research dog breeds to find the right dog for your household. Keep in mind all dogs have the potential to bite, as the dog’s breed is just one factor that affects temperament and behavior. Get a dog from a reputable breeder and make sure the dog has a full vet check up before he enters your home.

, Cats require less maintenance than dogs but they are still fluffy animals that can provide good companionship. Keep in mind cats can be aloof or distant, even to owners they love, and they can respond negatively to a child who always wants to play or cuddle. An irritated cat can scratch or nip at unwanted attention. Explain to your child that a cat may not want as much attention as a dog, and will have a different temperament.Before you get a cat for your child, confirm he is not allergic to cat dander or fur. Children who are exposed to cats when they are babies have a reduced risk of developing cat allergies. But older children who have not been exposed to cats have a greater risk of allergies.

, If you are still not sure which pet will suit your child and your household, reach out to a veterinarian or a care worker at an animal shelter or an animal adoption service. They may be able to give you suggestions on several pets that might work for you and your child.


You and your child can also visit animal shelters to look at potential pets. Sometimes, your child will be drawn to a certain animal and be able to identify their new pet for themselves.

Labeling regulations do not allow manufacturers to describe the quality of ingredients on the package. A reputable pet food manufacturer will be able to explain to you their specific methods for evaluating and assuring the quality of ingredients used in their products.;
, Because dogs and cats need meat, it’s best to pick a food in which the first ingredient is an animal-based protein source, such as chicken and chicken meal, lamb, lamb meal, fish meal, or egg. These ingredients contain a full complement of essential amino acids, unlike vegetable-based protein sources, such as soybean meal or corn gluten meal. By-products are not a good source of protein because they are the left over parts from production, such as feathers, feet, heads, beaks, fur etc.

, For a glossy coat and healthy skin, your pet needs fat in the diet. Make sure the fat is meat based, since this fat is taken out from the rendering process it should be added back in. Fats are made up of fatty acids, and there are two important types of fatty acids for dogs and cats—omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids, found in chicken fat and corn, are essential for maintenance of skin and coat and proper membrane structure. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish oil, all other sources of Omega-3 are hard for cats and dogs to digest. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to be important in blood clotting and decreasing inflammation, among other things.

, Cats and dogs need very little carbs in their diets because they are carnivores. Ideally there should be no grain in their food. The grains that are known to cause kidney damage from their poor protein are corn, wheat and soy. Fruits and vegetables are good carb sources for pets as long as there are not too many of them.

, Research has shown that moderately fermentable fiber, such as beet pulp, enhances intestinal health. The fermentable part of the fiber is broken down by intestinal bacteria to provide short-chain fatty acids, an energy source for intestinal cells. The non-fermentable component provides bulk for normal feces. Using highly fermentable fibers can cause problems, such as excess gas, while using non-fermentable fibers, such as peanut hulls, promotes excess stool volume because they are of little or no nutritional value.

, Ethoxyquin is toxic and very bad for pets and should be avoided. Salt should also not be on the list.

, If your pet is on the chunky side you should pick a food with higher protein than the competition. If your pet is skinny get a food with average protein.

, If the food has any of these ingredients do not buy it. All of these ingredients are cheap and have little or no nutritional value to pets. By-products are left over from the slaughter/processing of the food, and corn, wheat and soy are not digestible by pets and cause kidney problems down the road.

Try holding your lizard or small animal.,
Play with your cat or dog, as it becomes comfortable with your presence.",How to Encourage a New Pet to Trust You," When you get your pet home, place it in its proper cage or area and let it get used to its surroundings. For reptiles and small animals, put them in their cage and let them have some time to themselves to explore their new house. For dogs or cats, let them roam around your house and get used to the unfamiliar area (or at least a pet-proofed portion of it).;
, After a while, let the animal get used to your presence. Walk by cage slowly and quietly to show your reptile or small animal that you're not a threat. Spend a little time in the same room as your cat or dog.

, Like they say, the best way to an animal's heart is through its stomach. Hand-feeding your reptile or small animal establishes a form of trust between you. Show your cat or dog that you are the one preparing and providing its food.

, Stroke your lizard's head or your small animal's body gently and slowly. This shows that you mean no harm. Pet your cat or dog's body, or any other place they like to be pet. It's not a good idea to pet a dog on the head, as this is considered a threat to them if they don't know you well and haven't learned your body language.

, Fully support their body and sit in a chair or anywhere comfortable. Walking around with them will mostly likely make them nervous. Let your cat relax next to you or walk your dog.

, It will help establish a strong bond.

Some fish types will live happily in a low-maintenance aquarium or pond, whilst others like goldfish, can get ill if the pH balance is off. Goldfish are also more susceptible to illnesses like white spot, so make sure to research the species you want before you set up an aquarium. Fish are often thought to have a calming effect: simply watching them swim around may help reduce anxiety and stress.;
, Most aquatic pets need a tank at least as large as five gallons, with an extensive filtration system. Consider whether you can commit to regular aquarium-cleaning sessions. Cleaning an aquarium requires you to clean out pumps and filters, wash the entire structure of the tank, and prepare good-quality water for your aquatic pet to live in.


Most fish need plenty of space to swim around. The larger the fish (and the more fish), the larger the tank you'll need. Research the tank size requirements for any aquatic creatures that you're thinking about getting.

, Choose between freshwater or saltwater fish; low-activity animals like starfish; shelled creatures like crabs and sea snails; or even less common pets like eels and shrimp. Read about various aquatic creatures, their needs, and the feasibility of keeping them.


Consider recreating a specific aquatic ecosystem. Read about which fish to put together in a tank. You don't want your creatures to fight, eat each other, or compete for resources!

, Consider an avian pet if you'd like an intelligent, life-long partner in crime. Birds are by far the longest living domesticated pet. Large birds can live for decades while smaller birds can live up to two years.They are also highly intelligent and are easy to care for. They don't require much attention from you but will need environmental stimulation through toys or interaction with you. Birds can also be very nurturing and even show empathy. Before considering an avian pet, you should ask yourself a few questions:

, The larger the bird, the larger the cage it will need. Certain birds—especially, but not limited to, birds of prey&mash;need plenty of opportunities to fly around and stretch their wings. Consider the ethical implications of keeping a bird in a cage, and decide whether you'd ever be able to let it fly free.

, Some birds can live for multiple decades, and you shouldn't adopt a long-lived bird unless you're prepared to care for it. Some birds, especially large parrots, have long life spans. African Grey parrots, for example, live an average of 50 years. Budgies, on the other hand, only live 5 to 15 years. Don't choose a bird that you're not willing to make a lifetime commitment to.On a more regular scale, you'll need to commit to regular cage cleaning and bird grooming. Cages need to be cleaned weekly, and birds should be misted every few days. They also need at least several hours a day of interaction with a human.
A lone bird can get bored easily. It can develop bad habits of over-grooming and over-eating which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Toys and appropriate avian companions can help mitigate this issue, but they still require interaction with the family.

, You'll need a keen sense of observation to get your bird prompt medical attention in the case of an illness. Many avian pets are prey species. As such, they have evolved to not show signs of illness until the problem becomes deadly.

, Understand that having a reptile as a pet is very different from keeping a mammal or any other domesticated pet. You'll need to have extensive knowledge about your pet: everything from adaptation, behavior, and the environment, to nutrition, camouflage, and reproductive strategies. You'll also need to research any laws regarding the particular species in your state. , Are you prepared to care for a pet that could be dangerous to you? Reptiles like some snakes and lizards can become dangerous if not properly handled. Some of these creatures—particularly venomous reptiles, or large and predatory reptiles—can pose a real risk to you, your family, and your other pets if they get loose. This is your responsibility.

, Reptiles are coldblooded, mostly carnivorous creatures, and you will need to cater to various environmental requirements. Make sure that you know what it means to care for a reptile!


Make sure that you're able to cater to the dietary needs of your reptile. Most reptiles are carnivores or omnivores, and will need to eat other animals like mice, crickets, rabbits, and birds. You can usually find these foods already killed and prepared at a local pet store, but some reptiles may require live food.
Understand the thermal needs of your reptilian pet. Reptiles are coldblooded and will need an environment that is warm, enclosed, and properly sized. This can become an expensive endeavor, and it is known to surprise new reptilian owners. Since reptiles can be purchased quite cheaply, people are unwilling to spend money to meet their very specific needs.
Consider whether you're ready to care for a reptile for many years. Some reptiles can live for up to 40 years – or even as much as 100 years.
Make sure that you have enough space. Snakes and some lizards can grow to very large sizes (over ten feet long), whilst others stay very small (under one foot long), so once again it is important to decide what type you want before you set up an enclosure.

, This can be a great option if you want an active, small, and relatively inexpensive pet. Common pet rodents include hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, mice, gerbils, and chinchillas. Beware that some rodents, like rats, can not live on their own and will need an either same sex or neutered companion. Other rodents, like some types of hamsters, live best on their own. Research the different rodents to see if the one you want will need a friend. Some rodents (such as mice and rats) can even be trained to follow commands and perform tricks.

, Many rodents need quite large cages, for instance rats need a minimum of 2 square feet per rat, according to the ASPCA. Cages can also get quite expensive, so building your own is a common endeavor.

, You'll need to commit to the daily and weekly upkeep of your rodent's cage. Cages need to be deep-cleaned regularly, and litter boxes must be emptied out daily. You'll also need to put time aside to interact with your rodent. Rodents need daily attention in order to be socialized into your family. They should also be let out of their cage every day to explore, play, and interact with their environment.


Are you ready to care for a rodent that may live up to three years? For some, three years can be a long time. For others, three years is much too short. The grief of losing a pet is inherent to the joy of owning a pet., Some rodents like mice, hamsters, and rats are quite fragile and need careful handling. That means learning how to properly hold and pick up your pet while avoiding injury to it.

, These large, social, mammalian pets can be a very rewarding choice if you are able to give them a lot of attention. Cats and dogs are the most popular type of pet. They also are also typically very social and high-energy, and they more attention than almost any other domestic animal. Understand what it means to own a dog or a cat.

, Dogs need to be outside, and an enclosed yard can greatly benefit the quality of life for your dog. Large dogs, especially, need regular physical activity in order to stay healthy. Cats can also go outdoors, and a safe neighborhood or enclosed yard can meet their needs. Factor this availability into the type of dog or cat that you adopt!

, Certain breeds of dogs develop behavioral problems if left alone for extended periods of time. The top reason for aggression found in cats is caused by boredom or lack of environmental stimulation.


Who will look after your pet when you go away for a while? Check for the availability of boarding kennels and pet sitters in your area, if you do not have friends or family who are willing to care for your pet when you are away. If you're out of the house a lot, a dog or cat may not be the right pet for you.
Do you move around a lot? Dogs and cats can become stressed if they are moved from home to home. This can cause long term behavioral problems.

, Ask yourself whether you're ready to care for a dog or cat for more than 10 years. Dogs and cats can live up to an average of 15 years, depending on breed. Some dogs and cats have been recorded to live for as long as 25 years. On a smaller scale, dogs and cats require regular and intensive interaction with humans or other dogs and cats.

Most dogs have to be walked everyday, and have to go outside to relieve themselves. Cats also need plenty of exercise and social interaction.
Are you getting an adult pet or a young pup or kitten? If it's the latter, make sure the baby is old enough to be separated from the mother. Younger animals need a lot of care and affection. Keep in mind, that they require more nurturing and a lot of looking after. This means major time commitment on your part.

, You'll need to pay for food, toys, and health products. You may need to front additional costs like obedience training, grooming, and medical care.Can you pay for obedience training? Having an unruly animal can play havoc with your life. Even if you decide not to attend a formal obedience program, you should be prepared to doing some reading and apply necessary discipline for basic training.
Can you afford yearly vet bills and unexpected vet bills from accidents or illnesses? Surgeries and emergency medical procedures can cost thousands of dollars., Every pet is unique, but a certain species and breed will have distinct characteristics that can help you determine what kind of pet is right for you. You can go online; visit your local library or bookstore; or speak to the staff at an animal shelter or pet store. Learn about the common traits, characteristics, and needs of common pets and their varying breeds. If you already have a few types of pet in mind (e.g. cat, rabbit, and iguana), ask about these animals first.


Some cat breeds (like the Siamese) are very affectionate. They can't be left alone for long periods of time. Left alone, they can become depressed or develop separation anxiety. If you work long hours or can't be home all the time, you might want to reconsider owning a Siamese cat and look for another breed of cat.
Climate can affect what kind of breed or species of pet you'd like to own. Most pet birds, for instance, do best in temperatures around 70 °F (20 °C).If you live in a colder environment, it's important to keep your pet bird indoors or another warm space. Many escaped birds die from exposure to the cold.
Each breed of a species has its own unique grooming needs. A long-haired cat will need to be groomed daily, while some short-haired cats may only need grooming once a week.

, The needs of an animal change with each stage of their life. Many new pet owners want to buy or adopt young pets such as puppies and kittens, but fail to realize that having baby animals can be difficult, time consuming, and can become expensive. Some new pet owners may also become disappointed when their baby animals grow up into adult animals. In the United States of America, over 7.6 million pets enter animal shelters every year.

Many of them are strays and many of them are surrendered by pet owners for a variety of reasons. One unfortunate reason pet owners surrender their pets is that they realize they no longer want to care for their matured pet because it is no longer cute. So when you're thinking of adopting or buying a pet, it's important to ask yourself if a baby animal or mature animal is better for you.


Young pets: Young pets need lots of attention and training. For dogs and cats, they will need to be house trained. For smaller animals like rodents and birds, constant attention and feedings will need to take place as you will be taking on the role of surrogate mother. Some young pets can also damage your home as baby animals often play bite, chew or scratch furniture, or soil your furniture. Some young pets will also need to be fixed and vaccinated. If you have young children in the home, you'll need to make sure your pets and children play safely together as both child and baby pet are quite fragile. As well, a young pet's temperament or personality may change as they become older.

Mature pets: Adult pets can be difficult to bond with, especially if they had been previously mistreated or abused. It may take longer for an adult pet to warm up to you or get settled in their new environment. However, an adult pet's personality will remain the same. So what you see and observe initially about the pet, is probably what you'll be experiencing when you bring the pet home. Plus, an adult pet may need little to no obedience training. Adult dogs and cats can play and interact with young children safely. In shelters, adult pets are often never given a second chance, so adopting a mature pet means you're saving a life.

, There are many options and ways to get a pet. Some people are given pets by neighbors, friends, and family. Some adopt and some breed and buy. Some pets enter the lives of people all on their own, showing up at doorsteps or found as strays. Many people find their pets through:



Animal shelters. Millions or pets are euthanized each year because they were never adopted or the shelter could no longer support the amount of animals coming in each year. Adopting from a shelter potentially means saving an animal from euthanasia or a lifetime behind bars. The cost of adopting a pet from a shelter is quite reasonable and all pets are vaccinated and fixed before they're allowed to be adopted out. Shelter staff also know the animals very well and can help you choose the right pet for you.

Breeders. It is extremely important that you choose a pet from a responsible and reputable breeder that is knowledgeable about the breed of pet they are selling.Breeders should always provide plenty of space, food, and water for their animals. They should also have properly socialized their animals before allowing them to be purchased and should never allow an animal to be purchased before they are properly socialized. Pets from breeders can be quite expensive, but is a good resource if you are looking for purebred pets.

Pet stores. Some pet stores act as adoption agencies that work with local shelters to help adopt out pets. They may also care for and sell their own pets, allowing you to view their pets' living conditions.

, Owning a pet is a big responsibility, and it will change certain aspects of your life. You will need to adapt your daily routine, your home environment, and your financial situation to suit your pet's needs.


A busy schedule can make it hard to keeps a pet that needs a lot of attention. Some dogs, horses, rats, and cats need to be exercised by taking them out on walks or setting aside time to play with them.
Pets often require established feeding times. You will need to remember to feed your pet or come up with alternative ways to ensure your pet has had enough food every day. This is especially the case if your lifestyle includes being away from home for long periods of time.
It can be stressful to own certain pets if you travel a lot or work long hours outside of the home. Large, active pets like cats and dogs need to socialize and be socialized. Being home alone all day can negatively impact your pet's emotional and physical well-being. You may need to hire a pet-sitter, bring your pet to a ""pet daycare,"" or choose a pet that can be home alone for long hours., Even though the pet may be yours, it's necessary that everyone in your home agrees to having a pet. A pet, especially one that is young or has special needs, can be stressful and hard to handle for everyone in the home. If you have a large family with many children or you're in a living situation with many people, it's important you make sure everyone in the home is ready to have a pet as well.


Find out if you or anyone is allergic to a certain animal. Moderate allergies to pets can be controlled but severe allergies can pose dangerous health risks. If you are uncertain if you or someone has pet allergies, visit an allergist to help you determine if anyone is allergic to a certain animal.
Having pets when there are young children or pregnant people in the home can be difficult. A pet may experience high levels of stress with little children around or the addition of a new pet can put a strain in the lives of a family that is expecting.

, If you're renting or living in an apartment, condo, or town home, it's very likely your building will have rules as to what kind of pet you are able to have. Many buildings allow smaller pets but not larger ones. Some may not allow certain animals regardless of its size and some will allow pets if a damage deposit is paid. Check with your landlord or building management for rules about the specific species, breed, and size of pet that you're allowed to have.


Get permission in writing and have your lease or contract updated. Word of mouth or permission granted vocally is often unreliable. Written proof can come in handy if you run into problems later on.
Check your municipal, county, or provincial laws if you're planning to own an exotic animal or if you are importing an animal. If you're importing an animal from outside the country, check with airlines and Customs or Port Authority on the necessary paperwork and quarantine procedures for animals coming from the source country. These regulations can change between borders without notice at any given time, depending on health regulations.
Some pets need large open spaces to live in. Most pets can live in small homes as long as they have the opportunity to go outside or have plenty of indoor stimulation through play or interaction with others.

, Keeping a pet can be more expensive than you realize. Make sure that you are in a financially stable situation. You must be able to afford to take care of a pet's needs: its food, supplies, toys, and healthcare. You may need to save for:



Vet appointments. With any pet, regular health checks done by your veterinarian is important. If you're thinking about owning an exotic animal, you may need to find specialized veterinarians that are experienced in caring for them.

Vaccinations and other preventive medications. Certain pets need to be vaccinated to prevent the spread of common pet diseases. You may also choose to protect your pet by giving them monthly preventative medications that protect them from fleas, heartworm, and other parasites.

Neutering. Unless you're a breeder, most pets that are mammals like dogs, cats, horses, and rats, will need to go through an operation to be neutered or spayed. Having your pet fixed helps keep your pet healthy by preventing unwanted pregnancies and other health concerns such as cancer. Neutering also improves your pet's quality of life. Unfixed pets face behavioral problems that can cause stress to both you and your pet.

Accidents and illnesses. When your pet is ill or gets into an accident, treatment can be extensive both mentally, physically, and financially. You will need to prepare for costly vet bills in case of emergencies.

Pet Insurance. Some pet owners purchase pet insurance to help pay for unexpected pet illnesses, accidents, and veterinarian visits.

Supplies. Food, toys, and grooming supplies will be need to be regularly purchased by you.

Training and daycares. Some pets will need to attend obedience or training classes. Some pets can't be left unattended and will need to be put in daycares or other facilities that care for them while you're away.

, Think about what your daily lifestyle is like. Do you work from home? Then maybe you have more time to devote to a pet. But if you regularly find yourself stuck at the office late at night, it might be hard to make it home in time to feed a dog.Think about how often you travel. If you are frequently out of town, do you have someone who can look after your pet?
If you are hardly ever home, you should consider a pet that doesn't need a lot of socialization. Fish or a hamster might be a good choice.
Think about your physical habits. For example, if you are a runner, consider getting a dog that can accompany you. Huskies, collies, and labs will be happy to go for a jog.

, If you live alone, you really only need to consider your pet preferences. But if you live with other people, it is important to talk to them about their feelings towards animals.

A brief note or phone call can answer your questions.Try saying, ""Hi, Jim. I am considering getting a cat. Are there any policies or additional fees that I need to be aware of?""
If you own your own home, you might need to take a look at your home owner's insurance policy. Some coverage does not extend to particular breeds of animals.
For example, dog breeds such as Rottweilers and Pit Bulls can cause problems with your coverage. Speak to an agent if you have questions.

Think about a feeding area for your pet. Is there room in your kitchen for water and food bowls?
If you are going to get a rabbit, do you have room for the hutch? Do you have a safe space where your rabbit can hop around?

, If you are considering getting a dog, take a good look at your neighborhood. An ideal space for dogs will have parks, preferably dog parks. Your dog will appreciate having a space to run and play if you don't have your own yard.Even if your pet will mainly be staying indoors, your neighborhood is still important. There are several things to consider.

Let the mixture stay on your dog for 10 minutes. If necessary, cover your dog with an old towel or blanket to keep her warm while you wait. After 10 minutes, thoroughly rinse your dog.


Avoid getting the mixture in her eyes, mouth, and ears. Use a cloth or sponge to bathe around these areas.

Make sure you use a different towel. You don't want to transfer the oils back to her skin.


Check the coat thoroughly for any lingering odor and repeat this process as needed.

Apply the mouthwash to your dog's coat and massage it in all the way down to the skin. Be sure to avoid getting it in her eyes. Be aware that mouthwash can cause a burning sensation if applied to cuts and scrapes.

, You should do this on a regular basis. Dog hair in your car can cause a troublesome doggy odor. If you have a handheld vacuum, you can use that. You can also use your vacuums upholstery attachment. If you don't have a vacuum, most car washes have a vacuum you can use for a fee., Things like the dashboard, and buttons can be cleaned with a multi-purpose cleaning spray. You can find a spray at a grocery or department store. You can also use a spray you have in your kitchen.Use the spray on a small portion of your car first. Watch to see if the spray dries without causing any damage.
If the spray seems to be safe for your car, go ahead and spray down and clean the hard surfaces in the interior.

, Rent a wet/dry vacuum to apply carpet cleaner. This will remove set in smells from the fabric in your car. Make sure to test the carpet cleaner on a small portion of your car's fabric before using it on the entire floor.Once you know the cleaner is safe, spray down the floor and seats with a layer of carpet cleaner. If you're unsure of how much to use, refer to the instructions on your bottle.
Once the carpeting is covered in cleaner, suck up the cleaner with the wet/dry vac. Your car should smell significantly better.

, Odor may be caused by urine. If your dog had an accident in the car, it's best to address it right away. If left untreated, urine can cause an unpleasant lingering smell.Immediately place a few layers of absorbent paper towel over the urine. Allow the paper towel to soak up some of the stain.
Cover the towels with a few large layers of newspaper.
After soaking up most of the urine, rinse the area with cold water. Then, use towels or a wet/dry vacuum to soak up the water.

, Sometimes, you may not notice a urine stain right away. In these cases, rinse out the stain with water. If possible, use a wet/dry vacuum, as this will be better equipped at removing the stain.Apply a pet odor neutralizer right away. You can find one at a local pet store, online, or at a grocery/department store.
Allow the spot to dry. If there is still a stain after the spot dries, wash it out with carpet cleaner.

Are you looking for a pet that can sit in your lap and cuddle? All of your desires should be considered when thinking about what type of pet to get.


Some types of pets you could consider include: dogs, cats, rabbits, and birds, such as parakeets and cockatiels.
When thinking about what type of pet to get, you can be as specific or general as is necessary. It may be that you figure out that you want a dog but you are OK with a wide variety of breeds. On the other hand, it may be that you want a very specific breed and you need it to be a certain age as well.;
, Depending on the size of the shelter in your area, you may be able to make an appointment to talk to a pet counselor there. Bring a list of your desires for a pet with you. A pet counselor can guide you in selecting the right type and breed of animal to best meet your needs.


Not all shelters will have a designated pet counselor. However, many shelter employees are good at discussing the needs of specific pets and what it takes to care for them properly.

, You can look at the websites of large shelter organizations for lists of available pets. There are also websites on the internet that smaller shelter and rescue organizations use to advertise their available pets. Doing an online search that includes the type of pet you want, the city you live in, and the words ""shelter"" or ""rescue"" will usually provide some hits., If you don't find potential pets online, you can contact a shelter directly and tell them what you are looking for. In some cases, if you tell a shelter what type of pet you are looking for, they will keep a lookout for you and contact you if one comes in.Even if a shelter doesn't have the type of pet you are looking for right now, it may have one tomorrow!

, Pet adoption may take time, but you want to be sure to select the right animal. Give yourself plenty of time to choose the right animal when you adopt a pet and ask shelter staff about the personalities and histories of potential pets in order to help with your decision.Sometimes, cats are kept in a communal room where you can go in and socialize with them. This can help you figure out what cats have the type of personality you are looking for.
Often, you may take dogs on walks to get to know them better.

, When you adopt a pet, you are making a commitment to take care of it for the rest of their life. You will need to begin this commitment by buying all the items that your pet will need. In general, all pets need food, water, toys, and bedding. You will need to buy these ahead of time, and the containers that are used to supply them to your pet.

Cats will also require a scratching post and a cat litter box.
Dogs will need a collar and a leash so you can take them outside to go to the bathroom and on outings.

, Pet-proof your home by putting away items that could be hazardous to your pet, such as toxic cleaning chemicals. You should also set up a special area for your new pet, with either a bed or a cage that will house the pet.


Having your house all set up before you bring your pet home will help ease the transition your pet will make. It will allow you to focus your attention on the pet, instead of the logistics of setting up its area.

, Shelters want to make sure that they are adopting their animals to a family that will provide a good home. Find out what type of paperwork the animal shelter requires and bring all required documentation.Bring a picture ID with your present address.
If you live in a rental apartment or house, provide proof that you have your landlord's permission to own a pet, such as a lease agreement or letter.
There may also be questions about your work habits, schedule, pet care philosophy, and financial ability to care for a pet.

, Have a check, credit card or cash ready to adopt a pet. Animal shelter adoption fees may cost less than purchasing an animal from a breeder or a store but prices vary. In many cases, fees for more popular types of pets, such as kittens, will be higher than those for less popular pets, such as old or disabled animals.There may be times of year or periods at each shelter when fees are reduced. For instance, black cats may cost less to adopt during Halloween time.
Before paying, ask about what the fee covers and whether you can return the pet under certain circumstances. In some cases, adoption fees will cover spaying or neutering and some preliminary veterinary care.

, Once you have finished your paperwork and have paid any adoption fees, you will be free to take your pet home. Depending on the type of pet, you will use different ways to transport it home. A dog will need to go into a carrier or be strapped into a harness in the car. A cat will need to go into a carrier. A smaller pet, like a hamster or mouse, will be transported in a small travel cage.

Many shelters will provide small travel cages for little pets. However, you will need to purchase a travel carrier to bring home a cat or dog.

, Have its health assessed, make sure it is up to date on vaccinations, and schedule any veterinary procedures that your pet may need in the future. Sometimes a free vet visit, including vaccinations, is included with the pet adoption.


Animal shelters are working to solve the pet overpopulation problem. If the animal is not neutered, you may have to sign an agreement stating that you will have the pet altered when you adopt it. Make an appointment to get your animal fixed when you take it to be seen by a veterinarian., Animal shelters usually have a 7 to 10 day grace period, so that if the new pet doesn't work out, you can bring it back and exchange it for another animal or get your money back. However, you should give your new pet some time to adjust to its new home before making any decisions like this.Some shelters offer dog training and taking care of pet classes for little or no cost. If your new pet is having behavior issues, try classes before choosing to bring it back to a shelter.

, When thinking about adopting a pet from a shelter, you need to think about whether you have time to take care of a pet properly. Your pet, whatever it is, will need food, water, exercise, and attention every day. Thinking about this can help you decide whether or not to get a pet but it can also help you to decide what type of pet to get. Some pets, such as cats, require less day to day work to take care of than other pets, such as dogs.Pet adoption is a big responsibility that should not be taken lightly. The shelter staff will likely ask you about your schedule to determine if you have time for a pet. You will need to commit yourself fully to providing a good home for the animal.
When thinking about whether you have time to take care of a pet, think about the reality of your life now, not what you want it to be. For instance, don't get a dog because you want to start running daily and you envision taking a dog with you on your daily runs. Unless this is already a part of your daily routine, don't let it sway you towards pet ownership.

, If you are a renter, you should get approval to have a pet from your landlord. First, look at your lease or rental agreement and see if it addresses whether pets are allowed in your home. Then, if the agreement doesn't restrict pet ownership, contact your landlord and tell them that you are considering getting a pet and you need verification in writing that it is OK with them if you have one.Most shelters will require approval in writing if you are a renter, as not getting approval can result in returned or abandoned pets when people have to choose between their housing and their pets.
If you own your home, you will not need approval. However, you may need to provide documents that prove you own your home.

, Even if you have the time to care for a pet and your landlord is OK with it, you may not have the money needed to care for a pet properly. Pets can be expensive to care for, especially big dogs that eat a lot of food. Look at your finances and assess whether you reliably have extra income every month that can go towards pet expenses. Some monthly expenses to think about when assessing your finances include:Food
Pet insurance
Veterinary expenses
Training classes
One time or occasional costs - such as a bed, food dishes, collar, leash, and toys

Observe the pet store premises.,
Take note of what types of animals are in the store.,
Look at the animals.,
Ask the pet store staff plenty of questions.,
Do your research.,
Do not buy the pet as a gift.,
Ask questions about the individual pet.,
Examine the animal.,
Take your pet to your veterinarian.",How to Choose a Pet from a Pet Store," Selecting a quality pet store is key to choosing a happy and healthy pet. When you walk into the pet store, take note of its neatness and cleanliness.In addition to looking at the store’s overall appearance, look at the animals’ cages and enclosures.They should be clean and neat (e.g., clean and fresh bedding, no spoiling food).


The store itself should be brightly lit.
The aisles of a quality pet store should be wide and easy to navigate.Consider asking how often the cages and aquariums are cleaned.;
, A good pet store probably will not carry all types of animals, due to the variability and expense of care. For example, general pet stores probably will not carry reptiles and amphibians, since they are high-maintenance and require more specialized, costly care.A more generalized pet store may recommend that you visit a specialty pet store that sells only reptiles and amphibians.
Specialty pet stores are more likely to be local than part of a national chain.

, The staff at a quality pet store will place a high importance on keeping the animals healthy.As you walk around the store, check to see if the animals look healthy (e.g., well fed, clean, bright and alert disposition). Although pet stores may have sick animals, you should not see them on display.Animals sold in pet stores can become sick because of disease transmission from other animals in the store. The high volume of animals coming into the store increases the likelihood of disease transmission.If you happen to see a sick animal, consider asking one of the staff about how (and if) the animal is being treated.
A pet store with a large number of sick animals on display may indicate a lack of emphasis on quality animal care.

, The staff at a quality pet store should be knowledgeable about the animals in the store, animal care, and the products sold in the store. They should also have a good understanding of disease prevention and control.Do not be afraid to ask questions—you want to be confident that the staff will be able to provide you with useful information on pet care and ownership.


Keep in mind that the employee turnover rate at national chain pet stores may be higher than that at local pet stores. This could result in employees with less in-depth knowledge on specific animals or animal care products.Make sure to ask where the pet store obtains its animals.For example, a pet store may acquire their puppies from puppy mills, which are notorious for breeding and raising dogs in deplorable conditions.Do not purchase an animal from a pet store that obtains their animals through unethical sources (e.g., puppy mills, wild caught).
There are several other questions you can ask: How often do the animals receive medical care? How often are their enclosures cleaned? How do you prevent disease transmission between the animals? Which animals are most popular?

, After you are comfortable with a particular pet store, begin to research which type of pet you would like to purchase. Buying a pet should not be a rush decision, so take your time to learn as much as you can before making the purchase. Several good resources include pet guides, a veterinarian, and neighbors and friends who are pet owners.You can also visit your local humane society or species-specific rescue groups (e.g., ferrets, guinea pigs, rabbits) to learn more information.Reputable breeders are another good source of information.
Be aware that, as knowledgeable as the pet store staff may be, their ultimate goal is to sell you a pet. This may introduce bias into your decision,so it may be a good idea to seek information from more sources than the pet store.
As you are doing research, consider all qualities of a particular animal, not just the desirable ones. For example, although cockatiels are very intelligent and sociable,the females can develop egg laying problems that could negatively affect their health., Resist the temptation to surprise someone, especially a child, with a pet. It may seem like a good idea, but buying a pet as a gift could backfire if the person is not prepared to handle the responsibilities of pet ownership.In fact, a number of pet stores do not allow pet adoptions around major holidays (e.g., Christmas, Easter).Unfortunately, many animals get returned to pet stores after the holidays because the person to whom the animal was given was unable to commit to its long-term care.If you would like to give the pet as a gift, the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommend buying the pet accessories (e.g., cage, dog bed) first and presenting those as gifts. You can then discuss pet ownership and decide if it is a good idea., When you have narrowed your search to a particular pet, ask specific questions about its care. Ask about basic animal husbandry (e.g., diet, housing, toys), required medical are, and how large the animal will get.You can also ask how long the animal is expected to live—some animals (e.g., large birds) can live for several decades, and others, such as pocket pets, live for only a few years.If you have children, consider asking which animals would be safe and manageable for children. For example, reptiles may not be a good choice for children because they are high maintenance and could transmit salmonella through their feces.You may have already come across this information during your research. However, you can further gauge the knowledge of the pet store staff by asking these questions when you are in the store.
Listen for answers that are direct and honest. You want to be sure that the staff is answering your questions in a way that provides useful information, rather than encourages a sale., Looking at the physical health and behavior of an animal is always important, whether you are buying from a pet store, breeder, or animal shelter. Although certain physical characteristics will vary between species, a healthy animal will look bright and alert in his enclosure, will look well fed, and will not have any signs of ill health (e.g., emaciation, discharge from eyes or nose, poor bone structure).


If you are considering buying a fish, healthy characteristics to look for include bright colors, a well-rounded stomach, and clear eyes.A healthy reptile will have such characteristics as a belly that is free of burns and skin that is free of scratches and bites.If you are unsure about what ‘healthy’ looks like in a particular species, ask a veterinarian or animal expert for guidance.

, After you have chosen your pet from the store, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as you can.If your veterinarian detects certain health issues with your pet, you may be able to return the pet to the store.Ask about the animal return policy before you purchase the pet. You want to make sure you understand your responsibility (and the store’s responsibility) if a health issue is detected after you purchase your pet.

Wash your pet with a good detergent based pet shampoo and very warm water.,

,
Any traces of skunk spray that did not get wet with the deodorant will continue to smell of skunk.",How to De Skunk a Pet Using OdorXit Concentrate," The detergent aspect of the shampoo is important because it changes the nature of the oily substance that is causing the odor. The very warm water makes it easier to wash and rinse your pet because their body temperature is higher than yours and they are always wearing their coat. When you wet their coat it looses all of its insulation ability and if the water is too cool, your pet gets cold. If your shower is big enough for you and your pet, and you have a hand sprayer, using the shower and hand sprayer works really well.;
, Avoid getting the shampoo in your pets eyes, but since the chances are very good that it was sprayed in the face, it is necessary to wash as much of its face, snout and ears as possible. It is normally not necessary to wash down inside their ears, but if their ears stand up naturally, it may be necessary, just use a minimal amount of water and let them shake it out right away.

,, Do not dry your pet at this point.

, When treating the face and surrounding areas, using a small kitchen sponge works very well but you still need to get the coat and skin wet with the mixture.

,, Therefore, it is critical to get the OdorXit solution into all the folds. If you miss a spot and discover it later, just re-wet the smelly area with the OdorXit solution and allow it to dry naturally. If your pet's paws have skunk spray odor on them, dip the whole paw in the solution.

Using a towel, start blotting and dabbing the vomit until the chunks and moisture are mostly gone.With each blot and dab, be sure to use a clean section of the towel; you may need more than one towel if the carpeted area is large.

, Warm up about 2 cups of water in a large microwave-safe bowl or cup. Stir in 1 tbsp of salt, and continue stirring until the salt is dissolved.

, Add these ingredients to the water and salt mixture. Mix all of these ingredients together in the bowl or cup.

, Dip a clean sponge repeatedly in the cleaning solution to saturate it with the cleaning substance. You will use this to continue cleaning the carpeted area. Again, if the area is large, you may need more than one sponge.

, Using small strokes, remove the rest of the vomit and any stains with the damp kitchen sponge. Just like before, with every stroke and dab, use a clean area of the sponge.


Each time you stroke the area with the sponge, you will be removing vomit.
Rinse the sponge in the sink with warm water if it becomes completely dirty.
You will likely want to throw the sponge you use away.

, This will rid the carpet of any smells and will help the carpet dry.

, It may take several hours for the baking soda on the carpet to dry, and it will likely become clumpy.Keep your pets away from the carpeted area during this time. Once the area is completely dry, use a vacuum cleaner to completely suck up the baking soda.

, Using a spoon or knife may help.

, With each blot and dab, be sure to use a clean section of the towel; you may need more than one towel if the carpeted area is large.

, This will absorb the rest of the moisture that remains below the surface of the carpet. Cover the entire carpeted area with baking soda or corn starch.

, The baking soda or corn starch will likely dry within 2 hours, and they may become clumpy. Once the baking soda or corn starch is dry, use a vacuum to completely suck up the remaining particles.

, Check the container before buying the cleaner to make sure it is enzyme based; this means the cleaner will break down the odor-causing proteins so they can be removed. They are effective in removing stains, too. Spray the area with the cleaner until it is very damp.

, The cleaner container may say that the cleaner needs to sit for a longer or shorter period of time. Read the back of the container for specific instructions. Generally, 1-2 hours will allow the product to remove stains and odor.

, Once the cleaner completely dries, it can be walked on again.

, Using a professional carpet cleaner will remove the toughest of stains. You can simply hire carpet cleaners, or rent the carpet cleaner and clean the stained areas yourself. Carpet cleaners are available at grocery stores or rental centers.Rentals can be as cheap as $24.99 for 24 hours.If you do not feel comfortable operating a carpet cleaner, hire professionals.
Ask a friend for help, since you will have to move furniture and operate a somewhat heavy carpet cleaning machine.

, Purchase the recommended cleaner when you rent the machine. If you are unsure what to fill the machine with, ask the salesperson you rented it from.

, Once you take the machine home, clear the area you will be cleaning of any furniture. Remember, you will need to let the carpet dry for around 24 hours, so the furniture will need to remain off the carpet during this entire time.

, They work by injecting a solution into the carpet, then extracting dirty solution back into the machine. You will need to fill a tank on the machine with solution.


There may even be a second tank that holds clean water.
Every carpet cleaner machine will be slightly different, so be sure to read all instructions before operating the cleaning machine.
You may need to replace the dirty solution if you are cleaning a large area.

, Now, turn the machine off, and make sure the carpet does not change color. Wait a few minutes; if the carpet does not change color, the cleaner is safe to use.

, Plug in the machine in the room you will be cleaning, and turn it on. In a pattern of straight lines, move up and down the room.Move at a pace of about two feet per second.Usually, only one pass over the carpet is necessary to remove stains, and moving over the carpeted area more than once is not recommended.

, Refill the tank with clean solution, and continue cleaning. You may not need to do this if the room you are cleaning is small.

, Once you’ve gone over every stained area once, turn off and the unplug the machine. Then, empty any water or solution tanks.

, It usually takes 24 hours for carpets to dry.

, Since you are done with the cleaning machine, you can now return it to the store or rental place.

Give the spot an initial go-over.,
Spray on some upholstery care or carpet cleaner.,
Let the cleaner start to work on the spot.,
Wipe away the remaining mess.",How to Clean Bird Droppings1," Using a warm, wet cloth, take a few passes at the spot to get the worst of the mess out of the way. Because of the way carpet and fabric upholstery are made, much of the droppings will collect and harden at the top of the fibers, making the bulk of it easier to wipe away. Use pinching, pulling motions with the wet cloth to coax the droppings out of the carpet or upholstery., Depending on exactly what type of surface you’re cleaning and what materials it’s made of, you’ll want to purchase some special cleaner that is guaranteed to work safely on that surface. Most standard carpet cleaners or all-purpose household cleaners will be mild enough to work on any kind of carpet, and foaming upholstery cleaners can be found at any supermarket or drugstore. Spray enough cleaner onto the spot to cover what’s left of it.If you do not have any specialized carpet cleaner on hand, you also have the option of mixing up a gentle solution consisting of mild laundry detergent, vinegar and warm water., Give the cleaner two or three minutes to sit on the spot. The chemical compounds in the cleaner will begin to eat away the hardened stain, making it easy to wipe away later.

, Use a damp washcloth to go over the spot once again. The stain-fighting power of the cleaner combined with the force of scrubbing by hand should be enough to take the spot out of your carpet or upholstery. If any traces are left after scrubbing, spray a little more cleaner on the spot, let it sit, then make a second attempt.


Scrub forcefully to ensure that you get as much of the dried-on mess out of the deeper layers of the carpet as you can.
Always wash any washcloth or towel that comes into contact with bird poop right away.

"
"
Wet the spot with warm water.,
Let the spot sit for a few minutes.,
Use a hose to clean the mess.,
Use a brush to knock out stubborn traces.",How to Clean Bird Droppings2," If the droppings are in an accessible place, wet them with warm water before you begin cleaning. Pour the water directly over the spot, or soak a washcloth and use it to cover the spot. The warmth and moisture of the water will begin softening the stain, loosening its hold on hard, porous surfaces., Give the warm water ample time to begin softening the stain. Bird droppings dry in a thick paste, and it may be much harder to clean them away if they’re still partially dry. Make sure you’ve wet the entire spot. Once the water has softened the droppings, they will begin to look fresh again.

, Take a garden hose and hold it a few feet away from the spot. Turn it on at full flow and aim it directly at the bird droppings. The constant stream of water should finish the job that wetting the spot started. Go over the stain it’s completely gone.If your hose comes with a head that allows you to adjust the stream, set it to the high-pressure, single stream flow to blast away bird messes.
If your hose doesn't have an adjustable head, you can place your thumb halfway over the nozzle to partially block the water flow and produce a higher pressure stream manually.

, If traces of the droppings remain after you’ve washed the spot with a hose, take a small, stiff-bristled scrubbing brush (a household broom will also work) and scour the area, re-wetting as needed. The bristles will dig into the crevices in the brick, concrete or roofing tile and and scrape away the remaining bird poop.


Be sure to clean the brush off after use; bird feces is filled with bacteria."
"
Place a warm, wet cloth over the stain.,
Treat the spot with a specialty cleaner.,
Leave the cleaner on for only a few moments.,
Use a soft towel to gently scrub out the spot.",How to Clean Bird Droppings3," Wet a washcloth with hot or warm water and lay it over the afflicted area. A wet cloth is preferable to directly applying warm water to hardwood or car paint because the cloth traps heat and moisture, rather than simply running off or possibly causing water damage. Leave the spot to soak in the moisture from the cloth.

, Once the bird droppings have softened, treat the spot directly with a wood or car cleaner. If the smooth surface you’re cleaning is vinyl or something similar, an all-purpose cleaner should be fine, or you might even have success with the warm washcloth alone. Spray or blot just enough cleaner onto the spot to cover it; avoid getting excess cleaner on unaffected areas of hardwood or paint.A wash-and-wax cleaner should do the trick on cars. Wash-and-wax solutions are formulated to clean dirt, oil and grime off of cars and leave the topcoat of paint with a freshly-waxed shine.Purchasing special cleaning products is recommended for treating temperamental surfaces, but assuming you don't feel like dropping a lot of money, you can also go the homemade route. A gentle, natural wood polish can be whipped up out of hot water, olive oil and lemon juice, while dish soap diluted with warm water makes a basic but effective solution for cleaning car exteriors., Hardwood and car paint are surfaces that are easily damaged, so only leave the cleaner on the spot for a few moments to give it time to set up. Otherwise, the cleaner made bleed through the spot and stain your hardwood floor, or eat into your top coat of paint. There’s no need for the cleaner to sit for a long period of time on the spot because hard, smooth surfaces are non-porous, and therefore the cleaner won’t have to soak into the material in order to clean it., Take another clean, damp towel and wipe away as much of the bird droppings as you can. Broad, gentle strokes will work best here. Try not to scrub in a back-and-forth motion or apply too much pressure, as this may weaken the surface’s finish. After all remnants of the spot are removed, dry the area by dabbing it with a dry towel.


Microfiber towels are extremely soft and their fibers let them lock in the dirt and water that they soak up, making them ideal for most gentle cleaning jobs.Take special care to dry hardwood floors quickly, as allowing moisture to sit on wood can cause it to warp and splinter.

"
"
Mix some gentle laundry detergent in warm water.,
Apply the solution to the spot.,
Scrub the stain away.,
Wash the garment.",How to Clean Bird Droppings4," Pour a small amount of liquid laundry detergent into a container of warm water and allow it to spread throughout the water. This will create a cleaning solution you can use to spot-treat the area directly. A little goes a long way: about one part detergent to five parts water is more than enough., Laundry detergents are effective at cutting through hard, dry and greasy stains like the one you’re dealing with. Wet the hardened stain the solution to soften it. Let the laundry solution sit on the spot for two or three minutes. Reapply the solution if the stain doesn’t look like it’s softening.

, Using a scrubber brush or disposable dish sponge, scrub the area thoroughly to wipe out the stain. Keep the stain wet and sudsy by dipping the brush or sponge into the laundry solution as needed. Continue until the spot is completely gone.If you’re cleaning a delicate garment, use gentle, sweeping circular motions to ease the spot out, or use the soft side of the sponge.
If you use a sponge, throw it away after you’re finished. Yuck!

, Put the piece of clothing you’re cleaning through a regular wash cycle after you’ve scrubbed out the bird droppings. Wash on medium or high heat with like colors. When the garment comes out of the dryer, you’ll never be able to tell that it happened!

Use baking soda.,
Use apple cider vinegar.,
Keep the windows open.,
Notice specific areas where the smell is the strongest.,
Target specific locations your dog frequents.,
Spray some air freshener.",How to Eliminate Dog Smell1," Baking soda is widely known for its odor neutralizing properties. If you want to get rid of some of the dog smell you’re your home, just sprinkle a little baking soda on the affected areas.Cover the fabric with a light dusting of baking soda and let it sit for 15-30 minutes. After the time is up, vacuum it up.
For extra tough odors, you can leave the baking soda on the carper overnight. This will help absorb even more of the smell.
Alternatively, you could create your own all-purpose cleaning solution out of baking soda. Simply add two tablespoons of baking soda with 3 cups of hot water in a spray bottle. Shake it up and spray on the fabric or surface emitting the odor. Wipe the surface clean with a damp cloth.;
, Another great way to address dog smell in your home is by using apple cider vinegar to eliminate the smell in problem areas. Make a mixture using one part apple cider vinegar and three parts water, then spray the mixture on the area that smells the worst – fabric, carpet, etc. Blot as much of it up with a rag or an old towel and let the rest dry on the carpet.This method is especially useful for covering up the smell of dog urine.

, A great way to address the dog smell in your home is by keeping the windows open as often as possible. This will help air out your home and make it smell fresher like the outdoors in addition to getting rid of some of the dog smell.

, Go around to the places your dog spends the most time and try to determine where the smell is coming from. Get close to the items and use your sense of smell to see if there is any noticeable odor emanating from the fabric.Check specific pieces of furniture (like the couch where your pup naps or the bed it sleeps on) and areas of the carpet (like the carpet around the door your dog uses to go outside) for odor.

, Use an air freshener to cover up any sources of odor you may not have been able to locate. After you’ve cleaned all your carpet and furniture that could be causing the dog smell, spray some air freshener liberally around the places your dog hangs out the most.You can even buy air fresheners that are specially formulated to cover up pet odor.

Understand the chemistry.,
Mix a homemade solution to remove the oils.,
Wear gloves.,
Apply the solution outside.,
Scrub the dog with the solution.,
Dry your dog well.,
Do not store the solution.,
Use a skunk-removal spray or shampoo.",How to Care for a Skunk Sprayed Dog1," The smelly part of the skunk spray is from chemicals called thiols.These awful-smelling oils make the scent “stick” to the sprayed dog. Unfortunately, you cannot simply shampoo and rinse these oils away.


Also, skip the tomato juice myth because that will not eliminate the oils either.;
, There are special chemical solutions used to remove substances containing thiols. You can mix a mild form of this solution at home that is safe for your dog. The following formula will make enough to scrub a small- or medium-sized dog. Double or even triple the amounts for very large dogs. You should mix:1 quart 3% hydrogen peroxide
1/4 cup baking soda
1 teaspoon liquid hand soap

, The solution has the potential to irritate your skin, so you should wear gloves when you mix and use it. You also want to wear gloves to avoid transferring any of the skunk smell to yourself while handling the stinky dog.


The solution may irritate your dog’s skin as well, especially if the pet is prone to skin infections or other skin conditions. In these cases, consult your veterinarian before using the solution.

, In addition to keeping the smelly dog from spreading the smell inside, you want to use the solution outside because the peroxide can potentially stain wood, cloth furniture, and other household items.

, Gently scrub the dog with the solution, but be careful to avoid the eyes and inner ears. Allow the solution to sit for up to five minutes but no more than that. Rinse the dog very thoroughly since the peroxide can discolor fur.


If the smell remains, you may have to repeat the process.

, Make sure you dry the dog well before allowing him back in the house. You should also keep an eye on him during this period and watch for other complications from being sprayed.


If your dog gets wet at all within a week or so, you may faintly notice the skunk smell again. Try not to bathe your dog again for a week.

, The solution will lose its effectiveness from sitting, so you should make and use it immediately. Do not store the solution for future use if you make too much.

, There are also shampoos formulated for removing skunk spray from a dog’s coat. However, they’re more expensive than the ingredients for the homemade solution, and they likely will not work as well. Your veterinarian may suggest one of these shampoos instead of the solution if your dog is prone to skin conditions that make the homemade solution inadvisable.

Sweep and vacuum regularly.,
Wash the bedding.",How to Eliminate Dog Smell2," One of the best ways to thoroughly clean your whole house and rid it of pet odor is to regularly clean your house with a general disinfecting cleaning product that uses an enzymatic cleaner to break down pet-related odors.Some of the most popular brands of enzymatic cleaning products include Nature’s Miracle, Urine Off, Pawsitively Clean, Biokleen, and Rug Doctor., One of the biggest things that contributes to pet odor is the accumulation of hair that your dog sheds on the floor. If you have hardwood or tile floors, you’ll be able to see the dust bunnies that form out of clumps of dust and dog hair over time. If you have carpet these are more difficult to see, but you’ll still need to clean them up regularly.If you have carpet, vacuum it once every few days (at least once a week) or as necessary. Consider steam cleaning your carpet once every couple of months or whenever you start to notice the dog smell more.
If you have tile or hardwoods, you should sweep it once every few days and consider a more intensive cleaning (like mopping) once every month or so.

, If your dog has a blanket or a dog bed that it sleeps on regularly, you should wash it at least once per week. If the dog spends much time on it, then its hair and dandruff constantly rubs off on it and settles into the fabric. This traps the dog odor inside the dog bed, but washing it will greatly decrease the pet smell in your house.


Additionally, if your dog sleeps on your bed with you, consider washing your own bedding once every week or so. This will help cut down on any odor that gets into your bedding at night.

This also works with rubber gloves or cloth gardening gloves with a rubber coating on the palm. A rubber bristle push broom can work in the same way on floors. Dampen the glove or rubber section of the glove for increased effectiveness.

, Rub it across the surface that has pet hair on it. The static charge on the balloon's surface will attract the hair (and yours, too!), which you can collect. You can then re-use the balloon to pick up more hair.

, This is especially effective for stubborn pet hair that sticks to all sorts of surfaces. The bristles' static charge causes the hair to jump onto the brush.

, Use a pair of shoes with a rubber sole, like cowboy boots (Without dung or dirt on them), trainers, etc. Wearing the shoe(s) (the easiest option), drag your foot along the rug or carpet and watch all the hair bunch up! Simply lift up the hair and bin it.

, A fabric softener sheet that normally goes in the dryer can be used to pick up pet hair. You can also mist the surface with a mixture of fabric softener and water to ""prep"" the area before removing the pet hair using any of the other methods.

Strong canvas in good shape will be okay, such as that used for overhead sail cloths but finer and older canvas may be weaker and pressure washing could break the fibers. A hose wash without the pressure attachment but putting a finger over the end of the hose to produce a stronger spray may be better for more delicate canvas.

, Mix 2 liters/1/2 gallon of warm water to 1/4 cup of liquid soap. Gently rub it over the stain to lift.


If the canvas is removable, such as seat cushion covers, remove and wash in the washing machine using the mild liquid laundry soap.






For really bad stains, using liquid soap may not suffice. See the section on using commercial preparations.

Brush off the droppings to remove anything that will come off easily.,
Hose or pressure wash the stain with clean water.,
Make a paste of salt and lemon juice.,
Rub the paste over the bird dropping stain that remains.

,
Let sit in full sunshine.,
Wash off.",How to Clean Bird Droppings off Canvas Furniture4," Use a household small dustpan brush to do this.

, (See the previous method for tips about pressure washing with care.)

, One lemon should be sufficient for a standard stain but you'll need to judge by how large the extent of the bird droppings. Add enough salt to the juice to form a paste.

,, When you find it hard to see the stain, it's time to remove the paste.

, Hopefully the stain will go with it.

Check the manufacturer's instructions.,
Ask for a recommendation at a store that sells canvas furniture.",How to Clean Bird Droppings off Canvas Furniture5," They may have recommended a product suitable for cleaning the canvas furniture. A lot of canvas furniture has special waterproofing features which must be considered when using a commercial cleaning product.

, When selecting a product, check that it doesn't affect any waterproofing placed on the canvas.


Some suggested options from a sweep of various online forums include: Barkeeper's Friend, LAs Totally Awesome and Spot Shot Upholstery Stain Remover. However, such products tend to be very strong and may cause new stains. If you do use them, always test a small patch first, to see if the product stains or removes waterproofing properties.

Use water to dilute the urine-stained area.,
Use an enzyme-neutralizing cleaner.,
Launder or replace any items that retain smell.",How to Get Rid of Dog Urine Smell2," If your dog’s urine stain has set for a long time and the smell is strong, you will first need to dilute the stain. Get a bowl of warm water, and use a two clean towels towel to alternately dampen and blot dry the stained spot. Do this several times to dilute the stain, and smell, as much as possible.


You may want to wear rubber gloves for this.
Your towels may start to take on some of the odor. However unpleasant, this is what you want, as it indicates you are drawing the smell out of the soiled area. Swap out your towels and continue diluting the stain as much as possible.

, Once you have diluted the odor as much as possible, use an enzyme neutralizer, such as Nature’s Miracle or Angry Orange. These cleaners break down protein-based molecules in urine that can cause bad odors. After doing a test for colorfastness on a hidden area of your carpet or upholstery, spray the area thoroughly with the cleaner and let stand for 5-10 minutes. Blot dry with a clean towel., If an odor remains after using the enzyme neutralizer, remove slipcovers from any soiled items and launder with cool water. Air dry to avoid shrinkage in the dryer..


If your dog has peed a carpet, consider replacing the rug pad beneath. These can contain synthetic materials that are more difficult to purge bad odors from.

Use a 1-1 water and white vinegar solution.,
Try a hydrogen peroxide mask.,
Sand the wood down and refinish.",How to Get Rid of Dog Urine Smell3," Removing odors that are set in hardwood is difficult, but luckily, wood is more tolerant of stronger cleaning agents. Mix a solution that is 50% white vinegar and 50% water. Rub the solution into the urine stain vigorously with a soft sponge. Let it cure for 5-10 minutes. Then, wipe up the solution with a clean, dry towel.You can sprinkle the spot with a few tablespoons of baking soda too for some additional cleaning power after using the vinegar solution. Vacuum the soda up after it sits for a few hours or overnight.

, Soak a clean facecloth or hand towel in 3% hydrogen peroxide until it is saturated but not dripping. Wring the towel if necessary, and place the towel over the urine-stained area. Let the towel sit for 2-3 hours to deodorize the offending spot.


If the floor is still damp when you remove the hydrogen peroxide towel, wipe the area dry with a clean cloth., If the smell of the stain is not dissipating, you have the option of sanding down your wood floor. This is not to be undertaken lightly because it is expensive and time consuming, but it may be the best option to remove very deep odors. Sanding removes the top layer of wood and will effectively polish out your odors by buffing away the surface layer they live in. Contact a professional contractor for a quote to perform this work without damaging your floor.Sanding is simpler to do with unfinished wood (a deck, for example) but can be accomplished with finished hardwood inside. A professional can help you match your existing finish properly.

Walk your dog more frequently.,
Get a dog trainer to work on your pup’s potty training.,
Get your dog checked at the vet for any underlying health problems.,
Use repellent products as necessary.",How to Get Rid of Dog Urine Smell4," If your dog is not getting walked frequently enough, they may feel the need to relieve themselves in the house. Ensure you are taking your dog out to pee at least four times a day, but more frequently if your dog is very old, young or infirm. If need be, hire a dog walker to come by your home so you can meet your dog’s needs., Some dogs, whether due to a lack of training as puppies or past abuse, never get properly trained to use the bathroom outside. If you suspect this may be the case of your dog, particularly if your dog has an unknown history, call a dog trainer. Many trainers do in-home sessions that can address your dog’s specific problem behaviors.Trainers can also diagnose whether your dog’s urination in the house may be due to an underlying behavioral issue such as separation anxiety.

, If your dog’s urination problems persist despite walking your dog frequently and employing a trainer, you may want to take them to the vet. Some health problems, such as neutering complications or urinary tract infections, can cause your dog to pee more frequently, including inside the house.Make a note of where your dog goes in the house, how often, and when your issues started so you can relate them to your veterinarian.

, Certain repellent products, such as Four Paws Keep Off! and Nature’s Miracle Pet Block Repellent, can discourage your dog from urinating in the house. Test your materials for colorfastness, and then spray the repellant thoroughly on the area your dog urinates.

Quit smoking.,
Smoke away from pets.,
Make sure that others are not smoking near your pets.,
Learn what secondhand smoke is.,
Find out about the toxic chemicals in secondhand smoke.,
Recognize the risk to your pet's health.,
Know the signs of illness.,
Seek out treatment for your pet.",How to Protect Pets from Secondhand Smoke," The easiest way to protect pets from secondhand smoke is to stop smoking yourself. If you smoke often, for instance in your home, and your pet is exposed to that smoke, then it can have very severe health consequences for both of you. Instead, work on quitting smoking so that both you and your pet can have longer, healthier lives.

Quitting smoking can be very difficult. Get help from other people, such as family members and health professionals, and from smoking cessation products, such as patches and gum. It's important to use whatever tools you can and whatever is helpful in order to quit a habit that is so bad for your health.;
, If you cannot quit smoking, then at the very least do it far away from your pets. If your pet could potentially smell the smoke, then you are too close to it and you are exposing it to secondhand smoke.

The easiest way to smoke away from pets is to do it outside in an area that the pets do not go in. This will guarantee that the pets are not exposed to your smoke.
Although it has not been linked directly to causing diseases, some scientists argue that thirdhand smoke, meaning smoke particles that land on fabric, hair, and skin, is full of toxins that can affect other people, and pets, as well.If you are concerned about this, make sure to wash your hands and change your clothes after smoking and before snuggling with your pet.While electronic cigarettes do not pose the same threat of secondhand smoke to pets as traditional ones do, they do pose a small hazard. Make sure spent cartridges are kept away from pets, so that they do not chew or eat them., Even if you have avoided exposing your pets to secondhand smoke, other people may do it without knowing that it could damage your pet's health. If you see someone smoking near your pet, move your pet far enough away so that you can no longer smell the smoke.

If you hire a pet sitter or get friends to watch your pets, make sure that these people know to keep your pet away from secondhand smoke.

, Secondhand smoke is a combination of smoke coming straight off a cigarette or cigar and the smoke exhaled from a smoker's lungs. It can build up especially well in an enclosed room, such as when a smoker smokes inside their home, but can enter one's lungs if they are close to a smoker who is smoking outside.Secondhand smoke is emitted from all tobacco products that are burned, including both cigarettes and cigars. In fact, a cigar can put off as much secondhand smoke as an entire pack of cigarettes.

, There are a wide variety of chemicals in secondhand smoke, such as cyanide and arsenic. These chemicals are inhaled into the lungs and transferred into the bloodstream when one inhales secondhand smoke. These chemicals can be extremely toxic to pets and humans alike.There are actually more than 7,000 chemicals that have been identified in secondhand smoke.Many of these are cancer causing, while others can cause other illnesses.

, Secondhand smoke does a variety of harmful things to your pet's health. It limits the ability of blood to get oxygen to the heart by limiting the oxygenation of blood, it introduces a wide variety of toxic chemicals into the body, and it promotes the growth of cancerous tumors, particularly in the lungs and other parts of the respiratory system.It has been scientifically proven that secondhand smoke is a known carcinogen, meaning that it causes cancer.While there has been much less testing on its impact on animals than its impact on humans, secondhand smoke is nonetheless extremely dangerous to their health as well., Secondhand smoke can cause a wide variety of illnesses, including, but not limited to, diseases of the respiratory system. These include less serious illnesses, such as asthma or bronchitis, and more serious diseases, such as precancerous and cancerous lesions in the lungs. If you notice that your pet has a dry cough, has a cough that is getting progressively worse, or the pet is wheezing when it breathes, then it could be a sign that your cat needs veterinary care.Many less severe illnesses associated with secondhand smoke, such as bronchitis, can clear up on their own if the pet is no longer exposed to secondhand smoke.

, If you suspect that your pet is suffering from a disease associated with secondhand smoke, then go to the veterinarian. Keep a record of its symptoms, including when they started, and bring that information with you to the veterinary office. The best thing you can do for your pet at this point is to get it good veterinary care.Your veterinarian will likely run a variety of tests on your pet. These could include a blood test, an x-ray, and a thorough examination of your pet's body. These tests will help the veterinarian to assess the animal's overall health and they will help him or her to locate any problems.
Ask your vet about potential treatment plans for your pet. Always make sure to closely follow the vet's instructions.

Watch your food tables.,
Refrain from giving carcasses to your cat.,
Keep rich sauces from your cat.,
Stop your cat from drinking alcohol.,
Take your cat to the vet immediately.",How to Protect Your Cat from Holiday Hazards1," The holidays bring parties and dinners where you and your loved ones often have rich foods. These foods may be tasty for you, but they are not good for your pet. This is even worse for your cat, because she can jump on tables or counters and grab food without you being aware of it. This means you need to be very aware of where your cat is when you have food lying around, and you should also be sure to close your kitchen doors. There are certain foods that are especially toxic for cats, including:


Grapes and raisins, often in holiday treats such as mince pies, fruit cake, and Christmas pudding
Chocolate
Alcohol are all toxic to cats;
, During the holidays, you may be serving turkey or other large meats. Make sure that you do not feed any turkey carcasses to your cat. The small bones in these could get stuck in her throat or puncture her stomach wall. This is true of the scraps of chicken, ham, or other meats.


Make sure you also have a cat proof trash can. Your can may want to get the scraps out of your trash by knocking down your trash bins. A bin with a screw top is best for this, because it will not open is she knocks it over., You may also serve rich sauces during the holiday season. These rich sauces, especially those containing onions and garlic, are dangerous to your cat. These can damage her red blood cell and may cause serious anemia.


Rich sauces that contain cream or other dairy can also cause your cat to have bad diarrhea. These high fat sauces are a possible risk factor for pancreatitis, a potentially serious condition that may cause your cat to die., Holiday parties may mean there is alcohol around your house. While you are having a party, make sure you keep your cat away from these alcoholic beverages. The relatively small size of your cat means that just a few laps of the alcohol could cause alcohol poisoning.


Try to make sure your guests also keep their drinks from your cat as well., If you cat happens to eat any of the foods that are toxic to her, you need to get her to the veterinarian immediately. Your vet will make your cat vomit the bad food up to ensure they are out of her stomach so she cannot digest them.


If this is done within two hours of ingestion, it could potentially save your cat from the possibility of medical issues."

Anchor your Christmas tree.,
Do not let your cat drink Christmas tree water.,
Keep your cat from tinsel or foil icicles.,
Avoid cat exposure to glass ornaments.",How to Protect Your Cat from Holiday Hazards2," Your cat may be tempted to climb your Christmas tree if you have one up. If you have a cat, consider anchoring your Christmas tree so it will not fall over and hurt you, your cat, or a visitor.


To do this, wrap fishing line around the top of the tree and tie it to a sturdy structure., If your house has a real Christmas tree, make sure you keep your cat from drinking from the water bowl underneath it. This water could be filled with harmful chemicals, fertilizers, and bacteria that were drained through the tree.


When you are home, make sure you keep your cat away from the tree water.
If you aren't home, find a way to keep your cat away from the water, such as putting a small gate around the tree or keeping your cat in a different room., During the holiday season, you may have tinsel or foil icicles around your house. Since cats love to play with shiny things, these decorations may be a disaster waiting to happen. If you cat gets a hold of these things and swallows it, the tinsel can pleat up your cat's bowel and then shred her insides. This will cause your cat to be very sick and she may need to have life-saving surgery.


This is also true for ribbons on gifts as well., Hanging glass ornaments or table decorations can be very dangerous for your cat. These decorations can easily be grabbed or batted by your cat, which can cause them to shatter. The shattered pieces can cause her to cut herself and cause major injury.


If your cat eats any of these shattered pieces, she may also sustain internal injuries."
"
Keep your doors closed.,
Avoid holiday plant ingestion.,
Place candles in safe locations.,
Keep small parts away from your cat.",How to Protect Your Cat from Holiday Hazards3," The holiday season brings many guests to your home. Whether you have overnight guests or are throwing a party, there are many people coming and going from your house. During this time, your pet has a higher likelihood of getting out.


When your guests arrive, ask them to please close the door behind them.
If your cat has a tendency to dash out the door, you may need to keep your cat locked up in one room in your house with food and water. This way your pet will be safe and comfortable and there will be no risk of her getting out.

, During the holiday season, you may have certain holiday plants around your house. These plants can irritate your cat if they are eater. They may also cause sickness, diarrhea, or excessive drooling. Also avoid keeping winter lilies in the house, since the ingestion of these can cause kidney failure. The plants that can cause poisoning include:


Poinsettias
Holly
Mistletoe
Ivy, During the holiday season, you may have candles around your house. Although candles are pretty, they can be dangerous if you have cats. Your cat may jump onto the shelf, counter, or table where the candles are. This can cause your cat to burn herself. She may also knock it off, which can cause a fire to spread.If you plan to have many candles around during a party or event, keep your cat in another room.

, During this time of year, you may have costumes that you wear for holiday programs, events, or other get togethers. If she gets a hold of small parts, it may cause intestinal issues or get stuck.


If you have any children, make sure you keep any toys with small parts away from your cat. If she swallows these pieces, she may choke or have health issues."

Remove electrical cords.,
Be careful with plants.,
Keep household chemicals under lock and key.,
Keep the candles out of reach.,
Be careful with toys.,
Keep an eye on heaters and pets.",How to Remove Household Hazards from Your Pets," These look like chewing toys to young animals, especially kittens and puppies. The trouble is that a few bites can result in electrocution or severe burns, not to mention loss of the cord in question for your appliance. Always keep cords out of the reach of your pets and if you must have them in the open, get some cord guards from your local hardware or electrical store (even the vet might know where to get some from). And as horrible as this sounds, never touch a dead pet found with an electrical cord in its mouth; the pet may still be live and you will be electrocuted too. Turn the power off at the mains or call the fire brigade or police for assistance.;
, Some plants are safe around pets but a lot of them are not. Unfortunately, many of the beautiful flowers in floral arrangements are deadly to our furry friends, such as lilies and hydrangeas. Poisonous plants should be kept out of reach from chewing pets or keep them out of the house altogether.

, Household chemicals are mostly hazardous if swallowed and a curious pet can easily fall prey to some nasty chemical combinations if attracted to the product or chewing the container. One problematic household item in particular is antifreeze. Antifreeze tastes sweet and is therefore attractive to pets. It will attack your pet's kidneys very quickly if swallowed, so never have it at pet level or where a pet can get to it. Lock it and all of your other chemical products up! See Protect Pets from Hazardous Household Products for more information.

, Do not leave a burning candle alone any time for any reason; this is how fires start. It is even more dangerous when pets are about - the flame can attract them to play with it, or they can accidentally brush a candle with a tail as they walk by, knocking it over. When using candles, always be present, have the pets away and preferably have at least one other person keeping an eye on the candle as well., Even pet toys can cause problems. Don't buy toys that are too small for your pet - they can be swallowed and the pet can choke. String and yarn should also be put away when you have finished playing with the kitten or puppy because the animal can become entangled in it when you are not present, or swallow it.

, Some modern heaters and fireplaces are very attractive and the ones with glass frontage are a danger to pets who do not realize the glass is present. Pets can push their noses against the glass thinking that they are sniffing at the fire, only to get a nasty burn from the hot glass. Keep a close eye on activity of pets around such a heater and around other heaters as well. Always keep a cover over any fans (hot or cold) in case a pet tries to play with the moving blades.

Keep your houseplants out of your pets' reach.,
Purchase sturdy plant stands for your houseplants.,
Coat the houseplants with a pet deterrent.,
Grow houseplants specifically for your pets.,
Grow plants that require little soil.,
Avoid growing toxic houseplants.",How to Protect Your Houseplants from Pets," This is the simplest and most effective solution. Position as many of your plants as possible on high, inaccessible window ledges or on top of tall furniture. Hanging baskets are also a good option. In some cases, you may even be able to prevent a pet from jumping onto a previously accessible windowsill by simply crowding it with houseplants.;
, If you are worried about your pets eating your houseplants, you can place the pots onto tall plant stands. These decorative stands are an attractive way to display houseplants, and they keep the leaves out of reach of your pet's mouth. Unfortunately, these stands can still be overturned by aggressive, energetic pets.

, Many pet stores (as well as some nurseries) sell spray products that are meant to be repulsive to cats and dogs. One such spray product is sold as ""bitter apple,"" and can be harmlessly sprayed on your houseplants. Regular application of these types of sprays will dissuade dogs and cats from attempting to eat or overturn houseplants.

, If you can't keep your pets from damaging your own houseplants, consider growing more attractive options just for them. Catnip, mint, and cat grass (which is usually a variety of oat grass or wheat grass) are 3 plants that cats love to nibble on. Having these plants available may lead your cat to ignore your remaining houseplants.

, If your chief concern is that your pets continually overturn your houseplant pots and spill the soil, you can opt for plants that need little or no messy soil. Succulents and cacti can be grown in a mix made largely of gravel, while lucky bamboo can be grown in nothing but water.

, If all else fails, you will at least want to know which houseplants are toxic to pets so that you can avoid growing them. Common houseplants that are toxic to cats and dogs include aloe, heartleaf philodendron, shamrock, and poinsettia.

Turn the shredder off and unplug it from the wall when not in use.,
Place the shredder where your pet cannot get access to either the room or the shredder.,
Don't make the shredder more enticing by shredding food packaging.,
Keep all the cords up and out of the way of where pets go.",How to Protect Pets from Your Home Paper Shredder," The shredder should only be on when you are present. This way, all the blinking lights, fascinating noises, and any chance of it working while nobody is present are completely removed.


Never leave a shredder on an automatic setting. At home, this should never be needed.;
, Keeping the shredder out of harm's way is the most sensible option of all. However, many people like having a pet in a home office, so it might be necessary to find a way of keeping the shredder behind a cupboard door, or a barrier of some sort.


Whenever you leave the room, ensure that your pets are out of it too, and shut the door so that they can't wander back in when nobody is present.

, Always keep food packaging for the bin or the recycling, not for the shredder. Small particles of food may stay lodged in the shredding mechanism, leaving an odour, as well as attracting pests that might attract a curious pet.

, Cords can be a strangling hazard, so they're always best tidied away and out of reach.

Keep objects that increase lead poisoning away from pets.,
Provide your pets with bottled water.,
Get your pets tested.",How to Protect Pets from Lead Poisoning1," Many different objects can cause lead poisoning if the pet chews or swallows them. Become aware of what objects are dangers and try to keep these objects off the floor or low surfaces. Objects that cause lead poisoning include:Lead weights, like fishing sinker or curtain weights
Batteries
Bullets
Golf balls
Ceramic glazes on pottery or porcelain
Putty or caulk
Electronic equipment
Wine cork covers prior to 1996
Cheap jewelry
Foil made with lead
Door grease;
, If your area has contaminated water, you should give your pets bottled water until the issue is resolved. Drinking water is one of the most common ways that pets end up with lead poisoning.Keep up with your local news to hear of any problems with lead contamination in your area.

, If you suspect lead poisoning, get your pets tested. You may want to get your pets tested if your children have been diagnosed with lead poisoning because there is sometimes a correlation between children and pets being poisoned.Take your pet to the vet if you have any concerns. A negative test is better than chancing your pet’s health.

Keep your pet away from open flames.This is the biggest and most obvious thing you can do to reduce the likelihood that your pet will accidentally cause a fire.,
Remove stove knobs.If your dog smells something tasty cooling on the stovetop, it might jump up against the stove and turn the stove on accidentally.,
Use flameless candles.“Flameless candles” sounds like a contradiction.",How to Prevent Your Pets from Accidentally Starting a House Fire1," Cats often accidentally knock over candles with their tails. Large dogs might lean against stove knobs and turn up the heat. If you’re cooking on the range or using candles, make sure your pet stays away.


For instance, put up baby gates to keep dogs out.
Close the door of the room or space you’re in so your pets don’t get curious about the flame.
During Halloween, keep jack-o-lanterns outside and away from dry leaves, fake spider webs, and other material that might kindle.Otherwise, your pet might accidentally roll them over into something flammable.;
, So in addition to keeping your pets away while cooking, you should remove the stove knobs once you’re done in the kitchen. Stash the knobs in a kitchen drawer. Most knobs slip off easily, and slip back on just as easily when you’re ready to use the stove again.

, That’s because flameless candles are candles only in appearance. Instead of a wick that you have to light, flameless candles have a small switch on the bottom and an LED light on top. When you turn the device on, it emits a warm glow similar to that of a candle.


Since flameless candles don’t involve actual flames, there is no danger of your pet starting a house fire by knocking one over. Real candles, on the other hand, might accidentally be knocked over by pets.

Replace paint with a lead-free variety.,
Keep an eye on your pets when remodeling your house.,
Protect pets from bare soil areas.",How to Protect Pets from Lead Poisoning2," Paint is another common way that pets can get lead poisoning. If your house has lead-based paint, your pet can get lead poisoning through licking or eating paint. The pet may also chew on woodwork or parts of the house that contain lead from old paint.You should fix any peeling paint so your pet cannot eat it. Repaint your house if your paint is old and could possible contain lead.

, Lead poisoning is pretty rare in pets, but remodeling your house can increase the chances significantly. This is due to any old paint or lead in the walls or floors. For example, if you sand a wall with lead-based paint, then you can release toxic lead particles into the air.Plumbing and other building materials, such as caulk and putty, can also cause lead poisoning.When you remodel your house, watch your pets at all times when they are in the rooms you are remodeling to make sure they are not ingesting anything. If possible, keep them out of the parts of the house you are remodeling.
Make sure to sweep up any lead dust or wash it away with soap and water.
Pets can get lead particles of lead paint on their paws and lick it off, which could lead to poisoning.

, If you have bare areas of soil in your yard, you may consider keeping your pets away from them. Bare soil often contains lead. If you take your pet for a walk, keep them away from lots where buildings stood or where renovations have occurred.Lead can get into the soil from building projects, renovations, exterior paint deterioration, or gasoline leaks from old vehicles when lead was still in gasoline.

Look for digestive problems.,
Check for neurological symptoms.,
Notice any changes in behavior.",How to Protect Pets from Lead Poisoning3," A common symptom of lead poisoning is problems with digestion and the digestive tract. Your pet may experience a stomach ache, constipation followed by diarrhea, or vomiting. Your pet may also show a decreased appetite or an increased thirst.The pet may also have an increased need to urinate.

, When the lead poisoning gets more serious, the pet can exhibit neurological symptoms. These may include muscle spasms or tremors, lack of coordination, and even seizures. The dog may also appear weak or walk around in circles or with an unsteady gait.The pet may also experience deafness or blindness.
Your pet may also start chomping their jaws.

, Lead poisoning may also cause your pet to act differently than normal. The pet may act lethargic or depressed. The pet may start to be anxious or suddenly become aggressive.Your pet may become weak and uninterested in things they used to. They may also experience shortness of breath.

Use child and pet-safe heaters.These are heaters that turn off automatically when they are knocked over.,
Don’t leave glass pet bowls on wooden decks.Pet owners sometimes leave water bowls outside for their pet to drink from.,
Do not allow your pet to chew on electrical wires.Some pets chew almost anything.",How to Prevent Your Pets from Accidentally Starting a House Fire2," Normal heaters, by contrast, stay on even if they’ve overturned. If your pet gets rambunctious and accidentally knocks over a heater, it could easily heat your carpet or clothing to the point of combustion.

, But glass bowls can focus the sun’s rays in a prism-like effect, causing the heat to concentrate on a single point on your wooden deck. If this happens – especially on a hot summer day – your deck might burst into flames.


If you want to leave water outside for your pet, use a ceramic or stainless steel bowl instead of a glass bowl.

, While normally this habit is just irritating, if your pet starts chewing on electrical wires, the situation can quickly become dangerous. Frayed electrical wires can cause house fires, so train your pet to chew only on appropriate chew toys. Say, “No,” to your pet in a loud, stern voice if you see them chewing on wires.


Provide chew toys or other distractions for your pet so that they do not play with cables and electrical wires.
If you need help training your pet not to touch electrical wires, consult a professional pet trainer to help.
Alternately, you could apply an even coat of liquid soap to the electrical cord to keep pets from chewing it. Use a dishrag or disposable towel coated lightly with liquid soap and wrap it snugly around the cord. Move the rag from one end of the cord to the other. Do not get any soap on the prongs of the cord that connect to a device or an electrical outlet. The next time your pet chews on the cord, it will quickly stop because of the soap’s bitter taste.
Try to hide wires behind large appliances and furniture. Use wiring covers – long tubes you can use to conceal your wires and keep them out of your pet’s reach.If all electrical wires are out of reach, your pet will not be able to get into trouble with them.
Dispose of any fraying cords your pet has actually chewed through.

Keep pets near entrances when you leave home.If there’s a fire at your home while you’re away, you’ll want to ensure that your pet is found quickly.,
Use monitored smoke alarms.If you’re not home and a fire occurs, you’d never know it.,
Place crates near your home’s entrance.When a fire starts and smoke fills your home, your pet might be scared and confused.,
Use a pet alert window cling.A pet alert window cling is a small reusable sticker or hanging sign that you can place in your window to indicate to emergency responders how many pets are in your home.,
Practice a fire drill with your pets.After developing a fire drill for your home, practice the escape route with your pet frequently.,
Place your dog house at a distance from the house.If your dog has a doghouse, it might head there for safety when a fire breaks out.",How to Prevent Your Pets from Accidentally Starting a House Fire3," When you leave your pets home alone, keep them as close to the front of the house as possible.


Dogs are easily contained using baby gates.
Cats are more difficult to contain because of their jumping abilities. Place your cats as close to the front of the home as possible and close all the bedroom doors.
Additionally, keep collars and leashes on a rack near the entrance of the home in case you need to get your pets out of your home in a hurry. This will also let firefighters know that there are pets in the home, as well as give them a way to safely remove your pets in the event of a fire.

, Monitored smoke alarms automatically alert local fire departments and emergency responders that there is smoke in your home. These emergency responders then call you or go to the home directly. Using monitored smoke alarms protects your pets even when you aren’t around.

, Pets often associate their crates with safety, and retreat there when a disaster strikes. If your pets are already in their crates when emergency crews arrive, they can be more quickly and easily removed to safety.

, Most pet alert window clings have a blank space for a numeral next to the words “Dog(s),” and “Cat(s),” with another line for “Other.” Enter the appropriate information on your pet alert window cling and place it in your window or glass storm door.

, Use a simple keyword your pet can associate with the fire drill. For instance, you might say “Go, go go!” to your pet to indicate it’s time to evacuate. Then, put your pet on a leash and calmly walk them through the fire drill.


Don’t panic when practicing (or actually performing) the fire drill or your pet will be scared. A scared pet will have trouble remembering where to go during the evacuation procedure and could try to escape or run back into the house.
Practice the fire escape frequently to ensure your pet doesn’t forget it. Reward your pet with a treat after it successfully practices the fire drill with you.
Dogs are the most easily trained pets, and most likely to respond to and retain fire drill training.

, Keep your dog’s house free of dry leaves, grass, and other flammable materials. Ensure the doghouse is placed at least 20 meters (60 feet) from your home, and is not surrounded by trees, logs, or other flammable materials.

Give pets an abundant supply of fresh water during hot weather.,
Give pets access to a shaded area while outdoors.,
Take care to not overexert pets with too much exercise during hot weather.,
Let pets stay in air-conditioned areas.,
Groom pets to get rid of excess hair.",How to Prevent Your Pets from Getting Overheated1," This is important for all pets regardless of whether they are kept indoors, outdoors, or spend time both inside and outside.


Put ice cubes in your pet's dish to keep the water cold.
Make sure tethered pets can reach the water dish.
Provide several filled water dishes for pets. This guarantees a supply of water even if a dish breaks or spills.;
, This allows them to get out of the sun's direct rays. Shaded spots are always cooler.

, Keep walks and exercise periods short to prevent pets from getting overheated.


Walk pets on grass or soil when possible. Paved sidewalks and asphalt roads can burn your pet's paws.
Walk and exercise pets in the morning or after sundown. This is when the temperature is coolest.

, Run the air-conditioner for pets in very hot weather even if you're at work. Run an electric fan if you don't have air-conditioning.

,


Brush or comb cats frequently to remove hair and cool them.
Shear dogs so their hair is about 1 inch (2.54 cm) long. Leaving hair that length makes you dog cooler yet still shields its skin from the sun's rays. Remember that pets can get sunburned, too.

"

Watch for signs of heat stroke, which can be deadly.,
Move your pet to a cool location.

,
Blow a fan on your pet.

,
Lower your pet's body temperature with cool water.,Rush your pet to a veterinarian right away.",How to Prevent Your Pets from Getting Overheated2," Take immediate action if your pet displays any of the following symptoms.


Racing pulse or weak pulse
Drooling
Heavy panting
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Weakness
Seizure
Unconsciousness

,,, Don't use cold water or ice, which can actually lengthen the time it takes for your pet's body to cool off.


Position wet towels at your pet's groin, back of the neck, and the animal's equivalent of armpits.
Douse your pet's ears and feet with cool water.
Don't force the pet to drink water. But have water handy if your pet is conscious and wants to drink.

Apply a pet bug spray.,
Try a monthly repellent.,
Consider lemon eucalyptus spray.,
Consider a combination of soybean and geranium oils.,
Try citrus.,
Skip bug spray made for humans.",How to Protect Pets from Mosquitoes1," Pet stores do sell bug sprays formulated just for animals. If you are planning to be out for extended periods of time with your dog or other pet, find a spray that is appropriate for them, and apply it to their coat according to the directions on the bottle.You may notice more flea and tick formulas than ones for mosquitoes. Look more closely at the bottle, as those sprays will sometimes guard against mosquitoes.
Pick one that contains one of the following ingredients for dogs: permethrins or pyrethrins. However, if you are spraying a cat, avoid permethrins, as it's not safe for cats; pick one with pyrethrins.;
, Like the repellent you apply for fleas once a month, you can also apply mosquito repellent this way. In fact, many repellents combine protection against both. When applying these repellents, you generally put them where your pet can't get to them, such as near the skin on the back of the neck.For dogs, one to try is K9 Advantix. However, this repellent should be kept away from cats, as it's toxic to them. If your cat does eat some of it (such as licking it off the dog), take your cat to the vet immediately.
You may not be able to find this type of product for a cat that also covers mosquitoes, so stick to sprays or wipes.

, This spray is a natural remedy made from lemon eucalyptus oil, which can help prevent bites. It's at least as effective as DEET sprays, and it can be used for humans, dogs, and cats. However, be sure to get one specially formulated for your pet to make sure it's safe for them.Many commercial sprays contain the chemical DEET, which is a chemical that makes it harder for bugs to catch your scent. DEET is one of the main ingredients recommended by the government for use in bug sprays (for humans, not animals).
For instance, it's sometimes placed in a holder on the pet's collar. That way, they can't eat it, and it doesn't touch their skin.

, Similar to lemon eucalyptus spray, a combination of soybean and geranium oils can be an effective repellent. It comes in a close second to lemon eucalyptus in effectiveness and is safe for most pets. Look for a brand such as PetFresh Bite Blocker., Citrus is a natural mosquito repellent. You can boil citrus, such as lemons, in a ratio of three lemons to 2 cups of water. You only need to boil it for a minute or so, then take it off and let it sit for an hour. Strain the mixture, and spray it on your animal. You can also just cut open citrus and rub it on your animal's fur.Avoid spraying the animal in the face. You can just rub it in instead.
Don't spray or rub citrus into an open sore or cut.
This treatment is safe for both dogs and cats.

, Bug spray for humans isn't safe to use on pets, particularly since most pets lick their own coats. You don't want them ingesting bug spray, as most contain DEET. Even if they don't ingest it, it can cause problems for your animal, including seizures and skin irritation.Also, try to keep your pets away when you spray it on yourself. It can also cause harm if they lick it off of you.

Block access to cords with furniture.,
Lift cords out of your pet’s reach.,
Run cables through the walls.,
Wind up excess cord lengths.",How to Pet Proof Household Cables1," Take advantage of any sturdy object in your home that can act as a barrier between your pet and electrical cords. Tuck as many cords as you can under or behind bookcases, TV stands, cabinets, and dressers.


If you have large pets, you can simply tuck many power cables under or behind furniture. However, smaller pets, such as cats or ferrets, can squeeze into extremely small spaces, which may make it harder to apply this method.
Attach the cords to table or desk legs using wire ties. Pets are more likely to chew loose wires.
You can also run electrical cords under rugs or other floor mats.;
, Getting them off the floor and affixing them to walls and furniture surfaces with adhesive-backed cord clips covers all the bases, because pets can’t hurt themselves with something they don’t even have access to!


Use your cords to create wall art. Use u-shaped cable brackets to mount cords to the wall in loops or other fun patterns. , If you have drywall, it can be relatively easy to drill two small holes through which you can thread your cords. Use a tool such as fish tape or a cable puller to feed the cord through the wall.


Cords can also be threaded through the attic or basement.
Put detachable cords away. The power supply for a laptop or other portable device can be particularly easy to damage and expensive to replace, so put these cables away instead of leaving them out to be chewed.

, Excess cord and cable lengths can be strangulation hazards to cats and dogs, so get the extra length under control with a cord winder. Excess cables also tend to stick out, making them more attractive to pets.


Make sure you don’t stop with electrical cables. Long cords on window treatments can also become wrapped around your pet’s neck, so don’t forget to tackle those, too!

Do a barrier check of your house.,
Walk your dog when the mosquitoes aren't out.,
Add bird and bat houses to your yard.,
Turn down the light.,
Try a mosquito trap.,
Use citronella.",How to Protect Pets from Mosquitoes2," Mosquitoes can easily get into your house if there are cracks in your window frames or holes in your screens (if you open the windows). Therefore, check around your house to make sure you're not letting them inside through these areas. You can get a professional to put in new ones, or you can even just repair small holes with tape., When walking your pet, pick times when mosquitoes are less active. Generally, you want to avoid the times around sunrise and sunset, as that's when the mosquitoes are out and biting., Both birds and bats enjoy munching on mosquitoes. Therefore, inviting them into your yard can help hold down the mosquito population. Both bird and bat houses will encourage the animals to come around., As your probably know, light attracts bugs. It's no different with mosquitoes, so the more light you have around, the more mosquitoes you'll attract. Try to cut down on light around your house at night if you can, particularly outside light.One option is to use motion-detecting outdoor lights in some areas, so they're only on when you need them., Mosquito traps are designed to attract mosquitoes to them, usually using things like scent, vibration, and other lures. Once the mosquitoes are near, the machine sucks them in with a vacuum, removing them from the yard., Citronella candles and torches, as well as sandalwood products, can help reduce the mosquitoes around your house. However, they won't work in when it's windy: this method relies on repelling mosquitoes with the scent in the air, and the wind blows the scent away. You can also use citronella coils, which create smoke once you light them."

Drain any standing water.,
Be sure to treat swimming pools.,
Use a product with methoprene for low-lying areas.,
Treat ponds to prevent breeding.,
Clean out your gutters.,
Check tarps.",How to Protect Pets from Mosquitoes3," Standing water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes, so it's best to remove water from your yard if possible. Birdbaths, empty pots, and tin cans that fill with water can lead to more mosquitoes, so be vigilant about draining these areas.If you want to keep your birdbath, trying changing out the water once a week.Also, look for anything that collects water, such as empty pots or small dishes. Try to remove these from around your house. In addition, fill in any potholes in your driveway or sidewalks, as well as holes in your yard.
Kiddie swimming pools and pet bowls can also breed mosquitoes. If you have a water dish for your dog outside, make sure to change it daily.
Be sure to check around air conditioning units and faucets for standing water. Also, check flat roof spaces., If you keep swimming pools clean and flowing with the proper chemical balance, they shouldn't breed mosquitoes. Therefore, make sure to keep your pool maintained even when you're not using it. Also, make sure to check the cover doesn't collect water., If an area of your yard naturally collects water, you may not be able to drain the water. Instead, use a product that contains methoprene, as these products inhibit the growth of mosquitoes. Spray the product in the area to help keep mosquitoes from breeding.If it's your grass or garden that's not draining, try aerating it so it drains better.

, If you enjoy having a small pond on your property, you need to treat it properly to stop mosquito growth. One option is adding a waterfall or fountain to help keep the water moving, making it more difficult for mosquitoes to breed.You can also add fish that enjoy eating mosquitoes, such as koi, goldfish, and mosquito fish.
Another option is adding a biorational larvicide. While these products will kill off the mosquitoes, they won't harm the plants or fish in the area. Look for products such as Mosquito Dunks or Microbe-Lift Liquid Mosquito Control.

, You may not think about your rain gutters much. However, if you have leaves or other items clogging up your gutters, you could have standing water up there. It's best to get up there and clean them or have someone come and do it for you to help keep mosquitoes from breeding., If you have tarps or other clothes covering anything near your home, check to make sure they aren't collecting water. If they are, try to move them around so the water won't collect, as they'll breed mosquitoes, too."

Wrap cords.,
Mount wire channels along the wall to provide a protected path for cords.,
Run cords through metallic braided sleeving.,
Use a homemade solution.",How to Pet Proof Household Cables2," This is the easiest and least expensive approach. Use corrugated wire loom tubing or plastic spiral wrap, which are available from many office supply and other stores.


Some tubing and wrap may not be strong enough to protect cords from persistent pets. PVC piping is a sturdier option, but is also less flexible.

, These metal or plastic conduits are commonly used to add electrical outlets to the outer surface of solid walls, so many styles are available.


Flat wire channels are also available for running cords across bare floors.
Hide wire channels inside baseboards and crown molding. Products are available with channels pre-installed, or if you're handy you can hollow out the channels yourself., If you have small pets with tiny, sharp teeth, this sleeving, which is available in a variety of materials and colors, can protect your cords. These sleeves are often used to prevent electrical cables from causing interference with other electronic devices, so you're more likely to find it at stores that sell electrical and electronic supplies.

, For example, a garden hose can provide flexibility for snaking wires around furniture while still providing protection for your pets. Also consider making a custom charging station using a cardboard box and a few simple tools. Decorate your cables with beads. Plastic crafting beads can provide colorful and stylish protection."
"
Apply an anti-chewing spray.,
Camouflage your cables so that they blend in with their surroundings.,
Provide an alternative.",How to Pet Proof Household Cables3," Lemon juice, hot sauce, or pepper mixed in water will all deter most pets.


Observe electrical safety for yourself! Water conducts electricity, so make sure you're not touching the electrical wires or appliances while applying the spray. These substances will dissipate over time, so you'll have to reapply them periodically.

, Choose cords or cable-covering supplies that are a close color match to your floors and walls… if your cords don’t stand out, your pet will be much less likely to play with or chew on them.


You may be able to paint your electrical cords. If not, you can use colored electrical tape to match the surrounding colors.

, Pets who chew are often bored or frightened. Addressing the core problem by providing appropriate chew toys, playtime, and other activities may decrease chewing in general. Train your pet to chew a toy by associating it with food. Some toys come pre-flavored; others can be filled with food or treats.

Secure your home.,
Pet-proof rooftops, balconies, or other outdoor play areas.,
Beware of old/faulty wiring or radiator heaters.,
Provide a proper habitat or enclosure for your pet.",How to Protect Pets from Urban Dangers1," As the primary habitat of your pet, your home needs to be pet-proofed. This is especially important in urban areas, since your pet will be spending a lot more time in your home. When securing your home, consider:


Installing a security system.
Making sure windows and doors close and lock properly. You don’t want someone breaking in or your pet breaking out.
Making sure the structure is sound and healthy. Mold, mildew, lead paint, and other dangers will impact your pet just as they impact you. Such dangers are especially problematic since your pet won’t have the ability to roam freely outside.;
, One of the greatest urban dangers for pets is related to the limited safe outdoor areas for them to play in or go to the bathroom. Because of this, many pet owners turn to rooftops, balconies, and other areas that offer unique dangers not present in suburban or rural areas.


Make sure rooftop terraces are fenced appropriately so your pet won’t fall off the building.
Pay attention to the spaces in-between fence or balcony posts. Skinny or small dogs might be able to slip out and over the side of the building.
Patch any holes under fences in backyard areas. Dogs or other pets that slip out may find themselves in the middle of oncoming traffic., Older buildings with faulty wiring or antiquated heaters represent more dangers to pets in urban areas. Such problems put pets at risk since they don’t understand their dangers.


Make sure no wiring is exposed. Ultimately, you don’t want your pet chewing on or playing with wires.
Replace or pet-proof radiator heaters. Such heaters are especially dangerous because many pets are drawn their warmth and won’t understand that they can get burned.

, Whatever your pet, being in an urban area likely means that you and your pet will have to share smaller confines -- whether it be a smaller house or apartment. As a result, you need to make sure that you don't cut corners on providing large enough habitats or enclosures for your pet.


Make sure you follow ASCPA or Humane Society guidelines/recommendations for the size of enclosures.
Never let animals like rodents, birds, or reptiles roam your home. It will just take one minute for your pet to get out and become lost in the dangerous urban environment.
Avoid overcrowding in your animal enclosures. Just because you don't have enough room for enclosures for all of your pets does not mean your animals should suffer."

Avoid letting your pet roam freely outside.,
Take care around elevators.,
Mitigate the danger of hot pavement.,
Locate safe places to allow your pets to play or go to the bathroom.,
Get identification tags or microchip your pet.",How to Protect Pets from Urban Dangers2," The biggest danger to pets in urban areas involves them freely roaming without supervision of their caretakers. Such dangers come in the form of heavily trafficked streets, other animals, and malicious humans. As a result, you should never allow your pets to freely roam in an urban area.


Always keep your dog on a leash at all times. This is important, as you don’t want your dog getting distracted and running in front of a car. In addition, you don’t want your dog getting into a fight with another pet.
Don’t let your cat roam outside.
Maintain control of all animals., While you or your pet may be comfortable around elevators, that does not mean that they’re safe. Ever-present as they are in urban environments, elevators represent a huge danger to pets.


Make sure cat or dog leashes don’t get stuck in elevator doors.
Consider carrying small dogs, cats, or other pets in crates when transporting them in elevators.
If your pet is not in a crate, make sure to hold them tightly as the elevator door opens or closes., One urban danger that people don’t think about is hot pavement on the pads of dog or cat feet. While people may not feel the effect of pavement or cement that has been heated up all day in the sun, dogs, cats, and other animals sure can. Always consider this when walking your pet.


Avoid walking your pet on concrete or pavement that has been in the sun all day.
Consider dog shoes when walking on hot pavement., One of the greatest challenges of urban environments are the lack of green space for animals to enjoy. As a result, you should spend some time searching for a safe places for your pet to enjoy.


Dog parks are a popular solution for many dog owners. However, carefully consider the safety of a dog park before letting your dog play in it.
Try to locate a large park or field to bring your pet to play in., Another important thing to consider when living in an urban area is to make sure your pet has identification on them at all times. This is important, as your pet may at some point get lost. Without identification, your pet could get lost in the animal shelter system or be adopted by someone else.


Fit your pet with a tagged collar that includes your personal contact information, such as phone number, address, your name, and the name of the animal.
When getting a collar for your pet, consider a breakaway collar. These collars are designed to break off if your pet is at risk of suffocating.
Consider having your pet chipped. There are a number of companies that offer affordable microchip identification programs. A vet will insert a tiny microchip under your pet's skin, which will allow animal control authorities or other vets to access your contact information if your pet is ever lost.

"
"
Vaccinate your pet.,
Take care around other animals.,
Avoid bird droppings.,
Watch standing water in the street.,
Spay and neuter your pets.",How to Protect Pets from Urban Dangers3," Since pets, like people, are forced into closer confines in urban spaces, you need to make sure your pets are up to date on their vaccines. By properly vaccinating your pets, you’ll make sure that they’re immune or resistant to the most common transmittable diseases.


Consult your veterinarian about common vaccines.
Don’t let your vaccines lapse, especially if you take pets, like dogs, to places like dog parks.
Inform yourself about the rewards that vaccines offer., Because your pet will come into contact with other animals so frequently, you’ll need to take extra steps to make sure these are safe encounters. This is important, since relatively common interactions can lead to dangerous situations.


Know that close contact between pets can lead to transmission of dangerous diseases.
Realize that places like dog parks are relatively dangerous. Not only can your dog contact transmittable diseases there, but they may get into a fight with another dog leading to serious medical problems.
Understand that cats that roam in a large city may be susceptible to a wide variety of diseases they may not come into contact with in a rural or suburban environment. This is because of the larger and denser population of animals and people.

, Bird droppings are essentially everywhere in big cities. Unfortunately, bird droppings can carry microscopic organisms and cause an array of diseases in domesticated animals.


Don’t let pigeons roost on your balcony or windowsills.
Avoid letting cats or dogs eat, lick, or play in bird feces.
Clean rooftops where you or your pets might play.
Pigeon droppings can contain histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and psittacosis among other contagions., A great risk to the health of urban animals is the danger of contaminated standing water. No matter where you are – from Tokyo to London – urban centers have standing water that is dangerous if drunk by pets.


Standing water may harbor viral agents or bacteria like leptospirosis – a disease that can be fatal to cats and dogs.
Puddles and street gutter water may have gasoline or oil in them., You should also consider spaying and neutering your pets. Spaying and neutering offers a variety of benefits including decreased risk of certain health problems, elimination of complications due to pregnancy, and decreased aggression in male animals.


Talk to your veterinarian about the benefits of spaying or neutering your pets.
If you need assistance with the cost of spaying or neutering your pet, contact your local shelter, humane society, or municipal authority. Many organizations discounted vouchers for spaying and neutering pets."

Hide visible electrical wires.,
Make sure your windows latch securely.,
Remove any toxic plants in your home.,
Prevent your animal’s access to cabinets and trashcans.,
Prevent your animal’s access to rodent traps.,
Use Teflon-free appliances.",How to Make Your House a Better Place for Animals1," Chewing on electrical wires can be very hazardous for animals. For example, an animal could get electrocuted from chewing on an electrical wire. Electrocution can lead to several medical problems, including burns and fluid accumulation in the lungs.Given these risks, it is very important for you to identify and hide any visible wires (e.g., television cables, power cords for phones and computers) that an animal could get to.Electrocution typically happens in younger animals (less than two years old), since they are very curious about their surrounding environment.Additional clinical signs of electrical injury include difficulty breathing and coughing.Electrical injury requires veterinary care.;
, Cats and dogs can be especially prone to falling out of windows.In fact, cats fall out of windows so frequently that there is name for the occurrence: ‘High-Rise Syndrome.’Ensuring that your windows stay securely in the closed position will help prevent your dog or cat from being able to slip out of the window and potentially injure themselves.


Although it may be expensive, it may be worth investing in windows with secure latches. Visiting your local home improvement store can help you decide which type of window would work best for your budget.

, As beautiful as houseplants can be, they can also be quite toxic to animals, particularly dogs and cats. For example, Cali lilies and philodendrons are very toxic to cats and can cause drooling and vomiting, among other clinical signs.Aloe plants are toxic to dogs, and can cause such signs as vomiting, diarrhea, and tremors.The ASPCA website (https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants?field_toxicity_value[]=01) has a comprehensive list of plants that are toxic and nontoxic to dogs and cats.
If you are unsure what types of plants you have in your home, consider taking pictures of them and visiting your local gardening store for additional information.

, Our kitchen and bathroom cabinets typically contain cleaning agents and/or medications that could be very harmful to animals if ingested. For example, painkillers, vitamins, and diet pills are all toxic to animals.Childproof latches are very helpful in keeping out animals who are crafty enough to open doors or lids.


Spoiled or rotten food can contain toxins, such as the botulinum toxin, that can make animals very sick., Some rodent traps contain rodenticide, which is extremely toxic to animals. In fact, rodenticide poisoning is a very common cause of poisonings in animals.Rodenticides have anticoagulants, which can cause severe bleeding problems in animals.


Clinical signs of rodent poisoning include lethargy and weakness, and tend to get worse over time.If you have a rodent problem and choose to use rodent traps, it is advised to make the traps as inaccessible to pets as possible.Rodenticide poisoning requires immediate veterinary care.

, This is critical if you have birds. Teflon, which is a chemical commonly found in non-stick appliances, is highly toxic to birds. It causes a potentially fatal respiratory condition called ‘Teflon toxicosis.’A heated non-stick appliance, such as a skillet, emits a noxious fume that can cause a bird to become extremely weak and start gasping for air.If you are unsure if your appliances are nonstick, you may want to consider purchasing new appliances that you know are not nonstick.

Test your paint for lead.,
Be aware of harmful substances.,
Deal with mold.,
Consider the various ways your pet could get injured.,
Keep your pet away from the area.,
Clean the area thoroughly.,
Examine their coat.,
Contact your vet.,
Provide your pet with a safe space.,
Make time for your pet.,
Reward your pet.",How to Protect Pets from Home Repair Dangers," Lead is dangerous for humans and pets alike. If your home was built before 1978, you need to test the paint on the wall for lead before doing any kind of scraping or sanding. A pet may accidentally ingest some of the paint (or paint dust), which can cause lead poisoning.You may be able to remove the paint from your walls safely on your own; however, if you want to be on the safe side, you can hire a certified lead abatement contractor who will have the skills necessary to remove the paint.
A pet who is suffering from lead poisoning may lose coordination, have seizures, and/or muscle tremors. A pet can die from lead poisoning, so it is important to take a pet suspected of having lead poisoning to the vet right away.;
, The best way to keep your pet safe is to simply assume that all tools and materials related to home repairs are dangerous for your pet. Pets are often very curious creatures, so they may get into something that you didn’t even think to worry about. Thus, it is important to make sure that your pet won’t be able to get into any home repair substances you are using.For example, insulation can cause irritation to your pet's digestive tract if it is eaten. Glues, spackle, and foam insulation can cause major issues in your pet's digestive tract, and may even kill them.
Also remain aware of varnishes and paints.
Leftover materials such as sawdust and wood chips can also be harmful to your pet. They may eat or lick wood chips, which can cause harm to your pet’s stomach. They might also end up with painful splinters in their paws.

, There are several types of mold that can grow in a house, and just because you find mold in your home doesn’t mean that you or your pets have been exposed to it. That being said, if you discover mold growing in your home, you should take steps to have this mold professionally removed in order to prevent any family member (human or animal) from being exposed to potentially dangerous mold.If your dog or cat eats something with mold on it, they could suffer digestive issues, heart problems, or even neurological problems as a result.

, When doing home repairs, things often get left lying around. These objects could cause great injury to your pet. For example, a curious pet might get too close to moving part of a power tool or they might bite the electrical cord. Nails and screws left lying around could get eaten or stepped on by your pet. Thus, it is important to keep all materials secured and out of the reach of your pet.Another thing to watch out for is leaving heavy objects unsecured. For example, a heavy piece of wood left leaning up against a wall could fall and crush your pet.

, If you are doing home repairs in a specific area of your home, try to limit your pet’s access to that area while you are doing the necessary repairs. This is the best way that you can protect your pet from the dangers that home repairs pose.For example, if you are doing home repairs in a specific room, you could keep the door closed, put up a baby gate, or install a plastic curtain to keep them out.
If you have a yard that is safe for your pet, you could put them outside during the time you are doing the repairs.
If you are doing repairs that involve the entire home, you could consider keeping your pet in a kennel or having a trusted friend, neighbor, or relative keep your pet in their home while you do the necessary repairs.

, Once you have conducted the necessary repairs, you should take the time to clean the area thoroughly. Pick up and put away any tools, paints, and/or chemicals that you have used in a safe place. If you have laid plastic on the floor, pick it up at each corner so that none of the debris ends up on the floor. Once you have picked everything up, it is a good idea to vacuum and mop the floor to pick up any dust, fiber, etc. that might be left behind.


If the area has a strong smell because of the repairs, it is a good idea to let the area air out for a bit. Close off the area by closing the door and open a window. You could also place a fan in the room to help clear the air.
Don’t let your pet into an area where there is paint or some other material that needs time to dry. Wait until everything is completely dry before letting your pet near the area.

, If your pet comes in contact with paint that is not completely dry, the paint may end up in their fur. Your pet will likely lick this spot on their fur to try and get the paint off. This can make your pet very sick and it may even kill them. Therefore, it is a good idea to examine your pet's fur carefully after conducting home repairs that involve paint.Don’t forget to check the bottom of each paw. Your pet may have accidentally stepped in a drop of paint.
If you do discover paint on your pet, you’ll need to take action to remove the paint. If the paint is water based, use soap and water to thoroughly remove the paint. If it is oil based, wait for it to dry and then cut the affected fur off.
While the paint dries, use something such as an e-collar to prevent the animal from licking it. If you don’t have one, try to wash the paint out using soap and water as best you can, and then clip off whatever is left over. You could try covering the affected area with a bit of gauze and medical tape, but many animals will simply pull this off with their teeth.
You should never put any type of chemical paint remover (e.g. paint thinner, turpentine, or mineral spirits) on your pet’s skin.

, If your pet comes in contact with any home repair related materials, you should contact your veterinarian, especially if you think they may have ingested something. Many pets get injured or die because of accidents related to home repair tools and materials.


You can also contact the ASPCA animal poison control hotline. This number is 1-888-426-4435 in the United States. They may be able to help you if you believe your pet may have come in contact with something harmful.

, Change can be very stressful for pets. Even something as simple as repainting a wall can be stressful. Therefore, when you are doing home repairs, it is best to give your pet a quiet place where they can get away from the chaos. For example, you might make one room their designated space. Place everything your pet will need in that space plus a few of their favorite toys. If they have an undisturbed place to go, they are less likely to have bad reactions to the stress of home repair.If you don’t have a place where your pet can get away from everything while the repairs are going on, it may be best to let your pet stay in a kennel or with someone you trust until it is safe to return. This may also be stressful for your pet, but at least they will be safe.
If you are doing major renovations, many contractors will refuse to do work in a home where a pet is present. It is in your pet’s best interest to take them elsewhere during major renovations.
Make sure that your pet is microchipped and wearing a collar that has your contact information on it before beginning any home repairs. If your pet is frightened, they might escape. Taking these precautions will make it more likely that they are returned safely to you.

, Doing home repairs can be very time-consuming. Thus, it is important to take breaks every now and then to spend with your pet, and to help keep your pet’s routine as normal as possible. Many pets are comforted by the sound of their owner’s soft voice. When you go to your pet reassure them that everything is OK by speaking a calm voice and giving them gentle attention.For example, if you are doing a day of home repairs and you have a dog, be sure to stop working at the time you would normally take your dog out for a walk. This will help create a sense of normalcy for your dog.
If you have a cat, you can do something similar by stopping all work at the time the cat normally eats and allowing the cat to eat without having to feel nervous about the loud noises home repairs can cause.

, When you are done with your household repairs, go to your pet and comfort them. Spend time with your pet doing something they enjoy. Take them out for a walk, or go to the park and throw the frisbee. If your pet enjoys being brushed, do that. Whatever it is that will help make your pet feel happy and secure after a stressful (for them) day of home repairs.


You should not punish a pet who is upset by the noise and stress that results from home repairs. Punishing the animal will only make them even more stressed the next time you do these repairs.

Provide accommodations for older dogs or cats.,
Create a quiet space for cats.,
Place cages for your pocket pet and/or bird away from drafts.,
Maintain a comfortable cage environment for your reptile.",How to Make Your House a Better Place for Animals2," As animals get older, they can develop medical problems, such as arthritis, that can be uncomfortable and make normal activities more challenging. To assist them in their old age, provide older dogs or cats with additional bedding or padding to make their sleep area more comfortable.Carpet-covered ramps or stairs will help older dogs and cats get up or down from their usual resting spots or in and out of a car (more applicable for dogs).You can look for the ramps and stairs at your local pet store. Alternatively, you could visit your local home improvement store to find these items and design them to be more pet- friendly.
No-skid carpets and foam floor mats are helpful for older dogs who may be unsteady on their feet.Refrain from rearranging furniture if you have a blind dog or cat. Rearranging the furniture could cause them to bump into something and potentially injure themselves.Elevating food and water bowls to shoulder or elbow height is helpful for older dogs and cats with arthritis or back problems., Cats need space for peace and quiet.Try to set up an area of your home for your cat that is away from a lot of noise and distraction. This area can also serve as a safe hiding place for a cat who is easily spooked by thunderstorms or loud noises., Pockets pets and birds are very sensitive to temperature changes and extremes. Try to keep their cages away from any source of drafts (e.g., drafty windows, air vents, fans).If you have other pets, it is also preferable to keep pocket pet cages on a raised surface, such as a table. This would prevent your other pets from being able to get to your pocket pet., Reptiles are cold-blooded animals and need special cage accommodations to ensure their maximal comfort.This will likely require you to purchase additional lights and cage accessories. For example, you will need incandescent light bulbs and ‘basking’ lights to warm up the cage to the ideal temperature.Reptiles also need ultraviolet light. Light bulbs can be purchased at your local pet store that provide this type of lighting.When the outside humidity is low, especially during the winter, misting your reptile several times a week can help keep him comfortable.Specific needs vary between reptile species, so be sure to research your specific type of reptile to determine what will work best for him.

Learn the benefits of environmental enrichment.,
Provide environmental enrichment for your cat.,
Create an enriching environment for your dog.,
Enrich your pocket pet's environment.,
Enhance the environment of your bird's cage.,
Cater to your reptile's enrichment needs.",How to Make Your House a Better Place for Animals3," Environmental enrichment is very important for any animal’s welfare and well-being. Having an enriched environment keeps animals physically and mentally stimulated by providing novel and potentially challenging experiences. An enriched environment also allows animals to exhibit their natural behaviors (e.g., chasing, hunting).Environmental enrichment needs can vary from species to species, so it is important to do your research to determine what will work best for the animal you have.

, You can create an enriching environment for your cat in several ways. For example, you can provide him with a steady rotation of toys so that he does not become bored with what she plays with. Giving him toys that match his personality can keep him even more entertained.Toys that dangle are good for cats that like to chase things and use their hunting skills.Moving the toy away from his visual field will make it harder for him to chase and catch, and will make playtime more interesting for him.Scheduling regular playtime with your cat is an important component of environmental enrichment. Aim to play with your cat twice a day for about 5 to 15 minutes per session.Consider switching out his toys every few days.
Puzzle-feeders provide both mental and physical stimulation. You can place dry food inside these toys so that you cat has to put in extra effort to get to the food.Window perches are an excellent way to enrich your cat’s environment by providing him with visual stimulation.Cat videos featuring typical cat prey (rodents, birds) can also keep him busy, especially in the winter when there isn’t much to see outside.Training your cat provides great environmental enrichment by giving your cat mental and physical challenges. The main key to training a cat is making bad behavior undesirable and making good behavior extremely desirable.

, Just like cats, dogs need a variety and steady rotation of toys to prevent boredom. A good rule of thumb is to provide your dog with three toys at a time and rotate them out on a regular basis (e.g., about every five days).Dogs can benefit from watching dog videos when you are not home. Dog videos are more suitable for dogs who may become highly reactive when seeing something outside that they cannot get to.Puzzle feeders are a great way to provide your dog with environmental enrichment.Leaving the television or radio on when you are not home, or giving your dog a toy that makes noise, can stimulate his auditory sense and be enriching for him.Hiding treats around the house can help your dog use his sense of smell, which can keep him entertained and happy.Regular playtime with you is another way to provide environmental enrichment for your dog.Dogs can be trained to do many tricks or tasks, such as sitting, playing fetch, and playing dead. The process of learning the tricks and tasks will be enriching for your dog, as long as you make it a rewarding and positive experience (e.g., verbal praise, treats).

, Pocket pets tend to be very energetic animals and need enrichment to keep them busy and active. As with dogs and cats, pocket pets need toys and plenty of them. Rather than going out and spending a lot of money on toys at your local pet store, you can make your own toys out of items such as empty toilet paper and paper towel rolls.


If you would like to purchase toys at the pet store, consider purchasing nibbler and chew toys.Ramps and stairs are useful if your pocket pet’s cage is multi-level. Just make sure that the ramps and stairs are solid to prevent his feet from getting stuck.Exercise wheels are a great way for your pocket pet to exercise, but are not suitable for all pocket pets. For example, exercise wheels can seriously injure a guinea pig’s back, but are fine for a hamster or mouse.Playtime outside of the cage is important for pocket pets. Before letting your pocket pet out of his cage, make sure that your other pets are blocked from the area.Also, make sure to cover up any furniture that he could nibble on,and block his access to potential hiding places (e.g., under and between furniture).

, When outfitting your bird’s cage, make sure to include several perches of varying diameters and textures to keep his feet healthy and prevent a specific foot condition called ‘bumble foot.’ Select a perch diameter that will allow your bird to firmly grip the perch without falling off.Birds tends to like puzzle-feeder toys, as well as plush toys that they can snuggle up against.Be mindful that large birds can destroy toys quickly, so you may have to purchase toys for your bird on a regular basis.Contrary to popular belief, it is not recommended to provide birds with a mirror.Birds can be trained. For example, you can teach your budgie to step up.

, Provide environmental enrichment for your reptile. The environmental enrichment needs for reptiles are different from those of other animals typically kept as pets. For example, reptiles need perches, branches, and rock piles in their cages to give them places to climb and hide.It is also good to hide food throughout a reptile’s cage to encourage the natural tendency to forage for food.Doing your research on your specie of reptile (e.g., feeding habits, reproductive biology, natural aging process) is critical in providing the right type of environmental enrichment for him.Veiled chameleons prefer to drink water from dew-dampened leaves instead of a water bowl. For this type of reptile, you would need to set up either a misting system or a rainforest environment to allow water to accumulate on the foliage in his cage.If you are not too squeamish, feeding live crickets is good environmental enrichment for bearded dragons."

Prepare an emergency survival kit, just as you would for your family, thinking about the basics for survival such as food and water.,
Create a plan to get away.,
Develop a buddy system.,
Talk to your pet's veterinarian about emergency planning.,
Gather contact information for emergency animal treatment.",How to Prepare an Emergency Plan For Your Pets," Consider two kits. In one, put everything you and your pets will need to stay where you are. The other should be a lightweight, smaller version you can take with you if you and your pets have to get away. Plus, be sure to review your kits regularly to ensure that their contents, especially foods and medicines, are fresh. Kits should include:


Food and water. Keep at least three days of food in an airtight, waterproof container. Store at least three days of water specifically for your pets in addition to water you need for yourself and your family.
Medicines and medical records. Keep an extra supply of medicines your pet takes on a regular basis in a waterproof container.
First aid kit. Consult your vet about what is most appropriate, but most kits should include cotton bandage rolls, bandage tape, scissors, antibiotic ointment, flea and tick prevention, latex gloves, isopropyl alcohol and saline solution. Include a pet first aid reference book.
Collar with ID tag, harness or leash. Your pet should wear a collar with its rabies tag and identification at all times. Include a backup leash, collar and ID tag in your pet's emergency supply kit. In addition, place copies of your pet's registration information, adoption papers, vaccination documents and medical records in a clean plastic bag or waterproof container and also add them to your kit. You should also consider talking with your veterinarian about permanent identification such as micro-chipping, and enrolling your pet in a recovery database.
Pet carrier. If you need to evacuate in an emergency situation, take your pets and animals with you provided that it is practical to do so. In many cases, your ability to do so will be aided by having a sturdy, safe, comfortable crate or carrier ready for transporting your pet.
Sanitation. Include pet litter and litter box if appropriate, newspapers, paper towels, plastic trash bags and household chlorine bleach to provide for your pet's sanitation needs. You can use bleach as a disinfectant (dilute nine parts water to one part bleach), or in an emergency you can also use it to purify water. Use 16 drops of regular household liquid bleach per gallon of water. Do not use scented or color safe bleaches, or those with added cleaners.
A picture of you and your pet together. If you become separated from your pet during an emergency, a picture of you and your pet together will help you document ownership and allow others to assist you in identifying your pet. Include detailed information about species, breed, age, sex, color and distinguishing characteristics.
Familiar items. Put favorite toys, treats or bedding in your kit. Familiar items can help reduce stress for your pet.;
, Plan how you will assemble your pets and anticipate where you will go. If you must evacuate, take your pets with you if practical. If you go to a public shelter, keep in mind your animals may not be allowed inside. Secure appropriate lodging in advance depending on the number and type of animals in your care. Consider family or friends willing to take in you and your pets in an emergency.


Other options may include: a hotel or motel that takes pets or a boarding facility, such as a kennel or veterinary hospital that is near an evacuation facility or your family 's meeting place. Find out before an emergency happens if any of these facilities in your area might be viable options for you and your pets.

, Plan with neighbors, friends or relatives to make sure that someone is available to care for or evacuate your pets if you are unable to do so. Talk with your pet care buddy about your evacuation plans and show them where you keep your pet's emergency supply kit. Also designate specific locations, one in your immediate neighborhood and another farther away, where you will meet in an emergency.

, Discuss the types of things that you should include in your pet's emergency first aid kit. Get the names of vets or veterinary hospitals in other cities where you might need to seek temporary shelter. If your pet is microchipped, keeping your emergency contact information up to date and listed with a reliable recovery database is essential to your being reunited with your pet.

, Make a list of contact information and addresses of area animal control agencies including the Humane Society or SPCA, and emergency veterinary hospitals. Keep one copy of these phone numbers with you and one in your pet's emergency supply kit. Obtain ""Pets Inside"" stickers and place them on your doors or windows, including information on the number and types of pets in your home to alert firefighters and rescue workers. Consider putting a phone number on the sticker where you could be reached in an emergency. And, if time permits, remember to write the words ""Evacuated with Pets"" across the stickers, should you flee with your pets.

Limit your pet’s time outside.,
Place your pets in sweaters.,
Remove any salt from paws.,
Recognize your pet’s limits.,
Use caution when walking pets.",How to Keep Your Pets Safe in Winter1," During the winter, it is very important to limit the amount of time indoor pets spend outside. Most indoor pets are unprepared and not used to outdoor conditions, such as cold temperatures, wind, and snowy grounds.


When you take your dog out to use the bathroom, make sure not to spend more time outside than necessary. After your dog is finished, return inside promptly.
If your take your dog outside for walks, consider taking him on several shorter walks a day instead of one long walk to limit the amount of time outside. If possible, come up with indoor exercise alternatives, such as games of fetch, tug of war, or other forms of indoor exercise.Check your dog’s paws during cold weather. Cold temperatures can cause injury to paws, such as cracked pads or bleeding. If the dog starts limping during an outdoor walk during cold temperatures, immediately check the paws to make sure he doesn’t have ice in his paws or another problem.;
, Sweaters are cute fashion statements for pets, but during cold weather, they can be important for your pet’s safety. Short-haired dogs can be extremely sensitive the cold weather, especially during drastic cold snaps or severe wind chills. During severe cold weather, pets can be at risk for frostbite and hypothermia.When you take your dog on walks during cold weather, put a sweater or jacket on him. This is especially important for short-haired or small dogs, but even larger dogs with longer hair can be affected by the cold.
Sweaters can also help while your pet is in the house. Cats and dogs can get cold indoors as well. If your pet is shivering, consider placing a sweater on him.
Noses, ears, and paws can suffer the most damage during cold weather. Consider finding ways to cover these areas during cold snaps, or modify outdoor activities during harsh, severe conditions.

, When you take your dog for walks on treated roads or sidewalks, his paws may pick up salt remnants. This can be harmful for your pet. Salt and other chemicals can irritate your pet’s mouth and feet. If you pet licks his paws, he could ingest these chemicals, too.You can let your pet wear booties to protect his feet from elements and chemicals. Just make sure to buy booties that fit your pet’s feet well.Carefully clean paws when you return from outdoors. This helps remove the salt and chemicals.
Consider wiping down the belly and legs, too, especially if your dog is short and the belly may have come in contact with salt or chemicals., Your pet’s tolerance to cold depends on a lot of factors. If you have more than one pet, your pets may have different tolerances to cold. One may love the cold and enjoy running in the snow, while another may find it difficult and painful. Pay attention to your pets during cold weather to see their reaction. Adjust your exercise and other outdoor routines accordingly.Some conditions may limit the tolerance your pet has for cold weather. Pets with arthritis may have a lot of trouble walking in extreme cold. Conditions like diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, or diseases like Cushing’s disease may not be able to regulate their body temperature. Watch your pet closely if he has any of these conditions.
Young pets and elderly pets may have more trouble than other pets. Take great care when exposing young and elderly pets to cold weather.

, When you walk your pet, make sure to use caution. Look for slippery, icy areas on sidewalks, paths, or roads. Not only is this a hazard for you, but your pet can slip as well.Don’t let your pet run on frozen lakes, puddles, or other frozen water. Pets can easily fall through ice, which could cause death. If you try to save your pet, you could put yourself in danger as well.

Provide blankets.,
Keep your pet dry.,
Reduce the amount of food.,
Refrain from shaving your pets during the winter.,
Avoid leaving your pet in cold cars.,
Pet-proof your home.",How to Keep Your Pets Safe in Winter2," Even though your pet lives indoors, he may still get cold. Provide blankets for him to curl into on his bed, on the floor, or on furniture he is allowed to be on. You may also think about moving your pet’s bed to warmer areas in the house, away from windows, doors, or other drafty areas. Watch your pet and make sure he is comfortably warm inside your house during cold weather.Make sure your pet is not sleeping on the floor. Give him a bed made of blankets, a pet bed, or a pillow. Floors can retain cold and make your pet even colder., When your pet comes in from outdoors, dry him with a towel to remove any melting snow or precipitation. Make sure to remove snowballs or ice from the paws.If you pet is wet, it can have trouble getting warm and cause problems.

, Indoor pets expend less energy during the winter. They sleep more and usually exercise less. This means you need to reduce the amount of food you are feeding your pet.Watch your pet for weight gain. If you think your pet is gaining weight, limit his food intake every day.

, While proper grooming is still important, refrain from shaving pets down to the skin during cold months. Longer hair can help keep your pet warm.Keep your pet trimmed to reduce the amount of snow and ice that gets caught in his hair during walks. This is especially important around his feet. Trim the hair between his toes and around his feet.

, Just like in hot weather, leaving your pet in a car during cold weather can be harmful or deadly. Cars that are turned off and sitting can become cold extremely fast, which means your pet left inside will be exposed to extremely cold temperatures. Consider limiting any travel for your pet, especially if the pet will be left inside a car for a period of time.You should never leave young, old, ill, thin, or short-haired pets unattended in cold cars.

, Since you will be keeping your pet inside, make sure to protect your pet from potential dangers. Always watch your pet around space heaters to make sure he doesn’t get burned or knock it over, which is a potential fire hazard. If you have a fireplace, use a guard to keep pets from getting burned."

Bring your pet indoors.,
Provide a shelter.,
Check the paws, nose, and ears.,
Feed your pet enough food.,
Keep water unfrozen.,
Protect your pet from salt.,
Remove all antifreeze from around your pet.,
Keep your pet on a leash.,
Check under the hood of your car.",How to Keep Your Pets Safe in Winter3," If at all possible, bring your pet indoors during extreme temperatures and cold weather storms. This could be a room in your home or even a garage. Cold temperatures can be harmful even to outdoor pets.If you bring your pet into your garage, make sure there is no antifreeze spills or other chemicals on the floor. This could cause death.
If your pet is in your garage, don’t start your car in a closed garage. This could lead to carbon monoxide poisoning.

, If you pet spends most of his time outdoors and bringing him indoors is not an option, provide a shelter for him. This may be a doghouse, an outbuilding, or shed. When you provide a doghouse for your dog, it needs to be dry inside, as well as protected from wind. The dog should be able to comfortably enter, sit, and lie down inside. Ideally, it should be small enough to trap heat to help keep the dog warm.Cover the floor with shavings or straw. Make sure the floor is raised a few inches off the ground. The ground can hold cold and make your pet even colder.If possible, cover the door with burlap or plastic. Arrange the doorway away from winds.
Don’t use space heaters or heat lamps. These are fire hazards and can possibly burn your pet., Paws are particularly susceptible to cold weather damage, as are noses and ears. If your pet is kept outdoors, keep a watch on the paws, nose, and ears. Check for cracked pads or bleeding paws. Make sure no ice is accumulating on the paws., Outdoor pets need more food during the winter. They burn more energy during the winter trying to stay warm. Consider adding an extra meal each day, or increasing the amount you feed your pet each day.Don’t use metal food bowls during the winter because an animal’s tongue may stick to the metal in cold temperatures.

, Pets require constant access to water, and outdoor pets are no exception. The problem for outdoor pets during cold weather is frozen water. If the temperature outdoors is below freezing, your pet’s water may freeze. Check throughout the day to make sure the water is not frozen.Keep the water unfrozen by changing it frequently. You can also buy pet-safe heated water bowls.Do not place water in metal bowls. Your pet’s tongue may stick to the metal.

, If you have a pet who stays outside, try to protect him from salt. This may mean keeping your outdoor dog in an area where you do not treat the ground with salt or other chemicals. This can protect the dog from getting it on his paws, which can cause irritation. It also protects from your dog licking his paws or licking the ground and ingesting harmful chemicals., Antifreeze is poisonous and can kill pets. If your pet stays outside, make sure to keep antifreeze carefully put away so the dog or cat can stay out of it. If you get antifreeze on your driveway, clean it as best you can so your pet (or other neighborhood pets) will not be tempted to lick it.Antifreeze has a sweet odor, so pets may be attracted to it., You should keep your pet on a leash during cold weather, especially during storms. Snow and ice can cause scents to easily get lost, so dogs might lose their way and be unable to find their way home or back to you if they get off the leash., Cats can crawl into warm car engines during cold weather for warmth and shelter. If a cat is under your hood when you start your car, this can either injure or kill the cat. To prevent this, bang on the hood, blow your horn, or check under your hood before starting your car during cold weather."

Protect birds from cold.,
Take care of your horse.,
Keep your rabbits protected.,
Monitor for pets left outdoors in unsafe conditions.",How to Keep Your Pets Safe in Winter4," If you have a pet bird, make sure to protect her from cold weather. Move her bird cage to a warm location, away from drafts, doors, and windows., Though large, horses also need to be looked after in extreme cold temperatures. Your horse should have access to a secure shelter, like a barn or three sided structure. This shelter should protect the horse from the wind and elements.


If needed, place a blanket on your horse to keep her warm and dry.
Make sure your horse has plenty of food since staying warm burns more energy. Feed your horses more forage during colder months. Keep a check on your horse’s water supply to make sure it is not frozen.

, If you have outdoor rabbits, make sure to protect them during cold months. Most rabbits are able to withstand colder temperatures. However, if it is freezing, you need to make sure to protect them. Consider moving rabbits indoors, or into an unused garage, shed, or outdoor building during freezing temperatures. Make sure to ensure the rabbits have plenty of exercise areas if you move them.If you leave your rabbits outdoors, make sure they have ways to keep warm. This includes extra bedding. Make sure the rabbits’ home is protected from rain, snow, wind, and other adverse elements. The house should be protected from drafts.Make sure to keep your rabbits dry. The worst thing for rabbits during cold weather is to be in a wet or drafty home.

, If you see a pet in your area who is left outdoors without the proper safety measures, talk to the owner. If there is no change, document the conditions and report it to animal control or the sheriff’s office.You can politely follow up after a few days if the pet has not been provided for.
When documenting a case, note the date, time, and location. You also need to provide the type of animal. Describe the details of the unsafe care as specifically as possible. If possible, take a video or photo with a camera or cell phone. Providing as much evidence as possible will help the situation be dealt with.

There are two types of dandelions, the real kind and the false kind. Real dandelions have jagged leaves, while false dandelion leaves appear rounder and a lighter shade of green. Real dandelion flowers also do not have a bud in the middle of the flowers.;
, Sow thistle is a very common weed that will most likely be growing among your lawn. The leaves are purplish-green and have a serrated edging. The flowers are small and yellow, usually at the end of a long stalk. Be careful when touching the plant, its leaves can leave a scratch if you’re not careful.

, This is also known as wood sorrel is a type of clover that can be found growing in clusters among bare patches of lawn space. Most rabbits like to nibble on the flavorful clover, but remember not to add too much as clover can give rabbits gas that can’t be released.

, This is a very thorny weed. This is an optional backyard green that you may add to your rabbit salad. Use gardening gloves to avoid being pricked.

, The prickles are located under the leaf in a straight line on the backside of the leaves. The red spikes are also located on the stem, giving the plant a “hairy” appearance.

, This weed branches out in many directions and has yellowish-green tinted leaves. The stem is a bright red hue, you can break off a branch to check if the plant is sun spurge. If there is white plant blood oozing out, you have found the right plant.

, Use a pair of gloves if you decided to add some prickly weeds to the rabbit salad.

Determine if the bunny needs to be nursed.",How to Nurse a Baby Rabbit," The best things to feed your baby bunny are kitten milk replacer (KMR) or goat milk. You can get these items from a veterinarian’s office or from a pet store.Rabbit’s milk has a higher calorie count than other milks, so you need to add calories to the formula. Add 100% heavy whipping cream that has no added sugar.;
, When you feed the bunny, you want to make sure that you heat the formula. The formula should be warm, but not hot. It should be around the same temperature as what you would give to an infant.Avoid microwaving the formula. Instead, place the formula in the syringe. Then, put hot water into a bowl and place the syringe in the bowl until it reaches a warm temperature.

, It is very important that you don’t feed your bunny contaminated formula. One good way to avoid this is to throw away all formula after using it instead of saving what is left.If you make up formula ahead of time, check it each time to make sure it hasn’t gone bad. Look for lumps, a skin on top of it, or a change in color.

, The best way to give the bunny the formula is with a syringe. This method helps get the formula directly into the mouth. Make sure the needle has been removed from the syringe. Try a 1cc syringe when the bunny is first born. Use a 3mL syringe when the bunny grows older.You can get these from your vet, online, or from pet stores.
You can also use an eyedropper.

, When using the syringe or eyedropper, you want to hold it properly to avoid suffocating the bunny. To get the syringe in the mouth, move it side to side at first to insert it. Then move it to the front of the mouth.Make sure the syringe is pointed towards the side or bottom of the mouth, not the throat. This protects the bunny from getting choked if too much formula comes out.

, When you feed the bunny, don’t hold them so they are upside or on their backs. This is not how they would naturally nurse. It may also cause them to suffocate on the milk. Instead, keep them in an upright position.Move their head to where it’s slightly higher than their body. Make sure you have a good hold on the bunny, but don’t grip them too tight. This can make it hard for them to breathe and nurse.
Feed the bunny so they’re close to the floor. This is safer in case the bunny jumps out of your hand.

, Most bunnies will nurse slowly and take their time as they eat. This is normal. Don’t rush the bunny and try to make them eat faster than they want. Instead, set aside enough time for the bunny to nurse at their own pace.Make sure to go slow with the plunger on the syringe. Let the bunny get all the formula and swallow before pushing any more formula.

, Babies often resist being fed at first, so you’ll need to be patient. If the rabbit spits out the syringe, wet the baby’s lips with milk and gently try again. Be patient and keep repeating the process until the bunny willingly takes the milk.

If you get frustrated or the baby becomes upset, take a break and try again later.

, When you nurse a baby rabbit, make sure that you feed them the proper amount of times throughout the day. Only feeding them once or twice a day can make them too hungry, so they may overeat when they get access to food.Feed the bunny multiple times throughout the day. When they are first born, feed them small meals every couple of hours while you are awake. Once they are into their second week, reduce that to around every three to four hours while you are awake. By the time they are at their fourth week, you may be able to spread out the feedings again.
Check with a vet or a rabbit expert to make sure that you feed the bunny at the correct frequency and in the correct amount for the rabbit's age.
You may need to feed the bunnies less. It sometimes depends on the bunny or the breed. As long as the babies are gaining weight steadily, you are probably fine.

, When you feed the bunny, don’t feed them more than they want. You may think they need to keep eating, but the bunny will let you know when they are full. Watch the cues from the bunny. If they stop eagerly trying to get the formula, it’s time to stop.Watch the bunny’s tummy. Once it starts to get slightly rounded in shape, you can stop. They’ve had enough for now.
If they start crying, it is time to feed them again.

, Each time you feed your bunny, you want to make sure you are feeding them the right amount. While watching the cues of the bunny is the best way, you can also have a general idea of the amount of formula needed each day, spread out over your feedings.Each week, you should increase how much you feed the bunnies. Newborns should get around four to five cc of formula. In week two, you should feed them around 10 to 15 cc. In week three, shoot for 15 to 30 cc, and after that, give 30 cc.

, To avoid spreading bacteria to baby bunnies or yourself, make sure to wash your hands before and after feeding the bunnies. Use disinfectant soap and wash with hot water.After washing your hands, consider rubbing your hands on fresh hay to make them be more appealing to the baby bunny.

, If the bunny is a newborn, they need help to urinate and defecate. This should be done after you nurse them. Take a damp cloth or cotton ball and stroke it over the bunny’s genital area. The bunny should start urinating and defecating. Continue to stroke the bunny until the bunny is finished.You should only have to do this until their eyes open, so for around two weeks.

, When the baby opens their eyes, you can start adding in pellets and hay to their food options. Place the hay and pellets in the corner of their box or nest so the baby bunny can get them if they want them. Don’t give the bunny any fruit and vegetables just yet.Use plain pellets that don’t have any additives, like seeds or banana chips. The pellets should high in fiber.
For hay, try timothy, orchard, or alfalfa hay.

, If your baby bunnies have access to their mother, chances are they are being nursed. You may not see her nurse them, however. This is because rabbits will only nurse their babies a few times each day. Healthy babies will have pink skin, be warm, and appear active.Check for neglect by seeing if the babies are cold, if they are crying throughout the day, if they are a bluish color, if their skin looks unhealthy and shriveled, and if they are not gaining weight or have a sunken stomach.
Try not to disturb wild nests of baby bunnies, even if you don’t see the mother. Mother rabbits don’t stay with their babies in the wild to protect the nest.
If you have an orphaned bunny or a neglected, unhealthy bunny, you may need to nurse them.

, Sorry, treats are not allowed.Treats are for boys and girls, not cats and dogs. Chocolate, especially, is a candy that can poison your pet, and many other treats are too high in sugar or could pose a choking hazard, such as marshmallows. Xylitol and gum, ingredients of some candies, are dangerous for pets.It is best to avoid giving any Halloween treats to pets. After all, they don't know it's a special occasion and are simply happily living the day as any other, by being around you.


Be sure to keep all treats out of reach from pets. Put them up high, behind cupboard doors, etc.
Explain to children how important it is that Fido or Kitty cannot come across their treats stash and start nibbling. Ask children not to give treats to pets and to put their treats where pets cannot find them.

, Pumpkin and corn decorations are nontoxic, but if eaten, may give your pet a mild stomachache.


Read How to stop your dog from eating your plants for some tips on plant safety with canine pets.

, Many pets find the whole costume dressing upsetting and strange. It's an anthropomorphic desire to put pets in costumes and doesn't make the pet happy. Unless you've trained the animal from an early age to wear clothing, it's best not done. Try it on the day before, to see what reaction you get––if the pet behaves in an annoyed or frustrated way, the costume is not suitable.


If using a costume, ensure that it cannot harm the animal in any way. Dangling pieces can cause a pet to trip, hang or choke; fabrics can be too hot, constricting or itchy; costumes can cause injuries you haven't foreseen just by dint of restricting the animal's movements.

, If your pets usually roam around the front yard or entrance areas, keep them in the backyard or inside the house for the evening. That way, you will avoid scaring the pets or having excited or scared pets rushing at trick-and-treaters and frightening the children. This also prevents any potential for bites from your pets.


In this case, ensure that your pet cannot get to the front door when the trick-and-treaters call. A quiet room somewhere at the back of your house is a good choice for the night.If your backyard is not secure, do not leave your pet there. Some pranksters take pets on Halloween night if access is easy. It is also a good idea to keep cats indoors before, during and after Halloween, especially black cats, to prevent pranksters from taking them., If you've chosen to keep your people-loving pet at the front door, do not stop paying attention to it. If the pet seems unhappy, scared or bothered, remove it to somewhere safe. Realize that this is risky, owing to the fact that people will look unusual in their costumes, and many trick-and-treaters are liable to be loud, shouting and overly excited. This could send a pet into a frenzy of worry or excitement.


Leash the dog near the door, so that it cannot get past you in the doorway.

, Most treats are unhealthy for pets, as discussed above.

, Wires and cords must be a far distance from pets. They should also be taped down or put out of reach to prevent tripping from trick-or-treaters so this safety precaution serves both people and pets.

, For example, while carved pumpkins are festive, if you choose to add a candle be careful that pets cannot knock it over and hurt themselves or start a fire.


Scented candles are toxic for indoor birds.Rubber items can present choking hazards, fake cobwebs/strung lights can entangle animals and wildlife and glowsticks and fake blood can be poisonous to pets that try to lick or chew these substances., If your dog hates crowds, people it doesn't know or flashing lights, loud noises and general hubbub, do not take your dog trick-or-treating. Anything could cause such a dog to react in fear and either take flight and run away or possibly bite someone.


Taking your dog should only be done, if at all, in quiet, small neighborhood trick-and-treating exercises. In busy, noisy and crowded streets, this is not acceptable.

, Do not take your dog trick-or-tricking without this. You must be able to restrain your dog quickly and effectively.

, If you're going onto people's properties, consider having someone hold the dog at the gate for you, or ask the owners ahead if it's okay to bring your dog into the yard. Since this is an onerous thing to do, it may be easiest leaving Fido at home.


You could tag team with a friend; one holds the dog, the other collects the treats. Or, ask an older sibling or a parent to come along and hold the dog for you.

, The dog's senses will soon get overloaded and will need a break from all the excitement.

Make carrot cookies.,
Try bunny biscuits.,
Make rabbit or guinea pig treats.,
Try bunny cookies.",How to Make Rabbit Treats1," Carrot cookies are a fairly easy recipe that many rabbits enjoy. To make carrot cookies, you will need dry oatmeal, wheat flour, ground carrots, and water.


Add half a cup of oatmeal, half a cup of flour, half a cup of ground carrot, and half a cup of water in a bowl. Then, mix until smooth.
Roll the dough into small balls, about the size of quarter, and place them on a greased or no-stick cooking sheet. Bake at 350 °F (177 °C) for 15 minutes.
Carrot cookies should cool for about an hour before you feed them to your rabbit. You should refrigerate any extra cookies.;
, Bunny biscuits are another fairly simple rabbit treat to bake. For bunny biscuits, you will need one pureed carrot, half a mashed banana, a teaspoon of honey, 1/4 cup of rabbit pellets, and 1/4 cup of oatmeal.


Using a coffee grinder or blender, grind the rabbit pellets and oatmeal into a fine powder.
Add all the ingredients to a bowl and mix. Then, knead the dough with your hands for about one to two minutes.
Roll the dough into 1/4 inch layers between plastic wrap. Then, use cookie cutters to cut them into cookies or simply cut the dough into squares. Choose somewhat smaller cookie cutters, as bigger cookies might be too much for a rabbit.
Bake at 325 °F (163 °C) for 30 minutes. Then turn off the heat and allow the cookies to sit in the warm oven for about an hour. Refrigerate extras., Rabbit or guinea pig treats are great for your rabbit. They can also be fed to guinea pigs. To make rabbit or guinea pig treats, you will need a cup of oatmeal, a cup of rabbit pellets, 2/3 cup of vegetable broth, 6 tablespoons of olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of honey.


Mix all ingredients in a bowl. Then, roll them out and cut into shapes.
Bake at 350 °F (177 °C) for 20 minutes. Turn off the oven and then let the treats cool in the oven for an hour before giving them to your rabbit., Bunny cookies are another great baking recipe for your rabbit. You will need 1 cup crushed rabbit pellets, 1 cup flour, 3/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup molasses, 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup Cheerios, and one mashed banana.


Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Put the rabbit pellets through a food processor until they're ground into a fine pulp. Then sift the rabbit pellets and flour together.
Add the rest of the ingredients to the pellets and flour. Mix well.
Roll into balls and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes."

Feed your pets indoors.,
Leave pet drinking water inside.,
Keep your pets indoors when cane toads are most active.,
Remove hiding spots.,
Supervise your dog's outdoor time when the cane toads are around.,
Build a barrier.",How to Keep Pets Safe from Cane Toads," Cane toads are attracted to the food source. Cat and dog food is especially attractive to them. Keep an area inside the house for feeding. If cane toads do eat pet food, just eating it does not poison it but the pet that tries to defend its food is at risk of being sprayed by the cane toad.;
, Again, don't leave a bath as an invitation.

, Cane toads tend to be most active at night and after rain.

, Bushy plants can become hiding spaces for cane toads. Some landscaping features can also provide them with shelter. Either remove these attractants or check them regularly and remove any cane toads found in them.

, Leaving a dog alone with cane toads is often asking for trouble. In particular, be very cautious with puppies and playful dogs.

, It is possible to keep cane toads out of your backyard but it is expensive and requires some effort. A 50 centimeter (19.7 in) high fine mesh barrier that extends at least 15 centimeter (5.9 in) under the ground would be a good start. It will need to completely cover the perimeter of the area you want fenced off, including any gate entrances. Remove any cane toads in the yard. DO NOT KILL THE TOAD. Pick it up with proper protection avoiding direct skin contact.

Try a cheerio mix.,
Make honey balls.,
Create a fruit snack.,
Experiment.",How to Make Rabbit Treats2," Cheerio mix is a fun, simple mix that rabbits and other small animals will enjoy. You will need a handful of cheerios, a handful of sunflower seeds, some rabbit pellets, and a handful of dry oats. Mix the ingredients together and serve to your rabbit.These are best given as an occasional treat. The sugar in cheerios could cause health problems if given regularly.

, Honey balls are a fun, sweet treat your rabbit will enjoy. You will need 1/4 cup of crushed Weetabix, 1/4 cup of oats, honey, 1/3 cup of crushed rabbit pellets, and a carrot cut in tiny pieces.


Mix everything but the honey together. Then, add honey a little at a time until the ingredients just stick together. Roll into small balls, about the size of a quarter, and serve to your rabbit.Even with natural sweeteners such as honey, be aware rabbits rarely eat sugar in the wild, and eating it regularly in treats can cause dental problems and diabetes in rabbits. Give treats as just that - a treat!

, A fruit snack is a nice, healthy treat your rabbit will enjoy. You'll need a cabbage leaf, five blueberries, four baby carrots, two cherries, and three grapes.


Put the cabbage leaf at the bottom of a bowl. Slice the baby carrots very thin. Chop up the cherries, removing the pits. Slice up the grapes and then add the blueberries. Serve to your rabbit., You can make fruit and veggie salads for your rabbit by experimenting with different combinations of foods. See what foods your rabbit does and does not like and create foods to cater to his tastes.

"
"
Wash fruit and veggies first.,
Never add table sugar.,
Do not overfeed your rabbit.",How to Make Rabbit Treats3," If you buy any fruits and vegetables for your rabbit, make sure to rinse them under clean, running water before using them in recipes. You do not want your rabbit to ingest any pesticides or other potential harmful substances., Adding table sugar to rabbit treats can cause obesity and dental problems. If you want to sweeten your rabbit's treats, use fruit or natural sugars like those found in honey, but use sparingly and only every once in a while. Recipes that require you to dip treats in sweetened yogurt should be avoided. While your rabbit may enjoy the sweet foods, he could easily get sick from added sugar., Treats are not a replacement for healthy rabbit pellets. Never overfeed your rabbit. Give him only one or two treats at a time and store the rest for later use."

Fill the water bottle with warm water.,
Use a heat lamp.,
Insulate the bottle.,
Purchase a heated water bottle.,
Move your rabbit's hutch or cage into a shed or garage.,
Use a black plastic water dish.,
Check water twice daily.",How to Keep Rabbit Bottles from Freezing1," Do not use scalding hot water. This will cause it to take it longer for the water to freeze. However, you will probably still need to change the water several times during the course of the day.


When doing this touch the stream of water with your hand. If you find it uncomfortably warm, use cooler water.;
, If you have a heat lamp in the cage, place the water near the lamp to keep it warm. Similarly, you can create a homemade lightbulb heater.


For a homemade heater, take a cinder block. Screw an aluminum bracket into the cinder block to hang the light bulb on. Drill a hole in the cinder block that you can thread the wire through—be sure that the wire is near the outside of the cage so that the rabbit will not be able to reach it. Place an aluminum plate on the bottom of the cinder block so that the bedding does not get too warm. Then place a stone on top of the cinder block and place the water near the warm cinder block.Usually it will be easier to simply purchase a commercially produced heat lamp.

, You can purchase water bottle covers that will keep your rabbits’ water warm for longer. Just be sure to check that the cover fits your water bottle. Alternatively, it is also easy to make a homemade device that will insulate the water bottle.


For example, wrap thick woolen socks around the bottle. Tie them around the outside or use rubber bands to secure them in place., These are available for purchase online and are the easiest way to provide warm water to your rabbit year round. Some customers, however, find them to be a bit expensive and complain that they don’t survive for very long.Make sure that you have an electrical outlet to plug the heated water bottle into.
Be careful that the rabbits cannot get to the cord and chew it.

, This will help keep your rabbits warmer and prevent the bottles from freezing. Rabbits do appreciate the cold weather, but you should still protect them from moisture and wind during the winter., A little bit of frozen water in the spout of a bottle can make it impossible for your rabbit to drink. It will also be more obvious if a dish freezes over. The best way to slow the freezing process is to increase surface area by using a wide dish. A black plastic dish is also preferable to a metal dish.


Put a couple of ping pong balls in the dish to keep the water from freezing as quickly. With ping pong balls in the dish, any wind will create waves that prevent ice from forming.Water bowls are a more natural source of water for rabbits than bottles. Unfortunately, in a rabbit cage they can quickly became dirty. If you have the space, try to keep the bowl away from litter and bedding.Black is the best color for a water dish during summer. Black absorbs light and thus is more likely to remain warm.

, Even with these measures, the water is likely to freeze over. To be sure that your rabbit has constant access to water, it is preferable that you continue to check the water at least twice a day. Ideally, you should have two water bottles, so that you can easily switch them out, without worrying about thawing it first."

Talk with your veterinarian.,
Decide between a pellet and a mix.,
Select a complete, high-quality commercial rabbit food.,
Mix the new food in with the old food.,
Increase the percentage of new food to old food slowly.,
Look at your rabbit’s feces.,
Observe your rabbit’s eating behavior.,
Monitor your rabbit’s overall behavior.,
Take your rabbit to your veterinarian.",How to Switch a Rabbit’s Food Brand," If you are thinking about switching your rabbit's food brand, or if you have specific concerns about your rabbit's current food, talk with your veterinarian first. He or she can provide you with helpful recommendations on which food brands would provide your rabbit with the best nutrition.Bring in the bags of food, or just the food bag labels, to have the discussion with your veterinarian.This will give him or her a better idea of the food's nutritional value.
Your veterinarian can also examine your rabbit to determine if he has specific health needs that would be best addressed with a different food.;
, Commercial dry rabbit food comes in two types: pellets and mixes. Although both types contain similar ingredients, the consistency is different. Mixes have the ingredients separated out (e.g., cereal, flakes of peas), and pellets have all ingredients combined into each pellet.Although mixes are more colorful and look more interesting, rabbits often pick out their favorite ingredients and leave the rest. This selective eating can lead to nutritional deficiencies.Pellets don’t look very interesting, but will probably give your rabbit more nutrition than a mix. Rabbits are more concerned with the flavor of the food, rather than how it looks.Just like switching food brands, switching your rabbit from a mix to a pellet (or vice versa) will need to be a gradual transition. It would be best to switch from a mix to a pellet, since pellets are more nutritionally complete.

, When you visit your local pet store, you will probably see a wide array of commercial rabbit foods from which to choose. It might feel overwhelming to decide which one to purchase. Knowing what to look for on the ingredient label will help you make your selection more easily.


A ‘complete’ food is one that would meet all of your rabbit’s nutritional needs (e.g., protein, vitamins, minerals, fat). Some foods may be labeled as ‘complimentary,’ which means they are not nutritionally complete.High-quality foods contain the recommended amount of several key nutrients. For example, look for foods that contain at least 18% fiber (for better digestibility) and 12 to 16% protein (12 to 14% for adult rabbits, and 16% for young rabbits).
High-quality foods will also be low in fat (about 2 to 5%).Grass-based foods tend to be more nutritional balanced than wheat-based foods. Look for a high-quality food that has grass (e.g., timothy, ‘forage’) listed above cereals (e.g., wheats, corn) on the ingredient label.Do not be swayed by food brands that have words such as ‘premium,’ ‘gourmet,’ or ‘contains all natural ingredients’ on the bag.These words are more for marketing. Focus on the ingredient label.

, Not only is your rabbit’s digestive system sensitive to change, but your rabbit himself may be sensitive to change, too. Rabbits are very routine-oriented, and changes to the routine can cause a rabbit to feel stressed and anxious—more so if they are especially nervous and sensitive.Mix the new food in the old food over about 7 to 14 days to help your rabbit adjust to the new food.If you have already discarded the old food, feed the new food in small quantities (less than his usual daily intake). Make sure he has plenty of hay to ensure he is still getting enough nutrients.Feed the new food/old mixture as you would normally feed your rabbit—once in in the morning and once in the evening.Divide the total of amount of food in half.

, The slower the transition, the better. Begin with 10% new food and 90% old food. Each day for 7 to 14 days, increase the percentage of new food until your rabbit is eating 100% new food.How much you increase the percentage each day is up to you. Just make sure the increase is gradual.
As you increase the percentage of new food, make sure not to change the total amount of dry food your rabbit is eating.Feed the same amount of food you normally would.

, Since your rabbit’s digestive system is so sensitive, a rapid switch to a new food brand could cause your rabbit’s feces to become soft or runny. If you notice a change in his feces, scale back on how quickly you are increasing the percentage of new food.You may need to go back to a lower percentage of new food, wait until his feces become normal again, then slowly increase the percentage again.

, Do not be surprised if your rabbit does not eat the new food right away. He may like his old food just fine and not be too keen on eating something new. If you notice him eating only the old food, keep the same percentage of new food to old food until he starts eating the new food.You may have to keep the same percentage of new food to old food for a few days before he starts eating the new food.Your rabbit may be so resistant to the new food that he will urinate on it!If he does this, throw out the food, clean his bowl, and give him the same percentage of new food to old food.
You will need to have patience and persistence as your rabbit adjusts to the new food brand.

, Change is stressful for rabbits. Your rabbit may show different signs of stress about eating the new food, including growling or squeaking, lying his ears back tightly against his head, and tensing his body with his tail up.Lessening his stress may be as simple as slowing down the rate of switching to the new food brand.
If your rabbit still seems stressed, you may need to talk to your veterinarian about how to relieve the stress.

, If your rabbit is not responding well to the switch in food brands, despite your best efforts to make a smooth transition, take him to your veterinarian for further examination. Your veterinarian could recommend another food brand that would work better for your rabbit.If your rabbit's digestive is particularly sensitive to food changes, your veterinarian may also need to prescribe medicines to correct the soft and runny feces.

Do a yard sweep before letting your pets back outside.",How to Look After Pets During Fireworks," Contact your local municipality to find out when your area is likely to have fireworks. Mark the dates on a calendar so that you can keep track of when to ensure your pets are cared for. If you know or suspect that the fireworks will be heard at your house, take the precautions outlined in the following steps.


Check that your pets' ID tags and microchips are in date; mark the calendar when renewal payments are due and be sure to make the payments. If your pet does go running off during fireworks events, it's much easier to be able to identify its ownership with these features.
Fireworks upset pets as a result of the noise, smell of sulfur, and flashing lights.;
, Desensitization of noises helps to prevent a phobia of loud noises. Use a CD like Sounds Scary, well before the firework season, or after the event.

, The house becomes your pet's safety zone, so it's important to prepare it properly.


Keep some lights on. Keeping a light on will calm your pet and make him feel more secure, rather than being scared in a dark room.
Dampen the noise. Close the curtains in the room and, if your animal is a caged one, cover up the cage in a thick blanket, but make sure it is breathable so your animal doesn't suffocate. This will also help to stop the flashes of light affecting your pet.
Plan to use familiar sounds to drown out the noise of the fireworks. Music from a stereo or turning on the TV are likely familiar sounds that can sooth your pet. Just make sure not to play these sounds ridiculously loud as they can become bothersome themselves.

Classical music calms pets. Play the music loud enough to hear over the fireworks, but not to loud to bother the pet.



, Select a suitable room where you will contain the pets for the duration of the fireworks. An inner room that is least impacted by the noise is ideal. It should be a room that you can close off to prevent your pet from running about the house and injuring itself, wrecking furniture, etc. If you have more than one pet, be sure they don't mind being confined in the same room, or select several rooms for different pets. For example, dogs and cats will usually appreciate being kept separate.


Make the room cozy. Put down familiar, clean bedding somewhere pleasant such as under a table, on or behind a chair, etc. Add some familiar chew toys, scratch pads, balls, etc., to keep your pets amused and distracted.
Ensure that the room temperature is pleasant; warm if it's cold weather, or cool if it's hot weather.
Consider whether sound might be soothing. If your pet is used to music, turn some on at normal volume. Also, the sound of rainwater is very soothing to pets.

Use lavender. This is optional, but you might like to use lavender scented items to help calm your pet. Use a spray or gently bruise the leaves and flowers of some fresh plants. Just make sure that it's out of reach of your pet. Using heated scent oils or incense is not recommended as a frantic pet can knock them over and start a fire or injure themselves.
Add a litter tray for cats.
Remove any sharp items from the room in case your pet starts jumping or running around.

, In the desire to ease our pet's pain, sometimes we can transfer some of our anxiety and upset to the pet. If you've prepared properly in advance, there is no need to feel upset and worried as you can be reassured about the safety of your pet.


Realize that the startled and frantic reactions of your pet are often the principal source of your own upset. Being ready for their reactions can help to keep you calm as well.

, Half an hour to an hour before the fireworks are due to be set off, place your pet into the chosen room. If you're concerned about not being able to locate your pet (for example, cats aren't always easy to find), consider finding your pet several hours earlier. Mealtime is a good time to round up every pet, provided it falls before the fireworks are set off. If your dog needs a walk, be sure to walk her before confining her.


Even if your pet is caged, place it into the secure and comfortable room you've selected.
If your pet is a horse or other farm animal, make sure it has clean bedding and is inside the stable or barn.

, Be sure to leave sufficient water and food for your pet in the confinement space. Many pets will be uneasy, or even frantic. If your pet has access to water, it will help calm him, and food supplied in your pet's regular portion will make him feel like it's a normal day.

, Comfort her and talk to her. Be friendly Stay happy and upbeat, this will make your dog feel less anxious. It is false that comforting your fearful animal can reinforce that fear, just like comforting a child fearful of spiders will not make the child more afraid of spiders. If it's not possible to stay with her, (perhaps because you're out or busy (you may be at the firework display), don't worry - the previous steps should ensure that your pet has been adequately cared for.


Allow your pet to hide somewhere in the room if wished. It's your pet's way of coping (a ""bolthole"") and dragging them out of a safe spot can increase their anxiety levels. Don't fuss over her too much.

, Reassure him and remove the protection (blankets, etc.) as long as you're sure that the loud fireworks are over. Let him have free run of the house to see how he behaves before considering letting him return outside (it might be best to wait until morning, if possible). Check for signs of stress in your pet.


For cats, signs of stress include running away, soiling the house, hiding away and refusing to eat.
For dogs, signs of stress include barking a lot, running away, soiling the house, hiding and cowering, clinging to owners, whimpering, trembling and shaking, pacing and panting, and refusing to eat.
If your pet is stressed, keep him indoors overnight. Keep a litter tray somewhere in the house, or walk a dog after the fireworks but don't let him off his harness and be sure to stay with him the whole time.

, Collect any sparklers, firecrackers, etc., as well as party items and broken objects. This will prevent your pet from being injured by unfamiliar objects.

Match your schedule to the needs of your pet by monitoring when your animal is most likely to need to go outside.;
, Leave your door open, just a little. This will make it possible for your pet to get back in, in case you forget about him. You may get some bugs inside, if your pet needs to make use of this, but that will help you to remember in the future.


Screen doors and bug traps that won't harm your pet are available online to control and insect problems you might have.

Worry about wind and moisture.,
Keep your rabbit in an unheated indoor area.,
Cover the cage with plastic.",How to Keep Rabbit Bottles from Freezing2," Rabbits can easily remain comfortable and healthy in freezing temperatures. However, if they get water in their fur, this can seriously compromise their ability to stay warm. You don’t need to bring them inside during the winter, but you should give them some protection from the elements.


Bedding is a major factor here, because rabbits will hide in the bedding to stay warm. Keep plenty of wood shavings and straw in the cage., A basic shed or barn will work. The location does not need to be warm. It should, however, shelter the rabbit from wind and moisture. http://riseandshinerabbitry.com/2012/02/20/winter-care-for-rabbits/</ref>

, Take a sheet of heavy plastic and wrap it around all sides of the cage. Staple it to the wooden pieces of the cage. Leave some small gaps on the top and the bottom of the plastic, however. The rabbits will need fresh air in the cage to stay comfortable."

If you can't remember yourself and you can't get someone else to remember for you, get a machine to do it. This alarm, provided that you set it correctly, will remind you to let your pet back inside. This works better for dogs, as they tend to stay outside for shorter periods of time.


Set the timer on your stove.
Get a stopwatch with a timer, and keep it in your pocket.
If you get absorbed in the internet or a computer game, set a notification on your primary device.

, In the case that you don't have someone that can help you, stay with your pet. Your pet is your responsibility. If you cannot find another way to make sure your pet does not get locked out, you will need to stay with him.


On very cold days, or extremely hot days, this is especially important.
During times when it is unbearable for you to be outside, it will likely also be unbearable for your pet.
To lock your pet out in these conditions can cause harm or even death from exposure to the elements.

, Teaching a dog to bark or cat to meow when he wants to come in can be time consuming, but it will empower your pet, and it can help you remember to let him in. Many pets will naturally make noise when they want to come in. Some will not. In this case, it may be worth it to train them to let you know.


Be careful not to bother your neighbors.
Don't let your pet cry or bark for an hour at the door.
Install a baby monitor outside, so you can hear your pet better.

, If you're always forgetting, try asking someone you live with for help. Roommates or family members can help remind you to let your pet back in. They might even let your pet back in for you, if you ask nicely.


Offer to trade chores.
Do something nice for them for helping you.
Explain that it is for the good of the dog.

Install a Pet Door.,
Build a dog/cat house.,
Install a door knob that your pet can open.",How to Keep Your Pet from Being Locked Out3," This is the best way to enable your pet to get inside if you lock him out. It empowers your pet to go in and out on his own. Pet doors are not an option for some pet owners, but for those who can install a pet door, this may be the ideal solution. Not only will it make sure your pet won't get locked out, it keeps your pet from getting locked in. Cats can be trained to use pets doors, just like dogs.If your dog is on a leash, make sure it is long enough for the dog to get inside.
If your pet door has a lock, make sure to unlock it every time you let him out, or leave it unlocked altogether.
Think about your energy bill before installing this option.

, If you're worried about your pet getting locked out and nothing seems to be working, build an outside place for him to be. If he gets locked out, he will have somewhere to go. A dog house or a cat enclosure can provide a safe, dry shelter for your pet if he gets stranded outside.



Try constructing a simple doghouse.
Make an insulated or heated doghouse

Build a special enclosure for cats.
Don't use this as a permanent home for your pet, but as shelter for their comfort., Some door handles are easier for pets to open. It is possible to train your pet to open these doors. Look for handles that are levers, and spend time training your pet to use it. When your pet can open the door by himself, he is less likely to get locked out.

Store extra food in sealed containers.Coffee cans, Tupperware, and resealable zipper storage bags are some examples of containers that will help keep ants out.,
Create a moat barrier.,
Purchase ant-proof pet food dishes.,
Keep the area around food dishes clean.,
Use peppermint oil.",How to Keep Ants Out of Pet Food1," You may find that an additional container inside of another will be an even more effective barrier. Food stored in a resealable zipper storage bag and placed inside an airtight container provides a strong barrier against ants., Set clean food dishes in a pan of water, not too deep (such as a cake pan). The pan of water will act as a moat and keep the ants out.Another solution is to use two stainless pet food dishes, one slightly larger than the other—use industrial strength glue to attach a small piece of brick or very flat stone to the underside of the smaller dish, wait for the glue to dry, and put water in the larger dish. Place the smaller dish with attached brick or stone into the larger dish of water. The water serves as a moat, keeping ants out of the food, and the brick or stone helps keep the food dish from tipping over while raising it well above the water level.Set the dish with moat in a different area for two days or more. The ants will eventually stop returning to the normal feeding place.

, Several pet food dishes are available for purchase that are purported to protect against ant infiltration. Some of these dishes are meant for indoors, and some have even been developed for outdoor use. Choose the dish that will work best for your pet, whether an indoor or outdoor pet, a dog, cat, or other pet.


Some standalone moats are also available into which you can place your existing food dish, thereby protecting the food from ants.

, Keep pet food dishes on a removable surface—such as a placemat—and remove to clean after meals. Ants follow a pheromone trail given off as they walk to direct them back to food sources. Cleaning the surface on which the food dish sits—and the dish itself—with soap and water disrupts the pheromone trail, thus discouraging ants from returning., Mix a ratio of one tablespoon of 100% peppermint oil to one cup of water and mix in a spray bottle. Spray near the HVAC return vents in your home to deter pests. Their sense of smell will be disrupted, which is what deters them after the use of peppermint oil.Another effective way of using peppermint oil to deter ants from pet food is to use drops of the oil on a cotton ball to wipe onto baseboards and other surfaces near where ants may enter the home. You might also wipe the oil onto the surface around the area where pet food is stored or around the food dish."

Freeze infested food.,
Take the dry food out of the freezer.,
Re-store pet food.",How to Keep Ants Out of Pet Food2," If ants are already in a food dish, cover the dish tightly and place in the freezer. Leave the food in the freezer until the it is frozen and the ants are dead.This will allow you to remove the ants from the food while salvaging it for feeding to your pet.

, By now the ants should be dead. Pour the dry food into a strainer, over a sink, and shake back and forth vigorously until no more dead ants come out. This will keep from wasting the pet food, as you can now re-serve it., After pet food is free of ants, pour the food into an airtight container to protect against further infestation.Using techniques listed in method one, try to prevent infestation from recurring. You may have to repeat some steps to completely remove ants, so keep trying if you don't succeed the first time.

Use flypaper.",How to Keep Ants Out of Pet Food3," Tape that inside your window for a pattern. Then, use your finger to draw a Vaseline barrier on the outside of the window. Place the feeder in the center. This method is best used in a cool, shady area. In warm weather the Vaseline will start to run/ drip.

, For a hanging feeder, cut a hole in the center of a lid to a tub of margarine or other small, lightweight object and string the hanging cord of the feeder through the hole. Make a knot in the cord, if necessary, to hold the lid in place. Smear petroleum jelly on the lid or other object. The ants may get to the lid, but they will not make it to the feeder, and other ants will not make the attempt., Wrap a band of ribbon flypaper on the feeder pole, or place on window or custom mounts. Flypaper has glue on both sides, so ants will not cross the paper. Keep the fly paper away from the feeder so that birds do not make contact. If flypaper comes off in high heat, hold it up with small pieces of duct tape that have no smooth surface exposed for ants to crawl on."

Select food types based on season.,
Place grass and hay in rabbit friendly areas.,
Offer vegetables in moderation.,
Try commercial rabbit pellets.",How to Feed Wild Rabbits1," The eating habits of wild rabbits vary based on season. Choose different types of food for fall/winter months than you would for the spring/summer.


From early spring to the beginning of fall, wild rabbits feed primarily on grass, clover, wildflowers, weeds, and the kinds of crops that grow in gardens. Making a rabbit friendly area of your yard or garden where you grow these types of plants might be a good idea during these months. You can also leave a box or trough out containing grass, clover, etc., in an area where you've seen wild rabbits congregating.In late fall until spring, a rabbit's diet shifts. They eat buds, twigs, bark, needles, and any fresh plants they can find. You should leave such foliage out over the winter if you want to feed wild rabbits during this month.;
, Rabbits love grass and hay. Providing these snacks in a rabbit friendly area will draw wild rabbits to your yard.


You can try letting the grass grow tall in a certain portion of your yard. You can sprinkle bits of hay or leave barrels of hay in this area as well.If you're an avid gardener, you could leave a certain area of your garden exposed without fencing or other barriers. In this area, you can plant tall grass, clovers, weeds, and the kinds of wildflowers rabbits love and also leaves troughs of hay out. This will attract wild rabbits to your garden to eat., Wild rabbits enjoy vegetables such as fresh carrots, lettuce, and spinach. However, you should not overfeed wild rabbits fresh veggies as they're not digesting these kinds of plants.


Do not introduce fresh veggies all of a sudden. Mix in a small amount of leafy greens or carrots in with hay or grass. If you see young rabbits in your garden, it might be a good idea to avoid vegetables as rabbits under the age of 6 months should not ingest them.Always wash any vegetables you leave out for wild rabbits. If you buy vegetables from a supermarket, they're likely sprayed with pesticides before being packaged and sold. You want to make sure any chemicals that may be harmful to wild rabbits are washed off before feeding them fruits and veggies., Commercial rabbit pellets, the kind you would buy for a domestic rabbit, can be an excellent addition to a wild rabbit's diet.


Make sure you select pellets with seeds. This type of pellet is optimal for the health of wild rabbits.Feed pellets at a minimum and mix them in with things like hay, grass, and veggies. Pellets are a concentrated food source and wild rabbits may not be used to digesting them. As they do not rely solely on pellets for sustenance, as do domestic rabbits, they do not need to be fed pellets in as great amounts."

Establish a specified safe room or area.,
Stock supplies for your pets.,
Make sure your pets can be identified if you’re separated.,
Know where to find your pets when a storm approaches.,
Run tornado drills with your entire household.",How to Keep Pets Safe During a Tornado1," Even with improvements in detection technology, people rarely get more than a few minutes’ warning of an impending tornado. It is essential that you have a plan in place, and the first step is defining where your safe zone is located. A purpose-build tornado shelter is ideal, but a section of the basement or a windowless interior room on the ground floor will also work.A small, enclosed room is good because it may reduce the amount of falling or flying debris, but make sure all members of the household and their emergency supplies can fit within the space.
Indoors is normally better than outdoors, but mobile homes and trailers are not built to withstand tornadoes. Identify a place of shelter nearby that you can use.;
, You probably won’t have time to scramble around and gather supplies, so make sure your safe zone is stocked at all times. In addition to human supplies, make a storm shelter kit for your pets as well. It is a good idea to have a crate ready to go in the safe zone, so — for a dog, for instance — consider filling it with supplies like:


a dog first-aid kit; disposable bowls; a familiar blanket; a harness, leash, and muzzle; plastic poop bags; any medication your dog takes; immunization records; food, water, and treats for several days or (if possible) up to two weeks.For a cat, include a supply of litter and a scoop, and a small litter box if possible.Regularly check expiration dates on stockpiled food and medications.

, Amidst the confusion and destruction that can follow a tornado, pets often hide, run away, or get lost due to fear or disorientation. The easier it is for someone else to identify your pet, the more likely it is that you’ll be reunited.A secure, sturdy, clearly labeled identification collar (that is worn at all times) is an essential first step.
However, remember that an embedded microchip cannot fall off during a tornado. Strongly consider having a chip with identifying information implanted in your pets.
Also carry photos of your pets on your person and in your phone.

, If a tornado is headed your way, you simply won’t have the time to search far and wide for your pets. Scared animals tend to have favorite hiding spots, so take note of any places where your pets tend to go during a typical thunderstorm. That way you can quickly locate them and get them to safety.Bring your pets inside (if they’re not there already) anytime a thunderstorm approaches. If there is a severe thunderstorm warning or a tornado watch posted for your area, strongly consider heading for your safe zone. If there is a tornado warning, go there immediately.
In U.S. meteorological nomenclature, “watch” means the conditions are ripe for the event, while “warning” means that type of weather has been spotted in the area. Learn the terminology for weather warnings where you live.

, Training and practice beforehand can save lives when a tornado strikes. At least once or twice a year, and especially before the main tornado season where you live, run full tornado drills for your household. Make sure every person and pet is accounted for and knows where to go and what to do.If your pets have been trained to recognize and obey commands, teach a command like “shelter” or “storm.” Dogs can probably be trained to head for the safe zone on command; cats may be able to be prodded to enter a carrier to take to the safe zone.

Make sure the rabbit is truly orphaned.,
Contact a rescue.,
Choose a formula.,
Figure out how much to feed your rabbits.",How to Feed Wild Rabbits2," Oftentimes, people discover a rabbit nest or a group of baby rabbits and mistakenly assume they are orphaned. As most baby rabbits taken in from the wild do not survive, it is important you not bring in baby rabbits unless you're certain they've been abandoned.Baby rabbits often appear alone as their mothers sometimes leave the nest at day and return at night. If you stumble upon a litter of baby rabbits huddling together, chances are they are not orphaned and their mother will return in the evening. You should leave the rabbits alone.In general, you should only assume litters are orphaned if you know the mom is dead. Your dog or cat may have disturbed the nest or killed the mother. You may also have found the mother dead nearby. In cases like this, you can assume the babies are orphaned and intervene.If you find a baby under 10 days old far away from the nest, chances are he was somehow separated from his mother. He may have ran away if frightened from something or a crow may have carried him and dropped him. Chances are, he is injured in some way and will probably not survive. You should take him to a vet or humane society as this is his best chance for survival., As soon as you find orphaned babies, immediately contact an animal rescue. Baby rabbits need care from experienced rescue workers to increase the chance of survival. Only 10% of orphaned rabbits survive their first week. Unless you have extensive experience in rescue and rehabilitation and supplies on hand, you should not attempt to rehabilitate baby rabbits on your own., If you cannot get baby rabbits to a rescue for a few days, you should begin feeding them on your own. This will increase the likelihood they will survive.


Feed the baby a combination of KMR kitten formula, which can be found in many pet stores, and goat's milk. Make sure it is regular goat's milk and not low fat. You should add a pinch of a probiotic known as acidophilus to the formula.Feed healthy babies about twice a day. Use a syringe and feed the bunnies upright, with the tip of the syringe pointing downward.Do not surprised if the rabbit only takes a few drops of formula at first. It may take him awhile to get used to the syringe., The amount of formula a baby rabbit needs depends on his age.


If the rabbits are only 1 to 2 weeks old, they'll need 5 to 7 cc/ml each feeding and should be fed twice daily.At 2 to 3 weeks, they'll need 7 to 13 cc/ml each feeding and should still be fed once a day.At 3 to 6 weeks, they should be fed 13 to 15 cc/ml twice a day. They can also be introduced to solid foods like oats and hay at this age."
"
Put up barriers for flowers and vegetables.,
Try to restore a rabbit nest if a dog or cat destroys it.,
Take rabbits to the vet or humane society if they are injured.",How to Feed Wild Rabbits3," If you have wild rabbits in your yard that you want to feed, you need to make sure they understand where they can and cannot eat. Designate a rabbit friendly area of your garden, where you keep food they will like, and use some form of a barrier for other areas.


A good fence is the best option to form a barrier for your garden. Two foot high chicken wire is generally good enough to keep rabbits at bay. Make sure the bottom of the fence is staked securely to the ground so rabbits will not try to push underneath it.Scare devices, like a scare crow, scare tape, or a balloon may frighten rabbits and keep them out of areas of the garden where they're not welcome. Pinwheels sold primarily to repel moles may work on rabbits as well.Avoid the use of commercial pesticides, especially if you leave rabbit food out near your garden. Wind can blow traces of pesticide into nearby areas and, if ingested, the rabbits could get sick leaving them susceptible to predators., If you're feeding wild rabbits in your yard, they might end up building nests for litters nearby. A cat or a dog could easily disturb and destroy a nest. If this happens, try your best to restore it.


Return the grass, straw, and hay the rabbit used for the next to its original location. If the hole has been destroyed as well, dig a shallow hole, about 3 feet deep, and put the materials in there.If you find any of the mother's fur, put that back in the nest. This will help the mother find her babies if the nest has been moved or tampered with., Oftentimes, rabbits may become injured near your property. One of your pets may attack a wild rabbit or they could become injured by another predator. Try to secure the rabbit in a cage or crate. Wild animal traps can be purchased at some pet stores and online. Take the rabbit to a vet or rescue where it can get proper care and be re-released into the wild."
"
Secure your pets in carriers.,
Provide further protection from debris.,
Try to remain — or at least appear — calm.,
Don’t leave your pets behind if at all possible.,
Keep an eye out for post-storm dangers.",How to Keep Pets Safe During a Tornado2," As soon as a tornado warning is announced or you spot a potential twister, spring into action immediately. Command or coax your cat into its designated carrier, or, if necessary, use a towel or pillowcase to scoop it up and place it down into the carrier (with its opening facing up). Lead or command your dog into its carrier in the storm shelter or other safe zone.Place some familiar comforts, like toys or blankets, in each carrier.
A sturdy pet carrier or crate provides your pet with added protection and keeps them from running away or hiding in fear.

, No matter how sturdy your storm shelter happens to be, your should cover yourself and your pets with padding to reduce the risk of injury due to falling or flying debris. Place heavy blankets over the pet carriers, or even use an old mattress kept in the safe zone to huddle beneath.When you run your regular tornado drills, include this element as well. It will likely be disorienting and perhaps even frightening for your pets.

, No matter how often you train for it, experiencing a real tornado is a terrifying experience for all involved. As this loud, powerful storm barrels through, do your best to present an even keel for the sake of all the humans and pets in the storm shelter. Trust in your planning and preparation to see you through, as the outcome is by this point largely out of your hands — the storm is now in control.

, After the storm passes, you may have no choice but to temporarily evacuate due to damage or contamination. Bring your pets with you, in their carriers and with their supplies, unless you absolutely cannot do so. Don’t assume you’ll be able to get right back to them within a few hours or a day to care for them at whatever is left of your home.Of course, only you can decide how much personal risk you are willing to take before, during, or after a storm to protect your pets. Proper planning will help reduce these risks regardless.

, When you emerge from your safe zone, it may be difficult to recognize your home and the surrounding area. Tornadoes can cause catastrophic damage that leaves both humans and pets stunned and disoriented. Such disorientation will cause additional fear and anxiety in your pets, which may in turn lead to unusual or reckless behavior.Keep your pets in their carriers or leashed in the aftermath of the storm; they may get frightened and try to run away or hide.
Watch for broken glass; protruding nails or sharp debris; unstable walls, floors, or entire structures; gas leaks; and downed power lines. Take note that puddles or pools of water may be contaminated.

Make the storm shelter a happier space.,
Address storm phobias in your pets.,
Try desensitizing techniques.,
Consider medications in consultation with your veterinarian.",How to Keep Pets Safe During a Tornado3," Every person and pet in the safe zone will be on edge during a tornado, no matter how many drills you have run. Adding small, familiar comforts can ease at least a bit of this anxiety for your pets. Make sure to include some toys, treats, blankets, and similar comfort items in your shelter.Keep your pet occupied with play, training, or other everyday activities as much as is possible. Try not to express your own anxiety or be overly comforting toward your pet; act as though sheltering through an actual tornado is just as normal and safe as one of your drills.
Although, if your anxiety does get the best of you, your pet might assume the role of comforter and be the source of calm in the storm. They can be very sensitive to the needs of their human companions.

, Fears of loud noises, and especially storms, are common in pets like cats and dogs, and in some cases can be considered a phobia due to frequency and severity. There are ways to recognize and address such phobias in pets, and treatments are typically most effective when started early in life.Watch for signs of excessive storm fears in younger pets, and take note especially if a pet loses body control, becomes destructive, or risks injury to itself or others.
Consider utilizing the services of a licensed veterinary behaviorist for severe phobias.

, If your pet has mild to moderate storm fears, you may be able to use training to desensitize them to the commotion caused by severe weather. Try playing an audio clip of storm sounds at a very low volume, and immediately offer a treat and praise if your pet does not respond negatively.If the pet responds negatively, don’t use punishment; simply try again another time.
Each day following a positive result, increase the volume and duration of the storm sounds a bit. Continue to offer immediate treats and praise for successes.
When an actual storm blows through, similarly offer treats and praise for a calm response. But never punish a poor response.

, When dealing with severe noise or storm-related phobias, your vet may recommend one or a combination of medications. Some medications will provide long-lasting benefits during the entirety of the storm season, while others are meant to be used right before a triggering event occurs.Clomicalm or Reconcile, to name some common examples, may be prescribed for use throughout the storm season.
Fast-acting medications like Valium and Xanax, alternatively, might be prescribed for use during individual events.
Make sure you understand the dosing and administration instructions given by the vet, and follow them to the letter.

Determine which kind of pellet you should purchase your rabbit.,
Store the pellets in a clean, closed container.,
Consider putting vitamins in your rabbits' pellets.,
Determine how much you should feed your rabbit.,
Give your rabbit his pellets in a clean container.,
Give your rabbit plenty of water.",How to Feed Your Rabbit with Pellets," In general, buy alfalfa hay pellets for rabbits younger than seven months, and timothy hay pellets for adults.;
, This way, the pellets will be protected from dirt, sunlight, dark, water and other animals. Try to keep the lid closed; this will lower the chance of bacteria.

, Always consult a veterinarian before doing this!

, A quick rule of thumb is half a cup for every six lbs., but it depends on your rabbit's activity level as well.


Be very careful not to overfeed your rabbit. Obesity in rabbits can cause a shorter life-span. They will be tired because they can't move enough.

, A ceramic bowl works well. Clean the bowl daily, and give the rabbit his pellets every morning.

, Put a water container in the rabbit's cage and ensure that your rabbit receives fresh water daily; clean the container daily.

Select at least three types of vegetables per feeding, including one high in vitamin A.,
Avoid overfeeding your bunny certain vegetables.,
Use carrots and fruits as treats.,
Wash all vegetables before giving them to your rabbit.,
Give your rabbit a daily serving of vegetables based on her body weight.,
Introduce greens one at a time.,
Create a balanced salad for your bunny.,
Maintain your bunny’s diet with hay and pellets.",How to Feed Your Rabbit the Right Greens," Each type of vegetable will give your bunny different nutrients, ensure she eats a variety of veggies, and will allow her to practice different chewing motions. Your bunny’s teeth are constantly growing, so helping her work her teeth will help with grinding. Good vegetables for your bunny include:Collard greens (high in vitamin A)
Beet greens (the tops, high in vitamin A)
Lettuce: Romaine, Red or Green leaf (no iceberg or light colored leaf)
Spinach
Parsley
Basil
Mint
Bok Choy
Dandelion leaves
Mustard greens
Pea pods (just the pods)
Brussels sprouts
Swiss chard
Broccoli (the leaves and stems)
Cilantro
Dill
The green part of carrots
Celery leaves
Watercress;
, Some vegetables can be harmful if your bunny eats too much over a short period of time, or if she develops a build up of certain nutrients in her body. Vegetables like kale, parsley, mustard greens and spinach should be fed sparingly to your bunny as they are high in oxalates and goitrogens.Vegetables such as eggplants, potatoes, and tomato plant leaves are toxic to rabbits and should not be feed to them under any circumstances., The image of a bunny munching on a pile of carrots is in fact an unhealthy one, as carrots are high in sugar and oxalate, the later can encourage bladder stone formation. Carrots should only be used as treats for your bunny.Give your bunny a ½ inch of carrot to chew no more than once every other day to prevent a build up of sugar in her diet. Bunnies also enjoy sugar and are prone to eating sugary foods over healthy ones.Fruits are also high in natural sugar and sugary fruits like bananas and grapes should only be given to your bunny as occasional treats. Limit your bunny’s fruit consumption to one to two tablespoons per 5 lbs of bunny weight and go for high fiber fruits like apples, blueberries, oranges (no peel), papaya, and pineapple., This will clean the vegetables and remove any pesticides or harmful chemicals on the surface of the vegetables.If possible, choose organic produce to avoid exposing your bunny to harmful pesticides.

, The standard formula is a minimum of one cup of vegetables a day for each 4 lbs. of body weight. Most bunnies weigh around 5-8 lbs.Determine the weight of your bunny and then use the formula to determine the amount of veggies you should be feeding your bunny.

, This will allow you to check for any sensitivities in your rabbit, and avoid shocking her system. Begin with only a small amount of a green, and watch for any intestinal issues in your bunny, such as diarrhea or soft stools.Rabbits also have individual likes and dislikes when it comes to taste so if your bunny isn’t interested in a certain vegetable, make note of it and replace it with a vegetable she might prefer.

, Start by building a balanced salad for each feeding, with a base of green leaf, romaine, or butter lettuce, and two other herbs or greens, one of which contains vitamin A.For example, you may try a salad of romaine lettuce, spinach, and mint. See how your bunny reacts to this salad, and if she responds well, continue to feed her a variation of this salad, switching out the spinach with beet greens or collard greens. After several feedings, replace the base with another lettuce and a different vitamin A rich vegetable.

, Fresh hay is the most important element of your bunny’s diet, as it is high in fiber and good for your bunny’s digestive system. Your rabbit’s diet should consist of mostly fresh hay, vegetables, fresh pellets, and fresh water. Give adult rabbits timothy, grass, and oat hays, and give younger rabbits alfalfa hay. Avoid giving adult rabbits alfalfa, as it is too high in protein, calcium, and sugar.If your rabbit is new to veggies, try cutting them into small pieces and mixing them in with her hay or pellets. Your bunny may not notice them among her hay and will likely end up enjoying them.

Ensure your veggies are fresh.,
Choose organic when possible.Organic vegetables are grown without pesticides and harmful chemicals that can hurt your bunny.,
Keep the calcium content to a minimum.A high-calcium diet can cause bladder stones, urinary tract issues, kidney stones, and other digestive problems in bunnies.Greens that are high in calcium like kale, mustard greens, and collard greens should be fed sparingly to your rabbit.,
Look out for greens with high levels of oxalic acid.Oxalic acid can be consumed by rabbits in small amounts, but in high levels it can be toxic.,
Avoid iceberg lettuce.,
Know your rabbit’s likes and dislikes.,
Wait until your rabbit is old enough to eat greens.,
Feed your rabbit grass hay.,
Decide what volume of greens your rabbit should eat.,
Wash your veggies.Vegetables often ship with pesticides coated on them.,
Introduce fresh greens slowly.Don’t introduce a variety of new greens to your rabbit’s diet all at once.,
Serve your rabbit’s greens wet.,
Feed half the greens in the morning and the other half in the evening.,
Look for potential problems.,
Check your rabbit’s urine after feeding a new green.,
Try to feed a variety of greens.Like people, rabbits will tire quickly of eating the same thing all the time.,
Remove uneaten veggies.At the end of the day, remove any greens your rabbit did not eat.",How to Feed Greens to Your Rabbit," Spoiled veggies are bad for rabbits. In fact, rabbit stomachs are even more sensitive than human stomachs to rotting food. Check the texture and smell of your greens before feeding them to your hopping friend. If they feel excessively soft or spongy, or smell spoiled, do not feed them to your rabbit.Red leaf lettuce, romaine lettuce, raspberry leaves, cilantro, dill leaves, bok choy, watercress, and wheatgrass are just some of the fresh greens your rabbit might enjoy.;
, Buy organic greens when shopping to keep your rabbit healthy.

If your pet seems exhausted, loses its appetite, assumes a crouched stance when urinating, urinates only in small trickles, or seems to be in pain while urinating, contact your vet. These are signs your pet might have consumed excess calcium.
Broccoli, while not technically a green, is also relatively high in calcium and should also be fed in minimal amounts.

, Avoid giving your rabbit plants that are high in oxalic acid like parsley, mustard greens, and spinach.


Try feeding your rabbit a green with high oxalic content like parsley for one week, then leave it out of the diet the next week.

, This variety of lettuce contains a laudanum-like compound that can hurt your rabbit when consumed in excess. Choose dark, leafy lettuce types like red leaf and romaine to ensure your rabbit stays healthy., Each rabbit has a personality and its own unique preferences. While dandelion greens, for instance, might not bother one rabbit, they could cause another to have gas. Some rabbits like kale, while others do not. Always shape your rabbit’s diet in accord with what you know it likes., Because young rabbits have sensitive and developing gastrointestinal tracts, they cannot eat fresh veggies for some time after being born. Wait until your rabbit is about two months old before introducing greens into its diet., Before introducing greens or any other fresh food to your rabbit, it should eat some grass hay (as opposed to alfalfa hay) for at least two weeks.With at least two weeks of grass hay in its system, your rabbit’s gut will more easily process and absorb the new greens.

, Rabbits should eat one cup of greens per every two pounds of its body weight each day.For instance, if your rabbit weighs ten pounds, it should eat five cups of greens per day.

, Even when you’re buying organic, your veggies might have been in contact with something yucky. Rinse your veggies in cool water over a colander before serving them to your rabbit.


Do not use soap or other cleaning products to wash your greens.

, Instead, add one new type of green every two to three days. This way, if your rabbit has trouble digesting one or another of the greens, you’ll be able to easily identify which caused the problem.

, After rinsing them off, there’s no need to wait for your greens to dry before feeding them to your rabbit. The extra moisture will help hydrate your bunny., This is the best way to feed your rabbit. You could choose to feed all the greens at once and allow your rabbit to nibble on them throughout the day, but adding the greens to the rabbit hutch in two batches will keep the second batch fresh.

, Observe your rabbit and take note of anything out of the ordinary that could be a sign of health problems. For instance, if excessive or soft stool accompanies your rabbit’s consumption of a certain green, remove it from the diet and replace it with an alternative.If a certain green is disagreeable to your rabbit, soft stools will develop within 24 hours of feeding your rabbit the new green.

, Many greens (swiss chard, for instance) dye your rabbit’s urine red due to natural pigments in the plant. This is not harmful to the rabbit and should not be cause for concern. However, if you see sludgy or bloody urine, contact a vet immediately., A mixture of greens will also ensure your rabbit gets a good balance of nutrients and vitamins. Ideally, each meal should have two or three different types of fresh greens.

, This will keep your cage clean and prevent bugs from gathering to consume the rotting produce.

Provide your rabbit with hay.,
Include pellets in your rabbit’s diet, in moderation.,
Feed your rabbit fresh vegetables.,
Give your rabbit fresh, clean water.,
Learn what not to feed your rabbit.,
Feed your rabbit unlimited grass hay.,
Limit the amount of pellets in your rabbit’s diet.,
Feed your rabbit an adequate amount of fresh vegetables.,
Include fresh fruits in your rabbit’s diet as occasional treats.,
Provide your rabbit with water in a sturdy bowl.",How to Feed a House Rabbit," Hay is the most important part of your rabbit’s diet.It has many benefits. For example, hay has fiber, which helps move waste through your rabbit’s intestines and prevent intestinal stasis (‘gut stasis’).Hay also gives your rabbit something to chew on, which helps him keep his teeth filed down.In addition, hay can keep your rabbit entertained, since he can sift through it and move it around his enclosure.Grass hay (e.g., timothy, oat) is higher in fiber than alfalfa or clover hays, and is thus the ideal type of hay to feed your rabbit.Alfalfa and clover hays are high in protein and calcium, which can lead to kidney and bladder problems in older rabbits.Good quality hay is green and fragrant, and is free of mold and dust.Consider buying your hay from your local feed store. Compared with the hay at a pet store, hay at a feed store will likely be fresher and contain more of the nutrients your rabbit needs.;
, Pellets should only make up a small amount of your rabbit's diet. They are high calorie and low fibre which leads to obesity and overgrown teeth. Give extruded pellets only (each kibble looks the same) rather than muesli type diets (as these encourage selective eating of the tastier, low calcium components). Each day, give no more pellet that your rabbit can eat in 20 minutes, If your rabbit is addicted to pellets and won't eat hay, then make a gradual change over by cutting back on the pellets and making sure they have access to sweet, green hay.


Pellets should be approximately 18% to 20% crude fiber, 14% to 16% protein, and 1% each of fat and calcium.The pellets you feed your rabbit should be timothy-based, rather than alfalfa-based.Avoid pellets sold through feed stores or markets that are not in sealed packaging. Exposure to the air degrades the vitamins and makes for reduced nutrition. Ideally, buy the smallest sealed bag of food possible since a large bag once opened will start to degrade.

, Fresh vegetables keep your rabbit’s intestines well hydrated,which helps with overall digestion. There are many vegetables that you can feed your rabbit, including celery, collard greens, green peppers, and radish tops.Vegetables with high levels of vitamin A, such as broccoli, carrots, and mustard greens, are especially important to feed your rabbit.There is often a concern that feeding vegetables gives rabbits diarrhea. This would mainly occur if you introduce multiple vegetables types to your rabbit’s diet simultaneously, rather than one at a time.
Starchy vegetables, such as carrots, should be fed in moderation.Fresh fruits are also good additions to your rabbit’s diet, but should be fed only as treats,due to their high sugar content.

, A constant supply of fresh, clean water is essential to keeping your rabbit’s intestines well hydrated. Without enough water, intestinal contents can become very dry and get stuck. This can lead to gut stasis, which could be life threatening if not treated immediately.Be aware that your rabbit may continue to look well-hydrated on the outside, even when his intestines are not.If your rabbit has not passed feces in 12 to 24 hours, his intestines are likely dehydrated — call your veterinarian immediately., There are several foods that you should never feed your rabbit, including chocolate, pasta, and yogurt.Seeds, cookies, and crackers, and high-fiber cereals are also off-limits to your rabbit.These foods can cause a dangerous buildup of ""bad"" bacteria in your rabbit’s gut, leading to a serious condition called enterotoxemia.They can also cause fatty liver disease and contribute to obesity.Avoid feeding corn to your rabbit. Because rabbits cannot digest corn hulls, feeding your rabbit corn could lead to life-threatening intestinal blockage., With hay being such an important component of your rabbit’s diet, it makes sense that he should have plenty of it on a daily basis. Rabbits of all ages, from baby to adult, should be fed an unlimited amount of grass hay each day.Young rabbits that have been weaned from their mothers and are able to eat on their own should begin eating hay as soon as possible.Although alfalfa hay can cause bladder and kidney issues in adult rabbits, it is appropriate for young rabbits under one year of age. Be aware, however, that if you start your young rabbit on alfalfa hay, it may be difficult to transition him to grass hay when he gets older.Consider placing the hay at one end of your rabbit’s litter box. Your rabbit will likely enjoy being able to sit in a comfortable box and munch on hay at the same time. In addition, putting the hay in the litter box can help keep his cage clean., With pellets, your rabbit can have too much of a good thing. Limit your rabbit’s daily pellet intake to 1/8 to 1/4 cup per five pounds of body weight.Divide the total daily allotment in half: feed one-half in the morning and the other half in the evening.A high amount of pellets in your rabbit’s diet can lead to obesity.Because pellets don’t contain much fiber, a diet that is high in pellets would cause your rabbit’s feces to become very mushy and get stuck in the hair around your rabbit’s anus (known as ""poopy butt syndrome"").Your rabbit may begin to prefer the pellets to the hay, which could lead to nutritional imbalances and digestive issues.Baby rabbits can have an unlimited quantity of pellets—the high protein and calcium content will help their growth. If you have a baby rabbit, begin to decrease his pellet intake gradually at eight to 12 months of age until he is down to the recommended adult amount., Your rabbit should eat two to four cups of fresh vegetables per five pounds of body weight.The vegetables must be fresh — spoiled vegetables, and even those that are slightly less than fresh, can upset your rabbit’s sensitive digestive system.Serve the vegetables wet — the moistness will provide much-needed hydration to your rabbit’s intestines.Divide the total amount of daily vegetables in half. Feed one-half in the morning and the other half in the evening.Feed your rabbit three types of vegetables per day, with at least one vegetable being high in vitamin A.The website rabbit.org/what-to-feed-your-rabbit/ has a list of vegetables that are high in vitamin A.
Introduce new vegetables to your rabbit’s diet one at a time to prevent digestive upset. Remove any vegetables from his diet that cause soft stool or diarrhea.If you have a baby rabbit, feed him vegetables in very small quantities.Consult with your veterinarian if you are unsure what amount of vegetables to feed your baby rabbit.
Rinse carrot tops and radish tops thoroughly before feeding them to your rabbit., Rabbits have a sweet tooth,and would probably love to eat a lot of fruit. However, because of the high sugar content, fruits should be fed only as treats. Per day, your rabbit should receive no more than one to two tablespoons of fruit per five pounds of body weight.Examples of fruit you can feed your rabbit include mangoes, bananas, papayas, and cherries.Rinse the fruit thoroughly before feeding it to your rabbit.

, A heavy ceramic bowl is ideal for supplying water to your rabbit.Porcelain bowls are also suitable, as long as they are lead-free.Change out your rabbit’s water at least once a day. You should also clean the water bowl with soap and hot water on daily basis.Rabbits can also drink water from a sipper bottle. However, rabbits tend to prefer water bowls over sipper bottles. If your rabbit likes the sipper bottle, regularly check it to ensure the end is not leaky or blocked."

Choose a spot in your yard to place the food.,
Provide the wild rabbits with grass and hay.,
Place pelleted rabbit food out for the wild rabbits.,
Give the wild rabbits fresh vegetables.,
Provide the wild rabbits with small amounts of fruit.",How to Feed a Wild Rabbit1," If you do not mind wild rabbits visiting your yard, you can create an area of your yard where the wild rabbits can eat. Since wild rabbits tend to like wooded or shrubby areas on the edges of a particular area,consider creating a small brush pile near the edge of your yard or garden for the wild rabbits.


In the summer, when rabbits like to eat grasses and weeds, leave an area of your lawn partially uncut—this allows grass and/or weeds to grow up,and can also provide a sheltered area for the wild rabbits to eat.
If the wild rabbits feel safe in your yard, do not be surprised if they eat grass all day.During the colder months, when rabbits eat more barks and twigs, you can make a small pile of these items in a corner of your yard.Be aware that placing food in these spots could attract other wild animals to your yard.;
, Whether wild or domesticated, grass and hay are staples of a rabbit’s diet.The wild rabbits in your yard will have an abundance of grass to chew on, but will probably not have ready access to hay. The recommended types of hay for wild rabbits are oat, and timothy. Alfalfa hay should only be given to older rabbits. Avoid giving adult rabbits alfalfa, as it is too high in protein, calcium, and sugar.Visit your local pet store or feed store to purchase the hay.
Do not spray pesticides in your yard in which you are feeding wild rabbits. The pesticides could make the wild rabbits very sick., Pellets are a great nutritional source for rabbits. Pellets with seeds are ideal for wild rabbits.Keep in mind that pellets tend to be very nutrient dense—you do not need to feed them in large quantities.Look for pellets at your local pet store. If you can approximate the sizes of the wild rabbits, you could ask the staff at the pet store about an adequate amount of pellets to feed the rabbits.

, Give them at least three different types of greens per feeding, and including one that is high in vitamin A. For the wild rabbits in your yard, you can give them:


Collard greens (high in vitamin A)
Beet greens (the tops, high in vitamin A)
Lettuce: Romaine, Red or Green leaf (no iceberg or light colored leaf)
Spinach
Parsley
Basil
Mint
Bok Choy
Dandelion leaves
Mustard greens
Pea pods (just the pods)
Brussels sprouts
Swiss chard
Broccoli (the leaves and stems)
Cilantro
Dill
The green part of carrots
Celery leaves
WatercressThoroughly rinsed carrot tops are another good vegetable option.Thoroughly rinse all vegetables to remove pesticides.
Although carrots are a very popular food for rabbits, they are high in carbohydrates and should only be fed in small quantities(only half a carrot every other day).Feed the wild rabbits a smaller amount of carrots than the other vegetables.
Do not feed the wild rabbits vegetables that can cause gas or bloating: broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage. Since rabbits are unable to pass gas, the buildup of gas in their digestive systems can cause serious health issues and may even be fatal.Because wild rabbits are not as acclimated to vegetables as domesticated rabbits, introduce them to vegetables slowly.Try feeding them just one type of vegetable at a time.Begin with only a small amount of a green, and watch for any intestinal issues in your bunny, such as diarrhea or soft stools.Rabbits also have individual likes and dislikes when it comes to taste so if your bunny isn’t interested in a certain vegetable, make note of it and replace it with a vegetable she might prefer.
Wild rabbits can get diarrhea if they are introduced to new vegetables too quickly.
Wild rabbits also enjoy eating clover and watercress., Wild rabbits will eat small berries, but will also eat other plant parts to balance off the fruit’s high sugar content.If you would like to give fruit to the wild rabbits, consider giving them different types of berries: blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries.For raspberries and blackberries, provide the wild rabbits with the fruit as well as the plant stems and leaves.Bananas and dried fruit are very high in sugar and should be fed only sparingly (even less than the other fruits). Per rabbit, one to two half-inch slices of bananas and two to three pieces of dried fruit would be enough.Other types of fruit you could feed the wild rabbits include papaya, honeydew melon, and plums (without the pit). However, you may want to stick with the berries, since the rabbits may be more accustomed to eating these in their natural environment.

Determine if the baby wild rabbit is truly an orphan.,
Learn what to feed orphaned baby wild rabbits.,
Feed the baby wild rabbits.,
Stimulate urination and defecation.",How to Feed a Wild Rabbit2," If you find a nest of baby wild rabbits and the mother is not around, or if you see tiny baby wild rabbits hopping around on their own, you may think they are orphans. More times than not, however, this is not the case—their mother is simply not at the nest and will return later. It would be better for you to be certain whether the babies are orphans before attempting to feed and care for them.


Wild rabbit mothers nurse for short periods during the night and early dawn, then leave the nest during the day.Therefore, it would not be surprising if you did not see the mother with her babies during daytime hours.
If the babies’ tummies look nice and plump, you can be confident that their mother is caring for them. If you look closely at their bodies, you may be able to see a ‘milk line’ through their skin—evidence of nursing.If you want to be sure the mother is around, you can place string in a grid pattern over the nest.Arrange the string in the evening and check it in the morning. If it is disturbed, then the mother has returned to the nest.
Baby wild rabbits who appear cold, weak, dehydrated (loose skin stays tented when you pinch it), or injured are likely orphaned.Since baby wild rabbits are extremely difficult to rehabilitate and care for,you should contact a wildlife rehabilitation center as soon as possible. , In the event that you are not able to get to a wildlife rehabilitation center right away, you may need to provide at least initial care (food, general comfort) to the orphaned baby wild rabbits. Regular goat milk is frequently recommended for baby wild rabbits.Kitten and puppy milk replacers are also good choices.Milk replacers are available at your local pet stores.
You may be able to find regular goat milk at your local grocery store. If it is not available there, ask the grocer where you can find it.
Cow’s milk and human baby formula (Pedialyte) are not recommended for feeding baby wild rabbits.If the baby wild rabbits are cold prior to you feeding them, warm them up by placing them in a shoebox lined with a clean, soft cloth. Set a heating pad on low and set in a tabletop. Place the shoebox halfway on the heating pad—this will allow the babies to move away from the heat if they become too warm., Knowing what to feed baby wild rabbits is only half the battle—knowing how to feed them is a crucial component to their survival. Because they are so small, baby wild rabbits can be fed with a syringe (one to three milliliters), which is available at your local pharmacy.Eyedroppers are another good option.To remove harmful bacteria from the milk or formula, warm them up in the microwave or boil them on the stove.Cold milk or formula could cause potentially fatal diarrhea in baby wild rabbits.Keep the feeding area quiet so as not to stress the babies.One at a time, gently pick up each baby wild rabbit and hold him loosely but firmly in a soft cloth. Tilt his head so that it is higher than his back end and place the syringe near the side or bottom of his mouth—these two actions will prevent him from accidentally inhaling the liquid down into his lungs.Do not overfeed the baby wild rabbit. You will know when to stop feeding when his tummy becomes slightly rounded.Visit the website http://www.orphanedwildlifecare.com/rabbitandhare.htm to know how much to feed, and how often, according the baby wild rabbits’ ages.
Make sure to wash your hands before each feeding session., After the baby wild rabbits have finished eating, it is important for them to urinate and defecate to keep their digestive and urinary systems healthy. To do this, stroke the anal area with a cotton ball moistened with warm water until the rabbit urinates and defecates."

Provide water for baby rabbits.",How to Feed Baby Rabbits," Before you take a baby rabbit away from its mother or think it’s orphaned, make sure the mother is not feeding it or that she is a risk to the kitten. Mother rabbits feed their kittens about twice a day and only for five minutes. The babies also do not need the mother to keep them warm. If the babies do not seem distressed, even if the mother is away from them a lot, the mother is likely just taking a break and you should not interfere.Neglected baby rabbits are cold, cry for more than a few minutes at feeding time, are blue, or their skin is shriveled from dehydration.Some mothers may reject their babies, and in these cases you should separate the babies from her so that she doesn’t harm them.Don’t assume an unattended nest of wild baby rabbits is orphaned. Check on them frequently before you take them in to feed them. If they seem content, it is unlikely that they have been abandoned.Only 10% of hand-reared rabbits survive, so it is better to leave them in the wild whenever possible.;
, If you are going to feed baby rabbits, you’ll need to purchase replacement milk for them. Rabbit milk is the most caloric of all mammals’ milk, so you’ll need to make sure you get the proper replacement and amounts.Buy Kitten Milk Replacer (KMR) or goat milk to feed the babies. You can purchase these at pet stores or sometimes at a local vet’s office.You can supplement each can of KMR with one tablespoon of sugar-free 100% heavy whipping cream to increase the calories and mimic the rich mother’s milk.You can also supplement the KMR by adding a bit of acidophilus to the formula. This can help baby rabbits maintain healthy intestinal bacteria.Acidophilus is available at most health food stores., Baby rabbits won’t usually eat from a bottle, so make sure to have some sterile oral syringes or eyedroppers on hand to feed them. This will help you control the amount the kittens eat and help mimic the size of a mother’s nipple.You can buy oral syringes or eyedroppers at most pharmacies. Vet’s offices and pet stores may also have special options for pets.

, Baby rabbits will nurse from birth until they are about 6 weeks old, and you’ll need to mix enough formula to feed them at different ages. By splitting the formula into two equal feedings a day, you can help ensure your baby rabbit is getting sufficient nutrition.Remember to mix one tablespoon of 100% sugar-free heavy whipping cream with each can of Kitten Replacement Milk.You can also add the pinch acidophilus at this time, too.
Newborn rabbits up to a week old get 4 – 5 cc formula.Rabbits that are 1 – 2 weeks old get 10 – 15 cc formula.Rabbits that are 2 – 3 weeks old get 15 – 30 cc formula.Rabbits that are 3 – 6 weeks old or until they are weaned get 30 cc formula., Once you’ve mixed the formula, you can feed your baby rabbit twice a day. It’s important to feed them similarly to how they feed from their mothers to help them stay healthy and grow.Mother rabbits generally feed their babies twice a day — at dawn and at dusk., It’s essential that you let baby rabbits to feed at their own speed. Not doing so can suffocate or kill the kitten.The baby may suckle the syringe and you can gently squirt a small amount of formula as they want it.If the baby isn’t suckling the syringe willingly, give it time to adjust. You might want to stimulate the kitten with a gentle squirt.You may also want to pet your baby rabbit while feeding her for comfort.

, It’s crucial that baby rabbits defecate and urinate either before or after each feeding. This helps keep their intestinal tract and urinary system healthy and running smoothly.You only need to stimulate defecation and urination for the first 10 days of a baby rabbit’s life, or until their eyes are open.Use a cotton ball moistened with warm water and gently stroke the anal and genital area of the baby rabbit until it starts defecating and urinating. Continue this until the kitten is finished.Don’t worry that you’re doing something wrong, this mimics the same behavior a mother rabbit would do., Continue to feed your baby rabbit formula and solids until she is ready to wean. Depending on what type of rabbit you have, she will wean at anywhere from 3 – 4 weeks of age to 9 weeks of age.Domestic rabbits wean at about 6 weeks.Wild rabbits such as cottontails wean at 3 – 4 weeks, while jackrabbits wean at about 9 weeks., Baby rabbits may begin eating solid foods when their eyes open, at about 10 days after birth. You can slowly add solid foods to their formula diet until they are weaned at about 6 weeks old. Don’t feed baby rabbits solid foods before their eyes open. Their intestinal tracts cannot handle solids before this point., Once your rabbit's eyes are open, you can start incorporating solid food into its diet. However, domestic and wild rabbits feed on different solids, so know what kind of rabbit you have. Both can eat oat and timothy hay and alfalfa hay; domestic can also eat pellets; wild can also eat vegetables.Domestic rabbits: oat and timothy hay; alfalfa hay; pellets. Do NOT give them vegetables.
Wild rabbits: oat and timothy hay; alfalfa hay; fresh vegetables like dark leafy greens, carrot tops, parsley. Do NOT give them pellets.
Leave the solids in the corner of their box where they can easily eat them.Make sure to change hay, pellets, and vegetables often so that they don’t go bad and harbor bacteria. The vegetables should be fresh and moist.You can buy hay and pellets at most pet stores or a vet’s office. Greens and carrots are readily available at grocery stores or farmer’s markets.

, In addition to formula and solid foods, consider giving your baby rabbits water. This can help keep them hydrated and feeding properly.Don’t leave a deep dish in the box. Baby bunnies can drown in deep dishes filled with water.Fill a shallow dish with a small amount of water and place it in the corner of the box.Clean and refill the water dish frequently. This can not only help your baby rabbits stay hydrated, but can also help ensure that the water doesn’t harbor any bacteria."
"
Be aware that the reaction of your pets during a disaster event will be based on instincts and fear.,
Keep your pets' immunization up-to-date at all times.,
Prepare a pet First Aid/survival kit at the same time that you update the family one.,
Have a pet carrier or crate for each pet.,
Develop a pet buddy system.,
Know what to do if you must leave your home.,
Always take time to comfort and soothe your pet as soon as possible.",How to Prepare Your Pets for Disaster," Loud noises, moving ground (earthquakes, etc.), flashes of lightning and thunder, increasing water levels, etc., can lead to your pets abandoning their usual places of safety to find new ones. For this reason, it is important to increase the chances of your pet being located and returned to you as the disaster event eases:


Ensure that your pets are tagged or microchipped to make ownership clear. (Microchipping is available through many veterinarians and animal welfare organizations.)






Always keep your pets' ID tags current with their name, your phone number, and your current address, including your email. Add both a landline and a mobile phone number.






Take digital photos of each of your pets. Print off a copy for each pet; this will help you to ask others if they've seen your pet if you're separated. It is also recommended to include a photo of you with your pet, in case you're separated and people need to match you to your pet.






A flashing collar or ID tag can help you to find a lost pet at night.






Know your pets' common hiding places. These should be checked first before looking further afield.





;
, Not only is this important for their ongoing health but it is also essential for protection from disease during an emergency situation. Keep immunization cards or records and the vet's phone number in an easily accessible place and be sure to notify all of the family where they can find this information in a hurry. Keep copies in a plastic bag in your pet's survival kit, to allow shelter or rescuers to know the vaccination/health status of your pet.


Make a list of your pets' medications. If your pet is on medications, write down the exact names of the medications. During an emergency, being able to refer to this information easily will ease any panic and helps those who don't know your pets as well to do the right thing for them.







, It can be helpful to keep these kits together, or to at least have clear and accessible locations for them that each responsible member of the family knows about. The survival kit should be ready-packed to grab at all times in case you need to leave the house in a hurry: Think ""Grab pet and survival kit."" The kit should contain:


Any medication needed (keep this refreshed), and pet first aid supplies.






Emergency food supplies. Have at least 3 days of food.







Emergency water supplies. When planning the amount of water for your family, always include pets in the estimate. Also note the location of any outdoor water locations your pet usually uses that self-fill, such as pots, buckets, a stream, etc., as these may be important water resources to draw from during a disaster.






Harnesses and safety leashes.






Travel bowls for food and drink - at least two.






A can or tin opener if needed for food cans/tins.







Photos of your pets, at least one of you with your pet. Place in a plastic bag.






Emergency contact list with numbers for vet, emergency services, local authorities, and animal rescue centers. Also include the emergency contact for an out of region friend or family member. Place in a plastic bag.






Litter tray and litter for cats; poo bags for dogs.






Pieces of newspaper and pet-safe cleaning solution for quick clean-ups.







Towel or blanket suitable for your pets. One per pet is probably a good idea.







, During a time of an emergency, it is far better to have a proper carrier than to make one up that could fall apart. Knowing that your pet is safe in their carrier will remove a lot of worry from your mind and makes them super easy to move from place to place.


If you have to stay in emergency accommodation, having your pet's own carrier can make it easier for your pet to be accommodated.
Have leashes or harnesses for pets that are too large for a carrier, or where the carrier size might compromise space for passengers.






If you must make a last-minute emergency pet-carrier, consider zip-tying 2 milk cartons together, or securely duct taping the lid onto a sturdy plastic clothes hamper. This is better than leaving a cat behind, or putting a snappy small dog on a leash.
If you know your dog does not react well to stressful situations, have a muzzle in your emergency kit.







, Pets, unlike service animals, may not be allowed in some emergency shelters, particularly in urban areas. Talk to your family, friends and neighbors about planning how you will help each other in the event of an emergency, and where emergency supplies have been stored.


Designate an out-of-state/province friend or relative as contact, as well as a local person you trust. A contact can be used by family members or others to call if you are separated from each other. Identify a location where you can reunite.






Make note of where animal rescue shelters are in your area, or of people who can take pets in the event of an emergency that causes you to evacuate from your home.






Be prepared to help other pets you see roaming loose where this is safe to do so. Naturally, if you are afraid that the pet may be diseased, rabid, or dangerous, keep your distance. But where you know the pet or figure out it is safe, try to help care for it and get it back to its owner. Even if you simply alert pet welfare authorities where the pet is located, or get it to a central care point, this is a kind and helpful gesture that will help the owners too.

, After ensuring you have all family members ready, collect your pets. Do not leave pets behind unless you cannot find them – many pets won't be able to survive if you're gone for more than a day. Cover your pets with a towel or blanket to calm them if needed, and place in their own pet carriers. If your pet is too large for a carrier or the room taken up in your car is too much, place your pet on a leash.


Don't take toys or bedding – grab the pet survival kit only. Act urgently, think safety, and ensure enough space in your transportation – these should be your main priorities.







, They will be as afraid as you are. Spending time with your pet during a disaster situation can also comfort you and your children a great deal.

Give your rabbit a variety of foods.,
Keep clean grass hay available to your rabbit at all times.,
Allow your rabbit access to fresh grass.,
Feed your rabbit fresh pellets daily.,
Feed your rabbit leafy green vegetables.,
Avoid giving your rabbit foods that are bad for it.,
Remember that your rabbit needs a balanced diet to stay healthy.,
Understand what rabbits are supposed to eat.,
Understand the function of the first digestive cycle.,
Allow your rabbit to re-ingest its cecotropes, or night feces.",How to Choose Rabbit Food," Due to the way the rabbit’s digestive system works, the diet needs to consist of foods with the right amount of fiber along with moisture to keep the digestive tract functioning properly. A proper diet for a rabbit consists of:Quality grass hay.
Leafy green vegetables
Pellets
Water
Small amounts of starchy vegetables (such as carrots and small pieces of fruit);
, In addition to giving the rabbit something to chew on, grass hay is vital to maintain a rabbit’s intestinal health. Never let your rabbit go without hay.


Alfalfa and clover hay is too high in protein and calcium to feed to a rabbit. This type of hay should only be used as a treat.

, Fresh grass is good for a rabbit.You can set up a pen outside on your lawn for your rabbit to graze or you can clip grass with a scissors (don’t use lawn mower trimmings) and give it to your rabbit to eat.


Make sure there has been no chemicals used on the lawn. Fertilizers or herbicides could make your rabbit very ill.

, These are produced to be completely nutritionally balanced. Adult rabbits should have from 1/8 to ½ cup daily, depending on their size.


If you don’t limit the amount of pellets a rabbit eats, it may become obese. It could also have other health conditions, as it may choose pellets over grass or hay and it needs grass or hay for proper digestion.
Throw out any uneaten or spoiled pellets every day before putting fresh pellets in the rabbit’s dish.

, Leafy green vegetables, like salad greens, bok choy, arugula, broccoli stems and leaves, and carrot tops are great fiber and water sources for a rabbit. Feed from 1-3 cups a day, depending on the rabbit’s size.


Make sure to slowly introduce new greens to a rabbit. Introducing new foods to a rabbit too quickly can give it diarrhea, which can be life threatening to a rabbit.

, Now that you know the proper foods to feed a rabbit, you should learn what to never feed a rabbit. Foods that should never be fed to a rabbit, as they may cause severe intestinal upset and may kill a rabbit, include:


Human foods other than previously mentioned vegetables and fruits.
Corn, seeds, and other grains.

, One of the most dangerous nutritionally-induced conditions in a rabbit is gastrointestinal (GI) stasis. This is caused primarily by a too low fiber diet although stress, not enough water, pain, and a foreign object in the gut can also cause GI stasis.If you ever see these signs or suspect GI stasis get your rabbit to the veterinarian. This is an emergency and needs to be treated immediately. Signs of GI stasis include: decreased fecal pellet production, slow or no appetite, and lethargy or no energy.Hesitating or taking a “wait-and-see” approach may kill your rabbit.
To prevent this problem always keep fresh, clean hay out for your rabbit. This cannot be stressed enough. They must always have hay to chew on and to digest to keep the intestinal tract moving properly and functioning normally.

, The rabbit’s digestive system is designed to deal with a diet consisting of very fibrous plants, plants which humans could never digest.This type of food is typically very coarse and rough so the rabbit’s teeth continuously grow as the food wears the teeth down.If the food doesn’t perform this function the teeth will grow long and ragged, potentially injuring the rabbit.

, Rabbits are crepuscular, meaning they eat primarily at dusk and dawn, so the food needs to be stored for hours. The stomach mixes the food up with enzymes and acids before it is passed along to the first the small, then the large, intestine.In the small intestine, most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs as the food travels along this part of the gut.After the small intestine, the large intestine goes to work on the food along with the cecum. The cecum is an outpouching of the large intestine, very much like the human appendix. Unlike our appendix, the rabbit’s cecum serves a purpose, to further digest the fibrous portion of the plants the rabbit consumed.

, In the rabbit, the cecum is huge, 10 times the size of the rabbit’s stomach. It is loaded with bacteria and microorganisms that break down plant fibers to make nutrients available to the rabbit’s body. When the fibers are broken down, the cecum releases all the nutrients and material into the large intestine in a blob called a cecotrope.This is passed out of the body via the large intestine and anus. When it does, the rabbit eats it to recover the nutrients produced by the bacteria and microorganism in the cecum.

Avoid plastic bowls.,
Place away from bedding.,
Clean the bowl daily.",How to Choose a Water Dish for Your Rabbit1," Your rabbit’s bowl should be made of ceramic or metal. Plastic bowls are easily scratched. Bacteria can then build up in the crevices and contaminate the water. Your rabbit may also pick up a plastic bowl and treat it as a toy.Heavy ceramic bowls are ideal for rabbits.
Rabbit bowls are typically hold about 550ml of water and about 5"" across.;
, While bowls are the most natural way for your rabbit to drink water, they are more likely to be contaminated with beddings, litter, and food. The bowl should be placed away from any food and loose bedding. You may need to change the water more than once a day to keep it from becoming contaminated.If your rabbit tends to knock over the bowl, purchase a bowl that clips to the side of the cage.
Consider having a water bottle in the cage as a backup in case the water bowl gets knocked over.

, Wash the bowl with warm, soapy water, rinse, and refill with clean water. Your rabbit will not be interested in drinking stale or unclean water. Disinfect the bowl at least once a week.Mix 1 tablespoon of bleach with 1 cup of water to disinfect the bowl. Rinse the bowl thoroughly with clean water to remove any traces of bleach.

Do not punish your rabbit.",How to Teach Your Rabbit to Jump over Something," Clicker training is a very effective and popular way to train rabbits. Throughout your training sessions with your rabbit, you will use the clicker to let your rabbit know immediately when he has done the right thing. The clicker is even more effective when used in combination with positive reinforcement (e.g., treat, verbal praise, extra petting).Clickers are available at your local pet store.
For rabbits, the sound of the clicker is more consistent and less confusing than human words.A click is a more immediate reward than verbal praise or treats.
You could also use a pen as a clicker.;
, Although some rabbits will jump over something without needing a lure,other rabbits may need some motivation. A target stick is a popular training tool to use with rabbits. The target stick is commonly made of a jingle bell tied to the end of a stick.Visit your local home decoration store to find the jingle bell and a stick.
The purpose of the stick is to lure your rabbit into performing a certain task.

, Before you can start training your rabbit to jump, he first needs to learn how to follow the target stick. With a few treats in one hand, hold the stick about one inch in front of his nose. When he turns his head to look at the stick, immediately click and give him a treat.Repeat this about 15 times., When your rabbit can pay attention to the stick when you hold it still in front of his nose, start moving the stick in different directions: right, left, up, and down. Each time he moves his head to follow the stick, immediately click and reward him. Repeat this 15 times., The ultimate goal for target training is for your rabbit to reach out and touch the target sick. The first time he does this, immediately click and give him six treats to reward him generously. To challenge him after this first time, gradually start moving the target stick farther away from his nose.As you move the target stick further away, your rabbit should start to follow and try to touch it. If he doesn’t follow, shorten your distance and try again.To challenge him even further, do not click immediately after he touches the target stick. Instead, wait for a second or two. This will teach him to be patient before he earns the reward.You may find that your rabbit enjoys the extra challenge., Daily practice will help your rabbit become comfortable with the target stick. Rather than doing one long training session, schedule several training sessions throughout the day: early morning, early evening, and late at night before your rabbit’s bedtime.Your rabbit will be hungry in the morning,which should make him more receptive to getting a food reward.
Your rabbit may get bored with a lot of repetitions. If your rabbit starts to lose interest, end the training session and work with him again later in the day or the next day.

, Now that your rabbit knows how to follow a target stick, it’s time to get to the really fun part of the training. First, put some thought into where you are going to train him. Pick an area of your home where the floor isn’t slippery—a slippery surface could cause your rabbit to lose his footing and possibly injure himself when he lands.


Choose a carpeted area of your home. Hardwood floors or tiles would be too slippery.

, To start out the training, you may want to choose something that your rabbit could easily jump over, such as a pole.You could also train him to jump over a basket, or even through a hula hoop!


Whichever item you choose, make sure it is light enough for you to hold above the ground during training sessions.
Visit your local pet store to pick up a pole or other small object for your rabbit to jump over.

, Before going straight to the training, give your rabbit some time to run around and investigate the object over which you want him to jump.Getting your rabbit to jump over the object may be a little easier if he is already comfortable with it. Also, if he has some pent up energy, letting him run around will let him release some of that extra energy.


Do not rush him while he investigates the object.

, Although your rabbit can jump high, start your training by holding the object low—about five centimeters (two inches) above the floor.This height is high enough that your rabbit will have to jump over the object (rather than step over it), but not so high that he will have trouble doing so.

, Hold the target stick a short distance from your rabbit’s nose. When he jumps to follow the target, click immediately when you see his back feet clear the top of the object.Your rabbit may surprise you and jump over the object without you needing to use the target stick. If he does this, click when he is at the height of his jump.Whether he jumps with or without the target stick, reward him with positive reinforcement after you use the clicker.
If your rabbit decides to run to the side of the object, or maybe run away from it, simply pick him up and place him in front of the object again.You may need to do this a few times until your rabbit understands that he is supposed to stay in front of the object and jump over it.
Keep on practicing until your rabbit can consistently jump over the object at a low height.

, Challenge your rabbit by raising the object higher off the ground.How high you hold the object off the ground is up to you. Continue using the target stick to lure your rabbit to jump.


Immediately click and reward your rabbit when his back feet clear the object.
Do not hold the object so high that your rabbit is not able to jump over it or risks injury trying to do so.

, The goal of training is for your rabbit to jump on command without you using the target stick. Choose a simple command, like ‘Jump.’ Say the command clearly and confidently,show your rabbit the target stick, and click and reward him immediately when he jumps over the object.Say the verbal cue softly. If you say the cue in a loud voice, your rabbit may become frightened and run away from you.With practice, you should say the cue only once.Initially, you may need to say the command several times before your rabbit understands what it means. Make sure your voice does not sound threatening or emotional if you have to say the cue multiple times., To start phasing out the target stick, say the command without showing your rabbit the stick. Click and reward him immediately when he jumps over the object.Gradually use the stick less and less until you are not using it at all.

, In addition to raising the object higher off the ground, you can also challenge your rabbit by moving him further away from the jump. When he is further away, say ‘Jump’ and click and reward him immediately when he jumps over the object.Eventually, you should also start phasing out the treats—you don’t want your rabbit becoming overweight while teaching him to jump!

, Jumping may be difficult and more dangerous for certain rabbits. For example, large breed rabbits could injure themselves when jumping. In addition, rabbits that are overweight or out of shape could hurt themselves when trying to jump.Large breed rabbits include English Lops, French Lops, and Americans.Although younger rabbits are easily trainable, their bones and joints are still developing. They could injure themselves and develop orthopedic problems with too much jumping.Before you teach your rabbit to jump over something, take him to your veterinarian for a physical exam. Your veterinarian can let you know if your rabbit’s physical condition is ideal for jumping., Positive reinforcement, which comes in many forms, is very effective for pet training. However, positive reinforcement for a rabbit is not necessarily the same as that for a dog. This is partially because rabbits are not naturally obedient—they are not inclined to follow a leader (you) as a dog would.Although rabbits are social animals, they are not pack animals and thus do not have an ‘alpha’ rabbit.Your rabbit is unlikely to see you and respond to you as his ‘alpha.’
In addition, a rabbit’s appetite is smaller than that of a dog. Therefore, treats may not be very enticing to your rabbit as a reward (unless he’s hungry).If treats are not enticing to your rabbit, offer him other forms of reward, such as head scratches., Training your rabbit should focus on rewarding good behavior, not punishing bad behavior. Do not ever shout at or physically punish your rabbit.If you do so, he will likely see you as the enemy and remember how you punished him.Punishing your rabbit can also make him more aggressive, fearful, and maybe even vindictive."

Keep treats in small amounts.,
Feed your rabbit an array of vegetables.,
Give your rabbit small amounts of fruit.,
Give your rabbit a wide array of healthy treats.,
Avoid giving your rabbit foods that are low fiber, high sugar, or high fat.,
Be very careful about the amount of high sugar fruits you give your rabbit.,
Keep foods that are toxic to rabbits away from your pet.,
Don't feed your rabbit anything you are unsure of.,
Do not make treats the majority of your rabbit's diet.,
Wait until a rabbit is old enough to eat hay before giving it treats.",How to Choose Rabbit Treats," For a rabbit, this means about a tablespoon of food. Give a small rabbit this amount once a day, while a larger rabbit can have a small treat up to three times a day.


Giving small amounts allows your rabbit to digest whatever healthy treats you give it. Because a rabbit's digestive system is so sensitive, you need to be cautious about overwhelming it with new and complex foods that are difficult to break down.;
, Make sure to wash or thoroughly rinse the vegetables before giving them to your rabbit.Also make sure you are not giving spoiled vegetables to your rabbit, as these can make a rabbit sick. Some good vegetables to feed to your rabbit include:Asparagus
Beet roots
Carrots
Celery
Cucumbers
Bell peppers
Brussels sprouts
Green beans
Turnip roots
Kohlrabi
Pea pods
Broccoli
Squash
Pumpkin

, Fruits, although delicious, are high in sugars. Therefore, it is best to limit these treats to only once or twice a week in small amounts, meaning one tablespoon for a small rabbit or two tablespoons for a large rabbit. Good fruit choices include:Raspberries
Strawberries
Blueberries
Melon
Apples
Kiwi
Pineapple
Papaya
Pear
Plum
Peach

, You do not want to give only one kind of treat, as this could give your rabbit too much of one kind of nutrient. For example, don’t just feed one kind of fruit or vegetable every day. Mix them up so that your rabbit gets a variety of nutrients but continue to keep to the recommended amount.


However, introduce any new food gradually. Your rabbit does need an array of foods but its digestive system needs to get used to digesting them. This is done by adding new foods to the rabbit's diet very gradually.

, Obviously, you should never give your rabbit junk food or meat of any kind, as rabbits are herbivores. In addition, avoid giving it food that low in fiber or high in sugar and fat, such as bread, rice, potatoes, and avocado.These foods can severely disrupt your rabbits digestive process.

, Sugar can disrupt the rabbit’s intestinal flora (bacteria), causing diarrhea. For example, you can feed a small amount of banana or grapes to your rabbit but give it half the amount as you would other fruits due to their extremely high sugar contents.


In the case of rabbit's, diarrhea is a very serious problem that can cause your rabbit to get sick and die very quickly.

, There is a wide array of plants that are actually toxic to rabbits.In nature, wild rabbits usually steer clear of them. However, a pet rabbit may be lured into trying something toxic to it if you present it like food. Some things that are toxic to rabbits include (but are not limited to):Apple seeds
Onion
Tomato plants
Rhubarb leaves
Wild carrots
Citrus peels

, If you are unsure whether a certain fruit or vegetable is good for your rabbit, then just avoid giving it until you find out. Remember that it is always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to a rabbit's digestive system.

, Rabbits need an appropriate diet to make sure their digestive system works correctly. An unbalanced diet may make them sick or could even kill them.The bulk of a rabbit’s diet should consist of clean water, fresh hay (that is available to the rabbit at all times), pellets (in limited amounts for adults) and fresh, leafy greens (also given in limited amounts).Consider vegetables other than leafy greens a treat and leafy greens themselves as a necessary component of your rabbits diet that needs to be given in moderation. Leafy greens include lettuce, spinach, beet greens, Swiss chard, and a variety of others., Basically, you should not give a new born baby rabbit any treats. Ideally, the rabbit will have been on hay for at least two weeks before starting to give it treats. This will allow the little rabbit's digestive system to adjust to digesting hay and its digestive enzymes will be established enough to start digesting fruits and vegetables."

Choose between a classic or sippy spout.,
Attach the bottle.,
Clean bottles daily.,
Prevent freezing in the winter.",How to Choose a Water Dish for Your Rabbit2," Classic water bottles have a metal tube with balls inside. The balls stay in the end of the tube until your rabbit licks the tube and causes the water to come down. These spouts are more likely to leak and your rabbit may be frustrated by the balls in the tube. A sippy spout has a wider spout and is quieter than a classic water bottle.If your rabbit will be staying in your room, a quieter sippy spout is best.
Sippy spouts are more expensive, but are easier to clean.

, Your rabbit’s bottle will come with the tools necessary to attach the bottle to the cage. Keep in mind that your rabbit may chew on the bottles because it is hanging in the cage. If you do not like the attachment that comes with your bottle, you can use the water bottle holders that cyclists use.If your rabbit is hesitant about using the bottle, put some molasses or sweet jam on the end of the tube to entice him., Clean the bottle with hot, soapy water each day. Use a bottle brush for a better cleaning. You can also use sterilizing tablets that are made for cleaning baby bottles.To prevent algae from growing, place an opaque cover around the bottle.

, Water bottles may freeze in the winter. Use an insulated bottle cover to prevent this. These covers only protect the bottle, but not the spout. Check the spout to make sure that water is still coming out.If you cannot afford a bottle cover, place bubble wrap around the bottle and then place the bottle in a wooly sock.
You may need to purchase a larger holder if you are using an insulated bottle.

"
Provide 24/7 access to fresh water.,
Add flavor to the water.,
Give a bottle and bowl.",How to Choose a Water Dish for Your Rabbit3," The amount of water your rabbit drinks depends on his size, diet, and climate. A medium sized rabbit will drink 50-300ml of water per day. If your rabbit eats a lot of fresh foods and grass, they will not drink as much water because they are getting a lot of water through their diet. Your rabbit will also drink more water in hot weather.Give your rabbit the same quality of water that you would drink.

, If your rabbit is not drinking enough water, add a small amount of Pedialyte or unsweetened apple or carrot juice to the water. Do not give your rabbit any sugary drinks or Gatorade. If you add Pedialyte to the water, you will need to change the water more than once a day to prevent bacteria from developing.There is not a standard amount of flavor to add to the water. You may want to test the mixture yourself in a separate cup to see if you can taste a slight difference.
Talk to your veterinarian before you add anything to your rabbit’s water. These additions could have a negative effect on your rabbit’s digestive system.

, If your rabbit has only been drinking out of either a bowl or bottle, give your rabbit another option. Your rabbit may be intrigued by this new source of water. It is also good to have a backup source of water in case a bowl gets knocked over or a water bottle is clogged or leaks too much.


Check the water bottle tube each day to make sure that it is working properly.

Hold a treat above your rabbit’s head when she or he has all four feet on the ground.,
Give a command such as “Fluffy, stand up.”

,
Give him/her a treat and verbal praise when he or she stands.

,
Repeat several times in a row, several times a day.",How to Teach Your Rabbit to Stand Up,";
,,, This is a very easy trick to teach. If you want more of a challenge once your rabbit has this down, try getting him to hold the position by holding the treat just out of reach and delaying its delivery. Start with a very small delay and gradually increase the time. Once you have the desired results, use treats only occasionally.

Learn how training a rabbit is different from training a dog.,
Do not punish your rabbit.",How to Teach Your Rabbit to Go Back to His Hutch," You can teach your rabbit to go back into his hutch with or without a clicker. With either method, a verbal cue will be helpful. Choose a short, simple cue like ‘home’ or ‘bed.’ You will need to say this cue each time you want your rabbit to go back into his hutch.Whenever you say the cue, say it in a quiet yet clear and confident voice.Say the cue without emotion. Even if you are frustrated with your rabbit, that frustration should not be apparent when you say the cue.;
, Small pieces of fresh apple, carrots, or melons make great treats for rabbits. Place a small handful of treats in your rabbit’s hutch, making sure he can see you do it.The treats serve as an incentive for your rabbit to return to his hutch.


If your rabbit does not want to walk all the way to the hutch to get the treats, make a trail of treats leading to the hutch.This way, he can munch on something on tasty when he walks toward and into the hutch.
Say your verbal cue as your rabbit walks towards and into the hutch. This will allow him to associate the cue with returning to the hutch, and learn that the cue is followed by a tasty treat.

, With a chute, you are giving your rabbit only one way of getting back to his hutch without the opportunity to escape. Fortunately, you do not have to spend a lot of money (or any money) to make the chute. Place a series of cardboard boxes on two sides to create an enclosed pathway through which your rabbit will walk to reach his hutch.Place some tasty treats in his hutch so your rabbit will be rewarded when he goes inside of it.Consider placing treats along the chute’s pathway as well.
When your rabbit is in the chute, block the entryway so he cannot escape.As your rabbit walks through the chute, stay a few feet behind him and repeat your verbal cue until he reaches his hutch.You may need to place your rabbit inside of the chute—he may not go in there willingly.
If your rabbit is showing signs of distress or fear (e.g., stomping feet, grunting), break down the chute and try again later on., If your rabbit is already reluctant to go back into his hutch, chasing him or trying to get him back into the hutch quickly will not work. In fact, either of those activities may frighten your rabbit and make it even harder for your rabbit to do what you want him to do.Even if your rabbit is testing your patience, do your best to move slowly and calmly, and keep a small distance away from your rabbit.

, Clicker training is another effective way to teach your rabbit to go back into his hutch. First, your rabbit will need to get comfortable with the clicker’s sound and learn what the sound means. In a quiet, distraction-free area of your home, press down on the clicker. Wait for a second or two, then give your rabbit a treat.Clickers are available at your local pet store. You can also use a writing pen or mechanical pencil as a clicker.
The time gap between using the clicker and giving your rabbit a treat allows him to hear and pay attention to the clicker.Continue using the clicker with a pause until your rabbit looks to you expectantly for a treat when he hears the click.Rabbits learn at different paces, so it may take a lot of repetition before your rabbit associates the click with a treat.You can challenge your rabbit by using the clicker when he is busy doing something else, like playing with a toy. If he turns to you looking for a treat when he hears the click, you will know that he understands what the click means. Reward him with a treat.The sound of a click may be frightening to a timid rabbit. To avoid frightening your rabbit, place your clicker in a pocket or gloved hand to muffle the sound., When your rabbit can associate the click with a treat, use the clicker to teach him to go back into his hutch. Put a few tasty treats in a small bowl and position the bowl where he exercises and plays. Immediately click and give him a treat if he looks at the bowl or makes any movement towards the bowl.If he moves toward the bowl, click and give him a treat just before he reaches the bowl.
Start by placing your rabbit near the bowl, then slowly place him further and further away from it. The goal is to teach him to move towards the bowl from any direction (and any distance) in his exercise area. Continue to use the clicker and give him a treat as before., When your rabbit is comfortable moving towards the bowl, place it inside of his hutch, near its entrance. Place your rabbit near the bowl as you did before, and slowly increase the distance between your rabbit and the bowl. Immediately click and give your rabbit a treat as you did previously.The goal for this step is to encourage your rabbit to go into the hutch from any direction and distance within his exercise area.

, Verbal cues are important during clicker training. Watching your rabbit’s movements closely, say the verbal cue right before your rabbit begins to walk toward the bowl in his hutch.Saying the cue before your rabbit moves helps him understand why you are saying the cue in the first place.


You may have to repeat the cue many times before he reaches this understanding., Now that you have added in the verbal cue, remove the food bowl from your rabbit’s hutch. This will challenge him to go back into his hutch even when there is no bowl of treats waiting for him. When he goes inside his hutch after you give your verbal cue, immediately click and give him a treat from your hand., In addition to removing the food bowl from your rabbit’s hutch, you should also stop using the clicker.By the end of your training, your rabbit should be able to respond to only your verbal cue to return to his hutch.

, It may be tempting to teach your rabbit to go back into his hutch by forcing him into it. However, using force indicates that going back into the hutch is your idea. He will be more likely to return to his hutch if you let him think it was his idea to do so.Creating a trail of treats and leaving a bowl of treats in the hutch will help your rabbit think that it’s his idea to return to his hutch.

, Like dogs, rabbits enjoy receiving rewards. However, rabbits do not aim to please as dogs do. In the wild, rabbits did not evolve to be very cooperative with each other unless there was an outside threat.Since wild rabbits do not necessarily look up to their leaders, it is not surprising that your own rabbit does not have much incentive to look up to you and please you.To train your rabbit, keep in mind that he is not trying to please you. Rather, he is primarily looking for his reward.

, As with other pets, punishment is not effective with rabbits. Verbal and/or physical abuse will cause your rabbit to see you as the bad guy. In addition, punishment can lead to negative behavioral changes in your rabbit—he may become afraid, withdrawn, or even aggressive.If you sense yourself become frustrated with your rabbit, it may be time to end your training session and try again later.

Provide for your rabbit's basic needs.,
Use a calm and even temperament with the rabbit.,
Devote plenty of time to training.,
Use your rabbit’s favorite treats.",How to Teach Your Rabbit to Come when Called1," Give your rabbit adequate food and shelter. You need to make sure that your rabbit is healthy and happy before attempting to train it. If a rabbit is unhappy or ill, it will be less likely to be interested in completing training sessions with you.;
, Rabbits, and other pets for that matter, don't usually respond well to anger and aggression. The saying ""you catch more flies with honey"" is very true when it comes to training an animal. Having a positive attitude and being nice will build more trust with a rabbit, and thus make the rabbit more likely to follow your commands, than brute force or hostility.

, Spend a bit of time every day on training. Training should be done in short sessions, consisting of only 5-10 minutes. The goal is to do training consistently but in short bursts., Since training is based on incentives, you’ll need to find a treat that provides the most positive response. If you don’t know what your rabbit’s favorite treat is, experiment a little. If the rabbit leaves a treat alone, then it won’t work as a treat. If the bunny munches a treat right down, you have a winner.


You can offer a new food, in small amounts to avoid digestive upset, once a day and watch the rabbit’s response.

You don't have to use a special rabbit tray. A regular cat litter tray with lower sides is fine, or even a shallow cardboard box (but be prepared to replace it regularly as it will get chewed).;
, Use it to line the bottom of the tray, which will make it easier to clean the pan out.Most newspapers now use soy-based ink, which is not toxic for rabbits, but always check before using it. Newspaper ink can also rub off onto your rabbit's coat, turning it black or gray.

, Choose a rabbit-safe product, such as paper-based litter or untreated aspen chips. Don't use pine or cedar chips, since these are treated with oils that can irritate a rabbit's lungs.Do not use clay based cat litters or clumping cat litters. If the rabbit eats them, these litters could cause a bowel blockage.

, The cage should be three to six times the length of the rabbit. The first step of training is to restrict your rabbit to a cage with food, water and a hide in one half, and the litter tray in the other. The restricted space encourages your rabbit to not soil her living area, and toilet in the tray., Use hay to attract the rabbit to the litter box.Rabbits frequently like to munch on a snack while toileting, so this will encourage her to use the space.

, You will scoop out litter soiled with urine on a daily basis. The whole tray needs disinfecting at least once a week.Use a commercial disinfectant designed specifically for small animals., Collect up some of the rabbit's pellets and drop them into the tray.

, Line the bottom of the litter tray with a sheet of folded up newspaper. Cover the newspaper with approximately one inch of litter. Rabbits do not bury the litter tray. This places some of the rabbit's scent in the box which gives her the idea it's the right place to toilet., Place the litter tray at one end of the cage and scatter some fresh hay in the tray, or attach a rabbit hay rack to the end of the cage where the tray is located. Rabbits like to eat as they toilet, so some tasty hay will attract her attention and encourage her over., Put bedding at the other side of the cage and set up her food, water, and a hide.This will give her somewhere to hide and feel secure.

, Put out several boxes in areas your rabbit spends time or exercises in. The more litter boxes you have, the more likely it is the rabbit will use one of them.


Before introducing your bunny to the litter box for the first time, watch it and pay attention to where it does its business. Typically, it will be the back corner. Once you've established your bunny's preferred area, place a box in that spot.

, Adult rabbits learn more quickly than immature rabbits (under 4 months of age). However, it's never too early to start litter training. Make a tray available as soon as you bring a new rabbit home, and start to teach her how to use it. Just be patient and and she will eventually learn.Most desexed adult rabbits will defecate and urinate in one corner, so you only need to place their litter box in their toilet corner.
Starting out, when she toilets outside the litter tray, scoop up the pellets and put them in the tray as a hint as to where to go.

, Un-neutered adult rabbits are more territorial and they use their scent to claim space. This involves depositing urine and pellets around the house, using scent as a territory marker. Getting your rabbit neutered will make it much easier to litter train her, because her need to be territorial is vastly reduced., At first, it helps to restrict the rabbit to the cage with the tray, so that the rabbit learns not to soil the eating and sleeping area. It only takes a couple of days to teach— once the rabbit understands this, you can start letting the rabbit out.

, When you allow her out to exercise, if she squats to the toilet, gently pick her up and place her in the litter box that's in her cage. A sign the rabbit is about to eliminate is that she raises her tail in the air slightly. You need to be vigilant for this, but it does help if you can catch her in time.In the early stages of training, do not let her out for more than ten minutes at a time, and do not leave her unsupervised in a room (you want to catch her before she toilets). Once she is using a tray regularly, you can relax your vigilance and let her have more freedom.

, Never shout or get angry with your rabbit if she doesn't use one of her litter boxes. Rabbits don't learn this way. Positive reinforcement is a much better teacher.


Offer a little treat, such as a bite of apple or carrot, immediately after she uses her litter box. This will reinforce a positive connection between toileting and the box.

, Once your rabbit starts using litter trays reliably, you can alter the number or position of them as needed.


For example, if your rabbit only uses two litter boxes and ignores the others, the extras can be removed. If your rabbit ignores one litter box, but urinates in a corner three feet away, move the litter box to the corner.

, Once a day, scoop out litter soiled with urine. It's fine to leave pellets behind for a day or so as they act as scent markers for the rabbit to go back to., When cleaning the litter tray, keep an eye out for large, moist looking pellets, which are made up of half-digested food. Leave them in the tray for the rabbit to re-eat and get vital nutrients. Without these pellets, your rabbit could suffer from gastric disturbances and diarrhea, and in the long term, dietary deficiencies., Once a week, completely empty the tray and clean it. Simply dump the entire contents into a plastic bag, tie it off well, and throw it in the trash. Clean the tray with a disinfectant, rinse well, and allow to dry. Then remake the tray with newspaper and litter.Vet clinics or pet stores sell disinfectants that are safe for use around pets.

, Accept the accident for what it is, and then clean the area well so she doesn't continue to toilet in the wrong place. Use a solution of biological washing powder and work it in well with a clean cloth or sponge. Then rinse with clean water.Do not yell at or punish your rabbit. Rabbits do not learn anything through punishment, other than to be fearful of the person doing the chastising.
When getting rid of a mess, always test the carpet for colorfastness first.

, Work a solution of baking soda into the carpet, then rinse with clean water. If the surface is smooth, such as tiles or lino, finish by wiping it over with surgical spirit.Do not use cleaning products that contain bleach. It contains ammonia, a component of urine, and can actually strengthen the smell of urine.

Sit on the floor near your rabbit.,
Give the rabbit a treat and verbal praise if it approaches you.,
Move a little further away.,
Hold out a treat and again give the command.,
Repeat this training frequently.,
Replace the treat with a toy or petting.,
Consider using clicker training.",How to Teach Your Rabbit to Come when Called2," Bring healthy rabbit treats, such as carrots and celery. Hold out the treat and say "", come.”

, This will positively reinforce the rabbit's actions. Also, repeat the command as it approaches.

, In the beginning, don’t move very far; just a couple feet will do. Over time can move further and further away from the rabbit.

, If the rabbit follows you without you having to say the command, then simply say it as it approaches. If the rabbit doesn't respond to your command and the promise of a treat, move back to your closer position and repeat.

, During the course of the day, occasionally call your rabbit. Use treats each time for the first few weeks to get your rabbit to associate the command with the treat. When your rabbit comes every time from a close distance, start calling it from further away.

, In time, reward your rabbit with petting and toys, but use food occasionally to keep the behavior strong. This will keep your rabbit coming when called but will also keep your pet healthy.

, Many people suggest using clickers to reinforce association.Each time you feed the rabbit, click the clicker so that the rabbit associates the click with food. Then, when you’re training, a click from the device tells the rabbit a treat is coming.


Try to click right as the desired behavior is happening so the animal knows what it did to get the reward. Give the rabbit a treat or something else they enjoy within a few seconds of the click for each and every time you click, even if you click accidentally. The rabbit will learn that a click means a treat and try to earn clicks.

Understand what motivates your rabbit.,
Understand how a rabbit uses sight and smell.,
Remember that kindness goes a long way with a rabbit.",How to Train a Rabbit1," Rabbits are very intelligent and eagerly respond to incentives. This means that strong punishment, such as spanking or yelling at a rabbit, won’t make it more cooperative. If you use incentives correctly, however, most rabbits will respond accordingly.


Food is generally used as motivator, but toys may also be a reward for your rabbit.
Rabbits are prey animals, so if they feel frightened they will usually flee and try to find somewhere to hide. If they exhibit this behavior, it means that you need to find a way to make them feel more comfortable and safe before attempting to train them.;
, Bunnies do not see well directly in front of their faces. Their eyes are set far apart on the head and so they see to the side and far away better than up close.


The rabbit will use scent and whisker feedback to detect anything in the immediate environment more so than sight, so you will want to place treats under the rabbit’s nose and mouth.
You may notice that rabbits change their head position as you get closer. This is an effort to see you better, like a person with bifocals trying to get the glasses and their eyes lined up to see.
Rabbits are prey animals and need to see predators from far away, so that they can run and hide in time to save themselves.Because of this, before you touch it, you need to let the rabbit see and smell you. This will give you an easier time handling the rabbit. By letting it see and smell you, it can verify that you are not a predator, and therefore no danger to it.

, Rabbits respond to kindness and will make excellent companions who will respond positively to your voice and presence if you treat them well. While you must have your rabbit’s respect in order to train it, you’ll be most successful if your rabbit also feels loved and comfortable in your presence.


Not all rabbits enjoy being stroked, but some enjoy it so much that stroking can be an even better incentive than food. Spend plenty of quality time petting your rabbit, and attend to all its basic needs so that it feels secure and comfortable in your home.
Never hold your bunny by the ears! Don't hurt your rabbit. Be kind and gentle to your fluffy friend and it will respond more positively to your training.

Be ready for your rabbit to wake up.,
Hold the rabbit firmly and gently turn over when finished.",How to Put Your Rabbit in a Trance," Many people feel strongly for or against trancing, and it’s best to hear what your vet has to say regarding your rabbit. If your rabbit suffers from many health issues, this is especially important -- putting a rabbit in a trance can be very hazardous to their health, but at the same time it can allow you to inspect a rabbit’s body for problems. Listen to what your vet says before deciding., If you believe your rabbit has been injured but you cannot find out where, or if you need to dress a wound, trancing might be your best option. If you’re just hoping to have an easier time clipping their nails or grooming them, it might not be worth it. It also might depend on the rabbit -- some rabbits seem to come out of it calm, while others are shaking in fear, Watch the video at the end of this article. If you're nervous, ask a friend or family member to be present before you begin. It’s important that you be confident in your motions when dealing with your rabbit -- it will be able to sense if you are nervous or stressed., Put a towel on your lap. Make sure you are in a chair where your rabbit’s head on your knees will be lower than the rest of its body. Gather everything you need nearby. If you’re trying to dress a wound, it would be the antibiotic and bandage. For grooming, it could be nail clippers, brushes, etc.

, Use your right hand under the bunny’s front legs, and left hand on its rump. Have it in the crook of your arm -- sort of like snuggling a baby. Turn the rabbit over onto the towel on your lap. Be gentle! Your rabbit will be on his or her back -- a position they typically do not enjoy. Be sure the rabbit’s rump is higher than its head. The rabbit will struggle, but this normally doesn’t last long., Some rabbits will immediately go into a trance, others will need a little help. Rub your rabbit’s chest between its front paws with one hand. With the other, gently rub the head. This might send them into a trance immediately., Soon the rabbit will drop its head back and become immobilized. If the feet are shaking, just touch them and they should stop. Then pet your rabbit’s front paws, back paws and stomach just so they know you're there. Keep hold of your rabbit while in a trance because you can’t know when they will wake up, usually with jerking motions that could seriously injure them if you haven’t supported them properly.

, Inspect, groom, or bandage your rabbit. It’s impossible to know how long your rabbit will stay in a trance, but 10 minutes is usually the maximum., It can feel like your rabbit just exploded to life in your lap! This is why it’s important to keep the rabbit’s body well-supported while in the trance. Other rabbits wake up more slowly and like to have their head rubbed while waking, Snuggle it for a moment. Put the rabbit down and pack away the supplies around you.

Repeat this daily.",How to Make Your Bunny Come to You when You Open the Cage," If the rabbit is new to your home, keep it inside the cage when unsupervised, and give it access to just one room. Choose a small room without much foot traffic, to avoid scaring the rabbit.Rabbit proof the room by moving electrical cords and houseplants out of the rabbits' reach.The cage should include some place for the rabbit to hide, so it feels safe. It also helps to keep one side of the cage against a wall.;
, If you just bought a rabbit, it's a good idea to leave it alone for at least three days. Provide food, water, and a clean litter box, but don't try to pick it up or play with it.


Some rabbits may take weeks to get used to the new home, especially if they've just been neutered or spayed.

, Many rabbits dislike walking on hard, slippery floors. If your rabbit is reluctant to leave its cage, try putting down a towel or rug for it to walk on.Stick to natural, cheap materials, since the rabbit may try to chew through it., Make sure all doors and windows are shut, and no pets or other people are in the room. Open the rabbit's cage door, then back away. Let the rabbit hop out when it wants to.


Shy rabbits and old rabbits may not want to leave the cage. Places boxes or other hiding spaces nearby so they can run out without staying in the open. Once these are set up, it's just a matter of patience.

, Sit quietly on the floor near the rabbit, but not right next to it. Talk to it in a calm, encouraging voice., Hopefully, this will make you seem small and nonthreatening. At this point, you're just waiting for the rabbit to approach you. This might take several long sessions if the rabbit is shy, so get comfortable.If possible, spend an hour or more with the rabbit.

, Put a sprig of parsley, a tiny piece of apple, or another treat on the floor, halfway between you and the rabbit.Leave them there for the rabbit to investigate.


Stick to one or two tiny treats. Rabbits have delicate digestive systems.
Once the rabbit is curious or brave enough to approach and eat the treat, move it closer on your next visit, or put it in your pocket for the rabbit to find. Pretty soon, you can hold one end of the treat and let the rabbit nibble the other.

, Once the rabbit finally approaches you, don't move or try to pet it. Let the rabbit sniff and explore as much as it wants. This is how the rabbit checks you out and decides you're friendly.

, When the rabbit finally approaches you and is done sniffing you, gently stroke the top of its head with two fingers.Avoid touching its ears.


Don't start by offering your hand, as you would with a cat or dog. The rabbit may get scared and bite you.

, If the rabbit grunts at your hand or runs away, don't chase it or try to keep petting. Once it comes back, try slowly moving your nose toward its forehead, while humming in a deep, soft tone. Some rabbits will let you do this even if they're scared of your hand., As the rabbit gets to know you, it will gradually get used to your petting. try gently cuddling the roots of the rabbits ears, or the top of the rabbit's back.


Stop whenever the rabbit runs away, gives a startled hop, grunts, or tries to bite you. Grunting may sound cute, but it's a sign of an angry rabbit.Win it back with a pellet or treat, while speaking in a calm, reassuring voice.
Avoid the rabbit's feet, chin, and nose until it is very friendly with you.Some rabbits are nervous about their ears being touched as well.

, The more you feed your rabbit and pet it, the more comfortable it will get. Once it's your friend, your rabbit will run to you for a treat or attention every time you open the cage.


Stay patient. Some rabbits are extra-shy or have had bad experienced with humans. These can take months to befriend you.

The common ones are Doc's Rabbit Enhancer, Calf-Manna,and ShowBloom.Some owners use these in addition to their own ingredients, so don't think you're restricted to just one of these if you buy one.;
, You can make your own additions to your rabbit's food to help increase its conditions. For instance, oatmeal, barley, and wheat germ are a couple of grain options.You can also use black oil or wheat germ oil.Another option is sunflower seeds--the kind you use for birds.For instance, one owner mixes equal parts of Doc's Enhancer, black sunflower seeds, crimped barley, and wheat germ. To hold it together, he uses a third of a part of wheat germ oil. In other words, if you use 3 cups each of the first ingredients, you'll need a cup of wheat germ oil. Leftovers should be frozen., According to some breeders, adding a tiny bit of molasses or salt to your rabbit's normal food can condition it in place of commercial or homemade conditioners. Basically, you just sprinkle it lightly on top of the food or pour a bit of molasses.The reason this may work is because it will encourage it to increase its water intake. In turn, that helps with its condition overall., If you buy a commercial product, it will have instructions about how much of the product you should feed your rabbit. Generally, it is not very much, as your rabbit will still be on regular food.For instance, ShowBloom recommends 1/2 an ounce for dwarf rabbits per day, 1 ounce for regular rabbits per day, and 1 1/2 ounces for giant rabbits per day.Calf-Manna recommends a tablespoon for large rabbits (or ones producing milk) or a teaspoon for smaller rabbits, including adolescents, per day.For conditioning, start feeding commercial products like ShowBloom 90 days ahead, but always read the manufacturer's instructions first., If you're feeding your own supplement, try a very small handful at first. As you feed your rabbit the supplement, you should reduce what it's eating otherwise. Try to reduce the normal food in the same amount that you're feeding the supplement.Other owners recommend as little as a teaspoon for small rabbits. Take into account the size of your rabbit when feeding special food.Start feeding a homemade product about a month to a month and a half ahead of time. If you're constantly doing shows, you can feed a small amount all year, though you can also just focus on a couple of shows for conditioning., Sometimes, rabbits will dig for the special feed. That's because it's a treat, and they may like it better than their regular food. If your rabbits are leaving too much regular food behind, you might trying feeding their supplement at a separate time. That way, they can focus on their regular food when you give it to them., Your rabbit needs plenty of water to be healthy. Change the water daily, and make sure to not let its water run dry. Water can also help condition your rabbit., After the show, it's important to take your rabbit off the conditioner. If you leave it on it, it can cause it to gain weight over time. In fact, it can work against you because then your rabbits will be out of condition for showing because they'll be too large., A conditioner will not work properly if your rabbits are not healthy in the first place. You need to check for certain diseases, listed in the bullet points. If you're not sure how to do it, check with your vet.Look for loose feces or a runny nose, as those can be signs of problems with your rabbit. Also, if you notice mites, that will get you disqualified at a show.A runny nose could be a sign of Pasteurellosis, also known as snuffles. It can be treated, but your bunny will not likely be able to show.Coccidiosis, abscesses, and pinworms can also be problems.If you notice any of these symptoms, take your rabbit to the vet for treatment.

, ""Foreign substances"" are things you use to make your rabbit look healthier than it is. That does not include conditioners, but it can include things like polishes and other silicone-based products meant for rabbits.It can also mean things like colors to help your rabbit's toenails look healthier than they are., Most of the time, your rabbit isn't going to need a bath. They keep themselves clean and generally do not like water much.If your rabbit is stained from the hutch or from feces, you can use a spray-in dry shampoo, available at the pet store. However, you must make sure all of it is out before the show, as it counts as a ""foreign substance"" if left in.You can also use rubbing alcohol or peroxide to try to get a stain out., Getting your rabbit's fur ready is a simple process. Wet your hands, and run them down the length of your rabbit's body, pulling off any extra fur you find. You can also go against the grain of the fur once and a while, but doing so too often can damage the fur.On some fiber-producing breeds, such as American Fuzzy Lop or Jersey Wool, you can use a wide-toothed comb, going in the direction of their fur.While you normally may need to brush your rabbit, for a show, you only need to make sure all the dead fur is gone. Plus, you should ensure your rabbit doesn't have mats, as that will get it disqualified. If you find a mat right before a show, you may not be able to fix it, as mats can be a sign of a runny nose. Otherwise, use a mat rake or splitter to get the mat out., If a judge is scratched by your bunny, that will likely get you disqualified. Therefore, you need to make sure your rabbit's nails are trimmed. In addition, missing toenails can also get you disqualified.Cat nail trimmers are good for this process.You can lay the bunny on its back, stand it on a table, or cuddle it with one arm. You might want to have another person around to help you corral the rabbit. Bring one leg up at a time to trim its nails.Remember to also get the ""thumb"" nail on the front foot.In some rabbits, you'll be able to see the quick without assistance. If you can't see the quick, trying shining a flashlight behind the nails. Try not to get below the quick, as the rabbit will bleed.If it does bleed, you can use flour, cornstarch, or styptic powder to stench the flow."

Devote plenty of time to training.,
Use your rabbit’s favorite treats.,
Get your rabbit in position for training.,
Have a plan.,
Give your rabbit a treat immediately when your rabbit does something you want to reward.,
Keep providing the treats until your rabbit responds correctly nearly every time.,
Consider using clicker training.,
Wean your rabbit off the treats gradually.,
Reinforce the training as necessary.",How to Train a Rabbit2," For best results plan on initially devoting a little time every day to training your rabbit. Two or three short sessions of 5 to 10 minutes at a time will keep your bunny interested in learning., Since training is based on incentives, you’ll need to find a treat that provides the most positive response. If you don’t know what your rabbit’s favorite treat is experiment a little. You can offer a new food, in small amounts to avoid digestive upset, once a day and watch the rabbit’s response. If they leave it alone, then it won’t work as a treat, but if the bunny munches it right down, you have a winner.


If you’re not sure if a particular food is safe for your rabbit, check with your veterinarian (one that is familiar with rabbits). Do not feed anything but vegetables, greens, or fruit to your bunny.
If your rabbit is not used to eating much fruit or fresh greens, go easy on the amounts for a few weeks to avoid causing diarrhea or digestive upset.Your rabbit may like Blueberries or Kale or Carrot (try shreds of carrot) as a treat., Stage your training in the area and situation where and when you will want the behavior to occur. For example, if you want to teach your rabbit to jump up on your lap when called, first put it near the couch. If you want to train it to go in its crate at night, train it around the appropriate time, and make sure its crate is positioned where it will normally be.

, Start simple. Carefully plan what you want your rabbit to perform and break that task down into small steps. You will reward the rabbit after completing each new step. Once the rabbit is performing the task with regularity and confidence, give the command a name.

, If the rabbit sits up as you lift your hand above its head as if sitting up to beg, give the treat right away to reinforce “sit up.” The reward will need to be given within 2-3 seconds of the behavior.


If the rabbit does something else before you give the treat, you are reinforcing the wrong behavior.
If you want to teach your rabbit to come when called, start its training by having it positioned very close to you. When it comes to you, give it the reward. Be consistent so that your fluffy companion knows why it's getting treats.
Use the exact same commands, such as “Sit, (Your Rabbit's Name),” or “Up, (Your Rabbit's Name),” every time, so your rabbit will learn to recognize your requests and associate those exact words with getting a treat.
Add praise to the act of giving the treat. For instance, “Good Sit” or “Good Up.”

, When you’re trying to teach a new skill, don’t skimp on the rewards. You need to make sure you are thoroughly conditioning your rabbit.


If you are training your rabbit to allow a harness to be placed, start with rewarding the bunny for going over to the harness on the floor and sniffing or touching the item. Work up to placing the harness on the bunny’s back and rewarding them for staying still. Reward the bunny for calmly allowing you to lift up a front leg then work up to placing their foot through the appropriate part of the harness. Reward as you go and move slowly. Don’t frighten or rush the rabbit. Once you have the harness in place, allow the rabbit to wear it for a few minutes at a time and take it off. Work up to having the rabbit drag the leash around the house before picking up the leash yourself.

, Many people suggest using clickers to reinforce association.Each time you feed the rabbit, click the clicker so that the rabbit associates the click with food. Then, when you’re training, a click from the device tells the rabbit a treat is coming.


Try to click right as the desired behavior is happening so the animal knows what it did to get the reward. Give the rabbit a treat or something else they enjoy within a few seconds of the click for each and every time you click, even if you click accidentally. The rabbit will learn that a click means a treat and try to earn clicks.

, Once your rabbit has a skill down begin to give the treats less frequently. Give its reward once and then don’t the next time, or give it a treat only every few times. Eventually you may not need treats at all.


In time, reward your rabbit with petting and toys and only use food occasionally to keep the behavior strong.
Rabbits like gentle strokes on their heads. Do not stroke the rabbit on its body; this is alarming to a rabbit. Be patient and take things slowly to avoid creating fear in your rabbit.

, From time to time your rabbit may need to relearn a skill. That is, you may need to bring the incentives back. Don’t be afraid to do so.


Never scold, punish, shout or even say ""no"" to the rabbit during training. This is counterproductive and will make your rabbit more fearful and delay training.

Figure out where your rabbit is eliminating.,
Place a little of the dirty bedding in the litter box you bought for their cage.,
Place the litter box in the place the rabbit has chosen to eliminate.",How to Train a Rabbit3," They naturally choose a particular spot in the cage to eliminate. Because they use the same spot repeatedly, you can use this to your advantage.

, This will encourage the rabbit to use the litter box. Make sure to clean the rest of the cage after moving a bit of the dirty bedding.

, There are litter boxes for rabbits made to fit in the corners of cages or you can use a rectangular version if the cage is large enough. If you position is right, the rabbit should naturally continue to use the same spot, only this time it will be in the litter box.


Of course, larger litter boxes are possible when the rabbit is enjoying “bunny hop” time outside the cage.

"
Make sure your rabbit knows who is in charge.,
Address any aggression in your rabbit.,
Investigate whether your rabbit's aggression has an underlying cause.",How to Train a Rabbit4," Chances are your rabbit will want to rule the house. While you can’t expect the kind of submission you can get from a dog, you must have the respect of your rabbit in order to train it.


The most common way rabbits try to assert dominance is inappropriate nipping or biting you to try to herd you or get you to leave your sitting place. If this occurs, let out a short, loud, high-pitched squeal and either put your rabbit down on the floor (if it has jumped up where you’re sitting) or pick it up and move it out of the way from you (if it is on the floor already). Do this firmly, but gently. You don’t want to hurt your rabbit or make it fear you, you simply want to assert that you are in charge. If your rabbit continues the behavior, put it in its crate for a “time-out.”

, First, approach your rabbit calmly so you do not elicit a fear response from the rabbit. Hang out on the floor with your rabbit. Have some treats on the floor. Reward the rabbit for coming closer to you. Leave your hand down. If the rabbit comes up to you and does not seem afraid or does not try to bite you, try to gently stroke the rabbit's head for just a few seconds.


If you do not back down and avoid the reflex to “run away” if the bunny charges you, the rabbit will learn that this behavior does not work to intimidate you.Never hit the rabbit. You and your hands are the sources of food and pleasure, like petting on top of the rabbit’s head.
If you are afraid of being injured, wear long pants, shoes, long sleeves and gloves if necessary to protect yourself from bites., A change in your rabbit’s behavior, including aggression, should be investigated to eliminate the chance that there is a medical issue causing the problem.Consult with a veterinarian familiar with rabbits to rule out pain, for instance, as a cause for misbehavior.


Hormones can also influence bunny behavior and having your rabbit spayed or neutered may help decrease territorial aggression, for instance.

The fur on the front paws is usually matted and crusty from a rabbit using its paws to wipe the discharge from its eyes and nose. Sneezing is another symptom of snuffles.If your rabbit has any of these symptoms, take it to your vet for diagnosis and treatment.;
, Many antibiotics are available to treat bacterial diseases. To determine which antibiotic to prescribe, your vet will take a sample of discharge from your rabbit and perform what’s called a culture and sensitivity test. This test will indicate which bacteria is causing your rabbit's snuffles and which antibiotic will be most effective against that bacteria.Some antibiotics can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) problems in rabbits. Your vet will select the antibiotic that is not only effective, but also least likely to cause GI problems in your rabbit.Be aware that no antibiotic is a definite cure for snuffles.The culture and sensitivity test may take several days to perform.

, To treat snuffles, your vet will prescribe oral antibiotics, which will be in liquid form and given using a syringe. To make things easier, ask your vet to pre-fill syringes with the correct amount of antibiotic (per dose). To administer the oral antibiotics, hold your rabbit snugly. Place the syringe in the corner of your rabbit’s mouth and gently empty the syringe’s contents into the mouth.


Your vet may also prescribe antibiotic eye drops if your rabbit has conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eye's inner lining).To give the eye drops, hold your rabbit and slowly drop the prescribed number of drops onto your rabbit’s affected eye.
Antibiotic treatment for snuffles can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, especially if your rabbit’s snuffles is chronic.Give your rabbit the entire course of antibiotics, even if your rabbit starts getting better. If you stop the treatment early, the remaining bacteria in your rabbit’s system could become resistant to antibiotics.If you are not sure how to give the antibiotics, ask your vet to show you how.

, Your rabbit’s GI system contains ‘good’ bacteria that help with food digestion. Antibiotics can suppress the good bacteria and allow ‘bad’ bacteria to multiply in your rabbit’s gut. These bad bacteria can release toxins that could make your rabbit extremely sick.Signs of GI problems in your rabbit include a reduction in fecal pellets and a doughy-feeling stomach (due to gas buildup).If your rabbit is having GI problems with antibiotic treatment, contact your vet right away. Your vet will need to put your rabbit on a different antibiotic.
Probiotics are products that contain healthy digestive bacteria. Talk with your vet about giving your rabbit probiotics to restore the population of good bacteria in your rabbit’s GI system., With antibiotic treatment, your rabbit should start feeling better. The nose and eye discharge should stop, as well as the sneezing. However, the improvement may be only temporary—your rabbit may get sick again after antibiotic treatment stops.If your rabbit’s symptoms come back, it may have chronic snuffles.


Take your rabbit to your vet if the symptoms return.

, Rabbits have tear ducts that allow tears to flow from the eyes and into the nasal cavity.With snuffles, these tear ducts can become blocked with pus and bacteria. If your rabbit’s tear ducts are blocked, your vet will want to flush them with a clear saline solution. Your rabbit may need to be sedated for your vet to do the flushing.During the flushing, your vet will take care not to damage the ducts., Chamomile tea for your rabbit will help him/her to breath better as well as calm your rabbit down. Brew it stronger than you would drink it, add a teaspoon of honey.

Consider purchasing some Echinacea drops (all natural-some contain goldenseal which is safe for your rabbit) to add to the tea. Add two drops in aprox. half a cup of tea. Echinacea works well for stuffy noses. Some rabbits who have been on echinacea drops respond better to this natural remedy over antibiotics that a vet may give.







, When a rabbit has snuffles, the body may try to ‘wall off’ the infection by forming abscesses (pockets of infection). These abscesses can form in different parts of a rabbit’s body, such as the lungs or under the skin. Removing the abscesses requires surgery, since the material in the abscesses is too thick to be drained.Below are a few things to keep in mind about surgical abscess removal:Abscesses found with chronic snuffle cases are difficult to remove, since they’ve had time to become extensive within the body.
The tissue around the abscess may be dead or dying. Therefore, your vet may need to remove more than just the abscess.
Your rabbit may need multiple surgeries for all of the abscesses to be removed.
After surgery, you will need to care for the wound at home. At-home care includes keeping the wound clean and monitoring the incision site for infection (swelling, green or yellow discharge).

, Sometimes, snuffles can affect the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) in rabbits. This can cause neurologic problems, such as Wry Neck and rapid, uncontrolled pupil movement. If your rabbit has neurologic problems, your vet will prescribe medication to treat those problems., Snuffles is a very contagious disease in rabbits. If your rabbit has snuffles, keep it in a separate cage until it has completed treatment.Without other rabbits in the cage, your sick rabbit will likely feel a little more comfortable.

, Snuffles can make a rabbit feel pretty lousy. Your sick rabbit will want some peace and quiet as it recovers from its illness. Put your rabbit’s cage away from areas with loud noises (television, radio) or a lot of human activity. Don’t put the cage too far away, though—it should be where you can easily keep an eye on your rabbit., A constant draft of air in your rabbit’s cage could make your rabbit feel even worse than it already does. Within that quiet area, make sure the cage is not in the direct path of drafts, such as air vents in the floor or ceiling., A clean cage will help your rabbit feel more comfortable as it recovers from snuffles. Following a cleaning schedule will ensure that your rabbit’s cage stays clean. Daily cleaning duties include removing any uneaten food, washing food and water bowls in hot and soapy water, and removing urine and feces.About every two weeks, do a deep clean of your rabbit’s cage. This includes disinfecting the cage and litter box, washing the bedding, and disinfecting toys.
Remove your rabbit from the cage before you start cleaning. You can put your rabbit in a separate cage.

Continue home care with bandages.,
Give your rabbit antibiotics.,
Administer pain medication to your rabbit.",How to Treat Sore Hocks in Rabbits1," A rabbit with sore hocks can be in so much pain that it can’t find any way to rest comfortably in its cage.In addition, the bottom of its feet could be red, inflamed, and oozing discharge (indicating infection).If your rabbit just can't get comfortable in its cage, and its feet are looking abnormal, take it to your vet as soon as possible for treatment.Try to find an exotic animal vet in your area that has experience treating rabbits.Use the website http://rabbit.org/vet-listings/ to find a rabbit vet in your area.;
, After diagnosing your rabbit with sore hocks, your vet will gently clean the affected areas of its feet using a wound cleanser.If your rabbit is in a lot of pain, it may resist the cleaning procedure. However, the feet must be clean before any other medication can be applied to them.


Your vet may use an antibacterial soap to clean your rabbit’s feet. After the cleaning, they may apply an antibiotic cream to the affected areas.After cleaning and applying the antibiotic cream, your vet may bandage your rabbit’s affected feet. However, rabbits do not like their feet being bandaged.Don’t be surprised if your rabbit tries to chew off the bandage., After the initial foot cleaning by your vet, you will need to continue cleaning and treating your rabbit’s feet at home. Your vet will recommend various products (Betadine, Nolvasan, Epsom salt) in which you will soak your rabbit’s feet two to three times a day.Betadine and Nolvasan are antibacterial solutions that are available at your local pharmacy.


Use a small bowl to soak your rabbit’s feet. Holding your rabbit, gently lower the affected foot into the bowl. Your vet will instruct you on how much cleaning solution to use and how long you should soak your rabbit’s feet.
After soaking your rabbit’s feet, gently dry them off with a clean towel, apply antibiotic cream (if needed), and bandage them.

, Bandaging materials (sterile gauze pads, elastic bandaging material) are available at your local pharmacy. To bandage, place one gauze pad on the bottom of the affected foot, then wrap the foot and lower leg with the elastic bandage, leaving the toes unwrapped. Do not wrap so tightly to reduce blood flow to the foot.Bandaging a rabbit’s foot can be tricky, so ask your vet to show you the proper bandaging method.
Your rabbit may resist having you soak and bandage its feet, especially if it's in a lot of pain. You could try feeding it treats while you hold it and treat its feet. If this doesn't work, talk to your vet about strategies to keep your rabbit still enough to treat its feet.

, If your rabbit’s feet have become infected, your vet will prescribe antibiotics. They can be applied directly to the affected feet (cream or ointment) or given by mouth. Oral antibiotics are recommended for severe cases of sore hocks when the feet have become extremely infected.Certain antibiotics can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) problems in rabbits by reducing the amount of ‘good’ bacteria in the GI system. If your rabbit needs an antibiotic, your vet will be very careful about selecting the right one.In addition to an antibiotic, your vet may recommend giving your rabbit probiotics, which contain healthy digestive bacteria.Oral antibiotics are liquid and usually given using a syringe inserted into the side of a rabbit's mouth.When applying an antibiotic or cream, do not touch the tip of the container to the infected skin.
Follow the prescription instructions carefully when giving your rabbit an antibiotic.

, To reduce your rabbit’s pain, your vet will prescribe a pain medication. This pain medication may be an anti-inflammatory drug, such as carprofen or naproxen.As with the antibiotic, follow your vet’s prescription instructions when giving your rabbit the pain medication.


The pain medication may be in pill form. To give your rabbit a pill, you can hide the pill in of your rabbit's favorite treats, or crush the pill and mix it in with either your rabbit's favorite food or some fruit juice. Use the bottom of a butter knife to crush the pill."

Make the cage flooring comfortable.,
Remove soiled bedding regularly.,
Clean your rabbit’s cage.",How to Treat Sore Hocks in Rabbits2," In the wild, rabbits move around on grass and soft earth, which allow them to sink their claws and toes into the ground and have adequate foot support. Unfortunately, it’s hard to replicate that type of flooring for pet rabbits.If your rabbit has been sitting on a wire mesh cage flooring, without another soft area to rest its feet, you will need to make the cage flooring more comfortable.


If buying a smooth-bottomed cage isn’t practical, cover about 1/3 of the wire mesh flooring with soft flooring.For example, place a towel on the wire mesh and pile a thick layer of soft bedding, such as straw, on top of the towel.You could also place cardboard on top of the wire mesh. Cardboard is very absorbent, though, so you will need to change it frequently.If your rabbit’s cage already has smooth flooring, consider covering it with a soft cotton mat that has a rubber bottom. The soft cotton mat will give your rabbit traction, which will keep it from slipping and sliding on the smooth surface., Urine is very irritating to the skin and can cause sore hocks. If your rabbit likes to sit in its litter box, its feet will be constantly exposed to urine, leading to sore hocks.As you treat your rabbit, remove soiled bedding from your rabbit’s cage at least once a day.


When you remove the soiled bedding, make sure you also remove your rabbit’s feces. Both urine and feces and contribute to bacteria buildup in the cage that can worsen a sore hock infection., In addition to removing soiled bedding regularly, you should also keep your rabbit’s whole cage clean. Each day, remove any uneaten food, then clean your rabbit's food and water bowls with hot and soapy water. Every two weeks, clean the cage more thoroughly: clean the cage and toys with a diluted vinegar solution (4 parts water to 1 part vinegar).

Trim your rabbit’s nails.,
Help your rabbit lose weight.,
Treat orthopedic problems.",How to Treat Sore Hocks in Rabbits3," Long nails can curve under a rabbit’s foot and damage the skin, causing sore hocks. If your rabbit has long nails, trim them during the course of treatment. Following treatment, keep them short as a way to prevent another case of sore hocks. If you are not comfortable trimming your rabbit’s nails, have your vet do so.


If you do decide to trim your rabbit’s nails on your own, be sure not to trim past the quick of the nails.The quick is the blood vessel that runs through the middle of each nail. Trimming past the quick would be very painful for your rabbit and cause bleeding.

, Usually, an overweight rabbit cannot stand properly, causing it to put unnatural and uneven pressure on its feet. This pressure can cause sore hocks.If your rabbit is overweight or obese, you will need to gradually lower its weight to decrease the pressure on its feet. This will involve feeding your rabbit a healthy diet and increasing its exercise.


Talk with your vet before starting your rabbit on a weight loss program. Your vet will let you know how much weight your rabbit should lose and help you devise an effective weight loss plan.
Exercise options for your rabbit including digging, chasing you, and running through an obstacle course. Be mindful that, at the start of treatment, your rabbit’s feet may hurt too much for exercise.
A healthy diet for your rabbit includes hay, fresh vegetables, and limited amounts of pellets and treats.

, A rabbit with arthritis or other skeletal problems will have a hard time maintaining correct posture, increasing the likelihood of sore hocks.If your rabbit has orthopedic problems along with sore hocks, your vet will treat your rabbit for those other problems as well.


You can make your rabbit's cage more comfortable by using a litter box with a low front and shallow food and water bowls.

Your rabbit will tilt his head in the direction of the affected side. The head tilt may start gradually or have a sudden onset., Wry neck is not a disease itself—it is a symptom indicating problems with a rabbit’s sense of balance. A rabbit’s inner ear and brain play important roles in balance. If your rabbit’s inner ear is infected, or something damages his brain (e.g., trauma, stroke), his sense of balance will be thrown off. Therefore, your rabbit may lack coordination when walking or walk in circles.Your rabbit may look very wobbly on his feet when walking.If your rabbit is unable to get up, he might just roll around on the floor.If you try to pick up your rabbit, he may start rolling his body in your arms., Since the brain is part of your rabbit’s balance system, damage to the nerves in his brain controlling his facial movements could lead to facial problems. For example, your rabbit’s eyelids may not close, leaving him unable to blink. In addition, his eyes may start to look sunken in. Also, your rabbit may drool and his lip may start to droop.You may notice your rabbit’s eyes moving back and forth rapidly. This is called nystagmus and indicates nerve damage., With an altered sense of balance, your rabbit may start feeling nauseated. This sick feeling may cause him to eat and drink less.Anorexia can lead to very serious gastrointestinal problems in rabbits, so pay close attention to whether your rabbit is eating less than usual.


Even if your rabbit wants to eat, the head tilt would make it difficult for him to get anything in his mouth., Do not delay in getting your rabbit to your vet—an early diagnosis is essential to treating a rabbit with wry neck.Although wry neck can be easily diagnosed based on the characteristic head tilt, your vet will need to identify the specific cause of wry neck. Effective treatment will depend on your vet determining the exact cause.Take your rabbit to a vet who has experience treating rabbits. Visit http://rabbit.org/vet-listings/ to find vets in your area who work with rabbits.
With several potential causes of wry neck, your vet will perform various diagnostic tests, along with a physical exam, to rule out the causes one by one.Diagnostic tests that your vet may perform include blood tests, analysis of the urine, and x-rays., After your vet has identified the cause of your rabbit’s wry neck, they will devise a treatment plan specific to that cause. For example, if your rabbit has an inner ear infection, then aggressive, long-term treatment with antibiotics would be needed. If trauma is the cause, then steroids may help with recovery, in addition to other emergency treatments.For wry neck caused by the parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi, anti-parasitic drugs like fenbendazole and albendazole are indicated., Your vet may prescribe several medications for your rabbit. Make sure you understand all prescription instructions and follow them exactly.If you are unsure how to administer the medications, ask your vet to show you how.


Treatment for wry neck can take up to several months, or may be lifelong.Properly administering the medication, whether short term or long term, will help your rabbit recover.

, Feed your rabbit plenty of fresh vegetables, including leafy greens. With a tilted head, your rabbit probably won’t be able to eat much on his own. In addition to what he can eat on his own, you may have to feed him a supplement with a syringe; your vet can show you how to do this.You could also try breaking up his food into small bits and feeding him by hand.


If pellets are a part of your rabbit’s regular diet, do not feed them to him during his treatment.Your rabbit will still need to eat his cecotropes, the fecal droppings that contain important nutrients. If he cannot reach them on his own, place them where he can easily get to them.Wear gloves to pick up the cecotropes.
Your vet can show you how to feed your rabbit with a syringe.

, Staying hydrated during treatment will be just as important for your rabbit as eating a healthy diet. Purchase a shallow, heavy water bowl that your rabbit can drink from without knocking it over.If he is not able to drink on his own, you may need to place water in his mouth with a syringe.

, Exercise is an important component of your rabbit’s treatment for wry neck. Once your rabbit is steady on his feet, set up a large play area for him to exercise. Examples of toys to put in his play area are cardboard boxes and shredded newspaper.Keep your rabbit company as he plays.

, Since you may be treating your rabbit for a long time, you will need to be patient with him as he recovers. You may start seeing at least a little improvement within a few days. Examples of improvement are eating and drinking, attempts at grooming, and efforts to move around.Be mindful that your rabbit may still have a head tilt after treatment has ended.Fortunately, your rabbit can still have a happy life with the head tilt, as long as his other symptoms have improved and he is living a generally normal life.

, If your rabbit falls when he walks or rolls around on the floor, he may injure himself against the sides of his enclosure. In addition, he may develop sores and bruises from lying in one position for a long time. Place a few layers of fleece blankets in his enclosure for extra padding.Remove any items (e.g., water bottle with a sipper tube) from the inside walls of his enclosure that could injure him.Consider placing your rabbit in a smaller area so he doesn’t have as much space to wobble and roll around. Placed rolled up towels or blankets on the sides of his enclosure to give him something soft to lean against.A plastic, rectangular laundry basket is an ideal small enclosure. Line the bottom with some pee pads and a fleece blanket, and line the sides with rolled up towels., If your rabbit cannot blink his eyes, switch to dust-free litter. This will keep dust from flying into his eyes when he uses his litter box. To keep your rabbit’s eyes moist, your vet may prescribe eye ointments or artificial tears. Trimming your rabbit’s nails (or having your vet do so) will prevent him from scratching his eyes with his nails., With a head tilt, your rabbit may not be able to groom himself very well. This could lead to a buildup of urine and feces in his anal area, which would feel irritating to him and possibly cause a bacterial infection.Gently wipe his anal area to dry it off and remove feces.Pet-friendly wet wipes are another option for cleaning your rabbit’s fur.Look for them at your local pet store.
Brush your rabbit twice a week with a medium or soft bristled brush.If your rabbit is trying to groom himself, let him do so. This is a sign of improvement for him.

, Picking up your rabbit may make him feel unsteady. If you must pick him up, hold him firmly against your chest to help him feel more stable.Pick him up and rotate his position slightly to prevent the development of sores on his body."

Be sure to look carefully at the bunny’s nose and eyes to see if they’re becoming “runny,” or filled with mucus.Pay attention to what and how much your bunny eats. If there’s any loss of appetite, you’ll want to take your bunny to a vet immediately.
If there aren’t any other symptoms, the sneezing may well be an ordinary response to getting dust in her nose.;
, If your bunny starts to sneeze only in the presence of certain substances (such as cigarette smoke, hay, pellet dust, or pollen) then he may start sneezing as an allergic reaction to the substance.You’ll want to make sure your bunny’s living area is free of the allergen. If you are a breeder with many bunnies, regularly power washing the bunny’s living areas is recommended.
If your bunny still sneezes despite clean quarters, absence of cigarette smoke or ammonia from litter, then check with your vet for other possible causes.

, One of the causes of a rabbit’s sneezing is the ammonia build-up from soiled bedding. To prevent sneezing, change her bedding regularly.Never use pine or cedar shavings for bedding, as these shavings will alter a rabbit’s ability to respond to medication.Make sure the bunny’s cage is well-ventilated.

, Like humans, rabbits will sneeze if they get dust in their nose. A good strong sneeze will clear their nasal passages and restore good breathing.This type of sneezing will go away on its own, as soon as the nasal passages are clear.
Sometimes a bunny may sneeze as an expression of dislike or disgust when confronted with a smell he dislikes.

, If your rabbit is sneezing frequently, and showing other signs of illness such as runny eyes and runny nose, it’s likely she has a bacterial infection. Unlike the common cold in humans, this condition (commonly called “snuffles”) is a bacterial infection.Your vet should do a culture and sensitivity test to determine which of multiple common bacterial culprits is causing the sneezing in your rabbit.
Once the pathogen (i.e., the disease-causing bacteria) has been identified, the appropriate antibacterial medicine can be prescribed.

, Infection in the teeth and/or gums is a common cause of snuffles in rabbits. Teeth and gums are closely connected to the sinus passages, which is why issues there can result in sneezing.This kind of infection is more often found in older bunnies as they’ve had time to develop molar spurs or molar root problems that cause inflammation and infection.
You might need to get an Xray of your bunny’s head to see root problems, as the visible portion of the teeth may appear normal.

, If your bunny’s nostrils are frequently clogged, this is a problem for his health. Bunnies are obligate nasal breathers, which means that they can only breathe through their noses. You can help keep your bunny’s nose clear by using a pediatric ear syringe to suction out the excess matter that’s preventing your bunny from breathing., In the wild, rabbits eat a very high-fiber diet that consists mainly of grass, hay and bark, and they rarely suffer from dental problems. The majority of your rabbit's daily diet should be grass and hay, with only a small amount of commercial rabbit food.Because a rabbit's teeth grow throughout her life, the rabbit will need to eat foods that will wear down the teeth.
A bunny’s teeth need to be continually worn down by the action of chewing on food in order to maintain good dental health.

, Offering too many pellets or commercially prepared food may result in obesity. Typically, pellets are high in calories and low in fiber. If you do feed pellets to your rabbit, make sure they’re high quality with a good amount of fiber.Realize that obesity in a bunny is a serious medical condition. It contributes to many health problems, such as stomach and urinary tract conditions, and foot problems from bearing too much weight on his feet.
You can tell if your rabbit is obese by looking at him from above. A healthy rabbit should be shaped like a pear, with the larger portion at the base. An obese rabbit will be shaped more like an apple with a head.

, A bunny who spends too much time in her cage is likely to become obese. She needs time every day out of her cage to exercise. In the wild, a bunny usually covers around two acres of land as she forages for food. While you may not be able to provide this amount of free space, make sure you allow it ample time (at least four hours per day) to exercise in your home, backyard, or a fenced area.Diet and exercise are the best treatment for obesity in bunnies as well as humans.
Rabbits are naturally more active at dusk and dawn. If you can, provide two two-hour sessions of exercise for your rabbit every day in the morning and evening.

, One of the best ways to keep your rabbit healthy and fit, as well as giving you a good chance to observe your rabbit, will be to play games with him. Lie down on the ground and let your bunny hop all over you, for instance. Playing “chase” with a rabbit means allowing your rabbit to chase you around the yard. Call to him (practicing voice commands), and let him try to catch you. Most bunnies will get the hang of this game pretty quickly.You can build an obstacle course for your rabbit out of cardboard boxes, newspapers, and other household items.
Some bunnies enjoy chasing balls or rolling them around on the floor.
These playing sessions are best done in the morning and evening when your rabbit will be more energetic.

One of the common clues is anorexia.Other clinical signs of dental problems include weight loss, bulging eyes, discharge from the eyes and/or nose, long teeth, and slobbering.Your rabbit may also become a picky eater.Bad breath, poor coat condition, and reduced activity are also signs of dental issues in rabbits.;
, Common dental problems in rabbits include tusk-like incisors, molar spurs (sharp points on the end of the tooth), and loose teeth.Tooth abscesses, which are pockets of infection, can also occur.Sometimes, dental problems can be caused by trauma (e.g., accidentally getting stepped on), which can lead to jaw damage and difficulty eating., Untreated and undetected dental problems can lead to major illness in rabbits.For example, overgrown incisors can grow into some of the soft areas of your rabbit's mouth, increasing his risk of infection.In addition, your rabbit could become malnourished and suffer from digestive problems, such as gastrointestinal stasis, if his dental issues are preventing him from eating.


In extreme cases, untreated dental problems in rabbits can become life threatening., If you notice signs of dental problems in your rabbit, take him to your veterinarian as soon as possible.The sooner your rabbit can get treated, the quicker he can get back to good health and normal rabbit activities.


Take your rabbit to a veterinarian that has experience treating rabbit dental problems.If your current veterinarian is not comfortable treating the dental problems, ask them for recommendations on local veterinarians with experience in rabbit dentistry.

, You may have noticed some signs of dental problems, but your veterinarian will be able to take an even closer look and diagnose the specific dental problem. A rabbit’s mouth is surprisingly small, so your veterinarian will likely sedate your rabbit to examine his mouth.While your rabbit is sedated, your veterinarian will probably take skull x-rays to get a more detailed look at your rabbit’s teeth. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are also helpful, but your veterinarian may not have access to these imaging techniques at the veterinary clinic.During your appointment, tell your veterinarian about your rabbit’s diet (e.g., brand name of food, treats, supplements, etc.).Also, describe the signs of dental problems you noticed.

, Discussing these options will help you make an informed treatment decision.


Treatment of rabbit dental problems typically involves trimming or extracting the teeth. Antibiotics would be needed for an infection.Pain medication is given if needed.
Treating dental problems in rabbits is not always easy, and can get expensive. The treatment plan you and your veterinarian decide upon should address your rabbit’s pain and nutritional needs, and your needs., Rabbit dental problems require veterinary care. For overgrown incisors, molars, or premolars, your veterinarian may trim the teeth with an instrument called a dental burr. Using a dental burr is safer and more effective than clipping the teeth.Clipping the teeth is inaccurate, painful, and can possibly lead to tooth fractures.Since rabbit’s teeth grow continually, your veterinarian may need to trim your rabbit’s teeth regularly. After several trims, many rabbit owners decide to have the veterinarian extract the teeth.Overgrown molars develop spurs that can either curve inward toward your rabbit’s tongue or outward toward his cheeks. Spurs are very sharp and can cause extreme pain, making it very important for your veterinarian to remove them with the burr.With loose teeth, bacteria can travel beyond the gum line and cause facial abscesses. If your rabbit’s dental problems become this severe, your veterinarian would need to remove as much of the abscess as possible, along with extracting the affected teeth and maybe even removing part of your rabbit’s jaw.If your rabbit’s dental problems are due to physical trauma (e.g., tooth fracture, jaw damage), your veterinarian may have to do more extensive treatment.

, One of the most important aspects of at-home care is a proper diet—feed your rabbit fresh vegetables and plenty of fresh, high-quality hay. If he is unwilling or unable to eat his normal diet, you can feed him a critical care formula so he can still get all of his nutrients.Your veterinarian would be able to able to recommend a critical care formula.


If he can eat his normal food, you may need to cut the vegetables into small bits.
If your veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics or pain medication, administer them according to your veterinarian’s instructions.
Your rabbit may be a bit groggy or slow after surgery, but he should recover after a few days and start getting back to his normal routine. If your rabbit isn’t eating or seems lethargic, contact your veterinarian.

, Regular dental examinations are essential to your rabbit’s overall health.In fact, an annual dental examination is one of the best ways to prevent dental problems in your rabbit. Your veterinarian would be able to assess your rabbit’s dental health and, if necessary, recommend changes to his diet to keep his teeth healthy and worn down., Not only is hay an excellent nutrient source for your rabbit, but it also helps him keep his teeth worn down properly. Rabbits need to grind their teeth from side to side to keep them worn down, and hay promotes this horizontal grinding.Providing your rabbit with a constant supply of fresh, high-quality hay will help keep his teeth worn down after treatment and prevent further dental problems.


Hay has an abrasive texture that is necessary to wear down your rabbit’s teeth., Unlike hay, pellets and treats promote only up-and-down grinding.This will not wear down your rabbit’s teeth properly, which could lead to overgrown teeth. You do not need to eliminate pellets and treats completely from your rabbit’s diet, though. Simply reduce his intake of these foods and make sure he has plenty of hay on which he can grind his teeth.

, Since rabbits love to chew, your rabbit will probably appreciate having multiple chewing choices. Untreated wooden sticks, willow sticks, and wicker balls are good chewing choices for rabbits.Homemade toys such as empty toilet paper rolls, cardboard boxes, and old cotton towels are also ideal for your rabbit to chew on.Replace the items when they start to look worn or damaged.
Chew toys, although helpful for preventing dental problems, are not a substitute for veterinary treatment of dental disease."

Isolate your sick rabbit.",How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Rabbits1," Several types of bacteria cause respiratory infections in rabbits, including Pasteurella, Bordatella, and Staphylococcus. If your rabbit has a bacterial respiratory infection, your vet will prescribe an antibiotic. To choose the appropriate antibiotic, your vet will perform a diagnostic test using a fluid sample from your rabbit. This test will identify the bacterial ‘culprit’ and determine which antibiotic will work best against that bacteria.Whichever antibiotic your vet prescribes, it will very important for you to follow the treatment instructions carefully. Proper treatment will give your rabbit the best chance of getting better.
An upper respiratory infection (URI) is called ‘snuffles.’ It is most commonly caused by Pasteurella or Bordatella and causes runny eyes, a runny nose, and sneezing.Pneumonia affects the lower respiratory tract.;
, A tiny sneeze in a rabbit can progress to a major respiratory problem and possibly cause other health issues.If your rabbit has a URI, early and aggressive treatment will be needed to prevent the infection from spreading to the lungs and other parts of the body.


A URI caused by Pasteurella can be very difficult to treat, since the antibiotic may not kill all of the bacteria. Treatment may take as long as 6‒8 weeks.Pneumonia in rabbits can be fatal if left untreated.Prompt treatment for pneumonia is also recommended.

, Pneumonia can make a rabbit very sick. If your rabbit has severe pneumonia, your vet will want to hospitalize it for intensive treatment. In addition to medication, this treatment would include fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, and assisted feeding (if your rabbit is too weak to feed itself). Your vet may use a nebulizer to administer the oxygen and medication.A nebulizer is a device used to administer medicine directly into the lungs. It can also be used to clear the airways of excess mucus.You will be able to take your rabbit home once it is strong enough for at-home care.

, This is very important! Give your rabbit all of the antibiotic your vet prescribes, even when your rabbit starts getting better. If you stop the antibiotic treatment too early, not all of the bacteria will be killed. The remaining bacteria can build up antibiotic resistance, making it more difficult to kill them.Your vet will prescribe enough antibiotic for you to administer beyond the resolution of symptoms.
In addition to oral antibiotics, your vet may prescribe antibiotic nasal drops.Ask your vet to demonstrate how to give your rabbit the antibiotics.

, Pasteurella is a very contagious bacteria.If your rabbit’s respiratory infection is caused by Pasteurella, keep that rabbit away from your healthy rabbits until the infection has cleared. Place the sick rabbit in a cage that is clean, comfortable, and away from drafts and loud noises."

Be aware that a reduced appetite can be hard to notice at first—your rabbit may be sick for several days before you realize he’s eating less.Anorexia in rabbits can lead to serious medical problems, so do not delay in getting treatment for your rabbit if you notice he is not eating.


Your rabbit may be eating less because he is unable to eat, not because he doesn’t want to. For example, dental disease may make it difficult for your rabbit to chew his food properly.;
, A healthy rabbit produces two types of fecal pellets: a hard pellet made of indigestible fiber, and a soft pellet (‘cecotrope’). Rabbits eat the cecotropes for additional nutrients. For some digestive problems, such as gastrointestinal (GI) stasis, rabbits will produce fewer pellets, or none at all.Digestive problems due to a bacteria or virus can cause diarrhea. Inflammation of the intestine can produce mucus-covered pellets.Consider taking a picture of the feces so you can show your veterinarian what the feces look like.

, As with a decreased appetite, your rabbit’s demeanor and behavior may change when he has digestive upset. For example, he may become more lethargic and prefer to be left alone. Your rabbit may also lie awkwardly on his side or remain in a sitting position to decrease pressure on his belly.Your rabbit may develop a hunched posture and start grinding his teeth because of the abdominal pain.Your rabbit may even press his stomach against the floor because of the pain. This occurs if your rabbit has gas., If your rabbit will let you, gently touch his belly. His belly may feel like dough, which indicates gas buildup.Gas accumulation may also make the belly feel very hard.With some digestive problems, such as GI stasis, harmful bacteria can outnumber good bacteria in the gut. These harmful bacteria can release gas., The digestive system will make sounds (‘gut sounds’) as it is processing food and moving it along through the system. These sounds will be abnormal or completely absent if your rabbit has a digestive problem. For example, if your rabbit has gas, his belly will make gurgling noises.With GI stasis, gut sounds are abnormally frequent early on, then decrease or stop completely as the condition worsens., Digestive problems in rabbits can be life threatening. As soon as you suspect a digestive problem in your rabbit, take him to your veterinarian immediately. Your veterinarian will first perform a physical exam of your rabbit. They will then conduct diagnostic tests, depending on what they suspect is causing the digestive problem.


If your rabbit has diarrhea, your veterinarian will test the feces to identify the specific organism (e.g., Clostridium).Your veterinarian will take x-rays and/or perform an abdominal ultrasound if they suspect GI stasis or GI obstruction.
A GI obstruction can be a life-threatening situation requiring emergency treatment.Being able to visualize your rabbit’s belly will help your veterinarian diagnose and treat your rabbit effectively.

, Treating digestive problems in rabbits typically involves several general treatment strategies, including rehydration, restoring gut movement, and pain control.These treatments are best performed by a veterinarian, at least until the rabbit is well enough for at-home care.


Treatment options will vary slightly, depending on the specific digestive problem.

, Dehydration can cause digestive problems in rabbits, and be a symptom of these problems.To rehydrate your rabbit, your veterinarian will give him fluids.How your veterinarian administers the fluids (e.g., by mouth, under the skin, directly into a vein) will depend on several factors, such as your rabbit’s ability to drink on his own and the severity of the dehydration.


Rehydrating your rabbit will put more fluid in his digestive system, which will soften digestive contents and allow them to pass through the system more easily., If your rabbit’s digestive system isn’t moving food through very quickly, or at all, it will need some help getting back to normal. In addition to fluid therapy, your veterinarian may administer medications called prokinetics to encourage the gut to get moving again.Prokinetics are helpful in treating GI stasis, as well as diarrhea caused by overuse of antibiotics.If your rabbit has an obstruction, he should not receive a prokinetic.Prokinetics may take several weeks to restore your rabbit’s normal gut motility., Gas buildup (due to GI obstruction or GI stasis) and diarrhea can be very painful for your rabbit.If the pain is severe, your veterinarian will administer pain medication to get the pain under control as quickly as possible. When your rabbit is well enough to go home, your veterinarian may prescribe a pain medication for at-home care.

, A bad diet (low in indigestible fiber, high in sugar and carbohydrates) is a common cause of digestive problems in rabbits.Your veterinarian will first see if your rabbit can eat a healthy diet on his own. If he cannot, or will not, your veterinarian may try feeding him a high-fiber gruel, such as Oxbow Critical Care, through a syringe., Depending on the nature of the digestive problem, your rabbit may need more specific veterinary care. If your rabbit has gas, his temperature may fall below normal (100 degrees Fahrenheit/38 degrees Celsius), which could cause hypothermia. Your veterinarian will have several options to keep your rabbit warm, including placing him on a heating pad, surrounding him with warm water bottles or soda bottles, or simply holding him., Your veterinarian will administer a product that contains simethicone, an ingredient that relieves gas. Over-the-counter simethicone-containing products are available, but it would be best for your veterinarian to treat your rabbit.Tummy massages are also helping in relieving gas., If your rabbit has a hairball, your veterinarian will try different remedies to break it down. One remedy is fresh pineapple juice, which contains a digestive enzyme. Another remedy is papaya, which contains an enzyme that would break down the mucus holding the hairball together.Keep in mind that the obstructive hairball could cause gas to buildup. In this case, your veterinarian would treat both the gas and the hairball.

, Hairballs and overuse of antibiotics can disrupt the normal balance of good versus bad bacteria in your rabbit’s gut. If your veterinarian identifies more harmful bacteria than good bacteria, they will likely administer a probiotic to increase the level of good bacteria., Following in-hospital veterinary treatment, your rabbit will need at-home care to fully recover. Feeding him a healthy diet will help him recover. Examples of healthy foods are fresh timothy hay and leafy greens (e.g., kale, spinach). A healthy diet also includes plenty of fresh water.Do not give your rabbit dairy products or any treats that are high in sugar, honey, or seeds., A tummy massage is a soothing and effective treatment strategy. If your rabbit has a hairball, a massage can help loosen the hairball so it can pass through his system.A tummy massage can also stimulate gut movements., Physical activity can help improve your rabbit’s gut movements.If your rabbit is well enough to move around, encourage him walk around in his cage. For example, you could move his food a few feet away from him to so he can walk to his food. You could also move his toys a little further away from his sleeping area.

Allow your vet to correct your rabbit’s dental problem.,
Have your vet surgically remove an airway obstruction.,
Follow at-home care instructions after surgery.",How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Rabbits2," Surprisingly, dental problems can cause respiratory problems. When the bones in your rabbit’s mouth start breaking down, the tooth roots (located above the gum line) of the molars and/or incisors get pushed into the skull bones. These roots could block the tear ducts, causing runny eyes. The blocked tear ducts could also get plugged with mucus and bacteria.Dental problems typically occur in older rabbits.Treating the dental problem may be extensive. For example, your vet may need to remove the problem teeth.Treating dental problems in rabbits require surgery.
While your rabbit is anesthetized, your vet will also do a nasolacrimal flush.This technique will help clear out the plugged tear ducts.

, Sometimes, a foreign object will get stuck in rabbit’s upper airway, causing a chronic runny nose. A nasal tumor can also obstruct the upper airway. Your vet will use different imaging techniques (x-ray, endoscopy) to locate the obstruction, then perform surgery to remove it.If your vet finds a tumor in your rabbit’s lungs, surgical removal may not be possible.


Endoscopy involves using a long tube with a small camera on the end. Your vet would slide the tube through your rabbit’s nose to find the obstruction.

, After your vet has performed surgery, they will give you specific instructions to care for your rabbit at home. For example, you will give your rabbit antibiotics. Since your rabbit will probably have some pain after surgery, you will also need to give your rabbit pain medication.


Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can provide pain relief in rabbits. Examples of rabbit-safe NSAIDs are aspirin and carprofen.Follow all prescription instructions carefully.

Keep your rabbit’s housing clean.,
Lower your rabbit’s stress.,
Isolate new rabbits.",How to Treat Respiratory Problems in Rabbits3," A clean cage is essential to preventing respiratory problems in rabbits. Each day, you should remove any leftover food, refill the water bottle with fresh water, and remove soiled bedding. Once a week, thoroughly clean the food dish and water bottle with hot, soapy water and sweep around your rabbit’s cage.Once or twice a month, do a deep clean of your rabbit’s cage. After removing everything from the cage, use a mixture of vinegar and water to clean the cage inside and out. Allow the cage to dry completely before putting items back into the cage., Stress can weaken your rabbit’s immune system, making a respiratory infection more likely. Stressors for rabbits include dirty housing and overcrowding.Keeping your rabbit’s cage clean and ensuring that it is large enough for all of your rabbits will help reduce your rabbit’s stress. If the cage is too small, consider purchasing an additional cage so each rabbit will have enough space to play, sleep, and eat.


Your rabbit may also become stressed because of boredom. Giving your rabbit lots of interesting toys to play with will keep it busy and lower its stress.
Examples of good rabbit toys are shredded newspaper and cardboard boxes with holes cut out.Switch out the toys frequently so your rabbit does not get bored with the same toys., If you bring a new rabbit home, isolate it for 2 weeks.Since respiratory infections in rabbits can be very contagious, you would not want the new rabbit infecting your other rabbits or pets. During the 2-week isolation period, monitor the new rabbit for signs of respiratory disease (e.g., runny eyes, runny nose, difficulty breathing).


If the new rabbit looks sick, take it your vet for treatment.

Look for hair loss under the rabbit's eyes.
,
Check for a layer of crust around the eyes.,
Look for droopy or saggy eyes.,Watch for excessive tear formation and fluid running down the cheeks.,
See if your rabbit rubs its eyes with its front paws.,
Think of a possible cause.",How to Tell if Your Rabbit Has Weepy Eye1,", This can also be a sign of weepy eye. It may be hard to tell if you have more than one rabbit living together, because rabbits groom each other. If you separate the rabbits for a short time, this may be easier noticeable., This can be caused by a few things - wrinkles that come with old age, sleep deprivation, or weepy eye. Use process of elimination to find the cause.,, This behavior is a response to discomfort (though it only irritates the eyes further)., If you can figure out what caused your rabbit's weepy eye, you might be able to help the vet (or yourself) in treating it. Weepy eye is caused by a blocked tear duct and/or inflammation of the eyelid, which might be caused by any of the following:

Cellular/bacterial debris clogging the tear duct
Osteoporosis making a tooth root intrude into the skull
Infection in a tooth root or middle/inner ear
Dust, sprays, or fumes

"
"
See the vet.,
Try a commercial eye washing product to remove dust, dirt, and foreign objects.,
Minimize sources of irritation.",How to Tell if Your Rabbit Has Weepy Eye2," The vet can officially identify weepy eye and prescribe medication, like ophthalmic antibiotic ointment., This can help relieve the illness., Dust and dirt can cause weepy eye, so keep them to a minimum. You may also breed to remove chronically affected rabbits."
"
Change damp bedding.,
Install appropriate flooring in your rabbit’s living quarters.,
Avoid placing your rabbit in cramped quarters.",How to Prevent Sore Hocks in Rabbits1," Damp unchanged bedding can cause sore hocks. If the bedding is not spot cleaned daily, then the rabbit risks sitting in bedding soiled with her own urine. The dampness and acidity of the urine damages the surface of the skin, weakening it and making it prone to infection.


It is important to observe scrupulous hygiene in the rabbit's living quarters. This means scooping out soiled bedding daily and replacing it with fresh. In addition, completely clean and replace the bed on a weekly basis.
Provide adequate deep bedding, such as three to four inches of straw, so that dampness can wick downward away from the rabbit's paws.;
, Flooring is one of the main reasons rabbit’s develop sore hocks. A wild rabbit hops around on soil, which is quite a forgiving surface. You need to make sure your bunny walks around on a comfortable, forgiving surface, too. Consider putting wool rugs down to provide a padded surface that is more forgiving on the rabbit's lower limbs.Wire-mesh flooring is inappropriate for rabbits since the mesh has a cheese-grater effect on the paws. Wire-mesh floors leads to abrasions and damage to the skin. #*Unfortunately, surfaces in the home such as laminate floor or nylon carpets can also be problematic. They are too hard, in the case of laminate, or can cause friction burns, like with nylon carpet.

, In the wild, rabbits forage and are constantly moving from spot to spot. If the rabbit is confined in a hutch for long periods of time, especially if those quarters are cramped, they are liable to develop pressure sores on the feet from not being able to move around. Make sure your rabbit has plenty of space to move around.Furnish the space your rabbit roams around in such a way as to encourage the rabbit to move around. For example, put food and water at opposite ends of the run and the shelter in another place.
Provide toys that encourage the rabbit to move and play. Simple things like a cardboard tube stuffed with good quality hay can go a long way to encourage your rabbit to move around and keep the hocks healthy.

"

Keep your rabbit at a healthy weight.,
Keep your rabbit’s claws shorter.,
Treat any mobility problems.",How to Prevent Sore Hocks in Rabbits2," The more weight the rabbit carries on her body, the more weight she has pressing down on her feet. Sore hocks are rare in wild rabbits, as are obese rabbits. Take care not to overfeed your rabbit and to keep her lean.


The perfect food for rabbits is grass or a good quality green hay. Feed your rabbit hay as the majority of your rabbit's food.
Only give a spoonful of pellets as an extra treat. Be aware that pellets are very calorie heavy, and feeding them as meals instead of treats makes it more likely your rabbit will overeat and become obese.
If your rabbit is already too heavy, start a gradual change over from pellets to hay. Don't make any sudden changes since this could cause your rabbit to starve themself, which can cause health problems.

, Long claws can lead to sore hocks. If the claws of the back legs grow too long and the rabbit then walks on a hard surface, the claws have the effect of raising the toes and lowering the hocks. This then forces more pressure onto the hocks, increasing the abrasive forces and creating sore hocks.This problem is easily sorted by regularly trimming your rabbit's nails. If you do not feel confident doing this, then a groomer or your vet can do this for a small fee. They can also show you what to do.

, Rabbits who don’t move often can get sore hocks. For example, rabbits with arthritis or with other muscular or skeletal problems may be in pain when they move, which makes them more likely to stay in one spot. This kind of behavior can predispose the bunny to sore hocks.If arthritis is the problem, speak to your vet about prescribing a painkilling medication that is safe for rabbits, in order to ease your pet's discomfort and encourage them to move around.

Check for missing fur on the feet.,
Look for sores on the foot.,
Check for signs of infection.",How to Prevent Sore Hocks in Rabbits3," To check if your rabbit has sore hocks, gently hold your bunny on her back so you can see the underside of her back legs. The condition affects the skin on the underside of the hock joint and along the foot. In the early stages all you may see is a lack of fur on the underside of the foot.Due to this lack of fur, the skin may start to thicken into places that look like a callus.

, Another symptom of sore hocks is sore or other irritated places on the feet. If this early stage goes unrecognized, continued pressure on the lower limb wears through the skin and pressure sores develop.


These sores look red and angry at first with the skin surface missing.

, If the missing fur or the sores on the feet go unnoticed, the sores can become infected. This means the sores will develop a sticky discharge or a scab that forms on the lower foot.The very worst cases can have a smelly, purulent infection. When the pus is cleaned away, the skin is lost down to the bone and the subcutaneous structures are exposed.

Pay attention for warning signs.,
Call the vet if you sense a problem.,
Feed your rabbit carefully.,
Shower your rabbit with extra attention.",How to Look After a Rabbit That Needs Its Teeth Trimmed1," Like most other prey animals that are hunted in the wild, rabbits are good at concealing pain and injury (so as to not attract predators).Sometimes it is obvious to the eye that a rabbit has teeth that are too long, but more often you will need to watch carefully for signs of trouble. A mouth infection or even just 24 hours without eating can be potentially fatal to a rabbit.A rabbit with teeth that are too long will have to change its eating habits. It may stop eating a favorite food, have trouble chewing and swallowing, show changes in feces production, or simply not eat anymore.
Overly-long teeth frequently cause mouth pain. Watch closely for your rabbit pawing at its mouth, which is a common indicator of pain.
Long teeth cause more cuts and scrapes in the mouth, and are harder to keep clean because of the crowding and irregular shapes. All of these can lead to infections. Keep an eye out for mouth swelling, excessive drooling (especially if bloody), and a new foul mouth odor.;
, If you suspect that your rabbit has long teeth that are causing problems, do not hesitate to call your veterinarian. Even one day can be too long to wait when dealing with a rabbit infection or lack of eating.The vet can give your rabbit’s mouth a thorough examination, likely under anesthesia. Depending on what he or she finds, treatments can range from cleanings to tooth-trimmings (by cutting or filing) to tooth removal in severe cases.

, First and foremost, follow the veterinarian’s advice when your rabbit has trouble feeding due to elongated teeth. Generally speaking, though, the feeding advice will probably be similar both before and after action is taken to repair (or remove) the teeth.When your rabbit has trouble feeding, expect to use a food processor and feeding syringe. Ask your vet’s advice, but consider the following recipe:

Blend together feeding pellets and water into a smoothie-like consistency. You may want to add some cooked oatmeal to help make it smoother. You can also add some banana or papaya to enhance the flavor. Feed small amounts regularly by placing the feeding syringe carefully into the rabbit’s mouth and dispensing the mixture slowly.


Make sure the rabbit is still drinking plenty of water. This ability should be unaffected by tooth troubles, but your bunny may be lethargic or disinterested. Make fresh water readily available at all times.

, Rabbits are not known for their ability to handle stress — some have been known to drop dead simply from being startled. Mouth pain and/or an inability to eat properly can certainly be a traumatic experience, so be sure to show your love and concern for your furry friend.Make yourself available for extra nuzzling, cuddling, etc., but also follow the rabbit’s lead. Some may be more eager for such contact when stressed, while others may experience additional stress from increased contact.
Check up on your rabbit more often than normal, and do so in a calm, reassuring manner. Rabbits seem to be good at sensing anxiety in other animals, so try not to show any.

"
"
Feed your rabbit fiber.,
Check its teeth weekly.,
Rely on a professional if you need help.,
Visit the vet annually at least.",How to Look After a Rabbit That Needs Its Teeth Trimmed2," Even with domesticated rabbits who lack the benefits of a “wild” diet, most cases of overgrown teeth can be prevented when the proper foods are offered. Food pellets are convenient and have their benefits, but they should not normally be the majority of your rabbit’s diet.Rabbits need heavy fiber to continually wear down their always-growing teeth. In the wild, grasses, leaves, and twigs do the trick. For a pet, make sure that you offer a constant supply of fresh hay, which can be found at pet supply stores and elsewhere.
Try to mix up the hay varieties if possible. The differing textures and flavors will produce different chewing motions and tooth wear.
As according to your vet’s advice, offer twigs for your rabbit to chew on as well. Beware that many types of twigs can be poisonous to rabbits, however. Stick to options like orange, lemon, apple, and willow (fresh or dried); maple, ash, and pine (dried only); and de-thorned rose canes. Make sure they have not been treated with pesticides. You can also freeze the twigs overnight in order to kill off any undesirable insects.
Wooden chew blocks can help with overgrown front teeth, but will be less useful if your rabbit’s back teeth are too long as well.

, No, examining the small mouth of a naturally jumpy animal, while navigating the flaps of skin that conceal the mouth and the sharp teeth inside it, is not the easiest thing to do. But it is of vital importance to your rabbit’s health.Check for overgrown teeth, cuts or wounds, and signs of infection once a week at least.
Giving a rabbit a thorough mouth examination can be an involved process. Consult your vet or the step-by-step instructions at http://www.rabbit.org/journal/3-9/oral-health.html for assistance.

, If you are unable or unwilling to put in the effort needed to make thorough examinations of your rabbit’s mouth, or if your rabbit simply will not permit it, do not ignore this responsibility. Make sure your rabbit’s teeth and mouth are checked regularly.


Visiting the vet more often may be your best option, but you might also consider a pet groomer who has experience dealing with rabbits.

, Even if you are doing thorough mouth examinations, it is important that a veterinarian examine your rabbit on a regular schedule. Remember, preventing rabbit tooth troubles before they occur is always the best option.No matter how good a job you do checking your rabbit’s teeth, the vet has the tools and experience to do it better. Your bunny may need to be sedated, and x-rays may be required to get a complete picture.
If problem teeth are caught in early stages, the vet can use special tools to clip or grind them down, again with the benefit of anesthesia if necessary.
Some people may want to try to trim their rabbits’ teeth on their own, but it is better to rely on a professional. It is very easy to break off a tooth, which can cause infection, among other problems.

Watch for signs of distress or illness in your rabbit.",How to Raise a Healthy Bunny," Hay forms the foundation of a rabbit's diet. Not only is this important for nutrients, but fiber as well. Since rabbits clean themselves, they often swallow a lot of hair. Without adequate fiber, these hairballs can block the GI tract and can be fatal. Chewing hay also keeps the rabbit's teeth at a healthy length by wearing them down and preventing them from overgrowing.Feed your rabbit grass-based hays like timothy, oat, or wheat. Other hays like alfalfa may be too rich in calcium or protein for your rabbit to handle. To choose a good quality hay, look for a tinge of green and a sweet smell. Poor quality hay is completely yellow and may smell musty. Do not feed your rabbit a poor quality hay.If you cannot find a good hay at a local pet store, there are mail order companies that can ship you the right hay.Rabbits can be fed hay from birth.;
, Like with most animals, water is essential for health and well-being. Without adequate water, a rabbit can become dehydrated, go into organ failure, and die. Your rabbit should have fresh drinking water at all times.A water bottle or ceramic/stainless steel bowl are sufficient to give your rabbit water. Keep in mind that your rabbit my drink more from a bowl than a bottle, which is good for the rabbit's health. You can start with both to see what your rabbit prefers.
Whatever method of providing water you choose, be sure to use lead-free products.
Replace old water with clean water every day.
Also be sure to clean water bottles and bowls with hot water and soap daily to prevent bacteria growth. Rinse these thoroughly to make sure all soap residue is washed away.

, The best vegetables for your rabbit are romaine lettuce, broccoli, carrots, cilantro, spinach, and celery.Make sure any vegetables you feed to your rabbit are fresh. Vegetables even a few days old can make your rabbit sick.
Serve vegetables wet to increase your rabbit's fluid intake and help the food flow more easily through the GI tract.
Switch up the vegetables you give your rabbit every day. Some rabbits, when fed only one type of vegetable, can develop sludge in the bladder which may then form into bladder stones. A typical example is carrots which are high in oxalate. Feeding carrots every day can predispose a rabbit to bladder problems. To avoid this, never give the same food two days in a row. If your rabbit eats carrot one day, offer broccoli next so you're constantly mixing things up.

, Fruits should be considered a treat and should not form the base of your rabbit's diet. Generally you should limit fruit servings to no more than two tablespoons per day.All fruits are considered safe for feeding to rabbits, as long as they are in controlled quantities.
Mix up your rabbit's fruit intake daily, the same as you would with vegetables.

, Commercial rabbit pellets are generally not considered essential for a rabbit's diet- they don't provide the fiber or the tooth exercise that hay provides. They are also high in calories and can cause obesity if your rabbit eats too much of them. In limited quantities, however, pellets can provide vitamins and minerals that your rabbit needs.Remember that pellets should only be a supplement to other foods, and not form the foundation of your rabbit's diet.
Pick pellets that are timothy-based rather than alfalfa-based. Alfalfa pellets tend to be higher in calories and can cause obesity.
Pellets come in two forms: muesli and extruded. Muesli types have individual nutrients in each pellet, while extruded types have all nutrients mixed into each pellet. Use extruded types to give your rabbit all the essential nutrients he requires. With muesli types, your rabbit may pick out tasty pellets and neglect others, leading to deficiencies.Talk to your vet for the ideal portion size for your rabbit. Some recommended servings for adult rabbits are as low as 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) daily.If your rabbit starts neglecting his hay, cut back on pellets. A lack of fiber from hay can cause a fatal blockage in your rabbit's GI tract, so you'll want to make sure it is the primary food in the rabbit's diet.

, Rabbits have sensitive digestive systems and you shouldn't feed them anything unfamiliar. Specifically avoid nuts, seeds, corn, or any dessert foods like chocolate. Your rabbit won't be able to digest these foods and consumption of these could be fatal.Also avoid any gourmet rabbit treats. These can be harmful.
Always check with your vet before feeding something new to your rabbit.

, There are unique advantages and drawbacks to each, so weigh each option before making a final decision.If you will house your rabbit outdoors, make sure he has a secure living space that will protect him from predators and the elements. Even urban areas have threats like raccoons and cats that can harm or kill your rabbit, so you'll need to make sure he is protected. Also be sure to provide your rabbit with plenty of company and social interaction. It would also be helpful to give your rabbit an outdoor pen to play in during the day.
If your rabbit will be an indoor pet, remember that rabbits like to chew. You'll need to sufficiently protect your furniture and valuables from getting damaged. He will also need daily exposure to sunlight to help with vitamin D production, so bring him outside regularly to ensure he stays healthy.

, Will your rabbit be allowed to roam the whole house, or is there a specific room you want to keep him in?


Your rabbit will need several hours of exercise outside his cage every day. When choosing an area, remember that he needs enough room to explore and roam to make sure he gets enough exercise. At the minimum a full room should do.Keep in mind that the bigger area you allow your rabbit to roam in, the more bunny-proofing you'll have to do.

, Rabbits love to chew, which can not only damage your home and furniture, but can be fatal for your rabbit. You need to remove or protect certain items within the rabbit's area.Either remove electrical wires from the rabbit's reach or wrap them to prevent your rabbit from chewing through them. To wrap them, get plastic tubes from the hardware store. Using scissors or a utility knife, carefully cut the tube lengthwise and push the wire inside.Cover open outlets with child-proof plugs.
Remove any plants from the area. Rabbits have sensitive digestive systems and eating unfamiliar plants can make them sick.
Continue supervising your rabbit if he is roaming the house. Even if you think you've taken everything out of his reach, rabbits can easily sneak through small openings and reach areas they aren't supposed to. This is especially true for younger rabbits.
Rabbits are generally fine around other house pets like dogs and cats, so long as they are well-mannered. Puppies especially should be well-trained before you let them interact with your rabbit, as they may hurt him trying to play., Your rabbit will need a place to sleep, eat, drink, and rest. Choosing the right cage is very important for keeping your rabbit healthy and happy.As a general rule, your rabbit should be able to stretch out fully and stand on his hind legs without hitting the top of the cage. For a more concrete measurement, the minimum recommended size is 24"" x 36"" x 24"".
Choose a cage without a wire floor. These can hurt the rabbit's feet. Instead look for a solid plastic bottom.
If you can only find a wire-bottom cage, lay a piece of wood or plastic on it to make sure your rabbit stays comfortable.
You can also substitute a dog or cat cage for a specialized rabbit cage, so long as it is big enough.
Include a small rug or mat and some hay for your rabbit to lay on.If your rabbit goes back into his cage, let him stay there and don't force him out. Rabbits often use their cages as a safe area where they can rest and relax.
Make sure the rabbit has a place to hide within the cage. Rabbits are burrowing animals and need the security of a small dark space. A simple shoe box will do as a hide, but be prepared to replace it regularly because he will probably chew on it.

, Like cats, rabbits can be trained to use a litter box.First see which corner of the cage your rabbit chooses as his bathroom. Then place a litter box there.
When he consistently uses the litter box in his cage, you can allow him to roam more outside his cage. Place more litter boxes around his area to encourage him to use them.
Always use positive reinforcement when house-training your rabbit, never punishments. Rewards include things like offering your rabbit's favorite treat. If the rabbit is well-socialized and loves people, reward him with praise or being groomed.
Avoid using clumping litters, as your rabbit may eat clumps and cause an intestinal blockage. Use litters made from wood pulp, paper, or citrus. You could also use newspaper as an alternative, though this may not be as absorbent., Go to your vet and have your rabbit fixed. There are a number of health benefits to spaying or neutering your rabbit regardless of its gender.Fixed rabbits are less likely to leave litter around the house because fixing reduces the urge to mark territory.
Your rabbit will be much less aggressive.
Rabbits' reproductive organs are susceptible to cancer as they age. Removing these eliminates this risk.
Skip this step if you intend to breed your rabbits. This is safe as long as you have enough space for multiple rabbits and are well-educated on safe breeding methods.If this is the case, be sure to visit the vet regularly to check for problems with your rabbit's reproductive health.

, Rabbits naturally chew, so giving them toys ensures that its not your furniture that gets chewed up. You don't need expensive rabbit toys- pieces of cardboard, paper towel rolls, and untreated, chemical-free wood will keep your bunny amused and entertained.Avoid rubber toys. If a rabbit swallows a piece of rubber it could block the GI tract., Rabbits are active creatures and love to play. There are some great games you can play with your rabbit to amuse the two of you and keep him in good shape.Set up some small toy bowling pins and let your rabbit go knock them over. Active bunnies will love this game.
Some bunnies like to flick toys around and have you return them, like a reverse game of fetch.
Build an obstacle course for your rabbit. Rabbits love to explore, so appeal to this tendency with an obstacle course. Make sure to use materials like newspaper or cardboard so your rabbit won't get hurt.Always allow your bunny to rest if he wants to. When he's losing interest in a game, don't force him to continue.

, Rabbits have fragile bones that can easily break if they are handled roughly. You should always be gentle with your rabbit to prevent harm.If your rabbit struggles when you try to pick him up, don't force it. Struggling rabbits can break their own bones or pull muscles, and you can also drop him as he struggles. Leave your rabbit alone if he doesn't want to be picked up.
Introduce him to being picked up slowly. Rabbits are ground-dwelling animals and get easily spooked by going high into the air. Get him used to being stroked first. As he becomes more used to human company, try raising his front feet an inch off the ground. Then stay sitting when you pick him up for the first few times and hold him in your lap. Finally, advance to picking him up and standing.
To properly pick up your rabbit, place one hand under his chest and one under his backside. For more details on picking up your rabbit safely, see Pick up a Rabbit.
If you are worried the rabbit may scratch you, use a towel to pick him up. You could accidentally drop him if you get scratched.
Make sure all pets are properly trained before they interact with the rabbit.
Make sure all young children in the house know the rules when playing with the rabbit. Supervise them while they interact with the rabbit and stop them if they do anything that could harm him.

, Rabbits are hairy creatures that like to clean themselves. Unfortunately, ingesting too much hair can cause a serious intestinal blockage. You'll have to groom your rabbit regularly to prevent this.Brush your rabbit at least once a week. Using a fine-toothed comb, like a flea comb, thoroughly brush your rabbit. This will remove loose hair that your rabbit might otherwise swallow while grooming himself.
Rabbits are typically sensitive to water, and can easily get hypothermia or fall into shock if submerged. If necessary you can spot clean your rabbit with a damp towel, but never submerge him. For more details on cleaning and grooming your rabbit safely, see Bathe Your Pet Rabbit.
Clip your rabbit's nails every few weeks. Look at your rabbit's nails and find where the blood vessel inside it ends. This should be visible even if your rabbit has dark-colored nails. Using a nail clipper, clip right after the blood vessel ends. If you're afraid of hurting your rabbit, the vet can do this during checkups.
If you see dry or flaky skin while brushing your rabbit, contact your vet. This could be a sign of mites or fleas.

, Like all pets, your rabbit requires regular medical care to stay healthy. Stick with annual checkups and don't hesitate to schedule an appointment if you think something might be wrong with your rabbit.


Look for a vet who has experience with rabbits. These are sometimes considered exotic veterinarians who specialize in non-traditional pets., Since rabbits are sensitive creatures, they are susceptible to a number of ailments that range from minor to fatal. If you notice any of the following symptoms, contact your vet immediately.Sudden loss of appetite paired with abdominal gurgling.
Labored breathing.
A head tilt.
Incontinence.
Lumps or abscesses anywhere on your rabbit's body.

Let your rabbit feed freely on hay.,

Make sure your rabbit gets enough sunlight.,
Make sure your rabbit is chewing as much as normal, which should be a lot.,
Look for symptoms of dental problems.,
Look at your rabbit's teeth.,
Seek urgent veterinary attention for a rabbit with dental problems.",How to Prevent Dental Problems in Rabbits," Wild living rabbits dining on a natural diet of grasses and fibrous vegetation do not develop dental disease.Pet rabbits that eat a commercial mix with little or no vegetables or hay are at high risk of dental disease.


Key to preventing dental problems is to feed a diet that better represents what wild rabbits eat.The ideal foods are fresh growing grass and good quality hay.
It is difficult to provide fresh grass to indoor rabbits, so the closest substitute is good quality hay. This is hay that has been slow dried in sunlight, and retains some green color, as well as some of the flat-bladed structure of the leaves. It should smell sweet, like a summer meadow, when you open the pack.;
, This is in contrast to poor quality hay with is dull looking, and a yellow, straw like color. Worse, some rabbit owners feed their rabbits hay that is a dull brown grey, and smells musty and dusty when you open the pack. Unfortunately, poor quality hay is low in vital nutrients, such as calcium, and good for little other than bedding.

, Good quality hay should be provided at all times. There should always be plenty available for the rabbit to eat.

, In addition to hay, feed your rabbit a variety of fresh vegetables, weeds and wild plants, as these are high in calcium. Ideal fibrous weeds include dandelions, brambles, and tree leaves.


A selection of fresh vegetable should be offered daily. Ideally, rotate what you give the rabbit and avoid giving the same vegetable every day for several days, as this could overload the system with certain minerals. The simple act of varying what you give prevents this.

, Commercial diets have a limited place on the menu, especially when it comes to teeth. If you feed your rabbit pellets then the rabbit can eat its daily calorie allowance with minimal chewing. This doesn't grind the teeth down but they keep growing. The result it overlong teeth and spurs.


If you offer a commercial food, only give a small amount per rabbit per day.
Also, choose extruded foods (where all the kibble look identical), rather than a muesli mix. The problem with muesli mix is the rabbits selectively eat the tastier parts, which are also the least nutritious elements with the lowest calcium content. This can lead to weak bones and unhealthy teeth.

, Sunshine is vital for vitamin D synthesis, which in turn is required to convert calcium into healthy teeth and bones. Experts believe there is a link between a lack of exposure to sunlight and dental disease.In an ideal world, the rabbit would be given some time to graze on fresh grass outdoors every day, hence fulfilling both needs for fiber and sunshine.

, To keep its teeth in good shape, a rabbit needs to chew for around 70% of the time they are awake. Problems start if the rabbit doesn't do enough chewing. If the teeth are growing faster than they are being worn down, then the teeth become overlong.This is perfect to balance the rate of tooth growth to the grinding down of teeth. Rabbit teeth are 'open rooted,' which means they grow continuously throughout the rabbit's lifetime. Constantly chewing wears the teeth down. If the teeth were closed rooted (like human teeth) within a few years the rabbit would wear their teeth down to useless pegs and starve as a result. Nature's answer is to have the teeth grow all the time and replace the dentine that was worn away by chewing.
Wild rabbits eat herbage that is extremely high in fiber and in order to get the maximum benefit out of a low nutrition food it needs to be grind it up a lot in the mouth before being swallowed. This allows the damaged cell of the herbage to be exposed to the digestive juices to get the maximum benefit.

, If your rabbit has slowed down its chewing, look for secondary symptoms. You should be suspicious that your rabbit has dental problems if you notice the following:A Wet Chin: Dribbling or drooling is due to the pain associated with moving the tongue to swallow. The rabbit finds it easier to dribble than to swallow.
Weight Loss: Dental problems always need to be considered for any rabbit that is losing weight. If the teeth are painful, the rabbit will be reluctant to chew and decreased eating leads to weight loss.
Messy Eating: If the rabbit starts becoming a messy eater, scattering food, or leaving partially chewed food on the floor, this can be a sign of dental discomfort.
Sticky Eyes: While it might seem strange, a thick, white discharge from the eyes is a common sign of dental problems. This is because the overgrown roots of the teeth in the top of the mouth can compress the tear ducts and prevent tears from draining from the eye in a normal manner.
Lack of Grooming: A rabbit with a sore mouth is less likely to groom, thus its coat will become dull and unkempt.
Jaw or Cheek Abscesses: Overlong tooth roots commonly become infected, which results in abscesses breaking out at the surface.

, Rabbit teeth can get overgrown in several ways. These include:Overgrown Incisors: These are the gnawing teeth at the front of the mouth. These can become overlong and curl around, interfering with the rabbit being able to eat. In extreme cases the teeth can grow around and dig into the lips.
Overgrown Molars: These are the cheek teeth that you are unable to see routinely because they are the back of the rabbit's mouth. If the molars grow too long they can interfere with the rabbit's ability to fully close its mouth.
Molars with Spurs: Uneven wear on the cheek teeth leads to the development of sharp spikes, or spurs, on the edges of the teeth. These can dig into the cheek or tongue and causes bleeding. In extreme cases the spurs can be so long they grow over the tongue and stop it from moving.
Overlong Roots: The roots of teeth also grow, which can result in the roots pushing downward through the jawbone, causing painful dental abscesses. Alternatively, the upper roots can grow upward and compress other structures in the head, such as the tear ducts.

, Problems that exist need professional remedial action, as they won't just go away on their own. This includes pain relief and procedures under anesthetic to remove sharp spikes and overlong incisors. In addition, where appropriate, the veterinarian will shorten overlong teeth.


Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to do anything about overlong roots because they are enclosed within the skull. It is also extremely difficult to remove molars because of poor access to the back of the mouth. This is one reason why dental issues in the rabbit can carry such a poor outlook in the long term. By far the more preferable option is to prevent the problems happening in the first place.

Give your rabbit something to explore.,
Create an obstacle course for your rabbit.,
Provide your rabbit with plenty of toys.,

Determine your rabbit’s ideal weight.,
Weigh your rabbit.,
Examine your rabbit’s body condition.",How to Keep Your Rabbit Slim," Daily exercise is essential to keeping your rabbit slim. Your rabbit should have about 2 hours of exercise outside of his cage each day (less if you keep him in a large, spacious cage). If you exercise him indoors, ‘bunny proof’ the area—remove any electrical cables, houseplants, or other hazards your rabbit could chew on. For an outdoor exercise area, block any potential escape routes, and keep your rabbit away from areas with pesticides or fertilizers.Place your rabbit in a large exercise pen outside so he will be safe from predators.;
, Fortunately, there are many ways to keep your rabbit physically active. For example, rabbits love to dig, so give your rabbit a chance to burrow into something. Fill a sturdy, relatively shallow box with dirt or sand. Make sure the dirt or sand is not so deep that your rabbit cannot climb out. Keep a close watch on your rabbit as he digs in the box.If you do not have cardboard boxes at home, you can purchase some at a home improvement store.

, Rabbits also enjoy running, so allow your rabbit to chase you. Give him something to chase, such as a towel or a favorite toy that is attached to a plastic wand. It is important that he chases you —if you chase him, he will think you’re a predator., Rabbits have a strong sense of curiosity. Foster this curiosity by giving him something new to investigate. If you are playing with your rabbit inside, rearrange the furniture in the play area. Also, consider hiding tasty food slices throughout the area so he can use his nose to sniff around and find the food., Whether you play with your rabbit inside or outside, make an obstacle course out of various household items (e.g., cardboard boxes and different pieces of furniture). Place these items throughout the play area for him to run around. On the boxes, remove the flaps and cut out large holes to give your rabbit something to run through.Consider placing a treat at the end of course so he can reward himself at the end.
Make yourself a part of the obstacle course by temporarily blocking your rabbit’s forward movement and making him run around you.

, Toys are an important component of your rabbit’s daily exercise needs. There are many toy options for rabbits, including unfinished wood chew toys, rope toys, and unfinished wicker baskets and tunnels. Keep in mind that not all rabbits like the same kinds of toys, so you may go through some trial and error to figure out what your rabbit likes to play with. Whichever toys you choose, make sure they do not contain any small parts your rabbit could swallow.Choose toys that encourage pushing or tossing.Look for small toys made of sisal or cane that your rabbit could easily toss around with his mouth (but not swallow).Also, your rabbit could push plastic bowling pins with his nose.
You can also make your own toys for your rabbit. Empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls make excellent toys: stuff the empty tubes with hay or grass, or cut the tubes into rings. Old bath towels are also good toys.Rotate the toys out frequently to keep your rabbit interested in what he’s playing with.

, Let your rabbit have fun with interior designing! Build him a cardboard castle by taking a large cardboard box and cutting a few openings in it through which your rabbit could easily fit. When your rabbit goes inside the box, he can have fun chewing the box and creating new openings.Consider adding ramps and tunnels in the castle to give your rabbit something to encourage jumping.Remodeling is another way to satisfy your rabbit’s natural tendency to chew.

, Feeding your rabbit unlimited amounts of high-quality hay is one of the best dietary ways to keep him slim. Not only does hay satisfy your rabbit’s urge to graze and chew, it also is low in calories. Not all types of hay are good for your rabbit, though—wheat and oat hays may contain high-calorie seed heads.Meadow hay is good for rabbits.Timothy and mixed grass hay are also good choices. Alfalfa hay is not a good choice for adult rabbits, since it is high in minerals and proteins and can cause health problems., Fresh vegetables can also help keep your rabbit slim and trim. There are many vegetables you can feed your rabbit, including broccoli, collard greens, green peppers, and mustard greens.Do not feed your rabbit starchy, calorie-rich vegetables (e.g., peas, corn, potatoes).Rinse the vegetables thoroughly to remove the pesticides.
Per day, feed your rabbit about 1 cup of green vegetables per 2 pounds of his body weight.For example, if your rabbit weighs 8 pounds, feed him 4 cups of vegetables per day.

, In general, pet rabbits do not need to eat pellets. They are typically high in calories and low in fiber. Those extra calories can lead to obesity, which is an extremely common problem in pet rabbits.If you have already made pellets a part of your rabbit’s diet, make sure the pellets are plain (e.g., no seeds, nuts, extra coloring), high in fiber, and low in protein.Your rabbit’s daily pellet portion depends on his weight. For example, a 7 to 10 pound rabbit should eat 0.5 to 0.75 cups of pellets per day. Measure the amount with a dry measuring cup., Your rabbit would probably love to eat sweet treats to his heart’s content. However, those treats contain extra calories and sugar that would make it hard to keep him slim. Rather than completely depriving your rabbit of treats, feed him occasional healthy treats, such as slices of flavorful fruits and vegetables. Avoid sticky treats (e.g., raisins) that can cause cavities, as well as starchy treats (e.g., oatmeal, crackers).Examples of fruit treats are papaya, cherries, peaches, and berries., An important part of keeping your rabbit slim is knowing his ideal weight. Knowing the average weight of your rabbit’s breed is a good starting point. However, you should take your rabbit to your veterinarian so he or she can determine a good weight for your individual rabbit.Weight ranges for specific breeds can be wide. In addition, pet rabbits can sometimes be mixes of different breeds. For these reasons, using the average weight of a particular breed is not the most accurate way to determine how much your individual rabbit should weigh., Use a scale to weigh your rabbit at home. If he will not sit still on the scale, weigh his carrier on the scale, then put him in the carrier. Subtract the weight of the carrier from the weight of your rabbit plus the carrier.For example, if the carrier weighs 2 pounds, and putting your rabbit in the carrier takes the weight up to 10 pounds, then your rabbit weighs 8 pounds.


Monitor your rabbit’s weight regularly (preferably a few times a month). Compare his current weight to his normal weight to see if he has gained weight., Looking at your rabbit’s body as a whole is a helpful way of determining if he is slim or overweight. A slim rabbit should have a curve from neck to tail and hip to hip. If you have a female rabbit, her dewlap (fold of fur below the chin) should feel like a fold of skin, rather than a roll of fat, when pinched. From the top looking down, a slim rabbit should have a visible waist.When you touch your rabbit, you should be able to easily feel his spine and hips, but their edges should not feel sharp. Rather, the edges should feel round, indicating a sufficient, but not excessive, fat covering.An overweight body condition consists of a fatty dewlap for female rabbits, the presence of a dewlap for male rabbits (male rabbits shouldn’t have a dewlap), and fatty pads around the shoulders, legs, and genital area.Be aware that rabbits have a lot of fur, which can make it difficult to determine body condition.
If you are unsure about your rabbit’s body condition, ask your veterinarian how to do a proper body condition examination.

Play tag.,
Hold treats out for your rabbit to reach.,
Play fetch.,
Hide food.,
Create a digging box.,
Train your rabbit to follow commands.,
Walk your rabbit on a leash.",How to Exercise Your Rabbit1," Rabbits like to run around, including after people. If your rabbit is coming towards you, turn and run away so it will chase you. Then, turn around and start chasing your rabbit so it can run away in the other direction. You can turn around again to make your rabbit the pursuer once more.It may take a few times for your rabbit to figure out what you are doing, but once it learns that this is just a game, it’s a great way to get some running exercise.
It can be good to crawl while doing this. Being closer to the ground will help your rabbit get comfortable with you.;
, This is good to get your rabbit to stretch out different parts of its body. Make sure the food is just out of regular reach so your rabbit has to really extend to get there.Hold a treat in your hand in the air above your rabbit’s head. Make sure it has to stand up and stretch to get there.
Put your rabbit on a box or table, and either hold or place a treat just off the edge. Your rabbit will need to stretch its neck to get there. Just make sure your rabbit doesn’t slip or fall off the edge.

, Unlike with a dog, you will be the one doing the chasing here. Give your rabbit a toy and let it toss the toy in the air. Chase down the toy, and return it to your rabbit., Take some small treats or pellets and hide them somewhere your rabbit likes to explore. It will smell the food, and try to hunt down a treat.Alternatively, you can put some raisins into a small paper bag, and let your rabbit dig around the bag to find them., Rabbits love to dig around. Take a large cat litterbox, or something of similar size, and layer the bottom with newspapers. Put some crumpled up newspapers on top to encourage digging. Your rabbit will enjoy shredding and tearing apart the newspaper.By rummaging around in newspaper, your rabbit will probably get ink on its nose, paws, and other parts of its body. Don’t worry, the ink is nontoxic, so your rabbit will be just fine.

, Rabbits are intelligent creatures, and are quite easy to train. Think about commands you want your rabbit to follow, and create steps for it to accomplish them. Reward good behavior with praise and a treat, but just be sure the rabbit doesn’t do something else first, or else you will be rewarding the wrong behavior.


Include simple command words, like “Sit” or “Jump,” so your rabbit begins to associate those words with what you want it to do. Once your rabbit is getting the hang of its tricks, start weaning off the treats, so it only follows commands.
Some good tricks include getting your rabbit to jump up and down onto places like the couch or your lap, running into and around certain parts of its play area, house breaking, or stopping aggressive behavior.
You can also use a clicker to reinforce what you are doing. When you provide treats, also click so the rabbit associates the sound with a treat.Make sure you don’t yell at or hit your rabbit during training. This will only make the rabbit uneasy or scared of you, which you definitely don’t want. Your rabbit should associate your hands with food and affection, and if you hit your rabbit may become more aggressive., If you want to take your rabbit out for a bit, attach it in a harness with a leash. Your rabbit will probably resist the harness at first, so make sure you have little delay between putting it on and going for your walk.Look for H-style harnesses, which you’ll probably find the cat section of the pet store. Don’t use harnesses or collars that go around the neck, as these can cinch the neck and cause injury. Make sure you have a stretchy leash, and don't tug too much while walking, as that is also a good way to hurt your rabbit.
In general, rabbits will prefer more unstructured freedom to roam and explore rather than a restricted walk. Still, this can be another way to get your rabbit out for some movement.
Never leave your rabbit leashed if you are not around. Left alone, your rabbit may chew through the leash, get tangled in it, or be unable to escape a predator.

"
"
Give your rabbit 3 hours of free ranging time a day.,
Get on the floor with your rabbit.,
Move your rabbit around.,
Watch for problems.",How to Exercise Your Rabbit2," Rabbits need up to 3 hours a day where they can run about and stretch their legs. If you allow your rabbit the space to roam around your house, this doesn’t need to be structured playtime, which can be easier on your time., Rabbits are curious and friendly, and you can do a lot to encourage your pet’s activity by getting down on its level. Get down on the floor with your rabbit and its toys. The rabbit will explore around you, and may even follow you as you roam around your house., If rabbits are given regular free range, especially indoors, they may get comfortable in particular places and spend too much time relaxing there. If you are worried about your rabbit settling, pick it up and move it to a different part of your house. The rabbit will get a little bit of exercise hopping back to the preferred location.


Alternatively, you can confine your rabbit for a few hours, limiting the space it can move around in. That way, when you remove the barriers and let it free, your rabbit will be more likely to explore the parts it couldn’t go before.You can also take some of your rabbit’s favorite toys and move them to different areas. Your rabbit will want to track them down, and maybe bring them back where it thinks they belong.

, Just like in humans, rabbits that don’t get exercise will suffer from various health problems. If you notice your rabbit suffering from some of these concerns, you may need to take some time to get your rabbit exercising. You should also consult with your vet to see what else you should do to help your rabbit.Problems include:


Obesity. Without exercise and a good diet, your rabbit will gain weight, which will add stress to other parts of its body, including the cardiovascular system and the pads of its feet. Your rabbit will even find it difficult to groom itself effectively. Keep an eye on your rabbit’s weight, and make sure it is getting a healthy diet of grass hay and fresh foods.
Behavioral problems. If your rabbit is not getting enough exercise, it may also become bored and unhealthy. Look out for signs that your rabbit isn’t healthy such as lethargy, aggression, chewing cage bars or its own fur, or destroying parts of its cage.

Leave toys around.,
Give your rabbit enough space.,
Create raised platforms.,
Provide hiding places.,
Remove potential hazards from the area.,
Always watch your rabbit.",How to Exercise Your Rabbit3," Rabbits are curious and playful. While they may not always be interested in toys you have, leaving things around for them to play with will help prevent boredom.These don’t need to be fancy toys bought at a pet store. Rabbits can enjoy themselves with untreated wood products, hard plastic baby toys, pine cones, oatmeal boxes, and phone books. Just be prepared for your rabbit to chew those items up.
You can move toys around too. When something isn’t where your rabbit expects it to be, it will naturally try to explore and learn more.Avoid toys made from cherry, redwood, and peach wood, as these materials can be poisonous to rabbits.

, Rabbits are fast, active animals that like to run and jump around. In the wild, rabbits can run up to 3 miles every day. You probably don’t have 3 miles to give your rabbit, but you want to make sure your rabbit’s secure play area is large enough for it to move around. Ideally, your rabbit run will be at least 8 feet long and 4 wide with some kind of fence or barrier at least 4 feet high., Rabbits need to exercise their legs by jumping on and off raised areas. These don’t need to be complicated things, maybe a box or chair that your rabbit will be able to jump on and off of. Keep these areas near grassy or soft areas for more comfortable landings.You can encourage your rabbit to jump up and down on these platforms by placing treats on top of them or back on the ground., Rabbits sometimes need an area where they can feel safe and secure. Your rabbit will also want an area that it can go to get out of wind and rain, or just go if it feels stressed and afraid, or simply wants to be alone. Make sure your shelters are big enough for your rabbit, and try to make more than one entrance if possible.Cardboard or wooden boxes, paper sacks, sections of wide-bore drain pipes, and shelves are all good places for a rabbit to hide.
If you have multiple rabbits, make sure you have enough hiding spaces for each individual.

, Because of their curiosity and speed, rabbits can easily get themselves into trouble, even if you are watching. Make sure you’ve gotten rid of hazards or other things that can cause harm to your pet.Make sure the area is sealed off and doesn’t have any small holes, like in a fence, where your rabbit can escape from the area. Outside of a den or other safe space you have set up for it, you don’t want your rabbit to get somewhere you can’t reach.
Remove house plants and weeds to prevent your rabbit from eating something poisonous.
Block off wires with a PVC pipe, or wrap them in electrical tape to prevent nibbling.

, If your rabbits are going to be let loose outside, you need to keep an eye on them at all times. Keep an eye out for possible escape attempts, poisonous items they may try to eat, and any predators that might be lurking nearby."

Find out if you can crush the medication.,
Crush the pill.,
Add the crushed pill to food.,
Dissolve a crushed pill in liquid.",How to Give a Rabbit Medication1," Your rabbit may have an easier time consuming medication if you conceal it within their food. You can try sticking a whole pill inside of a banana, or coating it with peanut butter. Then present this food to your rabbit the way you normally would, and watch to make sure they finish it.Peanut butter should not be a staple in your rabbit’s diet, but a small amount used to occasionally to administer medicine is OK.;
, Some medications are designed to be given whole, while others can be crushed. Check any packaging or directions for labels like “Do not crush” or “Administer whole.” If you are not sure, contact your veterinarian to ask.

, Using a mortar and pestle (or a spoon and a ceramic mug) grind the pill into a fine powder. Press the end of the pestle (or the back of the spoon) into the pill until it becomes a powder.


You can also buy a commercial pill crusher at most pharmacies.

, Once the pill is crushed to a powder, add it to soft food like applesauce, peanut butter, or mashed banana. Use as little as possible to disguise the medicine. Offer this food to your rabbit, and make sure they consume all of it., Another option is to crush a pill or tablet and dissolve this in a small amount of water or juice. (The amount will vary according to the size of the pill, and is not specific. Simply use enough liquid to create a solution.) Then administer the solution using a syringe, just like you would for any liquid medication."

One of these can be obtained at your veterinarian’s office, or at most pharmacies.If you do not have a needleless syringe, a plastic dropper can be used as well.

, Place the tip of the syringe into the liquid medication and pull back the plunger until the correct dosage is in the tube. (Follow dosage instructions on medication packaging.) Try to ensure that there are no air bubbles.If you get air bubbles in the syringe, simply eject the liquid and start over.
Be sure that the syringe opening is totally submerged in the liquid. (This will help prevent bubbles.)

, Sit down with your rabbit on your lap. Gently hold your rabbit still under your non-dominant arm, like you would a football. Do this gently and try to keep your rabbit calm.Be aware that your rabbit might squirm, so hold on tight.

, Wiggle the syringe into the rabbit’s mouth. It should be inserted right through the large gap between the incisors and cheek teeth, and directed toward the back corner of the mouth., Once you have inserted the syringe, press down on the plunger to slowly dispense the liquid medication. Once again, be sure to aim toward the back corner of the mouth, and not down the throat.It is very important you don't do this too forcefully. Give the rabbit a chance to swallow and avoid flooding the mouth with liquid. There is a risk if liquids are squirted in too quickly that the rabbit will inhale the medicine, which can cause pneumonia.

, Once your rabbit has taken the medicine, give them some gentle pats and words of praise. You may even want to play with them a bit, or offer a favorite treat.

Simply pick up your rabbit, and cradle them under your non-dominant arm, almost like a football, with their face away from you., Holding the rabbit with your non-dominant arm, use that same hand to gently part the rabbit’s lips. Use two fingers to carefully pry their lips apart. Be ready with the pill in your other hand., Once the rabbit’s lips are parted, swiftly place the whole pill in the back of the rabbit’s mouth. The pill can be inserted through the gap between the incisors and cheek teeth., Allow the rabbit’s mouth to close, while keeping them under your arm. Use your free hand to lean the rabbit’s head back a bit, and gently massage their throat to encourage swallowing., Once you are sure the rabbit has swallowed the pill, be sure to praise them!

Do you have to keep re-filling the dry food bowl? Do you keep having to add more hay or fresh food? Make sure that the hay is actually being eaten and not just being squashed at the back of the hutch. If you suspect that your rabbit has stopped eating, you must notify the vet immediately. It is a very serious problem for rabbits if they stop eating.;
, Your rabbit's abdomen/tummy should be soft and smooth. If it feels hard or firm, this could be a sign of a serious digestion problem. If you find hardness in this area, it's important to go to the vet immediately.

, Rabbits' noses should be clean and dry. It is okay if there is a little bit of discharge, but if the nose is running or bleeding it could be a sign that there is something stuck in the nose or that your rabbit is allergic to something.

, As with the nose, there should be no signs of discharge or running from the eyes. If there is, this could indicate a blockage, that something is in the eye or that the rabbit has an illness. Seeing the vet straight away is warranted.

, If your rabbit has its head tilted to the side and is scratching its ears, it could mean that it has some kind of ear infection. Rabbits do tilt their heads often anyway, but it's important to make sure your rabbit isn't doing it all the time.

, Rabbits have two types of stool; a wet, soft one that they eat and then hard, round ones that you find in the hutch and on the grass. If your rabbit is not eating the wet soft stool, it could be a sign that you have got the rabbit's diet wrong or that it is feeling too hot or is overweight. Make sure that the wet stool is not stuck to its tail area, as this could result in fly strike.

, Check up on your rabbit every hour or so and contact the vet if it gets worse. A change in character can be the first sign of a serious illness and if it is picked up early, it could prevent the illness or an untimely death.

Feed your rabbit quality grass hay.,
Give your rabbit fresh grass.,
Choose nutrition-packed pellets.,
Provide leafy greens for your rabbit.,
Avoid feeding your rabbit certain foods.,
Keep your rabbit’s water bowl filled.",How to Prevent Gastrointestinal Stasis in Rabbits1," The primary way to prevent GI stasis is to feed your rabbit properly. A rabbit’s diet needs to consist of foods with the right amount of fiber along with moisture to keep the digestive tract functioning properly. The most important part of the diet is to always keep clean, grass hay available to your rabbit at all times. Timothy or other grass hay is the best hay to feed a rabbit.Alfalfa and clover hay is too high in protein and calcium to feed to a rabbit daily and should only be used as a treat.;
, Fresh grass is also a good food for a rabbit. You can set up a pen outside on your lawn where your rabbit can graze, or you can clip grass with a scissors and give it to your rabbit to eat.


Clip fresh grass with scissors and make sure that you don’t use lawn mower trimmings. Make sure that fertilizers or herbicides have not been used on the grass or you may make your rabbit very ill.

, You will also need to feed your rabbit fresh nutritionally balanced pellets daily. Make sure your feed your rabbit the right amount of pellets. Young rabbits can have unlimited pellets; adult rabbits need from 1/8 to ½ cup daily depending on their size.


If you don’t limit the pellets, your rabbit may become obese.
Throw out any uneaten pellets after a day and replace with new pellets.

, Leafy green vegetables are good food choices for your rabbit because they provide both fiber and moisture. Feed your rabbit anywhere from one to three cups each day depending on the rabbit’s size.


Good leafy green vegetables to feed your rabbit include salad greens, bok choy, arugula, broccoli stems and leaves, and carrot tops.
Make sure to slowly introduce any new greens to a rabbit so it doesn’t cause your rabbit to develop diarrhea.

, There are some foods you should never feed to your rabbit. These foods can mess up your rabbit’s digestive tract or cause a problem that might lead to gastrointestinal stasis. Never feed the following foods to rabbits:


Human foods other than the above mentioned vegetables. You can also give your rabbit small amounts of starchy vegetables, like carrots, and small pieces of fruit. These are considered treats not a main part of the diet. You should limit the amount of these foods.
Corn, other grains, or seeds. Corn hulls can hurt the rabbit.

, Do not forget to always keep fresh water available for your rabbits. Provide a couple of options for your rabbit for the best results. You can provide your rabbit with a sipper bottle and a ceramic dish both filled with fresh, clean water. Change the water daily.Choose a ceramic dish over plastic because they are less likely to be knocked over. Plus, your rabbit won’t be able to chew on a ceramic disk.

Recognize the symptoms of GI stasis.,
Take your rabbit to the vet immediately.,
Treat GI stasis.,
Identify the cause of GI stasis.",How to Prevent Gastrointestinal Stasis in Rabbits2," Since gastrointestinal stasis is a disease caused by improper feeding that leads to the gut stopping to work properly, the symptoms deal mostly with the digestion of the rabbit. Signs of GI stasis include:Decreased or no fecal pellet production
Decreased or no appetite
Lethargy or no energy

, Gastrointestinal stasis is a serious condition in rabbits. If you see any of the symptoms, or suspect that your rabbit has gastrointestinal stasis, you need to get your rabbit to the veterinarian as soon as possible. This is an emergency and needs to be treated immediately.


Hesitating or taking a wait-and-see approach may kill your rabbit.

, If you notice the changes in your rabbit and take him to the vet, the vet can treat GI stasis. With treatment, your bunny can get better. The vet may prescribe medicine to help reduce the bad bacteria that has backed up or to help stimulate the digestive system. An IV can help soften the build up in the intestines.Your vet may suggest feeding your rabbit with a syringe so the rabbit can get the nutrients he needs.
Your bunny may need pain relievers to help with pain from the gas and bacteria backed up in the intestines.

, GI stasis is primarily caused by a diet that is too low in fiber. Other causes of GI stasis may include stress, not drinking enough water, pain, and a foreign object in the gut. However, the vast majority of cases are caused by an improper diet.


When a rabbit doesn’t eat the right food, the digestive tract stops working. Bad bacteria and gases build up in the intestines, which causes pain and decreases the appetite. The rabbit stops getting nutrients he needs."
"
Know that rabbits need to eat fibrous plants.,
Understand that a rabbit’s stomach is very large.,
Realize that rabbits eat their droppings as part of the digestive process.",How to Prevent Gastrointestinal Stasis in Rabbits3," You can protect your rabbit and help prevent GI stasis by learning how the rabbit’s digestive system works. The rabbit’s digestive system has developed to eat very fibrous plants. These are plants which humans could never digest but rabbits thrive on.The rabbits use their teeth to grind the fibrous plants down to make them small enough for the rabbit’s digestive tract to digest.


This type of food is typically coarse and rough to help wear down the rabbit’s teeth. Their teeth grow continuously throughout the life of the rabbit.If the food doesn’t perform this function, the teeth will grow long and ragged, potentially injuring the rabbit.

, As the food travels down the digestive tract from the mouth, it is held in the relatively large stomach. Rabbits are crepuscular, meaning they eat primarily at dusk and dawn, so their food has to be stored in the stomach for hours. In the stomach, the food is mixed with enzymes and acids before it is passed along to the small intestine.In the small intestine, most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients occur as the food travels along this part of the digestive tract.

, The small intestine empties into the large intestine and the cecum. The cecum further digests the fibrous portion of the plants the rabbit consumed.This is then passed out of the body via the large intestine and anus. When it does, the rabbit eats it to recover the nutrients produced by the bacteria and microorganism in the cecum.The cecum is filled with bacteria and microorganisms which break down plant fibers to make the nutrients locked inside available to the rabbit’s body.
When the fibers are broken down, the cecum releases all the nutrients and material into the large intestine in sticky substance called a cecotrope.

Prevent sore hocks.",How to Diagnose Sore Hocks in Rabbits," The hocks are the rabbit equivalent of an ankle joint, and the area that's affected is the length of the paw from the hock to the tips of the toes. To check your rabbit, gently roll the rabbit onto its back so that you can see the underside of the rabbit's back legs.Take care not to force the rabbit over, as this can damage their spine.
You may find it helps to cover the rabbit's eyes with a towel as this has a naturally subduing effect.
It's a good idea to sit on the floor when checking your rabbit, just in case they wriggle and you let go.;
, There is a sliding scale of severity from fur loss right through to full thickness pressure sores with secondary infections.In its mildest form, the rabbit may lose the fur on the surface in contact with the ground, and the skin may look slightly red.If the problem has progressed a bit further, the area may become puffy or swollen, the skin may be obviously reddened or even cracked or scabby.
Even further, it can develop into a sore or ulcer form. An ulcer is when the surface of the skin breaks open, often in response to pressure, such as is the case with bed sores., Unfortunately, once the surface of the skin is broken, this provides an entry route for bacteria and infections. To check for this, look for a weeping discharge, often consisting of pus, from the sore.The area may smell unpleasant.
Usually there is significant swelling and large areas of skin loss from the lower surface of the limb.
Once the discharge is cleaned away you may even be able to see underlying structures through the gap in the skin, such as tendons or ligaments.

, This rabbit will be very uncomfortable and reluctant to move around. Unfortunately this worsens the problem because the rabbit spends longer in one spot, which may be damp and contributing to the sore hocks. Thus a classic vicious circle develops.In some cases the infection spreads into the joints or even the bones. This is very painful and the rabbit will be reluctant to move. When it does move, it will be with an abnormal gait or a limp.
The pain and discomfort may also stop the rabbit from eating.

, Keep the rabbit's claws short, so that the foot lies at a normal angle. Also give the rabbit a deep bed of soft straw, so that the injured area is cushioned a bit.


Be sure to keep the rabbit's cage or hutch clean as well. If the hock injury was caused by the rabbit sitting in urine, clean the area and make sure it is no longer sitting in its filth.

, If you discover your rabbit has sore hocks then seek veterinary attention. The vet will look at the hock area and assess whether the skin is damaged. If it is, the vet will also assess whether a secondary infection is present. If the answer is yes, the vet will investigate whether the infection has spread to the bones or joints, which may involve radiography of the affected bones.


The vet will examine the rabbit to check for health problems that could cause it to sit still for longer than normal.
The veterinarian will also check the length of the rabbit's claws. Long claws raise up the paw, especially on hard surfaces, pushing the weight back onto the rabbit's hocks.

, The sores will need to be cleaned and wrapped, in order to prevent further irritation. Your veterinarian should show you the proper procedure for cleaning and wrapping the wound, as you will need to change the wrapping on a regular basis.Your veterinarian my prescribe a medication, such as an antibiotic, to apply to the wound. This will help kill any infection and allow the wound to begin healing., To understand how hock sores occur, it first helps to understand how rabbits move in the wild. They are constantly moving around from one patch of grass to another. Soil is relatively soft and allows the rabbit's claws to sink into the ground and the whole of the underside of the foot is in contact with the earth.This spreads the rabbit's weight evenly over a surface that is soft and forgiving.


Also, wild rabbits tend to be lean, so they are not carrying excess weight which presses down on the hock area.

, Contrast how a wild rabbit's hocks connect with the ground with pet rabbits. They move around over hard surfaces, such as carpet, laminate flooring, or lino. These surfaces do not allow the claws to dig in so the foot is naturally tilted up at the foot and down at the hock, adding pressure to the hocks.In addition rabbits kept in hutches for part of the time may be on abrasive surfaces such as mesh, which abrade and traumatize the skin to the lower limb.Also, wet bedding softens the skin and weakens its ability to form calluses and protect itself. Indeed, urine in straw macerates (softens) the skin further and dirty conditions predispose to infection.Pet rabbits may also be overweight, which adds extra pressure onto the rear limbs., Remove soiled areas of bedding from your rabbit's hutch on a regular basis. There should be no wet areas that the rabbit can sit in and damage its skin. Also make sure that your rabbit has a good surface to stand, and sit, on. It should not have to sit or stand on a wire flooring for long periods of time.Trim your rabbit's nails on a regular basis, so that its long nails don't press the hocks awkwardly onto the ground.
Also, keep your rabbit at a healthy weight, so it is not carrying excess weight. Excess weight can put extra pressure on the hocks.

Use caution when adopting new rabbits.,
Isolate new rabbits when you first bring them home.,
Clean the rabbit hutch often.",How to Prevent Snuffles (Pasteurella) in Rabbits1," Pasteurella is highly infectious, so you want to avoid introducing a sick rabbit into your existing rabbit household. When buying or rescuing a new rabbit, observe him closely to make sure the animal is not sneezing and has no discharges.Check to make sure there are no discharges from the ears or nose. These are signs of concern.
If the rabbit does have a nasal discharge, then the risk of introducing a problem into your house is high. Think carefully before taking on that rabbit.;
, When you bring a new rabbit home, keep him away from the other rabbits for a few days. This gives you a chance to check that the stress of rehoming hasn't triggered a bout of the snuffles.Opinions vary about how long to quarantine the new rabbit. Some say three to four days because if the stress of homing hasn't triggered a problem by then, you should be ok.
Others favor a much longer period, like two weeks. The longer isolation has to be balanced against the chance of socializing the new rabbit with your existing ones, which is best done when the rabbit is young.
If you have a rabbit that has the snuffles, you should isolate the rabbit while he undergoes treatment. Talk to your vet about how long he should stay away from your other rabbits to reduce the risk of spreading the infection.

, Another way to prevent the snuffles is to clean the rabbit's hutch and living area regularly. Do a spot clean everyday to scoop out bedding soiled with urine and replacing it with clean bedding. A rabbit living in dirty conditions is at high risk of developing the snuffles.Urine contains ammonia. A rabbit's respiratory tract is delicate and easily damaged by inhaling ammonia. Make sure the living quarters are well ventilated so fumes don’t build up.

Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Respiratory Problems in Rabbits," The most common respiratory problem is 'snuffles,' a disease that causes upper respiratory tract infections with a nasal discharge.The classic pasteurella infection discharge is a thick, creamy white discharge from the nostrils. However the discharge can be anything from watery to white to yellow.Pasteurella is so commonly a cause of ill health because many rabbits have it in their respiratory tract as a normal inhabitant. It only makes the rabbit sick when it's immune system is suppressed, such as when the rabbit is stressed, exposed to poor husbandry, or is treated with drugs which weaken the immune system, such as steroids.;
, This is due to mucous in the nasal passageways. It is often accompanied by a discharge, sneezing, and sometimes coughing., When the rabbit tries to clean the nose, so they can breath more freely, it smear the discharge over their fur. This leads to a dirty face and paws.


A sick rabbit may also neglect its general grooming regime. Be suspicious that your rabbit is sick if your rabbit's coat is looking dull and unkempt., The infection can also impact the rabbit's eyes. This means that the rabbit may have a discharge from the eyes. The classic pasteurella discharge is a thick and white., In some cases, the bacteria travels from the throat up into the ear and causes an ear infection. This affects the rabbit's balance and they develop a head tilt., If the rabbit is having a lot of breathing difficulty, it may adopt a posture with an exaggerated straight neck and head. This allows the rabbit to straighten the respiratory passages in an effort to get more air in., Sick rabbits don't eat and this is a serious problem in itself. If your rabbit doesn't eat, take it to see a vet as soon as possible. A rabbit's digestive system can shut down completely and this can put its life at risk very quickly., Husbandry can play a part, because a rabbit in a hutch that is not cleaned out regularly is exposed to high levels of ammonia, which when breathed in weakens the immunity of the respiratory tract and leaves it open to infection.Likewise, inhaling cigarette smoke is damaging to the delicate lining of the lungs, leading to airway irritation and inflammation., The vet will examine the rabbit and listen to its chest with a stethoscope. He or she will also check the heart for a murmur (since heart problems can lead to fluid build up in the lungs) and listen for crackles and wheezes in the lungs, which could indicate infection or pneumonia.The vet may also listen at the rabbit's windpipe to see if the noise is louder from the head end or the chest. This helps the vet decide if this is an upper or a lower respiratory tract problem.
The lower is the lungs, and respiratory problems affecting the lungs might include infections, pneumonia, heart disease, cancer, or smoke inhalation.The rest of the tract above the lungs is considered 'upper' and consists of the windpipe, larynx and nasal cavities. Problems here include inhaled foreign bodies (such as straw), sinusitis, tooth root abscesses, and infection with a variety of bacteria or viruses.

, This will cost you more but will allow your veterinarian to get a specific diagnosis. This may, or may not, be necessary, depending on what type of treatment the veterinarian suggests.


If the problem is in the lungs, the vet may gently place the rabbit on an x-ray plate and take a chest x-ray. The picture of the lungs can indicate the nature of the problem, such as inflammation in the lungs, fluid build up, tumors, or infection.If the problem is in the upper respiratory tract, the vet may swab the nose. This is to get a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for culture and sensitivity. This grows the bugs present and helps the veterinarian select which antibiotic to use to kill the infection.
In complex cases, the vet may x-ray the rabbit's skull, to look for complicating factors, such as tooth roots that are growing up into the nasal cavity or infection in the inner ear.

, Treatment usually involves antibiotics. However, this can be problematic because the bacteria in the rabbit's gut can easily be damaged by antibiotics. With this in mind, be sure to give your rabbit plenty of fresh hay and water while it is on the medication and take it back to the vet at the first sign of the digestive system having problems.There is now a school of thought that pasteurellosis is over diagnosed and that other bacteria may also cause infections.This difference could be important if the bug is not sensitive to the antibiotic used to treat presumed pasteurellosis.

Reduce your rabbit’s stress.,
Feed your rabbit a healthy diet.,
Provide your rabbit with a comfortable environment.",How to Prevent Snuffles (Pasteurella) in Rabbits2," Rabbits are a prey species and prone to stress. This releases stress hormones, such as cortisol which suppresses the immune system. Elevated stress levels can also cause the snuffles to become worse if your rabbit has it. Work on reducing stress for your rabbit to keep him healthy.Sources of stress include a change in routine, the introduction of another rabbit, visiting the vet clinic, poor diet, overcrowding, or aggression from other rabbits.
To help reduce stress, make sure to feed your rabbit a proper healthy diet, provide adequate clean housing, and give the rabbit plenty of space.

, Make sure the rabbit has a healthy, nutritious diet so that his immune system is strong. A healthy, natural diet contains mainly a good quality green hay. Supplement this with fresh fruit and vegetables every day, along with a small scoop of pelleted food.A rabbit is designed to chew on a high fiber diet, such as grass and herbage. This keeps the teeth ground down and reduces the chances of his teeth overgrowing. A painful mouth or tooth roots that grow up into the nasal cavity can reduce the amount the rabbit eats and make her more liable to infections such as pasteurella.
Limit the amount of pelleted food you feed your rabbit. It is high in calories and low in fiber. This makes the rabbit more likely to become overweight and have overgrown teeth.

, One common cause of stress and a weakened immune system is due to a rabbit’s environment. Avoid overcrowding your rabbits. You shouldn’t own too many, and make sure you have adequate housing and space for the rabbits you own.Your rabbit should be kept in a moderate temperature. Being too hot or too cold can cause stress. Keep them out of the sun, away from drafts, and regulate the temperature in their living spaces.
You should always provide clean drinking water for your rabbit.

Check for eye irritation.,
Check for sinus issues.,
Monitor for other infections.",How to Prevent Snuffles (Pasteurella) in Rabbits3," One of the symptoms of the snuffles is irritation of the eyes. Your rabbit’s eyes may has a mucous or discharge from them. This can cause the fur around the eyes to look damp, like your bunny has been crying. Your rabbit may also be squinting a lot.This eye irritation may also cause redness in the eyes.

, The classic sinus symptoms are what give the snuffles its name. Your rabbit may have mucous or a discharge coming from his nose. Your rabbit may wipe at his nose, so he may have crusty fur on his paws.Your rabbit may also sneeze a lot.
In some cases, the nasal discharge may be so bad that your bunny has missing fur around the nose., The snuffles may lead to other infections in the body. Ear infections are common combined with the other respiratory problems. This is usually presented in your rabbit with a head tilt. He may also shake his head around, or have a discharge from his ears.Your rabbit may also have abscesses, which are lumps on the body.Uterine infections can also occur, but these are generally found when your vet does exploratory surgery.

Look for sneezes and snuffles.,
Pay attention to nasal discharge.,
Inspect the rabbit's eyes.,
Look for an unusual head tilt.,
Inspect your rabbit for abscesses.,
Assess whether your rabbit is having a hard time breathing.,
Pay attention to signs of fatigue.,
Look for the signs of a genital infection.,
Take your rabbit to its veterinarian.,
Discuss with the vet which tests should be done.,
Follow the veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Snuffles (Pasteurella) in Rabbits," The signs of this infection are usually associated with the respiratory and nasal tracts. This causes the rabbit to sneeze and snuffle, hence the name 'the snuffles.'


Infected rabbits usually cough, in addition to sneezing, as the air passages and the lungs can be affected.;
, An early sign of the illness is a watery nasal discharge, which becomes thicker and has a white consistency. This excessive discharge irritates the nasal passages and causes the rabbit to sneeze.


Rabbits breathe through their nose and so having a runny nose is distressing for them. They may rub at their nose with the front paws, and have staining on the fur of the face and the forearms as a result., The pasteurella bacteria can affect the drainage and tear production of the eyes. If this is the case, the eyes may be watery or have a milky or creamy discharge.To treat this symptom, antibiotics may be applied to the eye and it may need to be gently flushed with saline to clear out the discharge.

, The bacteria may travel from the throat up into the middle ear. This will cause a build up of pus or fluid in the ear, which can cause the rabbit to tilt its head.This is known as torticollis.Treatment for the cause of the head tilt usually includes antibiotics but this may not clear up the infection. It may take surgery to eliminate the buildup of fluid in the middle ear.

, In severe cases of pasteurella, the bacteria can get into the bloodstream and travel to the lungs, liver, or the joints, and create abscesses near the surface of the skin. You may not be able to detect the abscesses when they lay dormant under the skin but they can rupture at any time. Once they rupture, you will be able to see the wound., If the infection travels into the lungs, the rabbit can then find it difficult to breath. Their breathing becomes fast and shallow, and the rabbit is likely to stop eating altogether.It is not uncommon for the infection to progress from cold like symptoms and spread to the lungs, causing pneumonia.

, The illness decreases the rabbit's energy and affects its mood. Most rabbits with the snuffles are subdued and quiet. They will eat less and start to lose weight.The fatigue can also cause the rabbit to stop grooming itself. Their lack of grooming creates a dull, unkempt coat.

, Rabbits with the snuffles can get a genital infection because the reproductive organs can become infected. This is more common in female rabbits than in males. Rabbits with this infection have a hard time reproducing, and can become completely sterile. If your rabbit is exhibiting other symptoms and has not been reproducing as usual, it may have the snuffles.The infection usually affects the internal reproductive organs but the symptoms can include a yellow or grey vaginal discharge in female rabbits.

, Your veterinarian will give the rabbit a general check-up, giving it a visual inspection and also probably looking in its ears, eyes, and throat. This will give the vet a good idea whether the rabbit is sick with the snuffles, although it will not specifically diagnose the disease.It is difficult to connect pasteurella to a specific illness. The snuffles is commonly used to describe the symptoms caused by the pasteurella bacteria.As mentioned above, a high percentage of healthy rabbits carry pasteurella in their respiratory tract but are not sick. This complicates diagnosis because swabbing these rabbits will produce a positive result, while the result itself is of little significance because the rabbit is not ill because of the pasteurella.
If the rabbit is unwell and produces a positive swab result for pasteurella, it can be difficult to know how significant this result is. It might be the rabbit isn't actually sick from the pasteurella but has another condition and the positive result is just a coincidental finding.

, Another complication in diagnosing pasteurella is that to obtain a representative swab the sample needs to be taken from deep in the nasal cavity.This is uncomfortable for the rabbit and many rabbits will object to the procedure and need either sedation or anesthesia. Thus, the vet may have a strong suspicion of pasteurella based on the symptoms alone, but putting an absolute label on the condition via a swab would not actually change the treatment.If the rabbit is already sick, then this could stress it further and so there needs to be a definite advantage (i.e., it would change the treatment) to know if the rabbit is pasteurella positive or not.
Because of this, the vet will weigh which tests are going to yield the most useful information and be most relevant to the treatment of the rabbit. For example, if the rabbit has breathing difficulties then it is a good idea to x-ray the rabbit's chest while it is sedated, to get a full picture of how serious the condition is and if pneumonia is a complication or not.

, Most likely, your veterinarian will only treat the symptoms your rabbit is experiencing. It is very difficult to eradicate the pasteurella organism with antibiotics, as they usually only temporarily eliminate it until the rabbit undergoes stress once again.While they will not eliminate the organism permanently, a variety of antibiotics may be prescribed to end this flare up, as the disease is bacterial.These include ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and trimethoprim sulfa.
Antibiotics are usually given for approximately 2 to 4 weeks.Remember that antibiotics can negatively affect a rabbit's stomach and digestion, which is a delicate system.

Instead, they will lie on one side looking paralyzed. While attempting to get up and balance themselves, they may end up simply rolling around on the ground.Wry neck can cause weakness or paralysis in the back legs, making it difficult or impossible for a rabbit to walk.;
, The most telltale sign of wry neck is a sideways-tilting head.If your rabbit’s head is tilting sideways as he walks, you can be confident he has wry neck. Wry neck has other symptoms, though, so you should look out of for those as well.


The side of the head tilt indicates which side is affected. The head will be tilted down on that side., Your rabbit, like humans and other animals, has a vestibular system within his central nervous system that controls balance, coordinates body movements, and helps keep body parts in their proper positions.Inner ear disease, if severe enough, could affect your rabbit’s vestibular system and cause him to walk abnormally.For example, your rabbit may begin to walk in circles.Wry neck can also cause dizziness, so your rabbit may look wobbly or fall over when walking., Occasionally, rabbits with wry neck have nystagmus, an eye condition during which the eye uncontrollably moves horizontally or vertically.Sometimes, the nature of the nystagmus (e.g., direction, speed) can provide clues about the cause of wry neck.The nystagmus will be present whether or not your rabbit is walking.

, Wry neck can affect nerves controlling facial movements. Signs of facial paralysis include a drooping lip, drooling, and an inability to close the eyelids. In addition, you may be able to see the third eyelid, a protective covering that is normally visible only when the eye needs to be protected., If your rabbit has wry neck, he may feel nauseated, causing him to eat less and possibly develop anorexia. The nausea could also cause your rabbit to drool more and grind his teeth.A head tilt would make it difficult for your rabbit to get food into his mouth.

, Wry neck requires veterinary care. If your rabbit has a head tilt, regardless of whether you see any other symptoms of wry neck, take him to your veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. If your veterinarian does not have a lot of rabbit experience, ask him or her for recommendations on local veterinarians with rabbit expertise. You could also visit the website http://rabbit.org/vet-listings/ to find a veterinarian.Wry neck can get progressively worse. Take your rabbit to your veterinarian as soon as possible., Wry neck is commonly diagnosed on clinical signs, namely the head tilt.However, since wry neck can have many causes (e.g., middle/inner ear infection, trauma, stroke, parasites), your veterinarian will need to identify the exact cause in order to develop an effective treatment plan. Identifying the exact cause will involve ruling out as many causes as possible.Your veterinarian will first do a thorough physical examination of your rabbit. From there, he or she will decide which other diagnostic tests to run., Several other diagnostic tests can help your veterinarian determine the cause of your rabbit’s wry neck. For example, skull x-rays could show an inner ear infection, indicated by a thickened tympanic bulla (bony structure in the ear). However, these x-rays may be non-diagnostic, meaning they wouldn’t be helpful in diagnosing the wry neck.If an infection is the suspected cause, your veterinarian would conduct various tests. For bacteria, an analysis of pus inside the ear (if present) would help. For E. cuniculi, a parasite that can cause wry neck, diagnostic tests include blood tests and an analysis of the urine.Blood tests for E. cuniculi look for antibodies that form in response to the parasite entering the body.Diagnostic testing could be expensive, depending on how long it takes your veterinarian to identify the cause of your rabbit’s wry neck.

Be on the look out for diarrhea.,
Pay attention to the signs of stasis.,
Understand gut stasis.,
Take your rabbit to the vet.,
Discuss the diagnosis with your vet.,
Follow your vet's instructions for treatment.,
Pay attention to your rabbit's natural digestive process.,
Feed your rabbit properly.,
Allow your rabbit to digest its food naturally.",How to Diagnose Digestive Problems in Rabbits," Diarrhea is rare in the rabbit, but when it does happen it is usually after the rabbit has taken antibiotics. This is because the rabbit is dependent on bacteria in the gut to breakdown food, and antibiotics can kill these bugs. If the bugs aren't there, food can't be digested and the rabbit has diarrhea.Diarrhea is usually obvious as a runny, liquid brown stool. Usually the rabbit will walk through the diarrhea and get its feet, tummy, and rear end coated in feces.
It is important to let your vet know the rabbit has diarrhea. They may want to give the rabbit fluid to prevent dehydration and provide a course of probiotics to establish the correct bacteria in the bowel.;
, Gastric stasis should be treated as an emergency and you should get your rabbit seen by a vet immediately if you suspect the condition. The signs your rabbit might be developing, or has, gut stasis include:


Stress: A recent history of a stressful event, this could include a trip to the vet or surgery.
Lack of appetite: If the rabbit stops eating, the gut goes into stasis automatically, but stasis also causes the rabbit to lose its appetite. Either way, if your rabbit isn't eating it means they require urgent attention from a vet
Infrequent pellets, or pellets that are very small: These are both signs that the bowel isn't churning out it's usual pellets, which is a sign that it's starting to go to sleep.
Mucus coated pellets: Normal sized pellets, as opposed to larger, sticky cecotropes, that are covered in mucus is a sign of stasis. The mucus is produced by the gut lining as it tries to protect itself.
Strange noises in the gut: The air building up in the stomach can lead to strange noises emanating from the rabbit's tummy. These can sound like water swilling around or churning noises.
Depressed: The rabbit is usually hunched, uncomfortable, and depressed, with little interest in what's going on around it.

, Digestion relies on muscular contractions of the bowel wall to push the food along the digestive tract. In gut stasis, this stops happening. The muscular contractions no longer push food along. The food, then, may continue to ferment and produce gas, which causes the tummy to bloat.Food sitting stationary in the gut causes changes in the pH of the fluid in the gut, and this allows certain pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridia, to multiply and poison the rabbit. The rabbit can die, sometimes within as little as 24 hours of the stasis developing.
Stasis is a response of the rabbit's body to stress. The stress hormone cortisol acts on the gut wall, which then switches off from its digestive function. Common causes of stasis include stress (such as seeing a cat, feeling frightened, a change of routine, travel, or a sudden change of diet), or pain (such as dental pain)., It is important to get a problem with digestion fixed as quickly as possible. Call your veterinary office and tell them that you have an emergency. They should let you come in immediately.

, The vet will feel the rabbit's abdomen, which often feels bloated and hard. The vet may tap the abdomen with a finger and listen for sounds of air in the gut. He or she may also listen with a stethoscope for the fluid tinkling sounds that are characteristic of stasis.These signs, along with a history of lack of appetite and infrequent pellets, are enough to diagnose this problem.

, The vet will treat stasis by giving the rabbit fluids, either intravenously or under the skin. In addition, the pain of the condition should be treated. The vet will also give injections of prokinetic drugs, which stimulate the muscles of the gut to start working again.The rabbit should be offered a high fiber diet and encouraged to start eating again as soon as possible.

, Understand how your rabbit's digestive system functions on a normal basis. This will allow you to more easily identify when the rabbit is having problems.

, Rabbits are strict herbivores, which means they only eat plant material and do not eat insect or meat of any kind. Their ideal diet is grass, plant shoots, or foliage, and their digestive system has evolved to process this high fiber low calorie food.


To get all the energy they need from a food that is low calorie, rabbits need to eat and chew their natural diet for up to 20 hours a day. Their gut is designed to act as a huge storage silo for large volumes of plant material, while the bacteria which are essential for rabbit digestion breakdown the herbage., The rabbit's digestive system is so efficient that it passes food through the gut twice, so as to derive every last precious morsel of nutrition. The rabbit achieves this by passing food through once and producing a larger, sticky pellet called a cecotrophy. The rabbit then eats the cecotropes as they emerge from the rectum, so that they pass through the gut again to derive maximum benefit.Food that has passed twice through the gut is then passed as the small, hard, dry nugget that most people associate with rabbits.
A common misunderstanding, is that an owner spots the rabbit's cecotropes and thinks the rabbit has diarrhea. In fact what they are seeing is an entirely normal and healthy pellet that has only passed once through the gut. The owner may see this if the rabbit has arthritis or is obese, and has difficulty reaching around to eat the cecotropes as they exit the anus. Under these circumstances, the pellets may be deposited on the ground where the owner sees them."

Wait until the rabbit is old enough to be neutered.,
Decide if you want to breed your rabbit.,
Ask yourself how long you want your rabbit to live.,
Identify what sort of personality you want in your rabbit.",How to Determine Whether to Have Your Rabbit Neutered1," It is fruitless to determine whether to have your rabbit neutered before you can actually do so. Make the decision only after your rabbit is at least three to five months old, the age after which it can be neutered.Don’t wait until your rabbit is too old to be neutered. Most vets will not neuter a rabbit after it reaches six years of age.
Additionally, rabbits over two years of age will need to be screened more thoroughly for health issues than rabbits that are younger, which could add cost to the pre-operation procedure.;
, If you neuter your rabbit, it will not be able to produce baby rabbits. If breeding your rabbit with a female is important to you, do not have your rabbit neutered.Remember that rabbit litters can be quite large. If you are not equipped to care for your baby rabbits, you might be obligated to give them to an animal shelter or pet store, where they could be euthanized or end up as snake food., If your rabbit is neutered, it is at a decreased risk of getting cancer and urinary tract infections. Ask yourself, “Do I want my rabbit to live a longer, healthier life?” If the answer is yes, move forward with the neutering procedure., Compared to rabbits that have not been neutered, rabbits that have been neutered are calmer and easier to bond with. They are also less likely to engage in conflicts with other household animals, and can be litter trained more easily. Ask yourself, “Do I want a rabbit that is calm, affectionate, and easy to train?” If the answer is negative, do not get your rabbit neutered."

Consult your vet.,
Take stock of your finances.,
Learn more about getting your rabbit neutered.",How to Determine Whether to Have Your Rabbit Neutered2," The most important step in determining whether to have your rabbit neutered is obtaining your veterinarian’s opinion. If your vet warns against getting your rabbit neutered due to some health condition, you should take their advice seriously. Ask your vet questions about your pet and the neutering procedure, including:Have your performed many neutering procedures? What is your success rate?
Have any rabbits died due to the neutering procedure? Why?
Is neutering safe?
What sort of anesthetic will you use on my rabbit during the neutering procedure?

, Like any medical operation, neutering your rabbit costs money. Most neutering operations will cost around $250. If you don’t have the money, or believe that you cannot afford the expense right now, your final determination about whether to have your rabbit neutered should probably be in the negative.Specialty clinics might be able to neuter your rabbit for as little as $50-$75. Ask your vet if they know of such a clinic in your area.

, The more you know about neutered rabbits and the process of neutering, the better off you will feel. When your rabbit is neutered, your vet will remove its testicles. Some vets choose to remove the testicles by making an incision in the scrotum, while others prefer to make an incision in the animal’s stomach. Your vet will let you know which is best for your rabbit.Read more about the process of neutering to put your mind at ease. Your vet will probably provide you with pamphlets or internet resources you can use to better evaluate the procedure.
Like all surgeries, neutering your rabbit carries some risk of infection or unforeseeable complications. Overall, however, there are few risks involved in getting your rabbit neutered. The average loss of life due to the neutering procedure or complications thereof is less than 0.5%.

Keep your rabbit in its cage for at least 24 hours.,
Give your rabbit food and water.,
Administer pain medications as needed.,
Monitor your pet’s stool.,
Check the operation site daily.,
Take your rabbit back to the vet to get its stiches removed.",How to Determine Whether to Have Your Rabbit Neutered3," This will limit the rabbit’s mobility and prevent it from loosening the sutures due to activity. To reduce its stress and speed the healing process, place your rabbit’s cage somewhere warm and quiet. You can keep your bunny warm by filling water bottles with hot water and laying them in its cage, or by placing warm towels on the bottom of the cage., Your rabbit will probably be able to eat the same day as the surgery. Offer some of its favorite greens and a bit of Timothy hay or Orchard hay. If your rabbit has not eaten within 24-48 hours of the surgery, contact your veterinarian., Your vet should provide you with pain medication for your neutered rabbit. Listen carefully to the vet’s directions and administer the medicine at the prescribed intervals.Do not take your rabbit to a vet that will not provide pain medication.

, Rabbits might have soft or irregular stool for several days following the surgery. If it continues for more than a few days, however, alert your vet to the situation., If you see any swelling, redness, blood, or discharge at the site of your neutered rabbit’s incision, contact your vet. You should also contact your vet if you notice that your rabbit’s sutures are coming loose., The amount of time that passes between the operation and the removal of stitches varies. Generally, you will need to return to the vet after 10 to 14 days."

Inspect your rabbit’s teeth.,
Look for irregularities.,
Check for drool on the chin.Drool on your rabbit’s chin can also indicate that there is a problem with his teeth.,
Compare cheeks and look for swelling.,
Watch for bumps along the jawline.Bumps along the jawline can be due to extra-long teeth gouging the jaw, which may mean that your rabbit’s teeth need to be trimmed.,
Smell your rabbit’s breath.",How to Diagnose Dental Problems in Rabbits1," To inspect your rabbit’s teeth, gently part his lips in the front of his mouth and inspect his incisors. Looking at the front of your rabbit’s mouth, the incisors should be aligned with each other. From the side, the incisors should also look like they are aligned, but there will be a noticeable curve as well.Keep in mind that you will not be able to see the molars. Rabbit molars are in the back of their mouths and the veterinarian needs to use a special tool called an otoscope to be able to see them.;
, If you notice that one of your rabbit’s teeth is longer than the others or that it is pointed, then this indicates that there is a problem. A tooth that is longer than the other teeth or that has been ground to a point may be due to poor alignment.


If you notice any extra-long or pointy teeth, then you will need to take your rabbit to see a veterinarian and get a tooth trim.

, This is often called “slobbers” and it can be due to soreness. Make sure that you report this to your rabbit’s veterinarian.

, Swelling can also indicate a dental problem.If your rabbit’s cheeks appear to be swollen, then your rabbit may have an infection that requires treatment.


If one cheek looks larger than the other or you notice signs of swelling anywhere on your rabbit’s face, then take him to see a veterinarian.

,


If you notice any bumps along the jawline, then take your rabbit to see a veterinarian.

, Bad breath is also a warning sign that something may be wrong with your rabbit’s teeth.Try sniffing your rabbit’s breath to see if you detect a foul odor. Make sure that you report bad breath to your rabbit’s veterinarian as well.

You'll need the medication, clean tissue, and a restraint towel (if you're using one). Take the time to read the medication instructions thoroughly so you completely understand the directions.


Never leave your rabbit alone on a table or counter while you get supplies ready. Instead, leave her in her cage or hopping around until you're ready.Remember to wash your hands before administering any medication. This can prevent the spread of disease to your rabbit.;
, Choose a quiet area away from other people and pets so that your rabbit remains relaxed. Consider having another person nearby in case you need help restraining your rabbit. Make sure your rabbit is comfortable and not frightened by her surroundings.


Your rabbit can pick up on your attitude so be positive and give a lot of reassurance during this process. If you're stressed or anxious, your rabbit might be too so stop and try another time when you're both relaxed., One of the easiest ways to restrain your rabbit is to wrap her in a towel. Place a large thick towel across your work surface. Set your rabbit on it, about a third of the way towards the end. Wrap the short end of the towel snugly around your rabbit's body. Bring the longer end of the towel over your rabbit and tuck it snugly underneath her.With the towel technique, only your rabbit's head should be exposed. This will prevent her from kicking or squirming while you give her the medication.

, If you don't feel comfortable restraining your rabbit by yourself, you may want to get another person to help you. Have the helper hold your rabbit by taking a firm grip on her scruff (the skin behind the ears). The helper should wrap the free arm around your rabbit's body to cradle her.



Never lift your rabbit off of a surface by the scruff (or ears). This will injure your rabbit., If you don't need help restraining your rabbit and your pet is calm, try sitting on the floor with her. Set your rabbit in your lap so that her bottom is against your abdomen. Wrap an arm around her body to hold her snugly against your arm and body.


If your rabbit begins squirming and wiggling, wait till she calms down before giving the medication. If you feel uncomfortable restraining your rabbit, ask a veterinarian or vet tech to show you the best way to restrain her.

, Take the cap off the bottle or tube of medication. The medication will come in liquid or gel form. Gently pull your rabbit's lower eyelid so that a small pouch forms between the eyelid and the eyeball.


If you have a hard time doing this, you could try to pull the upper eyelid back instead so that you deliver the medicine directly onto the white of the eye., To deliver drops, carefully squeeze the bottle or tube so the correct number of drops fills the pouch between the eyelid and eyeball. To deliver ointment, hold the tube about an inch away from the corner of your rabbit's eye. Gently squeeze while moving along the edge of the lower eyelid so you end up with a long ribbon of ointment along the lid.Keep the nozzle of the bottle or tube pointed away from your rabbit's eye so that if she moves, you don't injure her.
Make sure not to touch the nozzle of the bottle or tube to any part of your rabbit’s body.

, Once the medication is in your rabbit's eye, gently massage her eyelid so the medication spreads around the eye evenly.Let go of your rabbit's eyelid and let her naturally blink a few times. Replace the cap on the medication bottle or tube for future use.


Take a piece of tissue and wipe anything that drips out of your rabbit's eye. This keeps medication from getting on her fur.

, As soon as the medication is in the eye, give your rabbit a treat for good behavior and release her from your hold. Immediately rewarding her good behavior will help her associate the medication with a positive experience.This is especially important if you'll need to give her medication for several days.


You may want to keep an eye on your rabbit and help her for a few minutes after giving the medication. Eye medications usually cause temporary blurred vision., If you've successfully given your rabbit the eye medication, but it doesn't seem like her symptoms are improving, contact your vet. Make sure you give the full dose for the prescribed amount of time. Contact your vet if you notice:


Change in tears
Change in the white of the eye
Color changes in the iris
Irregular edges to the pupil
Cloudy cornea

Look for scattered food in the rabbit hutch.Rabbits with dental issues may also scatter food in the hutch due to difficulty eating.,
Note any eye infections or eye discharge.,
Check for signs of poor grooming.,
Identify signs of pain or discomfort.Rabbits are not vocal about their pain, so your rabbit may show that she is in pain in subtle ways.",How to Diagnose Dental Problems in Rabbits2," Rabbits with dental problems are likely to eat less and start losing weight as a result.If you notice that your rabbit is not eating as much as he used to eat, then this could indicate that he has a dental problem.


Keep in mind that not eating can be due to other health issues as well. Make sure that you get your rabbit checked out as soon as possible if he is not eating well.

, If your rabbit stops eating a certain type of food and starts opting for softer foods instead, then this is a good sign that he may have a dental problem.

, If you notice that your rabbit has been making more of a mess than usual, then this may also indicate that he has a dental problem.

, Some dental problems may even cause eye infections or eye discharge.If you notice a white discharge coming from one of your rabbit’s eyes or if you notice swelling around one of your rabbit’s eyes, then this can also indicate that there is a dental problem.


Eye swelling due to a dental problem can lead to blindness if not treated.Seek treatment for your rabbit as soon as possible.

, Rabbits with dental problems can also start to have a hard time grooming themselves as well. If you notice that your rabbit’s fur looks messy or that his bottom is dirty, then this can also indicate a dental problem.You may notice cecotropes on your rabbit's bottom if he has a dental problem.Cecotropes are stools that contain partially digested food and that the rabbit needs to re-eat.

, For example, your rabbit may hide more than usual, grind her teeth, or seem reluctant to move.


These types of unusual behavior may also indicate other health problems. If your rabbit is displaying any unusual behavior, then have her checked by a veterinarian.

Explain the symptoms you have noticed.,
Ask for a trim if your rabbit’s teeth are too long.",How to Diagnose Dental Problems in Rabbits3," If you suspect that your rabbit has a dental problem, then you will need to take him to see a veterinarian. A veterinarian can perform a thorough exam of your rabbit and determine the best course of treatment. Other methods that your rabbit’s veterinarian may use include:


X-rays. If your rabbit’s dental disease is severe, then your veterinarian may need to take x-rays of your rabbit’s skull to determine how much damage has been done.
Blood tests. Your rabbit’s veterinarian may also need to do a blood test to determine if there is an underlying condition that may have caused your rabbit’s dental problems., Make sure that you give your veterinarian a full account of all of the symptoms that you have noticed. Mentioning the symptoms and behaviors that you have noticed will help your veterinarian to determine what is wrong with your rabbit.

, If you noticed that your rabbit’s incisors are too long, then a trim may be necessary to prevent further damage. Do to attempt to trim your rabbit’s teeth on your own. Trimming a rabbit’s teeth requires special tools and technique or the rabbit may suffer intense pain from the procedure."

Pay attention to prevent heatstroke.",How to Walk a Rabbit," If you plan to take your rabbit outside of your home, you’ll need a leash so that it doesn’t get away. Harness-style leashes are the best option for your bunny because they minimize the risk of discomfort or injury.Look for harnesses, which go around your rabbit’s chest and torso, in the rabbit or cat aisles of your local pet store. You want something that is lightweight and no more than 6 feet.Remember that your rabbit will technically be walking you. The harness and lead is simply to give your rabbit a gentle tug if he is going into danger, and to give you a feeling of being in control.
Try and find an H-style harness, which looks like an H when laid out flat.You can also get a figure-eight style harness, but be aware that there isn’t a consensus on whether they’re safe. These style harnesses can cinch your rabbit’s neck and cause injury.
Avoid collar leashes because your rabbit can easily slip out of them or get injured.;
, Once you’ve purchased the harness, you’re ready to put it on your rabbit. Making sure it fits properly can keep your bunny from escaping as well as prevent discomfort and injury.Kneel on the floor beside your rabbit and hold it gently, but firmly. Make sure to pet your rabbit and speak to it soothingly while you easy the harness on to it. Consider giving your bunny treats while you’re putting on the harness. This can help your rabbit associate the harness with a positive experience.Make sure the harness is snug, but not too tight on your rabbit.A harness that is too loose can result in your rabbit escaping and one that is too tight can cause discomfort or injury or may keep your bunny from moving., Your rabbit might be a bit resistant to its harness at first. Your rabbit may even demonstrate antics, which shouldn’t alarm you—you’re not hurting it.Giving your rabbit a few days to get used to the feel of the harness and associate it with something fun can make your walks enjoyable.


Take the harness off if your rabbit is reluctant to wear it. Try again slowly later the same day or even the next. Keep doing this until your rabbit feels comfortable with the harness.Attach the leash to the harness once your rabbit is used to wearing the harness indoors. Then let your rabbit drag the harness and leash behind him or her until he or she is used to the feel of a pull on it. You can do this by putting on the harness twice a day for 5-10 minutes for a week. Offer treats so that your rabbit moves and associates the harness with fun., Some local humane societies or even rabbit clubs may offer leash-training classes for your rabbit. If you are having trouble getting your rabbit used to the leash or just want some more information, consider enrolling in a leash training class. Call your vet, local humane society, or local rabbit clubs to inquire about upcoming classes., It will take a little while for your rabbit to fully adjust to walking with its leash and harness. This will give your bunny time to feel comfortable with the harness before you go on a longer walk outside.Give your rabbit 5-7 days of walking inside before venturing outside your home. This is especially important if your rabbit has never been outside. If this is the case, get your rabbit used to the outdoors by putting the cage outside in a pet-safe and shaded area and doing one of your daily walks in your backyard.

, Keep in mind that your bunny is fragile and needs a place to walk where it feels safe.It should be a place that you will walk regularly and won’t encounter things that may harm or startle your rabbit like a wide open space or another animal.Scope out potential spots while your bunny is still walking inside. Observe it for a few days to see what different types of traffic are there on a daily basis.
Look for a space that doesn’t have dogs or a lot of people. You may also want to find a place that has grass and dandelions as a snack for your bunny.
Ask yourself questions such as: When is this place most busy? Does the sun warm up the pavement, making it too hot for bare bunny paws? Is there broken glass or other rubbish lying around? Are there dogs or other predators such as birds and raccoons present?

, After you’ve found a regular place to walk your rabbit, it’s time to take it for walks outside. Don’t overwhelm your bunny with longer walks from the beginning. Instead, take your rabbit for a few short outings every day until it is ready to go on longer walks.Walk your rabbit a few times a day for just a few minutes. Make sure to stick to the same area you chose for walks so that it doesn’t distress your rabbit or you don’t encounter something unfamiliar.
Give your rabbit as much time as it needs to get used to shorter walks. Over time, it will get comfortable with walks and start moving on its own.
Offer your rabbit treats to get it to walk and help it associate walks with fun. You can phase out the treats as your bunny begins to move on its own.
Avoid pulling on the lead or trying to take the lead. Simply follow your bunny. If it seems to be heading toward danger, pick your rabbit up and soothe it.

, After you’ve taken your rabbit on shorter walks for a few weeks and phased out treats, it’s time to let your rabbit take the lead on “longer” walks. Take your bunny out for 10-20 minutes a couple of times a day and take the time to enjoy the fresh air and where your bunny is taking you.


Remember that bunnies may not move quickly—often only a few feet at a time. Be patient and avoid forcing your bunny with the leash so that you don’t injure or cause it to panic. If you need your bunny to move, pick it up gently with your hands. You can also coax it with a treat., Some bunnies don’t take to walking with a leash. If this happens with your rabbit, think about investing in an outdoor playpen. These can give your rabbit space outside to walk and hop about freely and safely.Find an outdoor playpen that has at least four walls and a top. The top can keep out predators. The walls of the playpen should be made of wire that is not wide enough for your bunny to escape or give a predator access.Supervise your bunny at all times if it is in an outdoor playpen. This ensures that no predators get close or your bunny is frightened by something.

, Whether or not your rabbit is leashed and out for a walk or in an outdoor playpen, it’s vital to your pet’s safely that you keep a close eye on it. This can prevent attacks by predators, your rabbit from escaping, or it getting tangled in the leash.Avoid staking your rabbit in the yard and leaving it alone. Your rabbit can get tangled in its leash, which can cause injury or even death. Predators can also snatch your rabbit or it may chew through its leash and escape if you are not watching.

, Many outdoor areas use pesticides and weedkiller on grass or in gardens, both of which are areas bunnies like to snack. These can harm or kill your bunny. Checking out the area properly before you start walking outside and keeping an eye out for spraying as well as new plant growth can prevent your bunny from ingesting dangerous substances.Find out public areas that have pesticides or weedkiller by calling your local county extension. You can find out your local county extension at http://npic.orst.edu/pest/countyext.htm.
Recognize that many plants may be poisonous to your bunny including: agave leaves, amaryllis, azalea, buttercup leaves, daffodil, eggplant, hyacinth, iris, ivy, jonquil, lily-of-the-valley, mistletoe, narcissus, ranunculus, sweet pea seeds, sweet potato, tomato leaves, tulip, wisteria.You can find a comprehensive list of plants poisonous to rabbits at: http://rabbit.org/poisonous-plants/.

, There are a wide variety of animals that are natural predators to rabbits. Dogs, birds, raccoons and other animals may harm your rabbit. Keeping an eye out for predators in the area where you’re walking can prevent injury or death for your bunny.Be aware that even if a predator doesn’t attack your rabbit, it can die from the stress of fear at a potential predator.

, Walking your rabbit outside, especially in the summer, can expose it to a host of bugs that can harm your rabbit. Keep bugs away as much as you can during the walk and look at your bunny’s skin when you get home for ticks or bites.Be aware that mosquitos and flies can bite your rabbit and transmit diseases such as Myxomatosis.Go over your rabbits fur gently to examine its skin when you get home. Look for ticks, fleas, or other bugs that can transmit diseases or cause your bunny discomfort., Heat is a very serious concern for rabbits that go outside. If the temperature outside is at or near 28 degrees Celsuis/ 82 degrees Fahrenheit, take care when walking your rabbit. Watch for the signs of heatstroke and take measures to reduce your rabbit’s temperature if you notice them.Recognize that the signs of heatstroke in a rabbit are: reddened ears, panting, lethargy, salivating, weakness and slow movement, acting confused, having seizures.Contact your rabbit to the vet as soon as possible if you notice any signs of heatstroke. While you are waiting, you can bring down the rabbit’s temperature by placing it in tepid water or wrapping it in cool, wet towels. Avoid placing a rabbit that is heat-stressed in cold or iced water."

Start conditioning your rabbit for the show a month ahead.,
Practice posing and turning over your rabbit.,
Brush and clean your rabbit well.,
Try to keep it in top condition for the week before the show.,
When transporting the rabbit, keep stress to a minimum.,

, The judges appreciate a rabbit that poses nicely and can be flipped over without struggling.

, You should do this every day for a month before the show. Give it an extra good cleaning the day before the show.

, Do not handle it too much, to avoid breaking hair shafts, which will knock you down on points.

, Stressed rabbits don't show well. When you get to the show, it will probably be noisy, so cover the rabbits carrier with a towel to help block sounds and keep it dark. Make sure the rabbit has access to water and a little something to nibble on (like an alfalfa cube) constantly while traveling.

, As soon as your rabbit has been judged, put it straight back in the carrier and cover it with the towel again. Try to keep him relaxed and quiet. Rabbits who are stressed at shows often pick up diseases. When the show is over, take your rabbit home and put him back in his cage.

This book describes every recognized breed and what it should look like. Having the standards for every recognized breed will allow you to figure out what breeds you like best and what they should look like.Having the standard will also help prevent you from getting a rabbit that will not do well on the show tables.
Breed standard books are typically available on the websites of breed appreciation groups, such as the American Rabbit Breeders Association.;
, The small-sized breeds (3 ½ - 6 lbs) are typically easy to handle for beginners. They also use less cage space and eat less food than the bigger breeds, so they are cheaper to care for and are a good choice to start with. Some of the small-sized breeds include:


Dutch
Mini Rex
Britannia
Holland Lop
Polish
Lionhead

, Do not get a dwarf breed rabbit unless you are experienced at showing rabbits or you are located near a competent breeder who can help you. These rabbits require skills to handle, breed, and pose. Overall, they can simply be more challenging to the beginner despite their smaller size.


If you really want to show dwarf rabbits, get some skills with small-sized rabbits first. Once you have some experience, you will then be able to care for and show dwarf breeds more successfully.

, Find a breeder online by looking at your state’s rabbit club website or the website of a national breed appreciation group. Try to find breeder listings for your area, as you will need to visit the breeder to assess the quality of their operation.If you are looking for a rare breed, you may need to travel to get one. Take this into consideration when contacting breeders.

, Once you have identified breeders in your area, or a breeder of a rare breed that you are willing to travel to meet, then you should contact them. Call them or email them and ask if they have rabbits available for sale. Be prepared to tell them why you want a show rabbit and why you want the particular breed that they specialize in.A good breeder will have as many questions for you as you have for them. They should be invested in the well-being of their rabbits. This means that they want to place them in the best, most suitable homes possible.
You may have to wait until the breeder has young rabbits available before scheduling a visit.

, A reputable breeder should be able to give you references of rabbit owners who have bought rabbits from them in the past. If a breeder cannot provide references, then you should look elsewhere for your rabbit.Once you have received the contact information for the breeders references, be sure to be professional when contacting them. Call them during daytime hours and ask questions about the person's interactions with the breeder, how satisfied they are with the rabbit that they purchased, and whether they would purchase a rabbit from that breeder again.

, When you talk to a potential breeder you should ask if you can see where they breed and take care of their rabbits. If they don't want to let you see their operation, then find a different breeder. If they agree to let you visit, then they probably have a relatively ethical and sanitary breeding operation.


However, first impressions count. When you visit, assess whether their rabbitry is clean, organized, and well-kept. If it is dirty, smelly, and full of unhealthy rabbits, then do not want to buy from the breeder.

, Ask about how the breeder shows their rabbits, how they condition them, and how they breed them. This is extremely valuable information learned over many years of trial and error. It can save you much time, money, and heartache to buy a rabbit from a person that is skilled at breeding instead of someone who it not experienced.If the breeder is calm, knowledgeable, and is prepared to stay a long time to see if this is the rabbit for you, chances are you have found a good rabbit breeder!

, When selecting a show rabbit, you should be able to choose between at least several rabbits. Interact with all of the rabbits and narrow down your choices by feeling the rabbit's bodies, noticing their personalities, and identifying ones that you generally like the look of.Oftentimes, if you are offered just one specific rabbit, this is the last of a litter and it may not be up to the breed standards of others that were in the same litter.
Make sure that the rabbits the breeder is selling are at least 8 weeks old. Rabbits that are younger than that should stay with their mother.
Some questions to ask yourself when assessing the rabbits for sale include: Is it friendly? Does it come and greet you or does it run and hide? Does it bite or scratch you? Will it allow you to flip it over? These will help you to assess whether a rabbit has the potential to be shown.

, Pet the rabbit and inspect its fur. In most breeds, the fur should snap back into position when you stroke it backwards (tail to head). The fur should also be soft, free of knots or mats, and there should be no bald spots on the rabbit.


Check the Standard of Perfection or the ARBA website for rules on fur for the breed you are getting before you pick a rabbit. The rules could include coat length, color, and pattern requirements. Check that the under-color (color of its belly) is correct, and that all markings are the right size, shape, and color.

, A good show rabbit should have eyes that are clean, free of discharge, and bright. The color of the eyes should also conform to the standard for the breed. The nose should not be runny and its top teeth should overlap its bottom teeth. Also, its ears should be parasite and wax free, so look inside them while assessing a potential rabbit to bring home.Any sign of illness should be enough to eliminate a potential rabbit. You want to bring home a rabbit the is in perfect health, so a runny nose or gooey eyes should not be tolerated.

, Its back should be strong and firm, not bony, lumpy or crooked. The rabbit’s body should be firm, not soft and flabby. The legs should be straight. Every rabbit should have five toes on the front feet and four on the back feet and all the toenails should be present.Some rabbits have different shaped backs and may feel skinnier than others, so check the Standard of Perfection (SOP) or ARBA website for the details.
There should be white toenails on white breeds and varieties and colored toenails on colored breeds or varieties.
In a very young rabbit, the body might not be very firm, but it should not be flabby.

, Listen to the rabbit's breathing. The rabbit should have very quiet breathing. It should also have firm, dry stools, so try to inspect its feces as well. Overall, there should be no signs of illness or injury.Rabbits do sometimes get urination stains on their feet. This does not mean they're sick.
It is important not to buy a sick rabbit. It can infect your whole rabbitry and can lead to heartbreak down the road if the rabbit doesn't survive or is in pain due to illness.

, If everything with a rabbit looks good, ask to see the rabbit’s pedigree and its parents and litter mates, if possible. Ask about any Best in Show, Best of Breed, or Best of Variety wins. If there is a history of winning in the pedigree, odds are you have a rabbit that could win.


Just because you get a rabbit that has show winners in its pedigree, that doesn't automatically mean that your rabbit will be a winner as well. However, it does increase your chances of having a winner.
You will need to have a pedigree for your rabbit to register it for shows. Make sure to get a copy when you purchase your rabbit., Once you decide to buy the rabbit, ask the breeder to tattoo it in its left ear. Most breeders do it themselves. You must have a tattooed number or letter sequence if you are to show in ARBA shows. This gets written on the pedigree so you can identify your rabbits easily.At rabbits shows, there may be eighty rabbits of the same breed and color, and you don’t want to get yours swapped up with someone else’s. The tattoos help to keep the rabbits straight.

For younger rabbits especially, pellets are a vital component of a healthy diet.Pellets should have at least 18% fiber. They should also be nutritionally balanced. You can talk to your vet about the right type of pellet for your rabbit's needs.
Younger rabbits who are still growing will generally need more pellets. If your rabbit is older, you'll want to give him less pellets and feed him vegetables and hay as a supplement to his diet.;
, Rabbits need access to hay 24 hours a day. Hay is great for nesting, and also aids in digestion. Go to the pet store and pick out a bag of high quality timothy or oat hay. Make sure there's always a few piles of hay present in your rabbit's cage so he can eat and nest as he pleases., Rabbits love vegetables, and they're also a great component of a healthy diet. In addition to spoiling your rabbit with quality hay and pellets, it's a good idea to give him fresh vegetables each day. Alfalfa, beets, broccoli, pea pods, lettuce, green peppers, kale, and carrots are some great options to spoil your rabbit.Make sure to cut bigger veggies up so your rabbit can easily eat them. Also, file down any harsh edges so your rabbit doesn't hurt his teeth or gums while chewing.
You should also pay attention to the types of vegetables your rabbit likes if you want to spoil him. If he's largely disinterested in lettuce, but goes crazy for kale, give him kale more often. Your rabbit will feel happy and spoiled if he gets to load up on his favorite foods all the time.

Not only can brushing help you feel close to your rabbit, it can also prevent issues like fur balls.Brush your rabbit about every 3 days. When your rabbit is shedding, brush him slightly more. You can use a slicker brush, which you can buy at most pet stores, to brush your rabbit.Brush your rabbit going in the direction of his fur. Use slow, gentle motions so your rabbit enjoys the experience.

, A massage is a great way to spoil your rabbit. It can help him relax and bond with you. It will also make him feel comfortable, promoting circulation and increasing the range of the joints in his muscles.Slowly run your fingers over your rabbit's nose, and then move them over his head and body. Work your way all the way down to his tail.
Make circling motions with your fingers over your rabbit's cheeks, as well as between his ears.
Not all rabbits like being handled extensively. If you just got your rabbit, it may take him some time to get comfortable with your touch. You may want to wait to massage your rabbit until he comes to you on his own. If your rabbit growls or clicks his teeth, you should stop massaging him.

, Rabbits are social creatures and love to play games with their owners. If you want to spoil your rabbit, schedule some time to play each day. Rabbits love to knock things over, throw things, and chew. Play games that cater to these instincts, always setting aside a small pocket of your day to play with your rabbit.You can set up miniature bowling pins for your rabbit. You can usually buy these in a department store, in the toy section. Rabbits love to knock things down, so your rabbit will love pushing over the bowling pins after you set them up.
You can provide a variety of cloth and plastic toys for your rabbit, which you should be able to find at a pet store. Many rabbits enjoy picking things up and throwing them. You can allow your rabbit to throw his toy, and then retrieve it for him.
Provide toys for your rabbits to chew on as well, as rabbits love to chew. Give them old rolls from paper towel and toilet paper, as well as boxes of shredded paper.

, Rabbits can develop very affectionate bonds with their owners. However, you need to let your rabbit come to you on his own terms. Try to get down on the floor, on your rabbit's level, and let him out of his cage. Make sure the room is closed off, quiet, and free of distractions. Wait for your rabbit to approach you and only then should you try petting and snuggling him.Rabbits enjoy different things, so it may take you awhile to see what kind of petting your rabbit enjoys. If your rabbit enjoys a form of petting, he may close his eyes in contentment and rest on the floor.
Some rabbits are more social than others. Certain rabbits may get in your lap while you're sitting down, while others may keep a slight distant. If you want to spoil your rabbit, make sure you allow him to set the rules. Allow your rabbit to come to you on his own terms, and pet and snuggle him in ways he enjoys.
Watch out for negative body language. This is a sign your rabbit is agitated. Rabbits may growl or grind their teeth when stressed. They may also kick their feet in the air while walking away from you. If your rabbit engages in these activities in response to petting or cuddling, stop. Your rabbit is telling you he does not like being handled in that way., If you want to spoil your rabbit, give him a lot of space. A large cage will keep make your rabbit happy, allow you to spoil him. Swing by your local pet store and pick up a spacious cage for your pet.As a general rule, the bigger the cage the better. Try to get the biggest cage you can safely fit in your home. You can try getting a cage separated into different compartments, allowing your rabbit to move from one space to the next.
Some people allow their rabbits to roam about their home, or have one room designated as a rabbit safe space. This can be great for your rabbit, especially if you don't have the money or space for a larger cage. However, if you make this choice, rabbit proof that area first. Make sure no electric cords are exposed without proper covering. Provide a litter box, so your rabbit has somewhere to eliminate. You should also supervise your rabbit when he's loose to make sure he doesn't dig at the carpet or chew on the furniture.

, Rabbits also need a variety of toys to stay engaged and happy. You should strive to get toys of a variety of texture. Just make sure any toys are made from non-toxic material, as rabbits are prone to chew.Things like wooden boxes, balls, parrot toys, and stainless steal measuring cups will entertain a rabbit for a long time. You can purchase these items at a pet store or supermarket.
Rotate toys every few days. Rabbits will get bored with the same toys after awhile. Every couple of days, switch out the toys you have and replace them with new ones.

, You can also make toys for your rabbit. With old material from your home, you can spoil your rabbit with a variety of homemade toys. Rabbits are big fans of materials like wood and cardboard, so reusing old materials can really spoil your rabbit.Rabbits love disassembling and chewing. Take a few old toilet paper roles and place them in an empty tissue box. Your rabbit will love removing all the toilet paper roles and then gnawing on the cardboard.
Weave leafy greens into a slinky. Then, hang the slinky from somewhere in your home or in your rabbit's cage. Your rabbit will love munching on the greens while chewing on the slinky. Make sure to supervise your rabbit when he's playing with this toy, however, to make sure he doesn't get tangled or caught.
Buy a few wooden boxes from a craft store, as well as a wooden board. Make sure the boxes have lids. Using non-toxic elmer's glue, glue the boxes onto the board. Put some vegetables, treats, or fruits inside the boxes. Allow your rabbit to rummage through the boxes in search of the treats.

, Rabbits are outdoor animals by nature, so it may be a good idea to let your rabbit roam outside on occasion. However, if you're going to allow your rabbit access to the outdoors, take certain precautions.You can set up a pen in a flat area in your yard. Make sure the area is free of any potentially toxic plants. Also, make sure any gaps in the fence are small enough that your rabbit can't escape.
A few times a week, let your rabbit play in the pen. You'll want to supervise him the entire time to make sure he doesn't get loose. Some rabbits may try to dig under a pen. If you see your rabbit digging, stop him.
You can also buy a small harness for your rabbit at a local pet store. You can take your rabbit on short walks around your backyard. However, be careful if there are any dogs or cats that occasionally roam your neighborhood. They may see your rabbit as prey.

Pay attention to the rabbit's appetite.,
Make sure your rabbit is still producing pellets.,
Be on the lookout for unusual behavior.,
Feel the rabbit's belly if you suspect stasis.,
Check for dehydration.,
Keep a close eye on rabbits who have been frightened or shocked.,
Keep an eye on rabbits that have gotten into food they shouldn't eat.,
Take your rabbit to the veterinarian immediately.,
Talk to the vet about the possible cause of the illness.,
Ask the vet whether further testing is necessary.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Gastrointestinal Stasis in Rabbits," The rabbit's natural diet of grass and herbage is high fiber and low calorie diet. This requires the rabbit to eat for most of the day (up to 20 hours). Thus, the digestive tract is never empty but always moving food through it on a conveyor-belt type mechanism.If your rabbit is eating less often, you should be concerned about stasis. This means that you need to pay attention to how much and how often your rabbit is eating when it is healthy.;
, The production of pellets signals that food is making its way through your rabbit's digestive system. If for any reason the muscular contractions in the bowel stop, the gut contents stagnate and cause digestive problems.


You should pay attention to how many pellets your rabbit produces in a normal day so that you will be able to tell if it is producing fewer.

, It helps if the owner is familiar with the rabbit's character and habits, because the first sign of a problem may well be that the rabbit becomes quiet and withdrawn. The rabbit may spend more time hiding in its hutch or otherwise trying to avoid being seen.


You may hear the rabbit grinding their teeth, which is a sign of pain., The rabbit's belly may become distended and hard due to gas accumulation. Feel for this hardness and notice if the rabbit is unusually uncomfortable when you attempt to feel their abdomen., The rabbit will become dehydrated if it has GI stasis. To check for this, lift the skin over the scruff of the neck and let it go. In a well-hydrated rabbit the skin snaps straight back. If dehydration is present it takes a few seconds to fall back into place.

, The scenario of a shock or fright inducing GI stasis is an accurate one. This is because the 'fight or flight' hormones that are released when a rabbit is fearful, such as adrenaline, direct blood away from the bowel and reduce the muscular contraction.Similarly, anything that causes pain or anxiety can have a the same effect. Typical triggers include a visit to the vet (especially for surgery), a change of routine, weather extremes, the loss of a companion, or a fright or shock. , Some foods can make GI stasis more likely. Rabbits are not designed to eat carbohydrate rich foods, as carbohydrates inhibit the release of a hormone called motilin, which is responsible for gut motility.


Thus, avoid giving a rabbit processed human food or compounded rodent foods that are high in carbohydrate.

, If you suspect your rabbit has GI stasis you have no time to waste. The risk of GI stasis is so great that any rabbit that does not eat or pass droppings for 24 hours should be assumed to have stasis and taken to a vet.This condition is a self-fulfilling prophecy because the act of not eating creates stasis, so even if it wasn't present initially, if the rabbit doesn't eat stasis develops within a day or so., The vet will take a history and ask questions about any recent events that may have stressed the rabbit, as this could act as a trigger. The vet then performs a physical examination of the rabbit, including checking teeth and looking for any problem which might act as a source of pain for the rabbit. Again, this could be a trigger factor.The vet will then feel the rabbit's belly, and be alert for excessive gas build up, tenderness, and any possible blockage in the bowel.
The vet may also listen to the abdomen with a stethoscope. This is because GI stasis is often accompanied by a unique sound, a bit like water sloshing around in a bucket. It is caused by fluid in the gut sloshing around in the gassy environment.

, Given a history of appetite loss and no fecal pellets, most vets start treatment immediately. However, the vet may want to take an x-ray to check for bowel obstructions, which are usually a result of the stasis rather than the cause.If a blockage is present, the vet will attempt to treat the stasis first. The vet will then reassess the rabbit to see if surgery is necessary or if the gut has started working again., The treatment involves giving the rabbit prokinetic drugs, such as metoclopramide, which stimulate the gut wall and encourage it to get moving again. It's also essential to keep food going into the gut, as the physical presence of cellulose can stimulate the gut wall. A slurry of pellets softened with water can be syringed into the rabbit's mouth regularly, to provide this stimulation.If the rabbit is dehydrated then intravenous fluids may be required, or fluids injected under the skin.


Pain relief is also important, as GI stasis is a painful condition. Injectable painkillers are usually the treatment of choice.

Decide on whether to keep your rabbits indoors or outdoors.,
Choose a proper cage.,
Build your rabbits a run.,
Make your rabbits comfortable.,
Feed your rabbit what it needs.,
Give your rabbit fresh water daily.,
Empty your rabbit's litter box every 2-4 days.,
Remember that rabbits are coprophagic.,
Clean your rabbit's cage about once every week.,
Give your rabbit plenty of attention.,
Brush your rabbit at least once every week.,

Trim your rabbit's nails as needed.,
Do NOT bathe your rabbit.",How to Raise Rabbits," Some rabbit breeders prefer outdoor living quarters, as it allows rabbits to experience fresh air and sunshine. Many outdoor rabbit cages include an attached, fenced-in run, as space is less of a concern outside the house. Other experts say that because rabbits are social creatures, they might benefit more from being indoors and around humans.


If you decide to keep your rabbits outdoors, it's important that they are kept out of the sun and rain.
Outdoor rabbits need to be given extra bedding when it's cold out. If temperatures dip below freezing, consider moving the rabbit hutch to a more protected environment, like a garage or shed.Be aware that being outdoors leaves rabbits vulnerable to predators--even the sight of a predator can cause heart attacks in caged rabbits.;
, Consider the size of the cage, so your pets have enough room. Also consider the floor of the cage: rabbits do not have padded feet like cats or dogs, and standing on a wire floor can be painful for your pets.Cages should be large enough for your rabbits to stand upright, lie down, and move around freely.If using a wire cage, be sure to put a board or mat down on the floor of the cage so your rabbits' feet will not get sore or stuck between the grates., Your pets will need daily exercise, and a run allows your rabbits to move around without getting anywhere in the house that could be dangerous. A rabbit in the wild may cover hundreds of feet in a given day, so having room to roam safely is crucial for your pets.


If you don't have room for a run indoors, you can put a run in your yard. The run should be spacious, but it should be secure in case the rabbit or rabbits try to escape. Always keep the run in the shade and supply water. If there is no shade in your yard, you may need to put a detachable ""roof"" over the run., Try to keep your rabbit in a cool, low-humidity environment, ideally between 60-70 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5-21.1 degrees Celsius). Set up your rabbit's cage in a quiet part of the house or yard, and be sure that your rabbits won't be harassed by other animals.Allow your new rabbit to acclimate to your home before you introduce it to larger pets like dogs. This can be stressful and overwhelming. Allowing rabbits and other pets to mingle is important, but it should be done gradually and under close supervision., A rabbit's diet should consist of grass, fresh vegetables, and timothy hay or oat hay. You can also feed your rabbit store-bought pellets.High-fiber pellets should be offered daily, but in small quantities to prevent health problems. Rabbits under four pounds can be given 1/4 cup of pellets. As a general rule, you can add another 1/4 cup of pellets daily for every additional two pounds of body weight on your rabbit.Young rabbits can be given alfalfa hay, but alfalfa is not a healthy option for adults. It's recommended that you switch your rabbit to timothy hay before it reaches one year old., It's important to change your rabbit's water everyday to prevent bacteria from growing. If you use a water bowl, choose one made with ceramic or metal, as these are easier to clean. If using a sipper bottle, check the drinking end every day to be sure that it is working properly.Some pet owners prefer sipper bottles because they cannot be easily tipped over in the cage. Choose a water container that works best for you and your pet.

, This will not only reduce the risk of unpleasant odors, it will also keep your rabbit healthy and happy.If you are just starting out training your rabbit to use a litter box, you should be able to tell which corner your rabbit goes in to relieve itself. If you put some newspaper or a litter box down there, your rabbit will quickly learn to use the box.
You may want to scoop out urine-soaked litter on a daily basis to keep your rabbit clean and keep the litter box smelling fresh.

, Rabbits excrete two kinds of droppings: fecal pellets (round, hard, dry waste product) and cecotropes (large, soft, light-colored droppings).The digestive system of rabbits requires that the animal eats its cecotropes in order to adequately absorb and digest the nutrients found in food.When cleaning out the litter box, remove hard, dry fecal pellets, but be sure to leave cecotropes behind. These ""droppings"" are an essential part of your pet's diet.

,


Use white vinegar to clean your rabbit's litter box, or soak it for stains that are tough to remove.Spot cleaning should be done daily.Clean the cage out while your rabbits are in the run.
Change soiled bedding daily. Straw makes an excellent bedding material and is easy to change every day.Clean out the food bowl and change the food daily. Do not overfeed your rabbit. Food portions should be commensurate with the size and weight of your rabbit.

, Rabbits are social animals, and you will need to handle your rabbit gently and frequently in order for it to grow comfortable being picked up., Long-haired rabbits will need daily brushings and will also need regular trimmings to keep their coats around one inch or shorter., Do not use scissors, as rabbits can injure easily., If you are uncomfortable doing this on your own, you may take your rabbit to a veterinarian or to an animal groomer to have this done., Bathing can be very traumatic, and is often unnecessary, as rabbits tend to groom themselves. If you notice a soiled area on your rabbit, you may want to spot-wash it with a wet towel, but do not submerge your rabbit in water."

Any rabbit whose ears lop down the side of his head, rather than pointing up, is a lop. There are around 19 different breeds of lops, each with different sizes and characteristics.English lops and Miniature lops (known as Holland lops in the US) are popular as pets.
Contact a local breeder, animal rescue centre, or pet shop.
Rabbits live for around nine to eleven years, and require attention and care for all of these years. They are active and need space to run around.;
, Before you go ahead and get a rabbit you need to be sure that you can afford to keep it. The price of a lop can vary, but you should expect to pay somewhere between $15 and $60.As well as buying the rabbit you will need to spend approximately $90 for a cage, $30 for a carrier and $25 for a litter box. This is just to get you started.


You should expect to have an average food bill of around $800 a year, and factor in $300 for toys and treats on top of that.
After this add on $125 for a basic veterinary checkup with a rabbit-savvy vet, but keep in mind that rabbit veterinary medicine is a specialized field, and most vets do not know how to properly treat rabbits. It's crucial to have your rabbit spayed/neutered if s/he isn't already when you adopt him/her, and this often costs around $300. Illness or injury can run from $500 up into the thousands. Be prepared in case your rabbit becomes ill; the first sign of symptoms means it's an emergency as rabbits hide signs of illness until they are crucially ill.
Don't forget $400 a year for litter., Rabbits are small creatures, but they are very active with strong and powerful hind legs that are designed for running and jumping around. As such they need lots of space to move around freely. The minimum recommended exercise pen for a single rabbit of a small to medium-sized breed is four feet wide and six feet long.Do not use a wire cage! If you must use a wire cage be sure to cover the bottom of the cage with cardboard, or a piece of wood, covered over with bedding to protect their feet. Rabbits' feet are very delicate and can become inflamed and quickly infected from standing on wire.

, Although it is quite common for rabbits to be kept in outdoor hutches, it is now advised that you opt to house them indoors. An outdoor hutch isolates sociable creatures and exposes them to dangers of predators. Even if they secured in a hutch, a rabbit can die from a heart attack brought on by an approaching predator.Keeping them indoors means they can interact with you and your family.
A secure and warm environment where they can run around is highly beneficial.

, In addition to a pen or condo if you cannot allow your rabbit to free roam, you will need to litter train your rabbit. Rabbits cannot usually be litter trained until after they are spayed/neutered. A large litterbox is important for your rabbit's hygiene.

, Hay, and/or grass, are the most important elements in a rabbit's diet. Rabbits are grazers so it's essential that you have plenty of hay for them to nibble on throughout the day and night. A rabbit needs a good intake of grass or hay to keep their digestive system working properly.You should ensure that there is fresh hay available to your rabbit at all times.


Your rabbit will eat a bundle of hay about the same size as him every day.Liberally spread the hay around the hutch and litter tray area. Rabbits like to eat hay while they are resting. Putting hay in these places will encourage them to eat plenty of it.Rabbits tend to graze the most at dawn and dusk.

, You should check your rabbit's water supply twice and day and top up as required. If your rabbit is outdoors take care to ensure that the water doesn't freeze in cold weather. Inadequate water supplies can seriously harm the health of your rabbit.You can use either a water bottle or a dish, the most important thing is the constant supply of fresh water.


Drinking from a dish may be more natural for your rabbits, and you might find they prefer this. The down side is that water in a dish will easily become soiled with bedding.It's a good idea to monitor how much they drink. A sudden drop off in the amount of water they drink can indicate health problems.

, A rabbit should have a diet that combines good quality dried food (often referred to as pellets), fresh hay, oat hay, fresh vegetables and water.You should follow the manufacturer's instructions for pellets, but it is advised not to just keep re-filling their bowls. If you do this the rabbits may end up not getting enough hay.


Look for pellets with 15-19% protein and 18% fibre.The amount of food required will vary for rabbits of different ages.But after your rabbit is fully grown (around six months), he should not be given more than between 1/8 or 1/4 cup each day per for every five pounds he weighs., Fresh leafy greens should account for around a third of your rabbit's diet. He'll enjoy lots of different greens, including dark leaf lettuces, collard greens, turnip greens and carrot tops. The amount your rabbit will eat depends on the age and size, but as a basic guide, it is recommended to provide two cups of greens per six pounds of rabbit weight each day.Fresh herbs are also a good choice.
Be sure they are washed and cleaned before giving them to your rabbits., Sometimes you will want to treat your rabbit with a piece of fruit or a root vegetable. Rabbits do not eat these naturally so you should limit the amount you give them. Avoid treats other than fruit and root vegetables, as they harm your rabbit.Some appropriate treats include strawberries, pineapples, apples, raspberries and pears.


You should not give your rabbit more than two heaped tablespoons of treats per 4 pounds of body weight. Banana slices should only be given very occasionally.Be sure you remove the pips from fruit such as apples and pears. These can be poisonous for rabbits.
Some common plants, including egg plants, tomato plants, and potato plants can also be harmful for your rabbit.
Do not feed your rabbit anything that contains chocolate or caffeine, bread, grapes or raisins., Rabbits should be kept with at least one other friendly rabbit. They are sociable animals and like to be with other rabbits. A good combination is a neutered male and neutered female of the same size and breed. If rabbits are left alone for long periods they can develop abnormal behaviours.Allow your Lop to choose its own companion, if possible. Some rescue organizations may allow you to introduce your rabbit to other rabbits before adopting.
For a bonding session you need to put two rabbits together in a neutral space with toys and treats to make it an enjoyable time. Watch over them and see how they get along., You should supply an abundant amount of safe and chewable toys for your rabbit. Some safe chew toys include simple things like cardboard boxes, or even an old telephone directory.You could also give them an old cotton towel to chew on, as long as you don't mind it getting chewed to bits., As well as being chewers, rabbits are diggers. It's in their nature to dig, so it's important to give them opportunities to do it. They won't be digging holes in your floor like they would outside in the wild, but you can simulate it with a digging box. You can put together a digging box simply getting a good size cardboard box and filling up halfway with shredded paper.If you don't mind the mess, you could even put soil in the box.

, It's very important to provide places where your rabbits can hide. They do this if they are feeling afraid and it's nothing to worry about. They need to be able to hide when something scares them or they will become stressed. The hiding places should have two entrances/exits and be high enough for them to run underneath.Have at least one hiding place per rabbit.
If you have more than one rabbit also provide a place big enough for them to hide together.
As a prey species they need to be able to hide somewhere away from the sight and smell of predators.
Even if they are totally secure in your house, you still need to provide hiding places.

, You should take your rabbit out of its cage every day so he can run around and get some exercise. Rabbits are very active animals which need frequent exercise ideally in a large space. They are most active early morning, late afternoon and overnight when they like to forage, graze and socialise.It's important to rabbit proof your home so that he is safe before you do this.
Rabbits should be able to exercise for several hours a day., Rabbits are sociable creatures so it's important that spend some time with them. Interact with them regularly to help you bond. Try to put some time aside every day to be with them, even if this is just sitting in the same room while he is roaming about. If you are watching TV you might find him climb onto the sofa to say hello.

, Rabbits need to be handled carefully and with sensitivity. Move slowly and talk quietly around him and lower yourself down to floor level. If he is comfortable with being handled you can slide one hand underneath his rib cage and gently lift him while you scoop up his rear with the other hand. Slowly lift him up to your chest and hold him gently but firmly, with one hand supporting his hindquarters at all times. You can help him feel secure by holding all four of his feet against your body.It's best to start handling you rabbit at a young age so they get used to the contact. If you have a rescue rabbit who is not used to being handled they might find it distressing.
Never pick up a rabbit by its ears, and ensure that children are supervised when around your rabbit.

, You should regularly clean out your rabbit's housing and its litter tray. It's important to provide a well-kept and clean environment for them to live in. You can empty out and replace soiled bedding every day and it won't take long. Give the cage a more thorough clean once a week.


Once a month, or every two weeks if needed, you should completely clean out the cage, scrubbing it throughout and letting it dry.
Only put the rabbits back in once the cage is completely dry.

, It's good to regularly brush your rabbit with a soft brush to remove any excess hair. Moulting hair can build up in mats and cause sores to develop if you don't groom him sufficiently.Brushing will generally help to keep his coat in top condition. When you are brushing go from the back of the head down to the tail.


Be gentle and patient with your rabbit. Different rabbits will respond to being brushed in different ways.You can also clip your rabbit's nails, but you should speak to your vet before attempting this.

, Bathing should be done in a way that doesn't alarm the rabbit. Make sure he has secure footing at the bottom of the bowl, and the water is warm. The biggest risk would be him taking fright, jumping out of the bowl or bath, and injuring himself. Keep bathing to a minimum so only when his fur is soiled or there is another compelling reason to bathe him.


You can also spot clean him by sprinkling a little baby cornstarch onto his fur and working it through with a fine flea comb.Instead of dipping him in water, try dampening a cloth with warm water and moistening the fur, trying not to let the skin get wet.
Dry him off with a hair dryer set to the lowest setting always being gentle and sensitive., It's recommended that you bring your rabbit to your local vets for a check-up at least once a year. In between these times you can help by observing your rabbit and watching out for any signs of ill health. If you think he might be ill make an appointment with the vet as soon as possible. Symptoms to look out for include:


Your rabbit stopping eating.
Your rabbit not having a bowl movement for twelve hours or longer.
Watery diarrhoea.
Runny nose and eyes.
Dark red urine.
Fur loss, or red and swollen skin.
Lethargy."

But if your rabbit usually leaps around and greets, but suddenly ceases to do so, this is an indication that something might be wrong. Watch for signs that your rabbit is less mobile than usual, such as hunching over or limping. , If your rabbit is not eating normally, it might be ill. Watch for leftover food from the last feeding. Also, monitor its droppings. If there are no droppings in the litterbox this indicates that the rabbit is not eating. Be attentive to the size and shape of the droppings. Ideally the droppings should be large and round. If they are are small, irregular, or liquid, it is possible that your rabbit is sick. , Your rabbit will often make a soft, grinding sound with its teeth when it is happy. However, if the sound is louder than normal it could be a bad sign. Often this is an indication that your rabbit is in pain., Begin by offering your rabbit its favorite treat. If it refuses to eat the treat, it might be sick. Move on to testing the rabbit’s temperature. If it is well, the temperature should be between 101⁰F-103⁰F.


You should ask your veterinarian to demonstrate how to take your rabbit’s temperature. If you do this in advance of any signs of illness, you will be prepared in case of emergency.
To take your bunny’s temperature you will want to place it on its back, either on a padded surface or your lap. Hold your rabbit’s head and shoulder against your stomach, so that its back curls into a “C” shape. Secure the rabbit’s back legs so that it does not kick. Once it is calm insert a lubricated plastic thermometer no more than one inch into its rectum. Be sure that the rabbit is well restrained and is not able to move while you take its temperature.Do your best to cool your rabbit off if it has a high fever by putting cold objects up against its ears until the temperature drops to less than 104 degrees., Dental disease can be caused by a misalignment of the teeth or the wearing down of a tooth. This can be a dangerous situation. It can cause your bunny to stop eating, endangering its health.Signs of tooth disease include loss of appetite, hair loss on chin and neck, slobbering, and drooling.Your rabbit might still show signs that it has an appetite, but is unable to eat. Perhaps it will approach food, even pick it up, before backing off and dropping it.
If you believe that your rabbit might have tooth disease rub its cheeks. Any evidence of discomfort would suggest that it has a dental problem., Until you can reach a veterinarian, try to force-feed your rabbit canned pumpkin, baby-food, or veggies. You can purchase a feeding syringe from a pet store. These can be used to insert fluid directly into the rabbit’s mouth.


To prepare for syringe feeding, wrap your rabbit in a towel and secure its head with an index finger under the head, and the thumb on the opposite end of the head, under the base of the skull.Insert the syringe into the gap between the incisors and cheek teeth. Begin by inserting no more than .2 to .5 ml of food and never feed more than 1 ml. Too much food at one time creates the risk that the rabbit will choke. Go slowly. Then repeat with 5 to 10 ml of water., Ultimately your rabbit will need professional assistance. Because of the variety of possible dental issues, treatment varies. If you do not do so already, you should begin yearly dental examinations to ensure that there are no future complications., As with many other disorders, gas pain will cause lack of appetite. What will distinguish gas pain, however, is a loud gurgling sound in the gut. Your rabbit might also stretch out, as if it is pressing its belly against the floor.Gastrointestinal problems are usually accompanied by a drastic, sometimes complete decrease in fecal production. Keep your rabbit comfortable and hydrated until you get to the vet.
Gas pain will typically cause below average body temperature. If your rabbit’s temperature is below 101⁰F, it is might suffer from gas pain

, You should try to counteract the rabbit’s drop in temperature. Try putting the rabbit on a warm (not hot) heating pad or a hot-water bottle wrapped in in a towel. You can also warm the rabbit with your body heat, holding it close to you for an hour or longer., A gentle belly message can help relieve the pressure of the gas. Massage frequently for periods of ten or fifteen minutes. For at least part of this period you should have hindquarters elevated., Head tilt is a frightening disorder, also known as wry neck, typically caused by an inner ear infection. Your rabbit will lose its sense of balance. It will look dizzy and uncoordinated. Its head will twist and its eyes might dart quickly from one direction to the other., There is nothing you can do to reduce the effects of head tilt at home. But you should do your best to prevent your rabbit from hurting itself. Make a box well-padded with towels or another soft object. You want to make sure that if your rabbit falls over or jumps into a wall, it does as little damage as possible.If your bunny seems to be physically unable to eat, feed with a syringe as described above.

, Head tilt can be a persistent condition, often lasting for several months. Some veterinarians without experience with it will recommend that you euthanize your bunny. However, if you are persist, the condition can often be treated., Wrap the paw in a clean towel and apply pressure. Stop applying pressure when the bleeding stops. Afterwards, keep the broken nail clean. Clean the litter box and cage bottom repeatedly so that bacteria doesn't enter the wound.


You can also rub styptic powder, plain flour, or a bar of soap on the end of the nail to help stop the bleeding., There is little you can do to fix a broken bone. Take your rabbit to the vet immediately if it has broken a bone. If your vet is not available, take the rabbit to an emergency clinic. Until the injury is attended to by a professional vet, try to keep your rabbit from moving around.


Place food and water close to the rabbit in an enclosed space. This way it will not need to move to take care of itself., It is tempting to give your bunny an eye drop, but this can cause considerable damage.All that you can do before going to a veterinarian is wet a cotton ball with warm water and gently wipe your rabbit's eyes to remove build-up.

, Rabbits often bite each other. While the wounds themselves might not appear bad, they often carry bacteria that can make for a dangerous situation. You should see a veterinarian after any bite wound. In the interim period, try to stop the bleeding and prevent infection.


Apply pressure with a towel or gauze to stop bleeding.
Once bleeding has stopped, wash the area with Nolvasan. Then apply Neosporin, triple antibiotic ointment. Do not use Neosporin Plus.

Compare prices.,
Use coupons.,
Buy food in bulk.,
Don't buy low-quality food.",How to Save Money on Rabbit Care1," Don't just buy your rabbit's food at the pet store closest to you. If you want to save some money, you should compare prices at various stores in your city and from online suppliers. If you can easily get food at a cheaper price, then it is worth the effort to shop around.


When shopping online, remember to take shipping charges into consideration when comparing prices. The list price may be lower than at your local store, but shipping costs may increase the overall cost.;
, There are mailing lists and email lists that will send you coupons for rabbit food and supplies. If you have a food that you always feed to your rabbit, consider getting on the mailing list of that company. They may send you coupons or offers for discounts.Depending on where you buy your rabbit food, sometimes coupons can be doubled or increased with a combination of manufacture and store coupons. Research your stores coupon policies and use them to your financial benefit.

, This is a particularly good idea if you have multiple rabbits that eat a lot. While buying in bulk does require room for food storage, and it can result in stale or spoiled food if it is not eaten fast enough, in the right situation it can save you a lot of money.Even if you only have one rabbit, buying a larger bag of pellets is always cheaper than buying a really small one. Buy the biggest bag you can, being sure that you will use all the food before it expires or gets stale. This will take some figuring out, estimating how much food your rabbit eats and how long food lasts.

, It may seem like common sense to save money by buying your rabbit cheap food. However, cheaper food is often low quality food, meaning that it will not give your rabbit proper nutrition. Cheap food often contains fillers and ingredients that are not good for your rabbit, so you are basically paying for junk food.


Avoid giving your rabbit food that does not give it proper nutrition because it will cost you more in the long run in veterinary bills and medication. Consider high-quality food an investment in your rabbit's future health. Not to mention that your goal should always be to keep your rabbit healthy and well fed."

Take your Rex rabbit to see a veterinarian.,
Get your Rex spayed or neutered.,
Play with your Rex rabbit.,
Stop your Rex from chewing on off-limits items.,
Cover up electrical cords.,
Brush your Rex rabbit as needed.",How to Care for Rex Rabbits1," Try to find a veterinarian who has an interest in rabbits and who is comfortable providing veterinary care for rabbits as well. You might need to seek out an exotics veterinarian or at least find a veterinarian who has done some ongoing professional development on rabbits. Take your Rex rabbit for annual checkups and watch for any signs of a problem. If your Rex rabbit seems like he is sick, then take him to see a veterinarian right away. Signs that your Rex might be sick include:losing lots of fur
not going to the bathroom
not using back legs or not hopping
producing dark red urine or no urine
seeming extra tired and not moving or reacting normally
having loose stools
having a fever of 105 degrees Fahrenheit or higher
having runny eyes and/or nose
drooling (wet chin);
, Spaying and neutering your rabbit helps to prevent unwanted litters and it can also protect your rabbit’s health in certain ways. If you do not plan on breeding your Rex rabbit, then get your rabbit spayed or neutered.


Not spaying and neutering predisposes your rabbit to hormonal behaviors, like urine spraying, food guarding, and fighting. Female rabbits also have a higher risk of uterine cancer if they are not spayed., Your Rex will need to get plenty of exercise to stay healthy. Try to allow your Rex at least two hours of exercise outside of his cage every day. When you exercise your Rex, make sure that you:Do not let your rabbit play outside. Your rabbit will be in danger from predators and parasites if you let her play outside. Inside of your home is the safest place for your Rex rabbit.

Confine your Rex to one or two rooms. You can use baby gates to keep your rabbit from getting lost in your house and to make it easier to supervise her as well.

, A Rex rabbit will chew on almost anything, including door edges, wall trim, chairs, table legs, area rugs, loose carpeting, or loose wallpaper.That is why it is so important to monitor your rabbit closely when she is playing outside of her cage.


If you notice your Rex rabbit chewing on something that she shouldn’t, don’t get mad or punish your rabbit. Just gently pick up her up, place her somewhere else, and then give her something else to chew on, such as a cardboard box, cotton cloth, or an apple slice.

, Your Rex rabbit will also chew on electrical cords, which can harm her and damage your electronics. Cover up electrical cords with hard plastic tubing or some spiral wrap. If you don’t have something to cover your electrical cords, then just lift them off of the ground so your rabbit can’t access them., Your Rex rabbit will need a quick brushing about once per week to keep him from shedding as much and to keep his fur soft. Run a natural bristle brush or comb over your rabbit’s fur about once per week.Don’t let your Rex rabbit get wet and do not bathe him. Rabbits are not fond of water and they can also develop hypothermia if they get wet.

Build your own hutch or cage.,
Buy products wherever they are cheapest.,
Buy supplies in bulk.",How to Save Money on Rabbit Care2," Buying a commercially made rabbit hutch or cage can be expensive. Instead, find plans online and build your own. Depending on the specific plans, you will only need basic carpentry tools and supplies that can be bought at your local home improvement store.When you don't pay for a commercially made hutch, and you build one instead, you are basically eliminating paying for labor. Instead, you are doing the labor of building the hutch or cage yourself.

, Not all supplies for a rabbit need to be bought from a pet or farm supplier. Instead, find products that can be used for a variety of purposes at stores that are not just for pets. For example, cleaning supplies, such as white vinegar, can be bought at any store and they are often cheapest at a big box or discount store. Vegetables, which should be included daily in your rabbit's diet, can be bought from a wide variety of stores.For products that are commonplace, such as white vinegar, be willing to buy generic brands. Be careful, however, about buying generic if the products will actually be of poor quality.

, More so than with food, supplies for a rabbit can often be bought in bulk. You can buy supplies through a wholesaler in bulk, paying way less than you would at a pet supply store. This can be done easily if you buy through a wholesaler already, for instance if you buy farm supplies already you can buy your timothy hay through that same wholesaler.Try going in on supplies with other bunny owners. If you can't justify buying in bulk for just one rabbit, search for others that own rabbits and are also looking to save money.
Buying through a wholesale supplier cuts out the middle man, making products cheaper because they are not marked up by an additional business.

Give your rabbit preventative care.,
Take your rabbit to a veterinary school for treatment.,
Apply for financial help with veterinary costs.",How to Save Money on Rabbit Care3," While it may seem counter intuitive, spending money on preventative veterinary care can save you a lot of money in the long run. Get your rabbit regular checkups so that any medical issues can be caught before they become serious issues. This will hopefully save you the cost of expensive surgery or veterinary care in the future.For example, having your rabbit's teeth checked regularly will reduce the risk of overgrown teeth, which is a serious health problem for rabbits as it impacts their ability to eat properly.

, If your town or city has a veterinary school, they may give treatment at a reduced rate at a low-cost clinic. Call the school in your area to see if they do low-cost appointments or search online to see if one is nearby.Be sure to take your rabbit to an accredited school that gives students proper training and supervision when treating patients., If you are in a financial situation in which you cannot afford to get your rabbit veterinary care, there are some organizations that may help you by offsetting the cost. Search online for these organizations, either through the website of a local or national organization that works to help animals."

Keep your Rex rabbit indoors.,
Choose your Rex rabbit’s cage.,
Provide a hiding spot for your Rex rabbit.,
Place a litter box in your rabbit’s cage.",How to Care for Rex Rabbits2," Keeping your Rex rabbit outside is a bad idea because rabbits are prone to attacks from predators, overheating, hypothermia, and loneliness. Your Rex rabbit will be at a higher risk of an early death if you keep her outside instead of inside your home.Even if your Rex rabbit is safe inside of her cage, rabbits frighten easily and she may have a heart attack from just seeing a predator.
Your Rex rabbit may also develop some antisocial behavior if you keep her outside. For example, she may start to fear people or become aggressive.

, There are lots of different rabbit enclosures to choose from. You can keep your Rex in a single room of your home that has been rabbit-proofed, house your rabbit in a puppy playpen, get a rabbit condo, or select a standard cage.When selecting an enclosure for your rabbit, make sure that you consider:



Size. Your rabbit’s cage should be four or five feet long and about two feet wide. The cage should be high enough for your Rex rabbit to stand up on her hind legs without her ears touching the top of the cage.Floor. Avoid wire bottom cages because they can hurt your Rex rabbit’s feet. Try to find a solid metal bottom cage. If you cannot find a solid metal bottom cage, then you can cover the bottom of the cage in a piece of plywood that covers the entire floor of the cage.Bedding. Cover the floor of your Rex rabbit’s cage with at least two to three inches of bedding. You can use straw, paper pulp, or shredded cardboard.Do not use cedar or pine shavings as your Rex rabbit’s bedding or as litter. Your Rex rabbit may develop respiratory and liver problems from these materials., Rabbits like to hide to when they feel scared or stressed, so it is important to provide your Rex with a hiding place. A cardboard box or a wooden box that has a hole cut out of it makes a good hiding spot.Provide a hiding spot for each rabbit that you have, otherwise they may fight over the spot.

, Rabbits will use a litter box if one is provided for them. Put a small litter box in one corner of your rabbit’s enclosure and fill it with some newspaper and hay. Make sure that you change the litter box every day to prevent it from smelling.Pay attention to where your rabbit likes to go potty and then place the litter box in that corner.
Keep a litter box or two in your house so that your rabbit will have somewhere to go when she is playing outside of her cage.

Feed your rabbit lots of hay.,
Give your Rex some rabbit kibble.,
Offer your Rex some veggies and fruits.,
Keep your Rex hydrated.,
Prevent your Rex from eating certain foods.",How to Care for Rex Rabbits3," Hay is an ideal food for Rex rabbits because it provides nutrition and it also wears down your Rex rabbit’s teeth, which are always growing.Make sure that your Rex rabbit has a large supply of fresh hay at all times.Refill your Rex rabbit’s hay at least once per day.
Timothy hay is a good variety for your Rex.
Try stuffing an empty paper towel roll or a cardboard box with hay for your Rex rabbit.

, Rabbit kibble is a nice nutritional supplement for your rex, but you do not need to give him a lot of it. You can give your Rex about ¼ cup of kibble every day unless your veterinarian says to do otherwise. Make sure that you get the plain kibble and not the mixed kind because some rabbits will pick out the tastiest parts and leave the more nutritious ones behind.


An overweight rabbit may only need 1/8 of a cup of kibble. If you your rabbit is not gaining weight properly, then he may need more than 1/8 of a cup. Ask your veterinarian if you are not sure how much kibble to give your rabbit., Rex rabbits enjoy munching on dark leafy greens, carrots, and some fruits. Try to give your Rex rabbit a few leaves of dark leafy greens each day as well as something crunchy, like carrot slices or apple slices. Some healthy veggie and fruit treats for your rabbit include:arugula
broccoli stems
collard greens
kale
bok choy
carrot slices
apple slices
banana slices

, Rex rabbits need plenty of fresh, clean water. Although Rex rabbits enjoy drinking out of a ceramic dish, these can tip over and make a mess in the cage. If you do go with a dish, make sure that it is heavy and check it often. Another option is to use a sipper bottle for your rabbit’s water. Sipper bottles will not tip and your rabbit will not be able to kick hay or feces into the water either.


Refill your rabbit’s water often and clean the dish or bottle out daily., Some foods can make your Rex rabbit sick if she eats them, so do not offer these foods to him. Never give your rabbit human foods except for the fruits and vegetables that they can tolerate. Other foods to avoid giving your rabbit include:broccoli
cabbage
cauliflower
brussel sprouts
spinach

Feed the mother a quality diet.,
Separate her from the male rabbit.,
Prepare a nest box.,
Check the kits.,
Warm the kits if necessary.,
Provide the mother constant access to food and water.,
Look for signs of nursing.,
Contact your vet immediately if the mother isn’t nursing.,
Keep the nesting box clean.,
Adapt the diet of the kits.,
Handle the babies beginning at eight weeks.",How to Care for Newborn Rabbits," Your rabbit’s diet will not vary much while she is pregnant or weaning, but it is as important as ever to provide high-quality nutrition. Check your feed label and provide a feed that is:


16 to 18 percent protein
18 to 22 percent fiber
3 percent or less in fat
She should also have constant access to clean water, which you should change two to three times per day.
You can supplement her diet while she is gestating and weaning the kits (babies) by giving her some alfalfa hay or cubes to provide more protein.;
, It is uncommon for the male rabbit to harm the kits. However, he can impregnate the female again as soon as she gives birth, resulting in another pregnancy before she finishes weaning the first litter. To avoid this, you should separate the two rabbits as birthing draws closer.Ideally, you should keep the male close enough to make contact with the female through their separate enclosures. Rabbits bond very closely and still being close to the male will cut down on unnecessary stress for the female during the pregnancy and birth., Kits are born without fur and will need constant warmth initially. Providing a nest box with bedding materials will help keep the kits warm and collected in one place. This small box (cardboard is fine) should be slightly larger than the mother with about a one-inch lip to stop the kits from getting away from the box.Put a generous handful of grass (make sure no fertilizer or pesticides are present), straw, or hay in the box as well for bedding.Put the bedding on top of a clean towel without any loose threads that might catch on the kits.The female might rearrange the bedding in the box or even pull out some of her fur to add to the bedding, which is usually a sign that the birth is close.Make sure you place the nesting box on the opposite side of the cage from the mother’s litter box to help avoid any complications for the kits.You should also place the cage in a quiet, darkened space. Too much activity around the mother and her new kits will cause her undue stress., The pregnancy for your doe will last roughly thirty-one to thirty-three days.She doesn’t need any help with the birthing process, which usually happens at night or in the very early hours of the morning. This means you’ll likely wake up one morning to the new litter of kits. Immediately check to see if any of the kits did not survive the birth. You may have to draw the mother away with a treat to get access to the nest box to remove any of the dead kits.


You should also remove any placenta or afterbirth from the box.
Don’t be afraid of handling the babies as the mother will already be accustomed to your scent.

, If the mother gave birth to any of the kits outside of the nesting box, then you’ll have to place them in the box. These kits will often be too cold and need warming. To do so safely, fill a hot water bottle with warm (not hot) water and place the bottle under the towel and bedding in the nesting box. The kits should not have direct contact with the bottle since this will likely be too warm., The doe will need constant access to food and water to eat at will while she’s nursing the kits.This is to ensure she produces enough milk to adequately feed the litter. Put out plenty of fresh food daily and check her water often, as she’ll drink more more than normal as well.


Ensuring that she receives proper nutrition will also help reduce the possibility of the mother cannibalizing the kits.

, The doe’s natural instinct is to stay away from the nest most of the time, so don’t be alarmed if you don’t actually see her nursing, which will only happen once or twice a day.Instead, look for signs that she’s nursed. The babies will be warm and have round tummies from feeding.They’ll also be quiet instead of making mewling noises like a kitten if they’re well fed., If the babies are weak (barely respond to being handled), have sunken tummies, and have wrinkly skin (caused by dehydration), then the mother isn’t properly nursing them, and you should see your vet immediately.If the mother set up the nesting box—especially if she pulled some of her fur—then she’s paying attention to her mothering instincts. The problem may be as simple as your vet providing a small dose of oxytocin to help with milk production.You should also contact your vet if the litter is more than eight kits, as this may be too large a number for the mother to support all of them. If the mother has more than eight kits or she abandons the litter and will not nurse them, then your vet will likely provide instructions for bottle feeding the babies. However, results are often unsuccessful because there is no formula 100 percent adapted to newborn rabbits., The babies will toilet in the box until they are strong enough to eventually climb out of it on there own, so you’ll need to clean the box daily, providing a new, dry bottom towel and clean bedding.

, The babies may begin nibbling at pellets as soon as two weeks after birth.However, they should not stop nursing for a full eight weeks after they’re born.During this period, the babies will slowly decrease nursing and increase their consumption of pellets, but it’s important that they continue to nurse as well as the mother’s milk provides antibodies against pathogens.If they are weaned too soon, their immune systems might not yet be strong enough without these antibodies.


You should additionally avoid feeding the rabbits greens for several months due to the potential for digestive complications. You can try tiny bits of one item at a time starting around two months, but remove it from the rabbit’s diet immediately if it causes intestinal problems such as diarrhea.Good items to start with include carrots, romaine lettuce, and kale., Until they’re weaned, the babies will be highly susceptible to illness and bacteria, especially E. coli, which can kill a kit in a matter of hours.You should thoroughly wash your hands anytime that you need to handle the babies until they’re weaned. After that, try to handle them often because it will lead to tamer adult rabbits down the line.

Give all medication as directed by your veterinarian and for the time period indicated.Veterinarians prescribe medication to rabbits for a variety of different reasons. Oral medication comes in both pill and liquid form.
If you have questions about the medication, how to administer it, or anything else, talk to your vet.;
, Before you give your rabbit the medication, carefully read the instructions on the pill vial or liquid container thoroughly. This ensures that you fully understand any specific instructions and how to administer the medication.Double check the dosage requirements so you give your rabbit the proper amount of medications.

, Before getting your rabbit ready for the medication, make sure you gather all the needed materials. You don’t want to have to leave your rabbit to go find something you need after you restrain her. Have the medication, any syringes and droppers, and a restraint towel available before catching the rabbit.Consider having good treats ready to reward a cooperative rabbit after the medication session.

, Your bunny is extremely sensitive to stressors. This means you need to keep her as calm as possible while administering the medication. Keep any extra people or other pets away from the area to keep a relaxed atmosphere., Measure out the proper amount of medication in the provided delivery device. This is usually a syringe or a dropper for liquid medication.


Make sure to keep a good hold on your rabbit while you are measuring out the medication so she doesn’t hop away.

, Liquid medicine can be hidden in favorite treats and fed to the rabbit. Bananas and raisins are good for this.Applesauce, strawberries, and other highly desirable treats can also be used to administer medication.
You can squirt the liquid medication onto the treat, especially if it is a wet treat, like applesauce.

, If your bunny needs to take a pill, you can try to work the pill in between the corner of the mouth. Be careful to keep your fingers away from the teeth.If this doesn’t work, give it to her in your hand like a treat.
You can hide or press the pills into softer treats, like bananas and strawberries.You can also sprinkle crushed pills onto a treat., If the bunny won’t take the pill, you can try to crush the pill. Then, you can sprinkle the pill over some food, like peanut butter, or mix it into treats, like applesauce.This can help prevent choking if your rabbit won't take a pill.

, If your rabbit is aggressive, resistant to taking her medication, or won't eat the medicine in the treats, you should restrain her. When you restrain your rabbit, you will be swaddling her in a towel or large cloth.You can also find a restraining jacket in a pet shop to place your bunny in.
Properly restraining your bunny is one of the most important parts of giving medication to a rabbit. An improperly restrained rabbit can kick out with its back legs and hurt itself to the point of breaking its back.
If you are uncomfortable with restraining your rabbit, have a veterinarian demonstrate how to do so.

, You need to use a towel large enough to wrap around your rabbit. Before you pick up your rabbit, place a large, thick towel on your working surface. Make sure to spread it flat.You can use a towel, blanket, t-shirt, or other kind of cloth.
The working surface can be the floor or a table top. Decide which will give you enough room to work on and which be easier for you to work on.

, Rabbits get upset quickly. Make sure to pick your rabbit up gently and calmly. You will have an easier time wrapping up your bunny if she is calm instead of agitated.Be aware your rabbit may bite or scratch you when you handle her. Remaining calm can help reduce this risk., Gently set your bunny on the towel. Since the towel is spread length-wise in front of you, place the bunny ⅓ of the way down the towel.


Your rabbit should be placed so ⅓ of the length of the towel is on one side of the rabbit, and ⅔ of the length of the towel is on the other side. The two ends should be long enough to wrap over the rabbit.
Handle your bunny so that you protect her hind legs. Rabbits can easily hop or jump, which can cause spinal injury.When you set your rabbit down, you need to calmly hold her in place. Put one hand on the scruff of her neck and the other hand on her hip, or place both hands on her shoulders. This not only helps prevent her from escaping, but it can also help to calm her., Take hold of the short end of the towel. Pull it snugly around your bunny’s body. You should wrap it around the neck, leaving the head exposed. Tuck the end under the rabbit’s body. Next, take the longer end of the towel and wrap it over the body. Snugly tuck it beneath your bunny’s the body.Only the rabbit’s head should be exposed.
You can also continue wrapping the towel by tucking the bottom of the towel around the rear to keep your bunny from escaping from behind.

, If you don’t want to wrap your rabbit in a towel, or you have someone who can help you, try the helper technique instead. Start by recruiting a person to help you. Have the helper hold the rabbit on the table by taking a firm grip on its scruff, which is the skin behind the ears. He should then wrap his free arm around the rabbit’s body to cradle it. This free arm should support the hind legs.Never lift the rabbit off a surface by the scruff or ears. This can injure your rabbit.

, It's common for a bunny to resist taking medicine even when it's hidden in treats. If this is the case, you can squirt liquid medication into the bunny's mouth with a syringe.Start by holding your bunny, making sure the back legs are secure so the bunny doesn't injure herself.
Carefully place your non-dominant hand over the bunny’s head to hold it still. Don’t put too much pressure on the head. You are just trying to keep the bunny from turning away as you administer the medication.

, Place your thumb and fingers on your bunny’s face just above the mouth. Use your thumb and finger to gently lift the lips or cheeks of your bunny. Do this gently and calmly.Make sure to keep your fingers away from your rabbit’s snout and teeth so she can’t bite you.

, With liquid medication, the nozzle end of the syringe or dropper can be gently worked in between the corner of the mouth. Place the nozzle in at an angle right behind the front teeth. This helps keep the medication from going into the lungs.Then slowly squirt the medicine into the mouth.


Make sure to squirt the medicine in the mouth slowly. If you go too fast, the liquid may go into the lungs, which can cause asphyxiation. Don’t squirt the whole syringe into her mouth at once.
Don’t shove the syringe or dropper too far into the bunny’s mouth. You could choke her. Just put it in enough so that the medicine gets in the mouth so she can swallow."

However, unlike dogs, rabbits do not aim to please their owners and can thus be difficult to train.They do not have a natural instinct to obey,so your rabbit will not stop chewing the carpet simply because you tell him not to.


Training your rabbit to stop chewing the carpet will involve not only making the carpet undesirable, but also redirecting his chewing behavior towards something more appropriate.
Positive reinforcement is an important component of training your rabbit. Rewarding him when he chews on something more appropriate, through such activities as head scratches and extra petting,will help train your rabbit to stop chewing carpet.;
, Training your rabbit to stop chewing carpet primarily involves making it undesirable or unattainable to him. One way to do this is to block his access. When your rabbit is chewing the carpet, pay attention to where he tends to chew. After identifying the problem area, find ways to keep your rabbit from that location, such as covering the area with a big piece of furniture (e.g., couch, reclining chair)., If moving heavy furniture is not practical for you, place smaller objects in the area where your rabbit likes to chew. For example, cover the problem area with heavy ceramic tiles. The tiles would hold the carpet down and prevent your rabbit from getting a hold of the carpet.You can also cover the area with a cardboard box. Weigh down the box with something heavy inside, such as an empty flowerpot, so your rabbit can’t push it out of the way.Place some ‘digging’ material (e.g., shredded newspaper or magazine) in the box to foster your rabbit’s natural digging habit.Place some rugs in the problem area. Make sure the rugs are made of natural material in case your rabbit decides to chew on them.If your rabbit can’t get to the carpet, he will eventually get bored and forget about the area altogether.Covering the area with different objects is a temporary solution.If you choose, cover the areas only when your rabbit is playing outside of his cage.

, If blocking access is not possible, you can make the carpet taste bad enough for your rabbit to stay away from that area. For example, spray bitter apple spray in your rabbit’s favorite chewing location.Bitter apple spray is available at your local pet store.


Ivory soap can also keep your rabbit from chewing the carpet. Your rabbit won’t get sick from eating the soap,but he probably won’t like the taste.
Break the soap into small sections and spread it along the area of carpet where your rabbit likes to chew.

, Chewing is not only a natural and normal activity for rabbits, but is also necessary to keep their teeth worn down. In addition to training him to stop chewing your carpet, you will need to give him chewing alternatives, such as fresh hay and untreated grass.Good types of hay are orchard grass, oat, and timothy. Replenish the supply a few times a day.Grass mats, which are available at your local pet store, are also good for your rabbit to chew on.The grass should be untreated to prevent your rabbit from ingesting harmful chemicals.
Compressed alfalfa cubes make another great chewing alternative., Rabbit-specific chew toys, such as wooden chew sticks, will also keep your rabbit from chewing your carpet.Willow sticks and wicker toys are other good choices.Examples of other chew toys are willow bridges, willow balls, and a hideaway made of wicker or grass.Make sure the wooden toys are made with untreated wood to prevent your rabbit from ingesting harmful preservatives or varnishes. Be aware that the willow or wicker in home decoration stores are often covered with these substances.Rabbit-specific chew toys are available at your local pet store.

, You do not have to spend money on chew toys for your rabbit. Chances are you have some household items for him to chew on. For example, empty toilet paper rolls and cardboard boxes make great chewing alternatives.Make sure the cardboard box does not have any heavy ink, varnish or staples.To keep your rabbit entertained, stuff some hay or grass into the toilet paper roll.Old blankets and cotton towels also make good chewing alternatives., Your rabbit will love to chew on branches. However, you should not go out and randomly pick some branches from the trees in your yard—they may be toxic to your rabbit. Know which branches are safe and unsafe for your rabbit.


Rabbit-safe woods include willow, apple, maple and birch.Unsafe woods include cherry, holly, yew, and rosewood.Some fruit tree branches (apricot, peach) are toxic only when they are attached to the tree. After the branches are cut and dried for about a month, they will be safe for your rabbit to eat.If you decide to pick branches from your yard, pick a tree or bush that is far away from the road and exposed to less car pollution.If you are unsure if the branches in your yard are rabbit-safe, visit your local pet store or home gardening store to purchase branches.

, House rabbits often resort to chewing carpet when they are bored or frustrated.To keep your rabbit interested in the chewing alternatives, switch them out every few days.Consider giving your rabbit a variety of toys each time you replace them.
Replace any chew toys that start to show signs of wear and tear.

, Disciplining a rabbit for bad behavior (e.g., clapping hands, saying ‘no’) is usually not very effective.Instead, give him praise and positive attention when he chews on what you have given him.Not only is discipline ineffective, it can also be stressful to your rabbit. If you try to punish him after you see him chewing the carpet, he will not know what he is being punished for and will feel stressed.Rewards can take the form of verbal praise, extra petting, and healthy treats.

, Rabbits are intelligent and social animals. Without attention and activities to keep him mentally alert, your rabbit can develop destructive habits, such as chewing carpet, to get your attention.Playing with your rabbit each day will give him the attention and mental challenge he needs to stay occupied and away from carpet chewing.


The mornings and evenings are good times to play with your rabbit.Do not interrupt your rabbit to start playing with him. For example, if he is eating or grooming, let him finish that activity before starting playtime. You can even leave the cage door open so he can come out to you when he’s finished and ready to play.When you play with your rabbit, get down on his level so he will feel comfortable with you. Although he may not necessarily want to jump in your lap, he will feel safer if you are not towering above him., Rabbits must have playtime outside of their cages each day. Not only does this give you an opportunity to interact with your rabbit, but it also gives him some much-needed exercise. Put a variety of toys in the play area, along with different items that your rabbit can dig in and chew on.Always supervise your rabbit when he is playing outside of his cage.‘Rabbit-proof’ the area by removing or covering electrical cords and covering wooden furniture legs with plastic or bubble wrap.Leaving a play area set up for your rabbit can keep him busy and physically active when you are away from home.

, Your rabbit may have the best toys in the world, but that doesn’t mean he should always play alone. Come up with different games that you can play with him. For example, play fetch with your rabbit, during which you are the one catching the toy.Rabbits like to pick up toys with their teeth and toss them across the room with a flick of the head. Small toys for birds are good for playing fetch.Try bowling with your rabbit. Purchase some plastic bowling pins and set them up in the play area. Your rabbit will enjoy knocking the pins down with his nose, and you will have fun watching him do it.Let your rabbit ‘steal’ things out of your hand and run away with them. This may not seem like much a game, but it will certainly keep your rabbit entertained.Choose an object that you wouldn’t mind your rabbit stealing, such as a piece of junk mail.

, In addition to playing with you, your rabbit may also enjoy playing with another rabbit. Having another rabbit to play with could keep your rabbit from getting too bored or frustrated.If your rabbit doesn’t seem to enjoy playing as much as he used to, a rabbit playmate could help get him excited about playing again.When you are looking to buy another rabbit, consider taking your rabbit along with you.Purchase the other rabbit through a shelter or rescue group rather than a pet store. Rabbits in pet stores typically come from mass-breeding facilities and can have digestive problems.The staff at the rescue group or shelter can teach you how to introduce the rabbits and determine if they are a good match for each other.

While your cat is not intimidated by you as you approach, a rabbit likely is. In order to establish that you are not a threat to your rabbit, take your time with it.Start by sitting next to the rabbit while it is still in its cage and let it get accustomed to your presence. Speak to it so it can get used to the sound and vibration of your voice.
Give the rabbit treats like bits of banana or apple.
After the rabbit is accustomed to having you around, open the cage and pet it softly to demonstrate that you are not a threat.;
, In order to establish the trust you need your rabbit to have for you, you should spend time with it every day. Trust takes time, and you need to continue to spend time with your rabbit to maintain it.Try to spend several minutes a day with your rabbit to establish and maintain trust.
Incorporate other people so the rabbit learns to trust people, instead of just you.

, If your rabbit scratches at you when you try to remove it from its cage, it may be because rabbits are very territorial animals. Giving your rabbit domain over its cage may reduce its aggressive tendencies.Instead of opening the cage and taking the rabbit out, try opening the cage and allowing the rabbit to leave on its own.
Using treats to entice the rabbit out of the cage is a great way to give it the space it wants while still removing it on your schedule.

, Rabbits are keenly aware of their surroundings and will recognize changes in your body language. If you want to indicate your displeasure with something the rabbit is doing, change up your body language so it recognizes a difference.Stomping your foot is an audible way to get the rabbit’s attention and demonstrate that you are not happy with what it’s doing. The rabbit may react fearfully to this the first few times, so be sure to give it space.
Turning your back to your rabbit will let it know that you are unhappy with it and over time can adjust the rabbit’s behavior.

, Rabbits are not able to understand English commands like other species, but you can demonstrate your displeasure with your rabbit’s scratching by using the same audible sound and tone in conjunction with stomping your foot or turning your back.Say no with the same tone and volume each time you use it.
Using it in conjunction with stomping or turning your back will help establish that hearing your say “no” is a negative thing on par with other methods you use to train the rabbit.

, When your rabbit does scratch you, the way you react can teach it what does and does not work. While negative reinforcement does not work with rabbits, ignoring them does.If the rabbit scratches you to get your attention or voice its displeasure with a situation, ignore it.
If you react, the rabbit will learn that scratching is an effective method to get your attention.

, Although you may be tempted to swat at your rabbit when it scratches you, doing so will only reinforce the rabbit’s fears that you are a threat. Hurting the rabbit will cause it act more aggressively in your presence.Even just tapping your rabbit on the nose could lead the rabbit to believe that you are a physical threat, causing it to scratch to try to get away from you.
Your rabbit must feel comfortable in your presence in order to prevent bad behavior.

, Rabbits can become dramatically more aggressive once they reach four months of age, as this is when they enter the mating stage of their life. If you do not have your rabbit fixed at this age, hormones can make the rabbit very aggressive.Rabbits are calmer and more docile after being fixed, which makes them better pets and reduces problem behavior.
Fixing your rabbits will make it so you can safely keep more than one rabbit together without violence or reproduction issues.

, While rabbits may be capable of experiencing anger, it is highly unlikely that your rabbit is angry or doesn’t like you. It’s much more likely that your rabbit is simply afraid.Young rabbits may not know the difference between you and a predator, so they may try to escape your grasp by scratching or biting.
Only once a rabbit is comfortable around you will it stop scratching to escape.

, Rabbits do not possess the intelligence of most dog breeds, so training a rabbit in a similar fashion will not yield similar results. Rabbits are, first and foremost, wild animals that are concerned with survival.


Rabbits are not extremely trainable animals, so you should still keep things you don’t want scratched or bitten out of their reach.
“Rabbit-proofing” your house by limiting the rabbit’s access to things you don’t want ruined is the only completely effective way to prevent rabbits from scratching or biting through things you don’t want them to.

, Rabbits don’t perceive the world in the same way that you do. Rabbits think in terms of patterns. They observe your behavior as well as their own, and come to expect the same results from the same behavior.If your rabbit regularly scratches you, pay attention to what you are doing leading up to it scratching. You may be frightening it without realizing. Once you note what of your behavior elicits the rabbit's scratching, try not use that behavior anymore.
Understanding that rabbits learn in patterns can make it easier to train the rabbit. When it scratches you, turn your back and say no. When it doesn’t scratch, reward it with affection. Eventually it will learn the pattern.

, While rabbits can learn not to scratch, changes don’t happen overnight. Continue to exercise the methods you choose to teach the rabbit that scratching isn’t appropriate behavior until the rabbit’s behavior actually changes.Use the same methods to indicate the rabbit is misbehaving consistently to help it learn faster. If you choose to stomp and say no, do that every time. Switching it up will slow the learning process.
It can take weeks for a rabbit to develop trust, then longer for it to change its behavior based on your training.
Remember that you aren’t just changing the rabbit’s behavior, you are changing its perception of the world and reducing its fear of humans. Such deep changes take time.

The minimum cage size for a single rabbit is 12 square feet. However, to give it a comfortable spot to live, the cage should be wide enough that the bunny can stretch out fully, high enough that his head doesn’t touch the ceiling when he stands on his hind legs, and long enough for him to hop three to four lengths when up and about.The cage needs enough room for your rabbit to stretch out. The minimum width of the cage needed for a Thrianta rabbit is two feet, while the length needs to be at least six feet so he can hop three to four times in the cage. The height needs to accommodate your rabbit standing on his back legs, so the cage should be two to three feet tall.
Consider making the cage a little bit larger than the minimum. The cage needs to have space for a litter box, his food and water dishes, and a resting box. Ideally, make the cage at least twice the minimum recommended amount of floor space.
You can make the living space from a hutch, a small shed, or a roomy dog crate.;
, Your rabbit needs an exercise space in addition to his cage. This exercise space needs to at least be 32 square feet. You can make an exercise area from a run, an aviary, or even a wire pen. You can set up a spare room to let your rabbit run freely in without having to set up a cage or an exercise area at all.For example, you can set up an area that is eight feet by four feet. You can also give your rabbit a six feet by six feet space.

, Your rabbit’s cage needs a solid floor, like a piece of carpeting or wooden flooring. Fleece fabric can also work since it won’t leave strings in the digestive tract if your rabbit eats it. Do not have a cage with a wire floor because they can give your rabbit sores on the bottom of his feet.Smaller rabbits, like the Thrianta, may get their feet stuck in the wires and injure themselves.

, Your rabbit’s living space needs bedding. This will be where your rabbit sleeps. Your rabbit will eat the bedding, so it should be edible. Good materials to make bedding out of include meadow or timothy hay, natural fiber blanket, pelleted paper, or other organic products.Your rabbit should have enough bedding in the cage so he can move it around and burrow in it.


The bedding should be checked daily. Clean the bedding as often as necessary. If your rabbit is going to the bathroom in his bedding, he needs a larger area to roam and exercise. Unclean bedding can lead to fleas, flies, and other pests, causing health problems.
Harmful bedding products for your rabbit include straw, cardboard, newspaper, wood shavings, sawdust, cat litter, or cedar or pine products.

, You can choose to let your rabbit live outdoors or indoors. Indoor rabbits generally live longer, happier lives and are more social. Outdoor rabbits are more skittish, susceptible to the elements, predators, mites, flies, fleas, and other complications.


You can set up your rabbit’s living area inside your house and set up his exercise area outdoors.
When placing your rabbit’s living area outside, you need to make sure to place it in a spot that protects your rabbit. Place is away from direct sunlight, drafts, damp areas, extreme temperatures, or loud noises. Always give outdoor living spaces a roof to protect the rabbit from the rain and other elements. The cage should be placed so predators and other animals cannot get to it or inside.

, If you choose to let your rabbit live inside, let your rabbit run free in one room. Your rabbit room should have everything your rabbit needs, like a litter box, a hay feeder, food dishes, and water bowl in one area. Set up things for your rabbit around the room, such as cardboard castles, bunny condos, puppy pens, or rabbit cages., Rabbits need a litter box where they can do their business. For a small Thrianta rabbit, a medium to large sized plastic cat litter pan will make a good litter box. Put fresh hay inside the litter box.For multiple rabbits, you can either set up a very large litter box or place individual boxes for each rabbit.
Confine the rabbit to the cage until he is consistently using the litter box.

, Rabbits will eat hay while they go to the bathroom. This means you need to set up your litter box with two different ends. On one end of the box there should be a kitchen area filled with clean hay to nibble. The other end should be the bathroom end where your rabbit will do his business.

, Rabbits like to hide from anything that scares them, like predators and loud noises. Your rabbit needs hiding places in his living area and exercise area.


Good hiding places include cardboard boxes, systems of cardboard tube tunnels, or any low enclosed area easily accessible.Rabbit hiding places can also be bought from pet stores.

, A rabbit’s favorite hobby is chewing. If you decide to keep your rabbit indoors, protect your rabbit and your home by covering wires, trim, furniture, and other similar things. Keep an eye on your rabbit when he runs around the room. Give him an acceptable chewing object if he tries to chew on wires, furniture, or part of the house.


Protect electrical cords by tucking them inside hard plastic tubing split lengthwise. You can also hide cords behind wood work or trim, wrap them in spiral wrap, or use concealers to keep them out of sight.You may also want to completely remove wires from any room your rabbit will be running around in.
Rabbits will also chew on furniture, door edges, trim, wallpaper, sheetrock, and carpet. To help keep your house safe, place a board or cardboard over any places that your bunny may want to chew. Put cardboard or 2x4s under furniture, like beds, couches, or chairs, so the rabbit doesn’t burrow up into the soft underside of it. , To help prevent your rabbit from chewing on things he shouldn’t, give your rabbit plenty of items to chew on. You can give your rabbit alfalfa cubes, grass hay stuffed in cardboard tubes, fresh apple, willow or aspen branches, or rolled up cotton towels., Your rabbit needs a water dish in his cage. Try a ceramic dish for a water dish.If you let your rabbit have an entire room, make sure there are multiple water dishes set out in the room.

, The most common thing in a rabbit’s diet is a high quality grass hay. Your rabbit should have grass hay in unlimited amounts. Daily, you should throw away wet or dirty hay and replace it with fresh hay.


Don’t feed your rabbit alfalfa hay as the main part of his diet. This hay is too high in protein and calcium and should only be fed as a treat.

, Your rabbit should eat commercial rabbit pellets daily.An adult Thrianta rabbit can have ⅛ to ¼ cup of pellets daily. Always provide your rabbit with fresh pellets, so change them daily.


Don’t feed a rabbit grain or seed mixes. If a rabbit has a seed or grain mix, he will pick out the parts of the mix, giving him unbalanced nutrition.

, Green leafy vegetables are important for a rabbit’s nutrition. They add fiber and moisture to your rabbit’s diet, which is needed for healthy digestion. You can give your rabbit all kinds of lettuce, except iceberg which is nutritionally deficient, carrot tops, broccoli stems and leaves, dandelion greens, and bok choy. A Thrianta rabbit needs one to two loose cup of these a day.


Introduce new greens to the rabbit slowly so they don’t cause diarrhea, which can be fatal.

, Rabbits can have a few tablespoons of treats each day. Treats include starchy vegetables, like carrot roots, and fresh fruit. The majority of your rabbit’s diet needs to consist of hay, pellets, and leafy vegetables.


Never feed any other human foods to rabbits, especially not corn or other grains.

, Your rabbit’s litter box needs to be cleaned often. Rabbits will avoid dirty litter boxes. You should never go two days without changing the litter box.


To clean the litter box, dump everything into the trash. Wash the box, then add more bedding and hay.
Make sure to check all of your rabbit’s hay often. You want to make sure to keep your rabbit’s space as clean as possible to avoid any diseases.

, The Thrianta rabbit has a medium length fur, which needs minimal grooming. Brush your Thrianta rabbit with a soft bristled brush once a week to remove any loose hairs. You can also wet your hands and stroke the hair to help remove loose hairs and to keep them from flying around the room.When you brush your rabbit, check the skin and ears for any crusts or parasites. If you find any, contact your veterinarian for advice on how to treat it.

, If your rabbit chews, the teeth should wear normally and your rabbit will not have any problems. However, some rabbits may end up with teeth that need filing or trimming. If the teeth need trimming, take your rabbit to the veterinarian to clip them.Don’t try to trim your rabbit’s teeth yourself. You could crack a tooth, which can become infected or abscessed.

, Most Thrianta rabbits are healthy as long as a proper diet is fed to them. Once a year you should take your rabbit to the vet for an examination to make sure all is well.


This examination will include a tooth check to make sure the teeth are wearing properly. If not, the veterinarian may need to trim them so the mouth or teeth don’t become injured.

, When your rabbit is four to six months old, he should be neutered (or spayed if she is a female). Neutering or spaying keeps rabbits from getting pregnant if you own two rabbits of the opposite sex. It also prevents aggression or urine spraying, along with reproductive system cancer and infections., Usually, rabbits fed proper diets live healthy lives. However, monitor your rabbit for signs of illness, such as refusing to eat or drink, diarrhea, not pooping for a day, eye or nasal discharge, drooling, swellings, reddened skin, or fur loss anywhere on the body, not hopping or moving like normal or unable to use back legs, dark, red urine, or a fever of more than 105 °F.If you see any of these, contact your veterinarian immediately for an examination.

Keeping your Sussex rabbit outside may also cause her to become antisocial.;
, There are wide variety of indoor cages and hutches for rabbits. You can house your rabbit in a room that is rabbit-proofed, keep your rabbit in a puppy playpen, or purchase a rabbit condo.Whatever you choose, make sure that your Sussex rabbit has plenty of space to move around.


The minimum length of an indoor hutch and run should be four feet, but five feet is better. The width should be about two feet and the enclosure should be high enough so that your Sussex rabbit can stand up on her hind legs without her ears touching the top.Do not get a wire bottom cage because it can hurt your Sussex rabbit’s feet. Look for a cage that has a solid metal bottom or cover the bottom of your rabbit’s cage with plywood., Make sure the floor of your Sussex rabbit’s cage is covered with at least two to three inches of bedding. There are numerous substances that you can use for bedding, such as straw (warm and soft), paper pulp (recycled material, safe and high absorbent), and shredded cardboard.Do not use sawdust because it can irritate your rabbit.
Never use cedar or pine shavings in your Sussex rabbit’s as bedding or in your rabbit’s litter box. These materials can cause your Sussex rabbit to develop respiratory and liver problems., Rabbits feel more secure if they have a place to retreat to when they feel frightened or stressed. You can provide your rabbit with a hiding place by putting a cardboard box or wooden box with a hole cut out of it into your rabbit’s cage.If you have more than one rabbit, then you will need to provide a separate hiding place for each rabbit.

, To prevent your Sussex rabbit from urinating and defecating all over her cage, place a small litter box in a corner of your rabbit’s cage. Then, put a few sheets of newspaper into the litter box and layer hay on top of the newspaper. Clean the litter box daily to keep your rabbit’s cage from smelling.You can always move your rabbit’s litter box to a different corner if she does not seem to be suing it where it is. Move it to the corner that she uses to urinate and defecate.
Try placing a couple of litter boxes in your house so your Sussex rabbit can use them when she is out of the cage.
Be aware that rabbits pass two different types of pellets. One type is small and dry and the other type is larger and sticky, called a cecotrophy. The cecotrophy contains food that has been partially digested but that still contains nutrition. Your Sussex rabbit will re-eat these. Never remove cecotropes from your rabbit’s litter box or cage.

Let your rabbit out of their cage before you put your hands into it.,
Spend more time playing with your rabbit.,
Your rabbit will need to be spayed or neutered.,
Consider if something is causing your rabbit to be stressed out.",How to Deal with Violent Rabbit Behaviour," Rabbits are territorial animals. If you tend to keep your rabbit in its cage most of the time and you put your hands in it, your rabbit is likely to charge at you and protect it's territory. Let your rabbit out of its cage before you do any cleaning or anything else to it.;
, It's unfortunate, but after a few months of owning a rabbit, you may have lost interest in it. However, you have to spend at least an hour a day with your rabbit - without a strong bond, some rabbits can become violent due to neglect.

, Getting your rabbit ""fixed"" can help reduce aggression and bad behaviour.


Unspayed female rabbits have a 85% chance risk of getting reproductive cancer, especially if she is five years old or older.
Neutering a male rabbit will not only prolong his life, but also help eliminate hormone related fighting and aggression.

, There may be something causing your rabbit's violence:


Are there any other pets in the house? If you have rabbit predators, such as dogs or cats, your rabbit may feel uncomfortable. Keep an eye on your other pets to make sure your rabbit is safe from harm. If you have attempted bonding your rabbit with other pets and it didn't work, keep the animals well away from each other.

Loud noises. Chances are, if you live in busy environment with constant noise, your rabbit will become annoyed, as rabbits have sensitive hearing. Keep your rabbit in a peaceful environment so it can rest.
Getting picked up constantly. Rabbits generally prefer to be petted rather than picked up, and there are times when they want to be left alone. If your rabbit does not want to be picked up, it will struggle to try to break free. This can be harmful, as their powerful hind legs can result in back injury. Firmly hold your rabbit, support it's belly and hind legs, and then gently lower your rabbit to the ground.
Are you stressed? Rabbits can sense if something's wrong and will pick up on it. This will get it agitated. Reassure your rabbit by showing it affection.

Block access to problem areas/objects.",How to Stop a Rabbit's Biting Habit," There are numerous reasons why a rabbit might bite someone or something, but aggressive biting is usually in response to fearful or threatening situations. If you want to break your bunny of his aggressive biting behavior, you'll have to observe him and determine what situations set him off.Is your rabbit fearful of being picked up?
Does your rabbit bite when you reach into his cage?
Does your rabbit seem to get aggressive when you feed him or take away his food?
Take note of the most common situation or situations in which your rabbit acts aggressively. Then think about why your rabbit might feel frightened or threatened in those situations.;
, If your rabbit is acting aggressively, you may be tempted to keep your distance. However, the best way to cope with this situation is to calm your rabbit and show him affection. This will teach your rabbit over time that you are not a threat, and that he does not have to fear you.Watch your own body language. Putting your hand in front of a rabbit's face may seem like a good way to introduce yourself (especially if you're used to dogs), but to a rabbit it could be perceived as a threatening gesture.
A dominant rabbit will often force his face into a subordinate rabbit's face as an act of aggression. If you shove your hand towards your bunny's nose, he might think you're doing the same thing.
Keep your hands above your rabbit's head and far away from his nose.
Any time your rabbit appears frightened near you, try gently stroking his head from above. Make sure you avoid the face (although the forehead may be okay), and talk to your rabbit in a calm and soothing voice.
Some people find that holding an angry rabbit against your breastbone, with one hand around his ribs and the other hand supporting his behind, can calm the rabbit down and make him feel secure.
Lifting and securing an angry rabbit should be done with great caution, and is not recommended for everyone. If you do decide to try it, make sure the rabbit's feet and mouth are away from you so he can't hurt you.

, Treats can often soothe or at least distract an aggressive rabbit. Over time, a rabbit who acts aggressively - say, for example, when you pick him up - will come to react more calmly when he knows he'll be rewarded with treats.Find an edible treat that your rabbit values highly. This should be a special treat, not the usual food pellets or vegetables you feed him every day.
Put the treat in a small tin, like a metal bowl or a clean mint/candy tin.
Rattle the treat around in the tin whenever you are about to approach your rabbit. Begin his association with the rattling treat when he's in a good mood so that eventually you can use the treat to calm his anger.
Keep associating the rattling with the treat until your rabbit will approach you when you shake the tin.
Eventually you'll be able to use this trick to calm your rabbit's aggression when you need to pick him up or clean his cage.

, If your rabbit acts aggressively when you do certain things (like trying to pick him up, for example), you'll need to expose him to that triggering situation slowly and gradually. This is important, as forcing him to cooperate will only make your rabbit more frightened and subsequently aggressive.Let your rabbit determine how much contact/exposure he can handle before he needs to be left alone.Offer treats using a rattling tin every time you expose your rabbit to his trigger (for example, lifting him up). Over time this can serve as a cue that he will get the treat if he behaves.
Limit how much and how often you expose your rabbit to the stressful situation. Continuing with the previous example of picking him up, only lift your rabbit for a moment or two at a time, then immediately put him back down and reward him with treats.

, Some people may think that disciplining a rabbit by swatting his nose or whacking him with a newspaper will ""break"" his bad habit. The reality is that this is very dangerous to do. Hitting or physically disciplining your rabbit in any way can cause serious injuries, and if nothing else will absolutely make your rabbit even more fearful of you.If you discipline your rabbit, he will never forget it. From that point on, he will only fear and resent you.
Your rabbit should only see your hands as a source of affection (through petting/caressing) and food.
Work on retraining your rabbit while also reassuring him that you are not a threat. Let him know that his environment is safe.

, Though physically disciplining a rabbit is always a bad idea, some rabbit experts recommend finding other painless ways to teach a rabbit that he has hurt you with his biting. Be aware, however, that any unpleasant physical contact may cause your rabbit to become fearful of you in the future. Talk to a veterinarian or a qualified animal care expert before attempting these or other methods of discipline.


Some people recommend pressing a rabbit's head down to stop him from biting, but this may seriously injure or even kill a rabbit if you use force. It's best to avoid trying this unless you are a skilled rabbit trainer.Rabbits typically scream to convey fear or great pain.Consider watching or listening to an online recording of a rabbit screaming and try to imitate that sound to let your rabbit know he's causing you pain.

, Aggressive behavior may be caused by sexual maturity. Some rabbits that are in heat will become hyper aggressive, and may bite or scratch for no apparent reason.


Desexing (spaying/neutering) a sexually mature rabbit will drastically reduce territorial and aggressive behavior.Talk to a vet about desexing your rabbit if you think sexual maturity is the problem. Make sure your vet is experienced at desexing rabbits of both sexes., Some rabbits become territorial due to sexual maturity. However, other rabbits simply become aggressive if you reach into the cage or try to remove the rabbit from his environment. Other signs of cage protective behavior include biting you when you try to clean the cage or remove his food or toys.Rabbits need to feel like they have a safe space, which is most likely the cage. Reaching into the cage could be seen as a threatening act.
Instead of reaching into your rabbit's cage to pull him out, try leaving the gate open and letting him come out when he's ready., Some rabbits resort to biting out of boredom. Much like a nagging child who pulls on your arm and cries until you pay attention, your rabbit's biting may simply be caused by boredom and not getting enough attention.Spend some time each day petting your rabbit or playing with him (if he'll let you).
Consider getting a second rabbit to keep your bunny company. If you do this, however, you should ensure that both rabbits have been desexed to avoid aggressive competition.
Make sure your rabbit gets plenty of exercise time outside his cage. Try to play with him, or simply let him romp around and explore a bunny-proof room., If your rabbit has reached the age of four or five months old and developed aggressive biting habits, it's possible that he's reached sexual maturity. This can mean that the rabbit is in heat, and may continue to act aggressively until he is desexed.Spraying urine is a common sign of being in heat, as well as the rabbit plucking its own hair (though this may be more common in females than males).
Grunting, growling, and biting may be related to sexual behavior, though there could be other explanations. Talk to your vet or a qualified animal specialist if you're unsure of your rabbit's developmental stage.

, Some rabbits will nip at you when you try to discourage destructive behavior. This usually indicates irritation or a desire to be left alone, especially if it comes as a response to touching or moving your rabbit.Nipping may simply be a cry for attention. Try guessing what your rabbit might need (petting, food, water, etc.) and see if that stops his nipping.
Typically, if your rabbit is nipping, it's to give you a warning. The easiest way to deal with a rabbit that wants his space is to leave him alone or put him back in his cage.

, Any time your rabbit's aggression or biting becomes a problem, you should talk to your veterinarian for advice on how to proceed. If the rabbit has already been desexed it could be a behavioral problem, perhaps related to previous mishandling, mistreatment, or even abuse.It could also be an underlying health problem that's causing your rabbit to act out. Your vet will be able to give you more concrete advice based on your rabbit's health history, adoption history, and a comprehensive physical examination.

, If your rabbit is biting objects but not people, he may be acting out of boredom. However, he may also be biting/chewing to manage his teeth. Unlike human teeth, a rabbit's teeth will keep growing throughout his life, and he'll need objects to chew on to help manage that growth so it does not cause greater health problems.


If your rabbit experiences decreased appetite, nasal discharge, tooth grinding, or easily visible teeth protruding from his mouth, he may have overgrown teeth. See your vet as soon as possible so that your veterinarian can help your rabbit.Wood is the best chew toy for rabbits. You can buy a wooden product at a pet store, or give your rabbit a fresh tree branch/twig to chew on.
Make sure that the wood is safe for rabbits. A chew toy should be untreated and unpainted, and tree branches should be non-toxic and pesticide-free.
Safe, nontoxic wood sources include apple, willow, aspen, and pine.You can also give your rabbit other chew toys (in addition to wood) to keep him busy. Try giving your bunny the cardboard from a toilet paper or paper towel roll, cereal boxes, paper bags, or commercially-bought animal toys., One option to keep your rabbit from chewing household items is to use a deterrent spray. These make furniture and other objects undesirable to the rabbit, and will likely deter future efforts at chewing those prohibited objects.You can buy a deterrent spray, or put unpleasant-tasting products on prohibited objects.
Try using bitter apple spray (which can be bought at many pet stores), or try rubbing a little hot sauce on an object (as long as it won't destroy the object).

, If your rabbit is determined to chew things, you might have to bunny-proof a room and make that his designated play area. Common household objects that rabbits tend to target include:


baseboards
wires and electrical cords
carpets
furniture (including the legs, which may be hidden by other fabric)
corners and enclosed spaces around your home"

Go to the veterinarian.",How to Calm a Rabbit," Your pet might not know how to speak but it will give you important visual clues when upset. These clues are subtle and you will need to be observant and know your animal’s usual behaviour to spot the signs of agitation or fear. Look for the following:Hiding in its den and refusing to get out.
A sudden change of behaviour. Your rabbit becomes aggressive or wants to hide.
Chewing the bars of its cage.
Over-grooming or changing its toileting habits.
Over-eating and over-drinking.
Refusing to move or circling its cage.
Stomping his/her hind legs
Wide eyes;
, Your rabbit is usually upset for a good reason. It doesn’t want to be turned into a meal! Cats and dogs can kill a rabbit easily and should be kept away.There are many other animals, depending on where you live, which constitute a danger for your pet.


The most common predators, aside cats and dogs, are foxes, ferrets and all birds of prey.Rabbits have an excellent sense of smell.They might identify a danger before you. If you’re outside with your rabbit and (s)he looks afraid, don’t take any chance. Take your rabbit in your arms and place him/her in a safe place.
If your rabbit has been chased by another animal, bring him/her to safety and reassure him/her.

, Rabbits are herbivores and are not equipped to fight back hunters.Their strategy is to hide as quickly as possible in a dark and secured place. You need to make sure that they can access a safe place at all times.Have an artificial tunnel in the cage and/or in the room where the rabbit plays. You can find one in a good pet shop. A cardboard box that is larger than your rabbit makes a good hidey too.
If they go out, make sure that they have a place to hide but don’t let them escape.

, Your rabbit is a fragile animal and is easily scared. Your voice or the screams of your children might be interpreted as a danger by the animal. Rapid movements are often mistaken for a predator’s attack.


Never scream at the rabbit. It will be terrified and may mistrust you in the future.
Some rabbits liked to be carried, others hate it. If you can’t make your animal relaxed in your arms, leave him/her alone.
If it's essential to pick the rabbit up, such as to remove it from harm, then hold the rabbit in a towel to avoid getting your arms scratched and to help the rabbit feel safe.
Rabbits are easily overwhelmed if there are too many people in the same room.
Avoid loud music and flashing lights. Your rabbit needs peace and quiet.
On the other hand, if your rabbit is scared, play some calming classical music. This will help them to calm down and feel more at rest.

, Gently hold your rabbit and pet it. Stroke the rabbit's head on the top, near the base of its ears. Keep your fingers at the top of the rabbit's head so it cannot nip you. Speak to the rabbit soothingly and kindly.


Try to establish a regular routine of petting and talking to your rabbit.
Remember that some rabbits dislike being stroked on the nose, belly or underneath their chin.
Covering the rabbit's eyes can help reduce fear. While stroking the rabbit, gently cover its eyes with your hands. However, some rabbits don't like this. If your rabbit doesn’t quiet down after a few minutes, slowly remove your hand.
If your rabbit is scared from loud noises around you, cover your rabbit's ears with your hand while stroking him/her or covering his/her eyes.

, If your rabbit is nervous, give it its favourite toy and play hard. Agitation can be a sign of boredom or lack of intellectual stimulation.Give a piece of rabbit wood bought at the pet shop. Your animal will be very tempted to chew it and it's excellent for its teeth.
If the rabbit doesn’t show any interest for the game, stop after a few minutes and look for what’s stressing it.

, Bunnies can rarely resist a piece of fruit or a slice of carrot. If your rabbit is scared, give him/her their favorite food to calm them. Don’t do it too often to avoid obesity.Put a small piece of fruit on your hand and approach your rabbit gently. The rabbit will slowly understand that humans can be trusted.
Never offer them sweets or bread. Avoid tomato leaves, potatoes, spinach and parsley. They are highly toxic for rabbits.

, If there is no apparent danger and you have tried everything to quiet your rabbit down, take him/her to a professional for help. Your rabbit might be ill and would benefit from a check-up.


Ask your veterinarian to make a visit to your house. There is no need to add more stress to your rabbit with a car ride.
Don't medicate your rabbit without having consulted a specialist. You might kill your animal.
If you have more than one pet, quarantine the agitated rabbit to avoid contagion.
Wash your hands and take care of your personal hygiene. If you haven't been vaccinated against rabies and have been bitten by your rabbit, immediately go to the hospital.Also wash your hands before handling the rabbit to get rid of the smell of cats, dogs, or other animals you have touched which predate on rabbits.

Care for your rabbit at home.",How to Calm a Rabbit During a Thunderstorm," Your rabbit can show fright in a number of different ways. Screaming is a very common way for rabbits to show fright. In addition, your rabbit may run back and forth in his hutch or other enclosure. He might also widen his eyes, bare his teeth, and flatten his ears against his head.Frightened rabbits may also stay motionless.
You may notice your rabbit’s fur looking spiked up or puffed out if he is frightened.Other signs of fright include repeated circling in the cage or hutch, sitting in a hunched position, and chewing on cage bars.If you notice any signs of fright in your rabbit during a thunderstorm, act quickly to calm him down.;
, If you have an outdoor rabbit, he should be inside during a thunderstorm. Bring his entire hutch inside if you can. If the hutch is too large or cumbersome to bring inside your home, leave it outside and bring only your rabbit inside.


If you cannot bring the hutch inside, prepare a comfortable caged area in your home for your rabbit, which should include comfortable bedding and some of his favorite toys. If you know the storm is coming, prepare the caged area well ahead of time.
Leaving your rabbit outside in his hutch is not a good idea, even if you cover the hutch with a sheet or large blanket to block out some of the thunderstorm’s noise. Your rabbit would still become frightened, and you would not be able to detect his signs of fright.

, To calm your rabbit during a thunderstorm, you will need to set up an area where he can hide and feel safe until the storm is over. If you were able to bring his hutch inside, set up a cozy hiding area within the hutch that has lots of comfortable bedding. Within a caged area (or other type of enclosure), set up a separate hiding spot with bedding.


Use a cardboard box to create a cozy hiding place. Cut an opening out of the box so your rabbit can go inside of it.Place comfortable bedding in the box.
Consider putting some hay in the box to give your rabbit something to chew on.
Put some of your rabbit’s favorite toys in the box as well., Your rabbit may still be worked up if he can hear the thunder. Closing the widows and drawing the curtains can help drown out the noise. You can also turn on some white noise, such as an air conditioner or fan, or turn on some soothing music., In addition to providing a comfortable physical space for your rabbit, you can also interact with him to calm him down. For example, your rabbit may want to be close to you to ease his fears. Let him come to you first, though. Rabbits can be very affectionate, but want to show their affection according to their own schedule and comfort level.Keep in mind that, in general, rabbits do not enjoy being handled or cuddled. If your rabbit is not comfortable with you holding him, simply sit quietly with him and let him be affectionate with you in his own way.
If you have brought your rabbit’s hutch inside, consider leaving him in there until the storm calms down. He may be perfectly content to rest in the hutch’s hiding place, and may not want you to take him out and interact with him.

, If your rabbit doesn’t mind being close to you, try gently covering his eyes for a few moments. Reach from behind, with your fingers resting comfortably near his nose. Covering your rabbit’s eyes can help calm him down, at least momentarily.If your rabbit is already in his hiding place, leave him be. You don’t want to cause him any more distress by forcing him out of his hiding place.

, If your rabbit is up to it, play some interactive games with him to distract him from the thunderstorm’s noise. Go bowling with your rabbit—set up some plastic bowling pins and let your rabbit knock them over with his nose. You can also play ‘reverse’ fetch with your rabbit—let him toss something towards you with his teeth.Allow your rabbit to snatch something (e.g., piece of newspaper, junk mail) out of your hand and run away with it.If your rabbit is taking a while to calm down, do not force him to play games with you. If he would rather lay quietly in his hiding place, let him do so.

, If your rabbit is screaming or showing signs of fright that will not cause injury, you can continue helping him calm down at home. However, if he has gotten so worked up that he has injured himself (e.g., spinal injury, fracturing limbs), then he will need veterinary care.In addition, your rabbit’s fright could cause him to have a heart attack, which would definitely require veterinary care.If your rabbit has broken his back, his back legs will be completely or partially paralyzed, depending on the severity of the break. He may or may not be able to urinate and defecate. If you put your hand on his back, you may be able to feel the location of the break.With a fractured limb, your rabbit will be limping and likely dragging the affected limb across the ground. He may appear guarded and even depressed.If your rabbit is lying still, put your fingers on his chest (near his elbows) to see if you can feel a heartbeat. If you do not feel a pulse, you can do chest compressions by squeezing his chest with the fingertips of one hand 1 to 2 times per second. Do not attempt CPR.
Stay calm while you assess your rabbit’s injuries. You need you to be able to think clearly, so you can get your rabbit the care he needs as soon as possible.

, Not all veterinarians have experience working with rabbits. If your regular veterinarian is not comfortable caring for rabbits, ask him or her for recommendations on where you can take your rabbit for veterinary care. You can also contact local rabbit rescue organizations or your local pet store for put recommendations.In an emergency situation, you probably will not have time to search for a veterinarian with rabbit expertise. In that case, contact your local veterinary emergency clinic and take your rabbit there.
You could drive straight to the emergency veterinary hospital, but calling first will give the staff time to become aware of your rabbit’s health condition and prepare appropriately for your arrival.
To safely transport your rabbit, pick him up gently, wrap him snugly in a towel, and place him in a carrier.Be especially careful handling your rabbit if you think he has broken his back.

, The veterinary staff will treat your rabbit according to his injuries. Be aware, though, that veterinary care is usually not successful for broken backs. Potential surgical procedures for broken backs in rabbits are risky and have not been very successful.If your rabbit has a fractured limb, the veterinary staff may be able to place a splint on it.


To control your rabbit’s pain, the veterinarian will likely give your rabbit some pain medication, such as an opioid.The pain medication could also reduce your rabbit’s anxiety from the injury.
If your rabbit’s injuries are severe and his quality of life is suffering, you may need to discuss euthanizing your rabbit. Although this is a very difficult topic to think and talk about, you will need think seriously about your rabbit’s quality of life in regards to his injuries.

, If the veterinarian determines that your rabbit will be okay after his injuries, start preparing for caring for him at home. If your rabbit is now disabled, you will need to do such things as provide him with comfortable housing, make his food and water bowls easily accessible, and assist him with grooming."

Provide your Satin Angora rabbit with some pellets as well.,
Offer dark leafy greens to your Satin Angora rabbit.,
Treat your Satin Angora rabbit now and then.,
Keep your Satin Angora rabbit hydrated.,
Avoid giving certain foods to your Satin Angora rabbit.",How to Care for Satin Angora Rabbits2," Satin Angora rabbits love to eat hay, so make sure that your rabbit always has plenty to munch on. Hay provides all of the essential nutrients your rabbit needs to be healthy, so this will serve as her staple food. Chewing hay also helps to wear down your rabbit’s teeth, which are always growing.Give your Satin Angora rabbit lots fresh, high-quality Timothy hay every day.Replenish your Satin Angora rabbit’s hay supply daily and check often to see if it is low.

, You can also give your Satin Angora rabbit some plain pellets each day as an additional source of nutrition. Limit your rabbit’s pellet intake to about ¼ cup to ½ cup of pellets per day.


Some Satin Angora rabbits may need more or less food to be healthy.

Choose a cage for your Satin Angora rabbit.,
Place some cardboard boxes in the cage.,
Provide other chew materials.,
Include a litter box for your Satin Angora rabbit.",How to Care for Satin Angora Rabbits3," Satin Angora rabbits need lots of room to hop and play, so make sure that your rabbit’s cage is at least 12 square feet. If the cage that you choose has a wire bottom, then you will need to cover it with something to protect your rabbit’s feet. A large piece of cardboard or a large plastic mat will work.If possible, try not to get a wire bottom cage because the wire can hurt your Satin Angora rabbit’s feet. Try to find a cage that has a solid metal bottom.You can also use a puppy playpen as an enclosure for your Satin Angora rabbit. This will give your rabbit lots of room to hop and play.
Rabbit condo enclosures also offer more room and fun hiding places for your rabbit to enjoy., Satin Angora rabbits like to hide in cardboard boxes, chew on them, and push them around. Make sure that your Satin Angora rabbit always has a few boxes to use for chewing, playing, and hiding.Try stuffing a small box with hay and cutting small holes in the sides so that your rabbit can munch on the box and the hay.

, Satin Angora rabbits have to chew all of the time to wear down their teeth, so make sure that your rabbit always has plenty of things to chew on. Try giving your Satin Angora rabbit some:


alfalfa cubes
untreated pine boards
cotton towels
cardboard
apple branches, Your Satin Angora rabbit will use a litter box if you provide one for her. Line the litter box with a few sheets of newspaper and some shredded newspaper as well. Make sure that you empty the box once per day to prevent your rabbit’s cage from developing a foul odor.Place the litter box in the corner of the cage that your Satin Angora rabbit like to use for urinating and defecating. This will make it more likely that she will use the box.
You may also want to keep a couple of litter boxes outside of your rabbit’s cage so that she can use them when she is playing outside of her cage.
Do not use cedar or pine shavings as litter or bedding for your Satin Angora rabbit. These materials can lead to respiratory and liver problems for your rabbit."

Make your Satin Angora rabbit an indoor pet.,
Play with your Satin Angora rabbit every day.,
Cover up electrical cords.,
Prevent your rabbit from chewing on walls and furniture.",How to Care for Satin Angora Rabbits4," Rabbits kept outdoors are more likely to die early from a variety of causes. Rabbits are vulnerable to overheating, hypothermia, attacks from predators, and loneliness. Protect your Satin Angora rabbit from these threats by keeping her indoors at all times.Rabbits may even have heart attacks from fear if they spot a predator.
Outdoor rabbits can become aggressive or fearful and this will make your rabbit into a poor pet.

, Satin Angora rabbits need regular exercise to stay healthy. Provide at least two hours of exercise for your Satin Angora rabbit every day by letting her spend some time outside of her cage.Try using baby gates to confine your Satin Angora rabbit to one room, such as the living room or a bedroom.
Make sure that you watch your other pets around your rabbit to make sure that they do not try to hurt her. Teach your children how to be gentle with the rabbit as well.

, Satin Angora rabbits will chew on almost anything that they can, including electrical cords. Allowing your rabbit to chew on electrical cords may kill your rabbit and ruin your electronics as well, so it is important to cover up or put up cords when your rabbit is out of her cage.


Cover up electrical cords with plastic tubing or spiral wrap or keep cords off of the ground., A Satin Angora rabbit will also chew on wooden objects and walls, such as wall trim, doors, chairs, and tables. You will need to watch your Satin Angora rabbit closely to ensure that he does not chew on these things when he is out of his cage.


Your Satin Angora rabbit may also chew on rugs, carpets, or wallpaper.Watch your Satin Angora rabbit closely well when he is out of his cage. If you see him chewing on something that is off limits, don’t try to discipline him. He will not understand and you may cause him to become fearful of people. Instead, pick up your rabbit and place him near an acceptable chewing object, such as a roll of cardboard tubing.

Clean everything the rabbit has touched.,
Allow the debris to heal on its own.,
Give your rabbit medication to kill ear mites.,
Avoid over-the-counter treatments.,
Treat any secondary infections.",How to Treat Ear Mites in Rabbits1," Ear mites are very contagious. Because of this, everything the rabbit comes into contact with should be cleaned and disinfected in case they harbor mites or mite eggs.Dispose of all bedding materials and provide fresh bedding every day until the mites have been gotten rid of completely.
Scrub and disinfect the hutch and run. Make sure to clean it often while your rabbit has the infection.
Ear mites are highly infectious to other rabbits and can spread by direct contact. Therefore, all the rabbits in the household should be treated, too.;
, In severe cases of ear mite infestation, there will be substantial scaling and discharge on the ears. Do not attempt to remove the crusting. Trying to forcibly remove this debris is liable to damage the skin or cause pain and bleeding. Instead, once the underlying ear mites infestation is treated, the debris will lift away over the course of one to two weeks.Once this process start to happen, particularly stubborn debris can be softened by the addition of a few drops of mineral oil into the ear.

, Drugs from the ivermectin family are highly effective at killing ear mites, although they do not kill the eggs. A course of treatment is necessary so that each generation of mites is killed once they hatch, but before they can lay more eggs. The life cycle of ear mites is three weeks, so dosing your rabbit every two weeks for three treatments is usually sufficient to stop any infection.The medicine should get rid of ear mites as long as the rabbit does not reinfect himself from the environment.
The options for treatment include spot drops containing ivermectin, which are applied to the skin over the rabbit's shoulders. The active ingredient is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it acts to kill the ear mites. Three doses are given, each a fortnight apart. It is important to weigh the rabbit and accurately follow the dosing instructions so as not to overdose the rabbit. Xeno is licensed for use in rabbits and should be the first choice of treatment. Other products are effective but not licensed, which means they have not been through the same rigorous testing on rabbits that Xeno has.
Alternately, your veterinarian may give your bunny three doses of ivermectin, two weeks apart, by injection or by mouth.

, Treatment with over-the-counter products should be avoided. Rabbits are extremely sensitive to many insecticides, including the pyrethroid/pyrethrin family which is the active ingredient in many of these commercial mite killing products.In some cases, the rabbit may experience toxicity, the symptoms of which include neurological symptoms, such as loss of coordination, seizures, coma, and death.

, If the rabbit has a secondary bacterial infection due to the ear mites, then the vet may prescribe a course of antibiotics, such as Baytril to combat this.Painkillers from the non-steroidal family may be prescribed to ease discomfort while the mites are dying off.

Check for fly strike regularly.,
Look for fly eggs or maggots.,
Remove eggs or maggots.,
Take your rabbit to the vet if it has fly strike.,
Understand flies and fly strike is in order to avoid it.",How to Prevent Fly Strike in Rabbits1," Every rabbit, healthy or sick, should be checked over twice a day in warm or hot weather to look for fly eggs. This means picking the rabbit up and visually inspecting all areas including between the armpits, groin, under the tail, genital area, dewlaps, skin folds and tail base.;
, You should know what you are looking for when checking your rabbit. Fly eggs are pinhead sized white glistening objects. Maggots vary in size from short thread like objects to plumper and worm like objects.

, Wipe away eggs with a clean disposable towel. Immediately remove any maggots with tweezers and then seek veterinary help.


If the skin is damaged, remove as many of those on the surface as you can and seek urgent veterinary attention for those that have burrowed deeper into the tissue.
Eggs take a matter of hours to hatch out, so it is possible for a rabbit that was clear at breakfast time, to have fly strike by the evening. This is why it is important to check twice a day.

, This condition needs to be treated quickly and effectively or it could kill your rabbit. In addition to making sure you have thoroughly eliminated all maggots and eggs from your rabbit, your veterinarian will probably prescribe a preventative medicine to stop further infections.

, The fly life cycle involves the adult fly laying eggs. These eggs hatch out into maggots, and these maggots need to feed in order to grow and ultimately hatch out as adults. The maggots normally eat rotting flesh.What happens with fly strike in rabbits is that the flies lay eggs in live flesh rather than dead carcasses. The eggs hatch in a matter of hours and the hungry maggots eat through live tissue. This is painful for the rabbit, and if the maggots are not spotted quickly the rabbit can quickly go into shock and die.
Flies are unlikely to be attracted to really healthy tissue. Problems occur when the flies are attracted to damp skin, an infected area, or an area of skin covered in urine or feces. Thus rabbits with health problems or those kept in poor conditions where their skin is liable to be damaged, are at greatest risk of fly strike.

Clean your rabbit's ears regularly.,
Keep your rabbit away from other rabbits you don't know.,
Apply a small amount of oil to your rabbit's ears regularly.,
Keep an eye out for the symptoms of an infection.,
Check your rabbit's ears regularly.,
Do not remove the crust in your rabbit's ears.,
Take your rabbit to a veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's treatment advice.,
Treat any secondary infections as well.,
Clean all items used by infected rabbits.,
Keep an eye on the recovery.",How to Prevent Ear Mites in Rabbits," Wipe out any debris with a clean soft cloth. You can add a few drops of an ear cleaner that is safe for cats or a few drops of baby oil or olive oil. Do not drench the cloth as you don’t want the cleaner or oil to run down into your rabbit's ear.Do not use cotton swabs to clean out your rabbit's ears. These can go too far down your rabbit's ear canal and injure it ear drum. Instead, use a cloth or cotton ball and just clean the easily accessible areas of the rabbit's ears.;
, In order to avoid the risk of infection, keep your bunny away from other rabbits. This includes keeping it out of areas where wild rabbits might be frequenting outside. Only let your rabbit in areas or around other rabbits that are known to be mite free.


If you have multiple rabbits and one is infected while the other is not, you need to keep the infected rabbit in isolation until the infection has been treated and is cleared up.
Chances are, however, that if you have one infected rabbit, the other rabbits it lives with are also infected.

, You can place 3-4 drops of baby oil in the rabbit's ear to smother any stray mites that you may not be able to see. This will not hurt your rabbit's ears and it will help to prevent a full blown infection if a stray mite gets into your rabbit's ear.


Ear mites are parasites, with the scientific name Psoroptes cuniculi, that crawl into the ears to feed.If you can stop them before they establish themselves and reproduce in the ear, that is ideal.

, While the goal is to avoid seeing these signs because you have prevented an infection from occurring in the first place, you should know what to look for just in case. In addition to the thick, brown crust that lines the inside of the ears, there are other signs of ear mites in rabbits. These are:Itching around the ears, head and neck
Head shaking
Ear pain, swelling, or redness
Ears fall down
Weight loss
Unsteadiness or falling over (sign of an inner ear infection)

, Make checking your rabbit’s ears a weekly habit to stay on top of any of ear mite infection. Preventing your rabbit from acquiring a serious ear mite infestation is the best way to deal with ear mites.

, As ear mites feed, the ear tissue responds by producing a buildup of fluid and brown crust, which is commonly referred to as ear canker.Do not attempt to remove this crusty build up, as it can be very painful for the rabbit.Instead, the crust will come off on its own once the infection is treated and the mites are killed.

, If you see any signs of an ear mite infection you should get your rabbit checked by its vet. The vet will assess your rabbit's overall health but will also take a close look at the animal's ears. Your veterinarian should be able to diagnosis ear mites easily by looking in the ears and looking at a swab taken from the ear.


Consult with your veterinarian for advice on treatment in any case where a rabbit has ear mites, but especially if it’s a serious infestation.

, Treatment of ear mites is done with medications that kill the ear mite. These include:


Ivermectin injections under the skin done every two weeks for three to four times.Miticides, like those prescribed for dogs and cats, applied on the skin at the base of the neck repeated every 30 days., If the rabbit has any bacterial infection associated with its ear mite infection this will need to be treated separately with antibiotics. Your veterinarian will assess this situation and prescribe medication as needed.


The mites can travel further into the ear causing an infection by bacteria called otitis externa. This infection can extend further down the ear, damage the ear drum, and cause an internal ear infection which is very serious.Apply the antibiotics for as long as it is prescribed to your rabbit. Using the medicine for too short of a time could limit its effectiveness.

, Hutches or any other plastic, wire or wood box that an infected rabbit has used will need to be cleaned and disinfected. First remove any bedding and poop along with any toys, feeders and waters. Throw away bedding and poop and anything that cannot be cleaned, such as cardboard boxes.


Wash everything with warm water and soap, then disinfect with a diluted vinegar solution.You should also use this solution daily for a few weeks to wipe down all surfaces.
You will also need to clean any other area the infected rabbit visited by sweeping or vacuuming once a day for a month. The crusts and scabs which fall off the ears may be harboring living mites and cleaning will remove them.
Basically, you want all items that your rabbit comes into contact with to be disinfected or replaced., Within 10 days of treatment the crusty lesions should begin to come off on their own. If the condition does not seem to be improving, or gets worse, you should take your rabbit back to the veterinarian for further treatment.


Your veterinarian may recommend a return visit to make sure the infection has cleared up. The vet will probably do a physical examination and may do a swab to check for any remaining ear mites."

Offer positive reinforcement.",How to Teach a Rabbit Not to Chew Furniture," Rabbits need to chew on grass or hay every day to keep their teeth worn down and to get the nutrients they need to thrive. Ensuring that your rabbit always has a supply of fresh, growing grass or good quality hay will reduce the chances that she will chew on your furniture.Timothy hay is a great choice and you can find it in pet stores.;
, Pellets can also offer your rabbit some valuable nutrition and something appropriate to chew on. Rabbits don’t need a lot of pellets though. Provide 1/8 to 1/4 cup of pellets for every 6 pounds of body weight.You may need to adjust the amount of pellets that you give your rabbit depending on her weight and activity level. For example, if your rabbit is underweight or still growing, then she may be able to have more pellets. Ask your veterinarian if you are not sure.

, Chewing on dark leafy greens and crunchy vegetables will also help keep your rabbit’s teeth worn down and reduce her urge to chew on your furniture. Some good veggies to give your rabbit include:romaine lettuce
dandelion greens
kale
collard greens
fresh herbs such as parsley, cilantro, basil
carrots (one 2 inch piece per day)
carrot tops, Fruit and hulled sunflower seeds can make a nice treat for your rabbit, which may also reduce her urge to chew on your furniture. Giving your rabbit a treat can also be a good distraction tactic if you catch her in the act. Try offering your rabbit one treat per day, such as:a couple of apple slices
a few banana slices
a teaspoon of hulled sunflower seeds

, Giving your rabbit plenty of fresh water every day may not keep her from chewing on your furniture, but rabbits need water to stay hydrated and healthy. Provide your rabbit with fresh clean water at all times and check her supply at least once per day to ensure that she has enough water.You can give a rabbit her water in a ceramic dish or in a sipper bottle. Either is fine, but a sipper bottle is less likely to spill or get contaminated with food or feces.

, Rabbits chew in order to file down their teeth and to entertain themselves. Your rabbit might chew on your furniture if nothing else is available for her to chew. Fortunately, there are lots of things you can offer your rabbit (just make sure not to feed her human food that may be toxic to her).Rabbits love to chew:Fruit branches (apple), willow branches, aspen branches
Cardboard boxes
Chew toys
Cotton towels (as long as she doesn't eat them)
Untreated pieces of pine lumber
Compressed alfalfa cubes
Phone books
Untreated wood blocks

, Your rabbit may be chewing the furniture if she's bored. Give her a safe enclosed space to run around and explore. If you can, let her run around outside where she can burn off energy and chew on hay or grass.Pay attention when your rabbit is running around outside. Make sure predators can't get to her. If she's running around inside, make sure she doesn't chew on electrical cords or get stuck behind furniture.

, Entertain and distract your rabbit by making her an indoor digging burrow. Fill a large cardboard box with hay or shredded paper. Let her hop in and dig into the hay. She can also chew the box. Add cardboard tubes that your rabbit can toss around. You might want to cut another hole in the side of the box so your rabbit has another way in and out of the box.Check to make sure that your rabbit doesn't toilet in the box.
You may need to replace shredded hay and paper after a few days or once your rabbit loses interest in them.

, Your rabbit might be chewing out of boredom. If she's been destroying furniture or chewing inappropriate things like wires, she might need company. Consider getting another rabbit so your rabbit can have social interaction. This may distract her from destructive chewing.If you choose to get another rabbit, consider the commitment. Decide whether you want the responsibility of caring for another rabbit.

, Does it feel like your rabbit chews on the furniture to get your attention? Try to spend more time simply playing and snuggling with your rabbit. Lay on the floor and let her hop around you. Talk to your rabbit and pet her so she feels relaxed around you. You can also toss her toys like cardboard tubes or chew toys.While you can buy chew toys from the pet store, you can also let her play with toddler toys or baby teethers.

, You may want to move valuable pieces of furniture into an area that's closed off to your rabbit, at least until you've trained her not to chew furniture. If you don't want to keep the door to the room closed, use a tall baby gate that she can't hop over.You may want to remove wicker furniture or baskets. Your rabbit will have a hard time distinguishing between wicker that's inappropriate to chew and fruit branches that you allow her to chew.

, Hide the furniture from your rabbit by draping large thick blankets over it. This way, your rabbit can't get to the actual furniture. Consider doing this while you work with your rabbit to control her chewing behavior. Once you can trust her not to chew the furniture, remove the covers.


Consider replacing wooden furniture with metal or glass furniture which will keep your rabbit from chewing.

, If your rabbit has been hopping behind the furniture to chew at the back, you'll need to block the furniture or her access. Rabbits enjoy running through crawl spaces, but these can be dangerous, especially if she gets stuck or chews exposed nails or finish on the furniture. Use blocking material to cover the backs of furniture or close off her crawl spaces.For example, if your rabbit likes to hop under the couch to get behind it, try stuffing the space under the couch with pillows. This keeps her from getting under and behind the couch.

, If you can't rabbit-proof dangerous parts of your home, use large wire panels or grids to block off a large space. Or, securely attach a low wooden doorway that you can easily get through (just make sure it's tall enough that your rabbit can't hop over it).If you want to install something permanent, try setting up moveable wire or panels first. This way, you can determine if your rabbit is safe in the area, or if you need to block off more or less space.

, If you don't want to completely cover your furniture, think about buying clear plastic baby-proofing rails and corner guards. Place these along the edges and corners of your furniture to keep your rabbit from chewing.You can also use these on painted walls, if you find your rabbit chewing them. Clear or metal corner guards can keep your rabbit from eating paint., Female rabbits are more likely to want to chew, but spaying her can reduce this urge. Try to spay your rabbit before she's 4 to 6 months old. If she's already older than that, just get her spayed when you can. If she's over two years old, get her examined before spaying.If your rabbit is already spayed, but still chews a lot you may just need to wait for her to outgrow this tendency.

, Stop your rabbit from chewing furniture by making the furniture taste bad. You can buy sour apple spray or other bad-tasting deterrent sprays from a pet store. Tasting the deterrent should keep your rabbit from chewing the furniture in the future.


Avoid spraying things like perfume or chili oil onto the furniture. Instead, use a product made for rabbits or small animals and use it according to the manufacturer's instructions., If you prefer not to buy a bad tasting spray deterrent, look for alternatives you already have at home. Dab a little oil on a cloth and spread it along the edges of your wooden furniture. Your rabbit won't like the taste and will avoid chewing there.


You can use olive oil or a few drops of cinnamon, lavender, or mint essential oils. Once the scent disappears, reapply the oil so your rabbit avoids the furniture.

, When your rabbit starts to chew on the furniture, spray her with water or clap loudly to get her attention and say, ""no bite."" Move her away from the furniture and offer her something that is alright to chew, like a teether or chew toy.Be consistent, but always remember to work with your rabbit. Chewing is just a natural urge for her.


Never shout or yell at your rabbit. This will only make your rabbit frightened of you.

, Reward your rabbit if you see her approach the furniture, but she doesn't chew it. There are several ways you can reward good behavior. Give her praise (like saying, ""good girl""), spend time petting her, or give her a small food treat. Do this as soon as you notice the good behavior. This way, your rabbit will associate the act with the reward.


You can also reward your rabbit when you see her chewing appropriate things, like the branches, chew toys, or cardboard. Rabbits learn better with positive reinforcement than discipline."

Move the rabbit to a cool space.,
Cool the rabbit down.,
Offer the rabbit some water to drink.,
Avoid cooling the rabbit too quickly.",How to Treat Heat Stroke in Rabbits1," Once you notice signs of heat stroke, immediately but gently pick the rabbit up and carry it to a cool place. This could be a room with a fan or air conditioning, whatever space you have readily available.


At the very least, move the rabbit out of the sun and into the shade.;
, As an emergency measure, start to cool the rabbit. This can be done by spritzing the rabbit's coat with cool, but not freezing, water, or standing the rabbit in a few inches of tepid water. However, make sure the water is just one or two inches deep, as rabbits will readily panic in deep water.


Some people suggest applying rubbing alcohol to the rabbit's paws, as this evaporates quickly and has a cooling action., It is important to start hydrating the rabbit as soon as possible. Getting cool water into the rabbit's system will help to cool it down on the inside of its body.


This is just as important as getting the rabbit's body cool on the outside.

, Don't use of ice water, as this can cause shock. A gradual reduction in body temperature is preferable."

Identify sore hocks.,
Make a rabbit fur compress.,
Cut a self-adhesive bandage.,
Place the fur mat on the injured paw.,
Wrap up the injured paw.,
Carefully cut a flex point out of the wrap.,
Check the front of the foot every few hours.",How to Treat an Injured Rabbit's Paw1," Pododermatitis, also called sore hocks, is a common ailment among rabbits. This painful condition can be easily prevented with proper exercise and comfortable housing. Once the condition has set in, though, you'll need to take quick action to treat the injury. Leaving it untreated will lead to infections and further pain.Early signs of sore hocks include loss of hair on the bottom of the affected paw(s).
As the condition worsens, the exposed skin will turn red and become inflamed.
Ulcers and scabs may develop if left untreated, followed by a skin abscess. In severe cases, this may lead to inflammation of the tendons and deep tissues in your rabbit's paw.
If the condition gets to the point of your rabbit displaying an abnormal stance and walking pattern, it may have inflicted severe and permanent damage.
Do not attempt to wrap up sore hocks if there are any open sores, as this may make the injury worse.
If caught early, you should be able to treat sore hocks at home. However, if you notice any advanced signs of sore hocks, you should take your rabbit to see your veterinarian as soon as possible.;
, In order to treat sore hocks, you'll need to replace the missing fur with some of the rabbit's own fur (or, ideally, from another rabbit). This will help pad the injury until the skin heals and the fur begins to regrow.To make a fur compress, you will need to:


Brush some spare fur off of your rabbit. Ideally, you should brush it off of a healthy rabbit to avoid further trauma to the injured animal, but if you only have one rabbit it will do.
Roll the fur between the palms of your hands until you form a mat of fur approximately two inches long, two inches wide, and one inch deep. The mat of fur you form should be soft and spongy, but with some firmness.
Do not attempt to use cotton, gauze, or any other type of man-made padding. These materials can form hard mats while applied to the paw, which may further irritate the injury.
Keep in mind that although rabbit fur provides excellent padding, it is not sterile. Therefore, there is a risk of introducing an infection to an open sore. To reduce this risk, avoid using rabbit fur on an open wound. The fur may stick to blood or other secretions and this can make it hard to remove the fur. That is why this method is best for skin that is merely red and inflamed, rather than broken.

, Once you've made a fur mat, you'll need to secure it in place. The easiest way to do this is by cutting a self-adhesive bandage to the correct size and shape so that you can then apply it to the affected paw.Something specifically made for pets, such as VetWrap, is ideal. In a pinch, though, self-adhesive bandages for humans can work.
Cut a long strip of self-adhesive bandage. It should be approximately nine inches long and two inches wide.
Next, cut straight lines down the strip lengthwise from both ends, leaving approximately one inch of strip uncut in the middle. It should look somewhat like an H or an X.

, Have someone carefully hold your rabbit on its back, with its underside facing up. Then gently press the pad you made out of rabbit fur against the bare spot on the rabbit's sole. Remember that you should only use fur, not cotton or any other man-made material.Try to gently tuck some of the rabbit's remaining paw fur over the bare spot to secure the fur mat in place., Keep your materials close at hand. You will need the fur mat that you made and the pre-cut self-adhesive bandage to secure it in place. Have a friend continue to hold the rabbit securely so that you can focus on treating its paw.Position the uncut middle section of your self-adhesive bandage over the rabbit's heel and ankle.
Make sure the fur mat is still in place before wrapping.
Wrap the four strips of the self-adhesive bandage above and below the rabbit's ankle to secure the fur mat in place.
Do not wrap too tightly, as this can worsen the condition.
The wrap should be loose enough that you could easily slide a popsicle stick between the rabbit's leg and the bandage, but tight enough to stay on and in place. (Do not actually stick anything inside the bandage; just eyeball it to make sure it's not too tight.)

, Once the wrap is on, you'll need to cut out a small flex point. This is because rabbits naturally bend and flex their ankles in order to sit, stand, and move. Without a flex point, your rabbit could develop new sores on the front of its ankle underneath the wrap.Pull up on the bandaging in the front (above the rabbit's ankle). Pinch and hold the bandage away from the skin so you don't cut through to the leg.
Use blunt-tipped scissors to avoid stabbing or cutting the rabbit's paw.
Your rabbit may be jumpy at this point, so have your friend continue to hold the rabbit tightly, and exercise great care as you cut out the flex point.
The flex point should ideally be cut in the shape of a diamond or a circle to best facilitate movement.

, Once you've finished wrapping up the paw, you'll want to check on the rest of the foot every few hours. Look for swelling and/or redness in the toes and front part of the foot (which should remain unwrapped). If you notice any redness or swelling, it means you've wrapped the foot too tightly. However, if the bandage has spun around or gotten bunched up around the ankle or knee, it means you've wrapped it too loosely.If there are any problems with the wrap (too loose or too tight), have someone hold your rabbit with its belly up again. Unwrap the bandaging and carefully rewrap it accordingly.
Even if bandaged correctly, you'll need to rewrap the injury with fresh bandages and new fur mats every day. If the bandaging gets wet or soiled in any way, unwrap it and change the dressings immediately to prevent infection.
Follow up with your veterinarian for a full evaluation to ensure that there's nothing else wrong and to see if antibiotics are needed.

Feel your rabbit.,
Watch your rabbit's physical behaviour.,
Listen for teeth grinding.,
See if your rabbit is breathing more heavily than normal or more rapidly.,
Observe how much food and water your rabbit is consuming.,
Take your rabbit to the vet.",How to Tell if Your Rabbit Is in Pain," Check your rabbit to see if there are any bumps, protuberances, broken or dislocated bones, etc. If your rabbit had a recent injury, s/he is probably in pain. Has s/he lost lots of weight unexpectedly? If you find anything odd or wrong with your rabbit, take him/her to the vet as soon as possible.;
, Is s/he reluctant to move? Not being curious and inquisitive to the environment? Is one of his/her feet limp? Is s/he leaning back on his/her hind feet? Is s/he being more aggressive than normal or hiding in a corner of the cage? Is s/he being more territorial? Is his/her head tilted to one side with a loss of balance? Is your rabbit squinting in pain? These can all be signs that your rabbit is in some pain and should be taken to a vet.

, A light grinding can mean that your rabbit is content, but if s/he has loud, ""rough"" teeth grinding, that is one of the most common signs that your rabbit is in pain.

, This is also one of the more common signs that a rabbit may be in pain after an accident or injury. Rabbits may breathe heavier when outdoors because there are many smells. This is not a problem- but if it's coupled with any thing else, it can be a sign of pain.


If a rabbit is hot (and their ears are pinker/red in colour) they will breath more rapidly to try and cool down.


, A rabbit in pain or one that is sick will not have a big appetite or thirst. As well, the rabbit's pellets will be either small, wet (diarrhea) or none. The urine (if consuming little or no water) will be very concentrated in colour. If any of these are the case, take your rabbit for a checkup at the vet.

, Even if you aren't sure if s/he is in pain, take your rabbit to the vet.

Watch for ear scratching.,
Look for discharge from the ear.,
Monitor for drooping ears.",How to Treat Ear Mites in Rabbits2," One of the most common signs of ear mite infection is the scratching of the affected ear. This ear scratching is because ear mites can cause considerable irritation. The rabbit may scratch his ears with his paw or rub his ears on the ground.Your rabbit may also shake his head or hold his ear over to one side.
Your rabbit’s ears may have reddened or inflamed skin.
Irritation from the feces and saliva of the mite causes extreme itchiness, and the rabbit scratches and traumatizes the ear.

, A severe infection due to ear mites is characterized by distinctive yellow-gray debris and scale that builds up and fills the ear canal. This debris and discharge is tightly adhered to the skin. Attempting to remove the debris causes pain.Forcible removal tends to peel away the top layer of skin with the discharge leaving a large ulcer behind.
Typically in the early stages of infection, close inspection may show scales of skin tightly stuck to the ear canal.

, If ear mites are left untreated, the weight of the collected debris inside the ear can cause it to drop. The rabbit may develop secondary bacterial infections where the skin is damaged, and infection may spread inwards into the middle and inner ear causing poor balance and a head tilt."
"
Take your bunny to the vet.,
Swab the ear.,
Check the ear with an otoscope.",How to Treat Ear Mites in Rabbits3," Whenever your bunny shows any signs of ear problems, you should take him to the vet immediately. Ear problems can cause major pain for your rabbit, and point to severe infections.You should tell your vet about all the symptoms you have seen in your bunny. Make sure to be as detailed as possible and tell your vet about anything you think is odd about your rabbit’s behavior.

, Your vet will perform an ear exam to check for any abnormalities. The best way for your vet to diagnose ear mites is by rolling a cotton swab in a sample of the ear wax.Then, your vet will smear the swab on a microscope slide and examine it under the microscope.

, If the infestation is bad enough, the vet may not have to do an ear swab. In heavy infestations, it is possible to see the glistening bodies of the ear mites when viewed with an otoscope.An otoscope is an instrument designed for looking in ears which has a light source and magnification.

Keep your rabbit's cage clean.,
Keep your rabbit's fur clean.,
Treat health issues that could lead to uncleanliness.,
Get dental problems treated.,
Check rabbits with physical limitations more often.,
Use a product to prevent fly strike.,
Repel flies.Do your best to eliminate flies around the rabbit.",How to Prevent Fly Strike in Rabbits2," Make sure your rabbit's hutch is kept clean at all times. Remove soiled bedding on a daily basis and replace it with clean. If the rabbit uses a litter tray, scoop out the soiled areas daily.


A common cause of fly strike is that a rabbit has been kept in dirty conditions, with urine stained bedding and lots of pellets. The smell of urine or feces will attract flies to the area. If the rabbit has been sitting in damp bedding, smells of urine, or, worse still, the rabbit's skin is damaged because of urine scald, flies will be even more attracted to the area., Check your rabbit's fur, especially around the anus, to make sure there are no pellets stuck in the fur. This could attract flies.


If the fur is soiled, tease out the pellets or carefully use scissors to cut the fur away.

, There are some health conditions that lead to a greater risk of a rabbit being unclean around its anus. For example, a rabbit with a urinary infection, or a problem with their bladder, may need to pass urine regularly and is more likely to soil themselves. Likewise diarrhea sticks to fur and is a big risk factor.


For both conditions, always seek veterinary attention. If the rabbit has diarrhea, take it off vegetables and fruit, and feed it mainly hay. However, make sure it actually eats the hay or it may starve itself., Rabbits with overgrown teeth or dental pain, are not able to groom themselves, and again are prone to soiling around the rear end. It is imperative to seek veterinary attention to get the dental issues corrected. Once the teeth have been filed, then a mainly hay diet is key to keeping the teeth at the correct length., For example, overweight rabbits are physically unable to bend round and clean the pellets from their rear end. This makes them liable to getting pellets stuck in their fur.Key to prevention is keeping the rabbit at a healthy weight by feeding a diet of mostly hay, supplement with fresh vegetables and only a dessertspoon of pellets a day. If your rabbit is already overweight, then it's essential to perform twice daily checks as they are at greater risk of fly strike. Aim to slowly reduce their weight by cutting back on their pellets and switching them onto hay.You should also check rabbits with arthritis more often. A stiff arthritic rabbit cannot turn around so easily and is more liable to become soiled. Your vet can supply a painkiller, meloxicam, which is suitable for use in rabbits. This helps ease their discomfort but daily checks are still essential., A product called Rearguard stops eggs hatching into maggots and is effective for 8 - 10 weeks. It comes in a one dose applicator and is dabbed onto the fur until it is wet down to the skin. It is then left to dry.


Rearguard does not repel flies or kill maggots, but it stops any eggs that are laid from hatching into maggots. This product is a tool to help prevent fly strike but it should not replace good clean bedding conditions, regular checks, or attending to your rabbit's health problems.

, Invest in a fly zapper, a blue light that attracts flies and then kills them. Alternatively use sticky fly papers, and also keep the rabbit's home clear of food debris that might attract these insects.


Some herbs are said to have fly repellent properties, so consider growing them beside an outdoor hutch or in pots inside. These include chamomile, peppermint, basil, green oregano, hemp, lavender, rosemary and rue."

Get emergency veterinary treatment.,
Keep the rabbit cool while in transport.,
Avoid stressing the rabbit out further.,
Understand that emergency veterinary treatment usually entails further cooling.",How to Treat Heat Stroke in Rabbits2," If the rabbit is not showing signs of improvement, then call the vet and tell them you are having an emergency issue with your rabbit. If your regular veterinarian is not available, for instance the problem is occurring on a day the veterinary office is closed, then you should call an emergency veterinary office in your area.


Your veterinary office may ask you some questions about your rabbit's condition. Then the person on the phone should help you assess whether the rabbit needs to be seen.

, If you need to transport the rabbit to a vet, keep cooling it as you go. Wrap the rabbit in a damp towel and have the air conditioning on in the car.


Transporting a rabbit with heat stroke, while continuing to try to cool it down, may require two people. However, if you don't have anyone to help, just keep the temperature in the car cool and give the rabbit access to cool water.

, Act calmly and quietly. Some rabbit's can really sense stress and react physically to being stressed themselves. They have sensitive systems, so whatever you can do to keep them calm will help.


Petting your rabbit softly and covering its eyes may help to keep it calm., In cases of extreme heat stroke, it is necessary to provide cool intravenous fluids. This will allow the veterinarian to bring the rabbit's core temperature down.This is the best, and usually the only, treatment a veterinarian can provide for heat stroke.


Getting these fluids can also help vital organs that have started to shut down as a result of dehydration.

"
"
Don't expect the signs to be obvious.,
Look for red ears.,
Be on the look out for mouth breathing.,
Look for flaring nostrils.,
Notice drool or excess saliva.,
Pay attention to strange behavior.",How to Treat Heat Stroke in Rabbits3," You will have to be observant to notice them. In fact, the more obvious the signs are, the more serious the rabbit's condition is.


This means that you want to get a rabbit's temperature under control before it is showing the physical signs of heat stroke. That can only be done if you are being an attentive rabbit owner.

, The earliest hint of impending heat stroke is red ears. This is because the rabbit increases the blood supply to the ears in order to try and lose heat.The ears have less fur, so the heat can more easily come out of the rabbit's body through the exposed skin on the ears.

, Rabbits cannot pant and only sweat through minor sweat glands in the paws, so they have no efficient way of cooling off. They usually breathe through their nostrils but when over hot they will open their mouth and attempt to mouth breath.This is unusual and so should be taken seriously.

, In addition to mouth breathing, the rabbit may flare its nostrils. This indicates heavy breathing and breathing more quickly in order to try and lose heat., This can indicate a variety of problems in rabbits, most commonly problems with their teeth, but it is also a sign that the rabbit is overheated. The rabbit may drool or dribble saliva in an attempt to lose heat., Commonly, heat stroke will cause lethargic and weak behavior. The rabbit will be reluctant to move and wants to stay in the same spot. If forced to move, the rabbit may seem weak and wobbly, or confused.Ultimately, heat stroke leads to convulsions, which can lead to coma and death.

Place the rabbit's hutch in a good location.,
Give your rabbit a way of keeping itself cool.,
Ensure there is adequate airflow around the hutch or pen.,
Give the rabbit constant access to water.,
Provide moist vegetables for the rabbit to eat.,
Consider moving your rabbit during extreme weather.",How to Treat Heat Stroke in Rabbits4," Be sensible about where you locate the rabbit's hutch and run, taking care to determine how your rabbit will be exposed to the elements. At the least, make sure the rabbit will never be in full sunlight without accessible shade.


The hutch should be protected from all types of weather, including rain, snow, and excessive wind, in addition to sun., This is especially important on hot days. You cold help it keep cool with a large ceramic tile that has been in the fridge and then placed on the floor of the hutch, or with a baking tray containing a shallow depth of cool water for the rabbit to sit in.Another idea is to freeze bottles of water and then place these in the hutch. The rabbit can then lie against the bottles or lick the condensation to cool itself off.

, Air movement helps to reduce the temperature, so the hutch shouldn't be somewhere that has totally stagnant air. If it is very warm out, consider placing a fan on floor level, directed at one corner of the hutch, so that the rabbit can choose whether or not to lie in the breeze.Avoid the rabbit being constantly being exposed to the wind from the fan. It should be able to choose whether it needs to cool off.

, Plenty of water is an absolute essential when it comes to keeping cool. Provide duplicate drinking bottles or bowls in case one gets knocked over or drunk dry.A dehydrated rabbit is extremely vulnerable to heatstroke.

, Moist vegetables can provide the rabbit additional water, which helps with dehydration and heat stroke. A good vegetable to provide is cucumber, as it has a very high moisture content.You can also rinse veggies in water and then leave them wet, so the rabbit takes in extra fluid when eating.

, You may need to relocate your rabbit if temperatures get too high. Consider moving it into the shade, into a cool out building, or even into your home, when the weather is too bad.


This can simply be a temporary measure, just to assure that your rabbit does not suffer from the heat.

Recognize the signs of a sprained leg.,
Administer half of a chewable baby aspirin.,
Apply cold therapy to the affected leg.",How to Treat an Injured Rabbit's Paw2," It may be difficult to differentiate a sprained leg from a fractured or broken leg. If you are certain that the leg is just sprained, you should be able to care for it at home on your own. If you're unsure about what's wrong with your rabbit, or if there's a chance the rabbit's leg or back might be broken, you'll need to take it to a vet for a firm diagnosis and treatment plan.Look for the following signs as common indicators of a sprained leg:


wobbliness or weakness in one leg
a hunched walk that favors three out of four legs
ability to bear some weight on the leg, but with a limp

, If you can't get to the vet and your vet has told you in the past that it's safe to give your rabbit baby aspirin, you may do so. Always check with your vet first if you're unsure whether your rabbit can have baby aspirin, as rabbits with certain medical histories cannot safely take aspirin.Only administer aspirin if your rabbit is not old (it should be young to middle-aged) and if you know your rabbit has never had any kidney or liver diseases.
Cut one chewable baby aspirin tablet in half, and give one of the halves to your rabbit to chew.
Wait for further instructions from your veterinarian regarding aspirin. It is essential to get the dose correct. Weigh your rabbit so that the vet can give you an accurate dose. This should ideally be done only while you wait to get to your vet.

, Cold therapy is the best treatment for any sprain. The ice pack will reduce the flow of blood to the site of the injury, which can help reduce swelling and inflammation. It can also reduce some of the pain at the site of the injury.Wrap a cold ice pack in a clean dish towel or washcloth.
Apply the wrapped ice pack directly to the affected leg. You may need someone to help hold your rabbit so that you can continue to apply the ice pack.
Try to leave it on for about 10 minutes, if your rabbit will let you. If not, try to keep the ice pack on for as long as possible.
Call your veterinarian to schedule an appointment so that he or she can give your rabbit a full physical examination.

Identify which leg is injured.,
Splint the injured leg.,
Wrap your rabbit in a clean towel.,
See a vet right away.",How to Treat an Injured Rabbit's Paw3," If your rabbit is having difficulty walking or is completely incapable of walking, it is probably suffering from a leg injury. If your rabbit is dangling or dragging one leg, it is most likely broken. If the rabbit limps but seems to be capable of carrying some weight on the injured leg, it may be sprained, dislocated, or fractured. Your vet will need to evaluate the injury to determine how serious it is and how to remedy it.Pick your bunny up while supporting its rear with your other hand.
While still holding your rabbit (do not let go or drop the rabbit at any time), gently try to get the rabbit to stand with good footing.
Whichever leg the rabbit tries to avoid standing on is most likely the injured leg.
If your rabbit drags both hind legs, it may have suffered a spinal injury and will need immediate veterinary assistance. Your vet will need to administer steroids and other medications, and may put a body cast on as well., If your rabbit will let you, the best way to treat a leg before taking your rabbit to the vet is to splint the leg with something firm. This will help reduce painful movements of the limb until your vet can examine the injury and treat it accordingly.Wrap clean gauze around the leg above and below the site where you think the leg is broken.
Gently place a pencil, popsicle stick, or similarly firm object lengthwise against the outside of the leg, covering the suspected site of the break and extending above and below it.
Use tape or a self-adhesive bandage to wrap the leg, including the splint, up and down the leg. Make sure you don't wrap too tightly, or you may risk cutting off circulation to the rabbit's paw.
If your rabbit's paw turns red or swollen, you've wrapped it too tightly and will need to rewrap it accordingly.

, If your rabbit won't let you splint the injury, or if your rabbit is being difficult about handling after splinting the injury, you may need to wrap it in a towel. This will allow you to easily handle and carry your rabbit without further injuring the broken leg. However, you'll need to take great caution while wrapping the rabbit in a towel, as it may be frightened or in pain at this point.Use a clean, dry towel.
Wrap the towel around your rabbit snugly, leaving the head uncovered.
Make sure the rabbit's back and hind end are in a natural position, and that the spine is not bent or twisted.

, You'll need to put your rabbit inside a carrier, even if you had to wrap the rabbit in a towel first. Carefully place the rabbit inside the carrier (towel and all) and take the rabbit to your veterinarian right away. It's important that you don't delay, as an untreated broken limb could be a very serious injury."

Recognize the signs of an injured rabbit.,
Prevent sore hocks.,
Use caution when lifting and handling rabbits to prevent injury.",How to Treat an Injured Rabbit's Paw4," Before you can treat any injury, you'll need to be able to identify the signs of an injured rabbit. Since rabbits cannot vocalize pain like some other animals can, you'll need to watch your rabbit's behavior and carefully examine any suspected injuries.An injured rabbit may display strange behavior, or it may act perfectly normal.
Look for prolonged lack of movement, extended periods of time spent lying on its side, tilting of the head, falling over, difficulty moving, and an inability to move in a straight line.
Contact your vet any time you're unsure about your rabbit's behavior.

, Sore hocks is an easily-preventable ailment that usually stems from an improper diet and exercise regimen or from a painful or unsanitary living area. Take precautions to ensure that your rabbit is eating healthy (and not overeating), getting enough exercise outside of the cage every day, and has a comfortable space inside its cage.If you use a metal wire cage, make sure your rabbit has some type of surface inside the cage (like a flat board, for example) to sit, stand, and lie on so that the wires do not dig into its paws all day. You should also provide two to three inches of soft bedding material for your rabbit to sit on. This will help to take some of the pressure off of your rabbit's hocks.
If you use a solid, flat-bottomed cage, make sure you keep the floor clean. Wipe away urine and other spills on a daily basis, as exposure to urine will irritate the tissue and burn the skin.
Keep your rabbit on a healthy, regulated diet and give it plenty of exercise time outside the cage to prevent obesity. Being overweight is a common cause of sore hocks in rabbits, and it can easily be prevented.

, One of the most common causes of broken, fractured, and sprained limbs and backs in rabbits is improper handling. Any time you lift your rabbit, you need to be careful and anticipate that it might flail or try to jump out of your arms, which could cause serious injury.If your rabbit struggles when you restrain it or try to lift it, don't try to force your grip.
Let go of your rabbit and focus on calming it down before you try to pick it up or handle it again.
Forcing your rabbit to let you handle it will only cause the rabbit to panic and flail more, which could result in broken limbs (if it falls) or even a broken back.
Get close to the ground before attempting to lift a rabbit. Hold it gently but firmly with one hand supporting the rabbit's back and hind end at all times."

, Frontline comes with several small plastic applicators. They look something like little bottles. Each applicator contains a single dose of Frontline.There are perforated lines between each applicator. You can separate the applicators by tearing or cutting along the perforated line.
Be careful when separating the applicators. You want to make sure you do not tear an applicator and spill a dosage of Frontline.

, Each applicator has a small tip that you can easily snap off. You must snap off the tip prior to applying Frontline to your dog or cat.Make sure to do this away from your face to avoid getting the chemicals in your eyes.
If the tip does not come off easily, you can use scissors to cut it off.

, You should apply Frontline on your pet's back, directly between your pet's shoulders. Frontline is safe to use on a pet's skin, but should not be ingested by the pet. Your pet will be unable to reach this are, preventing them from licking Frontline off., Part your pet's fur so you can see its skin. This is very important.

Offer plenty of shade.",How to Diagnose Heat Stroke in Rabbits," If your rabbit is suffering from heat stroke, you may notice something is wrong without realizing exactly what it is. Your rabbit may seem extremely stressed, listless, quiet, and confused.


Take care when handling your anxious rabbit. Any rough handling or extra stress could cause health damage.;
, Look for fast breathing that seems like your rabbit is panting. Your rabbit may only be able to take rapid shallow breaths while keeping his mouth open. This means he's breathing through flared nostrils.


He may also toss his head from side to side while he struggles to breathe., If your rabbit concentrates very hard on breathing, he may forget that he needs to swallow. This causes him to drool or salivate. This difficulty breathing and drooling is a strong sign of heat stroke.


The fur around your rabbit's nose and nostrils may also be wet if he has heat stroke., If your rabbit has heat stroke, he probably won't move around very much. When he does move, he might be slow and seem uncoordinated. Your rabbit might be wobbly or weak on his legs.


Some rabbits tremble, shiver, or have convulsions because of heat stroke., Look at the thinly furred inner part of your rabbit's ears. You should be able to see small blood vessels in the skin which give the ears a pink, red, or flushed appearance. This is because heat stroke can cause the blood vessels to dilate (get larger). The ears will also feel hot to the touch.The rabbit's fur may seem dull and starry (ruffled or spiky).

, To decide if heat stroke is likely, ask yourself whether it's a hot day. If so, think about whether or not your rabbit has been in the direct sun. Think about if he has access to water and shade.


These factors can help you determine how serious the risk of heat stroke might be and what you'll need to do to help your rabbit.

, If you suspect your rabbit has heat stroke, you need to immediately cool him down. Start by bringing him out of the heat into a cooler environment. For example, if your rabbit is in a room with full sun, move him into a shady air-conditioned room.


While you may think you should rush to the vet right away, start cooling your rabbit down before you take him.

, Use a fan to blow cool air over his fur, paying attention to his ears. This will help lower your rabbit's body temperature. You can also dampen his fur with cool water before blowing air over it to cool your rabbit more effectively.


Don't apply ice or ice-water because the extreme temperature change could send your rabbit into shock., Give your water plenty of fresh cool drinking water. Place the bottle water dropper beside him so he doesn't have to move far to drink. You may also set out a bowl of water so your rabbit can choose between it and the bottle water dropper. The main thing is to keep your rabbit hydrated.You can also put ice cubes in the water to keep the water chilly.

, At the first sign of heat stroke (as soon as you recognize symptoms), move the rabbit to a cooler area and contact the veterinarian. Since heat stroke can become lethal very quickly, your rabbit needs immediate veterinary care.


In extreme cases, the vet may put your rabbit onto intravenous fluids which can cool his blood and support organ function., When the weather starts warming up (usually over 75 degrees), keep an eye on your rabbit's comfort. Be in the habit of freezing large water bottles. This way, you can place them next to your rabbit's side when it starts getting hot out.If you're using an old soda bottle, be sure to remove the plastic wrapper from the bottle so your rabbit doesn't chew it off.

, You might want to set out two bottle water feeders for your rabbit, especially if you'll be gone during most of the day when it's hot. This way, your rabbit will have plenty to drink, preventing dehydration.


You can also add ice cubes to the bottle water feeder to keep the water cool., Set up a small fan near your rabbit's hutch or cage. This slight breeze can keep your rabbit cool and prevent overheating.


If you set up a fan, make sure your rabbit can't access the electrical cords. Rabbits love to chew, so keep these out of his way.

, If you keep your rabbit outside, he should have lots of shady places to rest. This doesn't mean you have to set up a large umbrella or keep your rabbit locked in his hutch. Just make sure there are larger leafy plants or trees under which your rabbit can get out from the direct sun.


This is especially important if your rabbit has dark-colored fur which tends to absorb sunlight.

Take your injured rabbit to the vet.,
Be aware of the less obvious signs of injury.,
Examine your rabbit to determine the nature of its injury.,
Take your rabbit to the vet immediately if it is in shock.,
Wrap your rabbit in a towel if your exam discovers no obvious problems.,
Take care with broken bones.,
Clean shallow cuts or bite wounds.,
Apply pressure to bleeding.,
Flush burns with cool water.,
Put styptic powder such as Quick-Stop on an injured claw.",How to Care for an Injured Rabbit1," You may choose to treat a small shallow cut or injured claw yourself, but for just about anything else, it is always best to take your rabbit to the vet. Your job is to minimize damage and keep your rabbit as safe and comfortable as possible en route. Know your vet’s hours and have a backup plan. If your vet is not available for emergencies outside of office hours, then you should have the number of another clinic or vet that is.;
, If your rabbit is bleeding, has been bitten, or has been stepped on, you should take him to the vet. But injuries are not always so obvious, especially since rabbits have high pain thresholds and instinctively hide pain. Less obvious signs of injury include:Lying on one side for extended periods of time.
Falling over.
Inability to walk in a straight line.
Limping or change in gait.
Awkward posture.
Licking, rubbing or scratching a particular area.
Failure to eat or drink for 24 hours.
Failure to pass fecal pellets for 8 hours or more.

, How you care for you rabbit will depend on the injury. If the injury is not immediately life threatening – i.e. the rabbit is bleeding heavily, paralyzed, or in shock – perform a brief exam:Nose and whiskers – Both sides should look the same. Look for discharge and swelling.
Eyes – Glassy or closed eyes are a sign of shock. Shine a light into them to see if the pupils constrict. If the whites of the eyes are yellow, this indicates a serious liver problem.
Gums and teeth – Lift the lips to examine them. Gums should be pink and the color should return immediately if after you push on them with a fingertip. Pale gums are a sign of sock. Make sure no teeth are broken.
Head and neck – Feel for lumps, bumps, or swelling. Head tilt may be a sign of shock or spinal injury.
Limbs - Check for redness, heat or swelling. If none is found, run both hands down each limb from the shoulder to the toes, flexing each joint. Stop immediately if your rabbit appears to be in pain. Cold feet are a sign of shock.
Torso – Run your hands along the ribcage and spine. Feel for swelling or abnormalities. Gently feel your rabbit’s stomach, searching for swelling or redness. Check for rapid breathing and heart beat, a sign of shock.

, Shock can kill a rabbit. If its eyes are glassy or closed, its extremities cold, and its heart rate and breathing rapid, wrap it in a clean towel, place it in its carrier, call your vet and take it in.Always place the towel and carrier beside your rabbit, so you will have to move it as little as possible.
If you suspect your rabbit is in shock, keep him warm and minimize stress as much as possible. If possible give him a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel (so he doesn't get scorched.) Place him in a covered box, so that he doesn't feel so exposed and vulnerable which rabbits find very stressful.

, Rabbits lose heat rapidly due to the stress of injury. If you believe your rabbit is injured, particularly if it has been kicked, stepped on, or sat upon, gently wrap it in a clean towel and take it to the vet.


Minimize his stress by giving him a dark safe place to hide. Rabbits have been known to die from pure stress, so while you are assessing his injuries, or waiting to hear back from the vet, make him feel as safe as possible.

, Do not attempt to splint broken bones, as this may cause more injury. Place the rabbit in a box so that he doesn't try to hop or move around. If the fractured ends of the bones are exposed through the skin, cover them with sterile gauze from a first aid kit. If you don't have sterile gauze then place a freshly laundered (clean) handkerchief over the bones to reduce the amount of bacterial contamination from the air. If you don't have a clean piece of fabric then leave the bones exposed but inform the vet so that they can decide if antibiotics are necessary. Never, under any circumstances attempt to push the bone ends back beneath the skin.


If a leg is dangling, at an odd angle, or cannot move properly, this may be a sign of a spinal injury. Practice extra care when moving your rabbit onto the towel and into the carrier.

, If your rabbit has been bitten, the wound is only skin deep, and your rabbit is not in shock, you can take time to clean the wound before taking your rabbit to the vet. Flush the wound using iodine solution diluted in warm water to the color of iced tea. If you do not have iodine, use an antiseptic soap in warm wateror make up a salt water solution, which consists of one teaspoon of salt to one cup of previously boiled water.


Be sure the water is warm, as cold water may induce shock.
If a cut is very minor, you may clean it and treat with antibiotic ointment yourself. Be sure to check it regularly to be sure it is healing well., Particularly if the bleeding from a wound is pulsing or gushing, applying pressure may save your rabbit’s life. Using a sterile gauze pad, or a clean towel or cloth if a pad is not available, apply firm but gentle pressure to the wound. Do not remove the cloth or pad if it becomes saturated with blood. Apply another one over it and continue applying pressure. Get your rabbit to the vet as quickly as possible.If you don't have help and need to drive to the vet, bandage the pressure pad in place.

, If a hot liquid or caustic chemical has been spilled on your rabbit, let cool running water flow over the burn for a minimum of 10 minutes. Do this before moving the rabbit to the vet as it is the most effective way of minimizing complications from a fresh burn.Do not apply any ointments, as this will interfere with the vet’s care for your pet.
If your bunny has suffered a burn from biting an electric cord, its mouth may be burnt or there may be fluid in the lungs. If he is breathing rapidly, the latter is more likely. Keep stress to a minimum, and place him in a well ventilated place while you fetch help.

, If the claw has been completely torn off, you’ll want to see your vet, but a broken claw, or one that has been trimmed too close, can be dealt with at home. Apply styptic powder to stop the bleeding (it may take several applications), and check regularly to be sure the claw is healing.

Look for the first symptoms of infection.,
Keep an eye out for the physical symptoms of a more established infection.,
Pay attention to the behavioral symptoms as well.,
Keep a possibly infected rabbit away from other rabbits and clean your rabbit hutch.,
Take your rabbit to a veterinarian.,
Go over the diagnosis with the veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Ear Mites in Rabbits," In a fresh infection the signs are all about irritation. The mite's saliva and feces are extremely irritating and they inflame the ear canal. The rabbit then scratches at the ear to soothe the irritation and makes it bleed. This blood then provides additional food for the mites and encourages them to breed.The symptoms of a new infection include:


Irritation: The rabbit will shake its head and seem troubled by its ears. One or both ears may be affected.
Depression: The irritation may be severe enough for the rabbit to feel depressed and lose interest in what's going on around it. It could even lose interest in eating.
Scratching: The rabbit may scratch its ears with its back legs or front paws.;
, These symptoms are more extreme and need to be treated as soon as possible. Indications of a severe infection include:Wax buildup: Wax and debris build up in the ear. The wax may be a tan or coffee color, and as the infection progresses the quantity increases. Sometimes so much wax is produced that it plugs up the ear canal.
Crusty discharge: The wax becomes flakey and crusty, and may even stain paws where the rabbit has rubbed at its ears. The ear is filled with flaky crusty debris, which extends onto the ear flap and around the base of the ear.Ear infection: A secondary bacteria or fungal infection can invade the ear canal when your rabbit has ear mites. You can tell this is happening if your rabbit has a thick, white discharge coming from the ear.
Spread of Infection: Scratching and rubbing with its paws spreads the mites to places beyond the ears. The crusting starts to affect the outside of the ears, the head, shoulders, and the forelegs or hind paws.
Hair loss: Scratching causes hair loss around the ears.

, Because the infection causes such discomfort, your rabbit may act differently than normal. Above all, it may be uncomfortable and resent having its head or ears touched.The rabbit may be very dull and unhappy.
Sick rabbits tend to stay in one place, hunched up, and not moving.

, The mites are easily passed between rabbits, or can survive outside of a rabbit for a couple of weeks. This means that direct contact between rabbits is not necessary to set up infection., If you suspect your rabbit has ear mites then take it to see a vet. Call your vet and tell the person scheduling the appointments what your rabbit's issues are. They will give you an appointment to bring the rabbit in.

, The vet will perform a thorough head to tail examination of the rabbit. This is to look for other health issues that might be weakening the rabbit's immune system and making it more vulnerable to a mite infection. If another problem is identified, then both issues need to be treated in order for the rabbit to fight off the ear mites.


Next the vet examines the ears. If there is crusting, the vet may flake off a piece of crust and place it on a microscope slide. Alternatively, if there are no flakes, the vet may take a piece of clear adhesive tape and press it against the ear in an attempt to capture mites and put them onto a microscope slide. The vet then examines these slides under a microscope to identify the mite.The vet will look down into the ear canal if it is not blocked by debris. It is sometimes possible to glimpse the mites as tiny bright white blobs that scurry away from the light.
The physical changes in the rabbit's ear, along with a sighting of mites under the microscope will allow the veterinarian to diagnose ear mites in rabbits., The vet will prescribe a course of treatment, usually an ivermectin-based drop that is applied to the back of the neck every other night for three treatments. Any secondary infection will probably be treated with antibiotics.The scabs and scales should be left in place. To make your rabbit more comfortable, try softening them by applying mineral oil with a cotton swab. This will give hopefully eliminate the rabbit's discomfort enough so that the scabs can peel away naturally.

Do not attempt to care for a wild rabbit yourself.,
Make certain the rabbit is wild.,
Be sure the rabbit is really injured.,
Keep pets and children away from the animal and leave it in place if the injury is not serious.,
Contact a vet if the rabbit is seriously injured.,
Wear gloves when picking up a wild rabbit.,
Handle the rabbit with care.",How to Care for an Injured Rabbit2," First off, it is illegal to keep a wild animal unless you are licensed by your state’s Department of Environmental Protection. Secondly, caring for injured rabbits requires careful training and expertise. Without it, you will probably only make the situation worse., Almost all wild rabbits are brown with white tails. If you see a rabbit in the wild with different colors – pure white, jet black, gray, striped, spotted, or mixed – it is likely a domesticated rabbit that has escaped or been set loose. These rabbits need your help. They should be captured even if uninjured and taken to a vet to check for diseases. Afterwards, you can care for them yourself or have the rabbit adopted., In most cases, wild animals should be left alone. Inexperienced handlers can easily fracture a rabbit’s spine picking it up. In addition, the stress of capture often hastens death. If you are going to take a wild rabbit out of its natural environment, you need to be sure it is really injured and needs your help. Some signs that a rabbit is injured include:Lying on their sides for extended periods of time.
Falling over or inability to run in a straight line.
Bleeding or puncture wounds.

, If the rabbit can move and is not bleeding copiously, it is best to leave it in place. Keep dogs and children away from the rabbit., If the rabbit is bleeding, lying on its side and cannot walk, or has been in a cat or dogs mouth, contact a vet. You’ll want to make sure in advance that the vet is willing to see wildlife patients. If not, the vet will usually be able to refer you to a wildlife care or rehabilitation center., Rabbits can be infected with tularemia, a disease that can be transmitted to humans. Symptoms may include ulcers, inflamed eyes, a sore throat, diarrhea, and pneumonia. The disease can be fatal without treatment. To protect yourself, always handle wild rabbits with gloves and wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.

, To a wild rabbit, being picked up by you seems the same as being grabbed by a hawk or other predator, and its response will be one of fear. You must handle the rabbit properly to minimize this fear and reduce the chance of injuring the rabbit further:Do not pick the rabbit up by the ears, legs, or scruff. Instead, put one hand beneath its chest and another under its bottom. Carry it with its head slightly higher than its rear, to reduce it ability to kick out or bite you.
Keep the rabbit close to the ground. The only time rabbits rise high off the ground in the wild is when they are captured by hawks. They don’t like it.
Transfer the rabbit to a carrier as quickly as possible. The shorter the distance you carry the rabbit, the better. You can transport it to the vet in a basket, shoebox, or carrier. Don’t use a carrier that has been used by a cat or dog, as the smells will cause the rabbit anxiety.

Your rabbit could have an upper respiratory infection, which may manifest with runny nose, runny eyes, and sneezing. It could also be a lower respiratory infection, which would include symptoms like loud breathing. Rabbits with lower respiratory infections may also that stick their noses up when breathing.
Foreign object such as a hair or a bit of food trapped in a nasal passage. In this case, there would be few symptoms beyond sneezing.
A dental problem, such as an infection that has spread to the nose, can cause sneezing. This would cause other cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, and is most likely in older rabbits.Again, a veterinarian should make a formal assessment, but you can come prepared with your opinion and information regarding symptoms to help.;
, Not all vets will see rabbits. Those who say they will may not always have enough background with rabbits to correctly evaluate your pet.Ask rabbit owners for vet referrals and search online for rabbit-savvy vets in your area. Always read reviews before making an appointment.

, Take the rabbit to the vet in a carrier or a well-ventilated box, and provide water in the pet carrier for your rabbit in case they need to drink. Many carriers now come with food and water dishes built in. Your pet's safety is the main thing when choosing a carrier, so find the right one for your needs before bringing your sick rabbit to the vet. Choose from crates, slings, and more. You can talk to a pet store owner or ask the vet over the phone what kind of carrier you should purchase if you don't already have one., The vet may have to do different tests, along with a physical exam, to determine the cause of the problem. Your appointment length will depend on what tests the vet feels the need to conduct.


Some vets ask that you bring in a stool sample for testing. This sample should be less than 24 hours old.Your vet may want to do a blood tests, where blood will be drawn from your rabbit. They might also take a sample of any nasal discharge on which to run tests. These tests will help determine what kind of antibiotic will be best to help your rabbit fight the infection, if applicable.
Be sure to tell the vet everything about your rabbit's home, from what your rabbit eats to what kind of bedding he uses.It may be something as simple as a change in bedding that puts an end to the sneezing.

, If you are sent home with antibiotics to give your rabbit, use them as directed and do not skip any doses. You may even receive antibiotics before any test results are back as a precautionary measure.


Skipping doses of antibiotics or finishing antibiotics too early can help create resistant strains of bacteria. This can make it harder to find an antibiotic that will work the next time your rabbit has an infection. Always give the full course, even after symptoms have gone away, making sure to give the correct amount at the correct time.
Some antibiotics may make your rabbit's digestive system slow down. Any changes in appetite or elimination habits need to be reported to your vet to make sure it's a temporary reaction to the medication and not a sign of a more serious problem.
If your rabbit does not eat or eliminate in a 10 – 12 period, contact your vet immediately. This can be a sign of a potentially fatal medical emergency.

, Your rabbit may not be easy to dose with the prescribed medication. Rabbits may dislike the taste or be distrustful of the substance. For this reason, you need to prepare a calm area ahead of time where you can medicate your rabbit.


Choose a flat surface, such as the floor or a table or countertop. Pick a table that's fairly low to the ground in the event the rabbit jumps down.
Have all supplies ready to go. Get out any syringes, pills, or other supplies you might need., To prevent your rabbit from scratching or resisting, wrap it in an old towel. Cover your rabbit gently with a towel and tuck the towel snugly under its body on both sides to keep it from being able to move. Wrap your arm gently around the animal and use the other hand to administer the medication.

, You will probably have to use a disposable syringe as most rabbit meds come in the form of a liquid. With the rabbit secured in the towel, place the tip of the syringe behind the front teeth, and slowly dispense the liquid.

, As pills are shaped like rabbit pellets, many rabbits will eat them without hesitation. If this does not work, try crushing the pill up and mixing it with the rabbit's favorite foods. You can also try mixing with liquids, such as water or fruit juice, etc., Spending more time with your rabbit helps you notice any changes in his behavior. It will also make your rabbit feel more secure knowing you are around. Try to spend time with the rabbit during free time and stay in the room when you can.

, If your rabbit is still sneezing and has a runny nose, use a damp cotton pad to clean away any discharge. Rabbits can only breathe through their noses, so it's essential that you keep their nostrils clear and free of blockage., In addition to simply spending quality time with your rabbit, monitor him in the weeks after your vet trip. Medications can cause side effects. For the most part, these should pass but you should keep an eye on things like lethargy. You should also make sure symptoms clear up after medication is administered. If they don't, you might need to make a second vet trip to see what's going on., Be sure to remove any feces from your rabbit's cage every day. The build up of bacteria can be detrimental to a rabbit's health. You can use a litter box much like you would for a cat as an area for the rabbit to defecate. In addition to removing feces, change out any bedding every couple of days, and every couple of weeks scrub the cage thoroughly with disinfectant spray. You should always take such precautions to protect your rabbit, but especially if your rabbit has been sick."

Your vet will give you specific instructions about your rabbit's care. When in doubt, always follow the vet's advice. Some questions you should ask your vet include:


""What type of pain medication will my rabbit be on?""
""What time should I pick my rabbit up?""
""How long will the rabbit take to heal?""
""What foods would you recommend I feed my rabbit after the surgery?"";
, Thoroughly clean the cage before you bring the rabbit home. You want a clean environment to prevent infection. Remove any shavings, dust, or hay, and replace them with newspaper or a towel. This will help keep the wound clean and clear during recovery. Once your rabbit has recovered (or once it has its stitches removed), you can return shavings to its cage.You can disinfect the cage with a mixture of one part vinegar to four parts water. Use a clean cloth to wipe down the cage's walls and floors.
Sterilize the water bowls and toys in hot water. You can boil water before removing it from the heat for a minute. Pour it over the bowls and toys., While you may have an outdoor bunny, you will want to keep the rabbit inside while it heals. This will allow you to keep a closer eye on your rabbit while making sure that it is in a safe, clean environment while it recovers. Try to find a warm, quiet corner of your house to keep the cage. You can put the hutch in your kitchen, garage, or bedroom as long as the room is kept warm., While you would fast most animals before surgery, rabbits are a special case. You must feed your bunny before a surgery. This is because rabbits cannot vomit, and their fast metabolism means that they almost always need something in their stomachs.If the receptionist or vet asks you to not feed your rabbit, it is recommended that you seek care elsewhere. While it is generally true that you should not feed pets before surgery, rabbits are a special exception, and this may be a sign that your vet is not experienced with rabbit care., If your rabbit has favorite treats, bring these with you to the hospital. Ask the vets to feed your rabbit the treats after surgery. It is important that your rabbit starts eating after the anesthesia wears off, and bringing its favorite food can help encourage it to eat., Take a warm water bottle, and wrap it in dish towels. Place this in the carrier when you bring it home. Once you are home, rewarm the bottle, and place it in the cage. Your bunny may rest against it for warmth. You should not use an electric source of heating as this can cause burns or electrocution. You can also place a light blanket in the cage., Rabbits can be aggressive around each other. While spaying or neutering can calm your bunny, other rabbits can cause injury during the recovery period. This is especially true when keeping male and female rabbits in the same cage.


For up to four weeks after surgery, a male rabbit can still impregnate other rabbits. During this time, its testicles will turn dark and shrivel until they disappear; this is normal. Once the testicles are visibly gone, it is safe to put your bunnies back together.Spayed female rabbits can be injured by male rabbits (even neutered ones). Keep your female rabbit separate from the males until its stitches are removed., While a male rabbit may start eating right away, a female rabbit may lose its appetite. It is absolutely vital that your rabbit begins to eat the day after surgery, at the latest. Try to give it treats and other favorite snacks.


If it still will not eat, put one part pellets and two parts water in a blender, and use a feeding syringe to feed it the mush. Only give this food in pea-sized amounts through the side of their mouth.If it has not eaten for 12 hours after the surgery, call your vet., While your bunny still has its stitches, you do not want it running around aggressively. This will increase the chances of it opening its wound. Keep any dogs or cats away from the rabbit’s cage during this period. Do not remove the rabbit from its cage or let it wander around the house. It is best not to handle it too much for a few days after the surgery, although you can pet it and give it treats.A female rabbit will hide in the corner of its cage for the first 24 hours after surgery. This is normal. Leave it alone, and do not handle it during this time. If it continues this behavior much longer than a day, you should call a vet., Your rabbit may pull at its stitches or rub up against it because of itching or irritation. Fold up a small dish towel, and lay it over the stitches. Use an elastic ACE bandage or gauze wrap to secure it to the rabbit’s body. As long as your rabbit can breathe, it will be fine.If you don’t have an elastic bandage, you can cut off a band from the leg of a pair of tights., Your vet will prescribe a pain medication for your rabbit. Follow their directions, and make sure that the rabbit is receiving the correct dose of medication at the right time. This is especially important when spaying females as it is a more painful surgery than neutering.Your rabbit may be given a pill or an injection that you will have to administer. If you do not feel comfortable injecting your rabbit, ask ahead of time for pills.


Your rabbit may be hesitant to swallow a pill. You can try hiding the pill in some food. You can also dissolve the pill in a little bit of water and use a feeding syringe to give the bunny its medication through the side of its mouth.
Pain medication injections are given to rabbits subcutaneously. This means that the shot only has to penetrate the rabbit's skin. If you are prescribed injections, ask your vet to teach you how to properly give the injection.
Ask your vet when they last gave your rabbit pain medication. It is common for vets to give your rabbit a dose right before they leave for home., Return to your vet when instructed to have the stitches removed. This generally takes place ten days after the surgery. The vet will check the rabbit over to make sure that they have healed properly.Tell your vet if you notice:


Bloody or pus-filled incisions
An open wound or stitches
Diarrhea
A lack of energy or a refusal to leave the corner of the cage
A “Tooth-grinding” noise
Loss of body heatDrainage or swelling near the testicles (for males)"

Since rabbits are prey animals, they tend to hide their pain to avoid looking vulnerable to a predator. Your own rabbit may do the same.Fortunately, one of the most recognizable symptoms of GI stasis is a decrease or complete stop of feces production.


If your rabbit is producing fewer fecal pellets than usual, or has completely stopped producing them, he probably has GI stasis.;
, Another telltale sign of GI stasis is a partial or complete lack of appetite.It would be obvious if your rabbit is not eating at all, but not so obvious if he is eating less. Consider keeping a food diary where you can record how much you gave your rabbit to eat and how much he actually ate.


In addition to eating less, your rabbit will drink less water, which can lead to serious dehydration.
Instead of eating his normal food, your rabbit may eat non-food objects like paper or wood to try to increase his fiber intake.Fiber helps move food through the GI tract, so your rabbit may become desperate to eat anything to get more fiber in his digestive system.

, Unsurprisingly, your rabbit’s overall demeanor will change if he has GI stasis. Even if he tries to hide it at first, his mood will start to change as GI stasis takes its toll. For example, your rabbit will become depressed. He will also become lethargic.Because of his intense pain, your rabbit will start hunching over.Your rabbit may also grind his teeth due to the pain., As GI stasis progresses, your rabbit’s intestines will fill up with gas.If your rabbit will let you, gently place your hands on his abdomen. His abdomen will probably feel doughy to the touch.Remember that your rabbit may be in a lot of pain, so touching his abdomen could make him very uncomfortable., GI stasis in rabbits can be life threatening,so do not delay in getting your rabbit to your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will physically examine your rabbit and run several diagnostic tests to confirm GI stasis. During the physical exam, your veterinarian will palpate your rabbit’s abdomen and put his or her stethoscope on the abdomen to listen for gut sounds.Your veterinarian will also look at your rabbit’s mouth, since dental disease can lead to GI stasis.In addition to the physical exam, your veterinarian will take several samples (feces, urine, blood) for analysis. He or she will also take an x-ray of your rabbit’s abdomen to get a better look at his GI tract.Your veterinarian will need to make sure your rabbit has GI stasis, rather than an intestinal blockage, since these two conditions are treated differently. The difference between the two will be apparent on the abdominal x-ray.If your rabbit has an obstruction, that will need to be treated as well.
Do not attempt to diagnose GI stasis on your own. Not only is it difficult to recognize early on, but other diseases resemble GI stasis.It is best to have your veterinarian diagnose your rabbit’s GI stasis.

, Intensive care by your veterinarian is required to treat your rabbit’s GI stasis.Your rabbit’s treatment plan will have many parts, one of which is pain relief. When his intestines fill with gas, this can stretch the walls of gut and cause intense pain.In addition, pain can cause GI stasis. Therefore, pain relief is an important aspect of treating GI stasis.


Several pain medications are available for your rabbit. Your veterinarian will decide which medication will work best for your rabbit.

, When your rabbit drinks less water with GI stasis, his body will draw water out of his GI tract and move it to other parts of his body in an attempt to stay hydrated.To treat your rabbit, your veterinarian will need to not only rehydrate your rabbit as a whole, but also rehydrate his GI tract so food can move through more easily.Rehydration will also provide your rabbit with much-needed nutrients.The fluids will help stimulate your rabbit’s gut motility.

, Anorexia can cause serious health problems in rabbits (fatty liver disease, gastric ulcers), even after just 12 hours of not eating.Since your rabbit has not been eating due to his GI stasis, it is critical for him to start eating again. Your veterinarian will probably feed him an emergency food called Critical Care.If your rabbit may not be strong enough to eat on his own, your veterinarian will hand feed him using a syringe or feed him through a nasogastric tube.In addition to this emergency food, your veterinarian will give your rabbit free-choice hay and leafy greens.Since alfalfa hay can cause bloating,your veterinarian will instead feed your rabbit some type of grass hay (e.g., timothy, oat, brome).Fresh herbs can stimulate an anorexic rabbit to eat. Examples of herbs are mint, basil, and fennel. Alternatively, your veterinarian may want to use an appetite stimulant, such as B vitamins.Your rabbit will need to be fed frequently (every 3 to 6 hours) to prevent complications from anorexia, restore nutrients, and stimulate gut motility., In addition to rehydrating and feeding your rabbit, your veterinarian will give your rabbit medications (‘prokinetics’) to get his gut moving again. Prokinetics should be given only if your rabbit does not have an intestinal obstruction.Your veterinarian will have determined if your rabbit has an obstruction (e.g., hairball) with earlier diagnostic testing.


Prokinetics may not work immediately. It may take a few weeks for gut motility to return to normal with prokinetics., During the course GI stasis, harmful bacteria (Clostridium) can form in the gut and release bad toxins.Your veterinarian may want to use a medication called Questran that can absorb these bad toxins and pass them through the feces.By absorbing the toxins, Questran can aid the recovery process while other medications are working to restore gut motility.Antibiotics should be used with caution when treating GI stasis in rabbits. Overuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of treatment resistant bacteria, which could make it even more difficult to treat GI stasis., There are treatments that should be absolutely avoided when treating your rabbit’s GI stasis. For example, yogurt and probiotics are not recommended, since the milk starches and sugar in these substances can actually feed the bad bacteria growing in your rabbit’s GI tract. Feeding your rabbit cecotropes (his own droppings) is not a good idea for the same reason.You may have heard that pineapples are a good hairball remedy for rabbits.Since hairballs can form as a result of GI stasis, it may make sense to try to break down the hairball. However, the enzymes in pineapples cannot break down keratin, the main component of hair.Your veterinarian should not give your rabbit pineapple.

, As you can see, treating GI stasis in rabbits is intensive and extensive. It is much easier to prevent GI stasis than to treat it.One of the best ways to prevent GI stasis is to feed your rabbit a high-fiber diet. Hay is an excellent source of fiber, so make sure your rabbit has unlimited access to fresh, high quality hay.


The freshest hay will likely be at your local feed store. The fresher the hay, the more nutrients it will have.Your rabbit can also get a lot of fiber from fresh vegetables, such as leafy greens, celery, and green peppers.The pellets you feed your rabbit should be at least 18 to 20% fiber., In addition to fiber, water is essential to keeping food moving smoothly your rabbit’s GI tract. An easy way to get your rabbit to drink more water is to put it in a bowl instead of a sipper bottle.Refill the bowl often to make sure your rabbit has enough water to drink at all times.


Place the water in a sipper bottle if you will not be home enough to frequently refill a water bowl.

, Stress can cause GI stasis, so you should try to identify and remove the stressors in your rabbit’s environment. Overcrowding is an example of a stressor. If you have more than one rabbit, you may need to separate them to relieve the overcrowding.Excessive heat can also be stressful to your rabbit.If his pen is by a window that gets a lot of direct sun, move his pen to an area of the room that gets less sun.

Enriching your rabbit’s environment with different toys and digging material can keep him busy and help him feel less stressed when you are not around to play with him.If you make any changes to your rabbit’s diet or daily routine, make them gradually.Rapid changes can increase a rabbit’s stress.

, Regular veterinary check-ups would help your veterinarian detect and treat underlying diseases that could eventually lead to GI stasis.For example, your veterinarian can check your rabbit’s incisors and molars to see if their growth is affecting your rabbit’s ability to chew his food.Regular veterinary visits may be costly, but may actually be inexpensive compared to the cost of treating GI stasis.

Talk to your vet about any concerns you may have at this stage concerning the rabbit's biting or aggressive behavior.
Have the vet check the overall health of the rabbit. Biting can be a sign of pain that needs to be treated, such as teeth or gum problems.;
, It is possible that something is frightening the rabbit and causing it to bite or be aggressive as a result.Some things to consider include:


Is the rabbit housed where it can see or be seen by animals that might normally prey on it, such as birds or dogs? If so, move the cage or add covers.
Is the rabbit reacting when you try to remove toys, bedding, water and food bowls, etc., from the cage? If so, the rabbit may be responding in a territorial way and you'll need to remove the rabbit first, then clean the cage.Is the rabbit in a foreign cage all of a sudden? Rabbits are used to the familiarity of their known home space. In the wild, they use their whiskers to check that they've entered the right burrow and if not, they panic.If you need to transfer your rabbit to a new cage, it is a good idea to gradually introduce the cage by keeping it alongside the existing one, letting the rabbit out to explore the new cage and then considering moving the rabbit into the new space.

, It is important to feed the rabbit regularly and on time. A hungry rabbit may bite out of hunger.

, Rabbits have a keen sense of smell. If you have been handling another rabbit that your rabbit is unfamiliar with, even if you've washed your hands, it might be possible that the rabbit can smell this odor and is displeased.In this case, the biting might be triggered out of fear of the other rabbit.

, Whenever the rabbit bites you, make a loud ""eeeep"" noise, imitating the hurt noise a rabbit makes.Then say ""No bite!"" or something similar every time it happens, to reinforce this as a command to stop the behavior.Do not physically discipline a rabbit. It is cruel and pointless, and will only make the rabbit more likely to bite you, out of fear.
Create a noisemaker, such as beans in a can, to shake whenever you're about the issue the ""no bite!"" command.Remain consistent; do the same stopping process every time the rabbit bites, including small nips, as any bite is an unacceptable bite.

, Praise and love the rabbit next, to reinforce the non-biting behavior., Keep your hand flat with the palm facing downward and your fingers spread widely.When petting the rabbit, lower the hand from above the head and pat gently. Do not place fingers or hands in front of the rabbit's face. Use a reassuring voice.

, In some cases, the rabbit may want to socialize more often with you (again, out of boredom), and the biting may be a sign of frustration or demanding this attention., Providing adequate enrichment for your rabbit companion is vital to relieving boredom and keeping the rabbit in a happier frame of mind.


Provide plenty of toys for the rabbit to play with.
Give the rabbit toys with food inside that the rabbit has to work at getting out.
Find objects that require the rabbit to do something constructive with.

, Rabbits can perceive a hand in front of their face as a threat, both because rabbits are near-sighted around the nose area and because they expect a dominant rabbit to threaten them by coming up close to their face.As such, it is advisable to stroke a rabbit from above and avoid all parts of the face except for its forehead.Rabbits do have good eyesight but it's focused on covering the field rather than as we see (stereoscopically), and this is for the reason of being a prey animal., Rabbits are easily spooked, and when this happens, they can use their strength, teeth and claws to injure you.Mishandling can also injure the rabbit's spinal cord or induce a heart attack in the rabbit.Things to keep in mind when holding a rabbit include:


Do not ever pick a rabbit up by its ears.
Put one hand under the rabbit's chest, hold each foreleg separately between your thumb and forefingers. Use your other hand to take the weight under the rabbit's rump.Rather than continuing to hold a rabbit, place it on a solid, non-slip surface for stroking it, but keep it restrained by your hands.If the rabbit is nervous or flighty, you can take its scruff in one hand and support its rump with your other hand while moving slowly and handling the rabbit gently.Realize that a rabbit familiar with you may not appreciate you handling it by the scruff.
At all times, speak calmly and reassuringly. Do not yell, sound afraid or emit high-pitched sounds yourself.

Research pet hospitals in your area.,
Find out if they accept small animals as patients.,
Narrow it down to a nearby choices.,
Visit the individual veterinarians at each pet hospital, if you feel you need to.,
Decide where to go and make your initial appointment.",How to Choose a Veterinarian for Your Pet Rabbit," This could be done by using the internet or by using the Yellow Pages in a phone directory. Most vets have websites, so if you do a search for ""vets in (your town)"", you should get a list of possibilities.;
, Some vets and pet hospitals do not accept rabbits because the veterinarians do not specialize in small animals. Check on their website or call them up to verify whether they'll see bunnies.

, This will allow you to compare the options. Considering the factors that matter most to you, investigate each option by reading their website, sending them an email with your questions, or calling them. Some factors to consider include:


Location: Is it easy to get to from your home, and is parking available if needed? You don't want to have to travel a long way with your rabbit, or carry it a distance.
Facilities: Which building has a nicer facility? Does each vet offer the services you need?
Cost: Find out the cost of a basic office visit, and other common services you might need.
Hours: It's important that your vet is open at convenient times for you. If you'll only be able to take your rabbit in on the weekends or during the evenings, make sure they're open at those times.

, While getting along with your vet might not be your number one concern, you likely still want to make sure that your vet is polite, friendly, conscientious, and knowledgeable. Talk to them and see who makes the best impression. Get an idea of their ""bedside manner"" with your pet. Make sure that they have worked with rabbits before and that they know what they are doing.

, If you decide you don't like that vet afterwards, you can always go and try a different one next time. Nothing is set in stone, and it's pretty easy to jump from vet to vet.

Notice if your bunny is scratching or itching excessively.",How to Determine if Your Rabbit Is Sick," Pay attention if your rabbit’s food dish stays full all day long, or if your pet doesn’t eat like s/he usually does. If your rabbit has a sudden loss of appetite, it can indicate a number of possible illnesses., Normally, rabbits will produce plenty of even, round droppings. However, if your rabbit has any of the following problems, it may have either a gastrointestinal illness, or an issue that causes this as a symptom:


No droppings at allIrregularly shaped droppingsDiarrhea (loose or runny droppings)Hair/fur embedded in droppings, You can use an ordinary stethoscope (available from many pharmacies and home medical supply stores) to check on your rabbit’s digestive system. Simply place the stethoscope on your pet’s belly and have a listen. If you hear unusual sounds (gurgling, rumbling, etc.), this may indicate that your pet is having gastrointestinal problems, especially when combined with other symptoms such as decreased appetite or diarrhea.Carefully pick up your bunny by cradling him/her in your arm and holding him/her close to you. Never pick a rabbit up by the paws or ears. Even if the rabbit kicks or squirms, keep him/her gently but firmly snuggled next to you so that s/he does not fall.Sit down and set your bunny in your lap. Pet him/her and talk to him/her in a soothing voice to calm it down.
Gently place the stethoscope against your rabbit's side and have a listen.
When finished, carefully lower your bunny to the ground or his/her home. Never let a rabbit drop to the ground, as this can injure it.

, Rabbits are susceptible to a common illness called snuffles. Ordinarily, this is accompanied by runny eyes and a runny nose as well as sneezing. If you see any of these symptoms (or all of them at once), you will want to have your bunny inspected by a vet.Unlike human colds that are caused by a virus, rabbit colds are caused by bacteria. Therefore, they can be treated with antibiotics prescribed by a vet., Rabbits are obligatory nose breathers, meaning they won’t breathe through their mouths. Normally, you shouldn’t hear or see any labored breathing. If your rabbit seems to be breathing loudly, or moving its chest significantly when breathing, this may be a sign of a respiratory problem or other issue., Occasionally, a rabbit may get some dust in its nose and need to sneeze. If you notice chronic (frequent) sneezing, however, your rabbit may be sick., Rabbits are able to regulate their temperature by radiating heat through their ears. If you notice that your bunny’s ears are unusually hot or cold, it can indicate that it is sick., If you suspect that your bunny’s temperature is unusually high or low, you can take its temperature to be sure. This can help you or a vet make a diagnosis.Use a plastic rectal thermometer to check your pet’s temperature. If you are uncomfortable with this, or unsure of how to do it, take your rabbit to a vet for help.
A rabbit’s normal body temperature ranges between 101 F - 103 F (38.3 C - 39.4 C).

, If you see tears or a discharge coming from your rabbit’s eyes, this could indicate a variety of illnesses. Aside from respiratory issues, dental problems could be the culprit. The roots of some rabbits’ teeth are close to their tear ducts. Dental problems may put pressure on these parts, which will then cause the tearing., Once your rabbit is fully-grown, it will ordinarily maintain a fairly consistent weight. If you notice that your pet has gained or lost significant weight, especially if this happens suddenly, this may indicate that it is sick., You will be familiar with the color and texture of your bunny’s fur and skin. If you notice that your pet is losing clumps of hair, or that its skin has become reddened, this may indicate an issue such as ringworm.Some conditions can cause a rabbit to have incontinence. Urine-soaked hindquarters are a clear sign of this problem. Contact a vet right away if you notice this issue.

, Rabbits can suffer from a virus known as myxomatosis. This is spread by biting insects such as mosquitos, and can cause redness and swelling of the genitalia, as well as runny eyes and nose.Sit down with your bunny in your lap. Pet it and talk to it soothingly for a few minutes to calm it down.When the bunny is calm, very carefully roll it over, using your non-dominant hand to support its back. Place it so that its head is curled against your abdomen, and its hind feet are sticking out away from you.
Whether male or female, your rabbit's genitals will be a fuzzy protuberance between its hind legs. Normally, they will be hidden by fuzz and not completely visible. If you see any obvious or abnormal swelling or redness, however, this may indicate myxomatosis or another problem.
You can also gently press on your bunny's abdomen above the genital area. This will make the genitals more visible and easier to inspect.Your bunny may not like to be inspected in this way. To avoid accidentally harming it, always be sensitive and keep in mind any injuries or disabilities it may have.

, Rabbits can develop their own personalities, and can display a wide range of normal behaviors. If you notice a sudden change in behavior, however, this may indicate an illness or other health problem. For instance, if sick, a normally playful bunny may not want to be bothered, or an aloof bunny may suddenly become clingy.Regardless of your bunny’s normal behavior patterns, sudden lethargy can be a clear sign that it is sick.

, Rabbits are susceptible to a variety of dental problems, such as malocclusion (misalignment) and abscesses. If you notice your pet drooling, this may be happening because they cannot close their mouth or are in pain due to one of these dental problems., If your rabbit has started to hop unusually, this can indicate a variety of illnesses. For instance, if your pet seems to have lost its balance or moves with its head tilted to one side (a condition called wry neck), this may actually be due to a bacterial infection of the ears. Similarly, if your bunny seems to lean to one side when hopping, this may indicate sore hocks., When happy, many rabbits make a kind of purring sound by grinding their teeth. If your bunny is noisily grinding its teeth together, however, this can indicate that it is in pain.You may notice your rabbit making a happy grinding noise when you are petting it, feeding it treats, or calming it down. Pay attention to this behavior, so that you can know what to expect from your bunny.
Grinding as a reaction to pain will be much louder than the ""happy"" version. You may also notice that the louder grinding is accompanied by other signs of discomfort, such as squirming or kicking.

, A particular virus known as the calicivirus can cause a variety of symptoms, including loss of appetite, lethargy, and breathing difficulties. It can also cause your bunny to shake, however, which may be a more obvious sign., Like dogs, cats, and other pets, rabbits are susceptible to fleas, mites, and other pests. These parasites can cause scratching, itching, and general irritation.If your rabbit has fleas, you may also notice dark, dry dust on your pet’s fur or skin. Known as “flea dirt,” this is dried blood that is a waste product of fleas.
Do not give your rabbit dog or cat flea medication. It can make your pet very sick, and may even be fatal. Talk to your vet about safe ways of eliminating parasites from your rabbit.

Consider your rabbit's age.,
Give your rabbit unlimited hay.,
Give your rabbit hay pellets.,
Your rabbit should have constant access to fresh, clean water.,
Give your rabbit vegetables.,
Feed fruit and treats occasionally.,
Keep your rabbit healthy.,
Don't feed your rabbit unhealthy foods.",How to Balance the Diet of Rabbits," Age makes a big difference in how you should feed a rabbit; it will be mentioned in the following steps.;
, Place a container to hold the hay in the cage and ensure that it is always full of fresh, mold-free hay.


Rabbits under seven months should be fed alfalfa hay; rabbits over seven months should be fed timothy hay.

, A few high-quality pellets is a necessary part of your rabbit's diet; speak with your vet on which brand of pellet you should purchase.


As before, rabbits under seven months should be fed alfalfa hay pellets; older rabbits should be fed timothy hay pellets.

, Use a water bowl (heavy enough not to be tipped over by your rabbit) or water bottle to contain it; switch the water and clean the bottle or bowl daily.

,


Your rabbit can be slowly introduced to green vegetables at twelve weeks.
Adult rabbits should have about two cups of green, leafy vegetables per six lbs. of weight.
Healthy vegetables to feed include basil, clover, wheat grass, bok choy, collard greens, parsley, and others.

,


Fruit such as blueberries, melon, apple (without stem and seeds), plums, strawberries, and others should be fed occasionally, but not in excess.
Treats should be yummy fruits and vegetables; do not feed pet store treats such as yogurt drops.

,


Always thoroughly rinse and dry vegetables and fruit before giving it to your rabbit.
Choose organic vegetables and fruit if possible.
Do not feed your rabbit vegetables and fruit treated with pesticides; if in doubt, do not feed it to your rabbit.

,


Avoid pet store treats such as yogurt drops.
Do not feed your rabbit crackers or sugary human foods.

Choose a rabbit trap.,
Pick a location for your trap.,
Place bait in trap.,
Set your trap.,
Check your trap often.,
Be careful in handling the rabbit.",How to Trap a Rabbit1," These live rabbit traps consist of a cage with a trigger plate forces the door of the trap closed once the rabbit triggers the plate by entering into the cage. You can choose between one door or two door traps, but you'll want a trap that is 22 to 30 inches in length. You can often purchase these online or at an animal feed or hardware store or make your own rabbit trap. Havahart is a popular brand for rabbit traps.The one and door two traps are both effective traps, but have different benefits. The one door trap is favored by professional trappers and it allows you to place the rabbit bate behind the trigger plate, which lures the rabbit further into the cage.
The two door trap allows the rabbit to enter the cage from both directions, thus providing a higher catch rate for rabbits. Rabbits will also become nervous or fearful once in the trap, but having a two door trap allows the rabbit to see through the trap, which can be comforting for the rabbit. The two door trap can also be set as a one door trap if desired.;
, Determine where you have the most rabbit activity and place a trap along that area. Rabbits don't often cross stretches of land, so avoid placing a trap in an area that would require the rabbit to be vulnerable. You'll want to place your trap on a flat surface, placing a small weight on top of the trap so that other animals cannot tip it over to reach the bait.


Rabbits are often in areas where they have cover and open land. Common areas rabbits are located are hedges, shrubs, trees, fence lines, tall grass, wood and brush piles, bushes, and tree lines. These are the locations you'll likely have the most success in catching a rabbit.
If you are able to locate a rabbit's den or warren (rabbit hole), then place the trap a few feet from the entrance.
You can often locate areas where rabbits have been by their droppings, which are dry, round pellets.

, Choose a bait that is likely to attract rabbits and place bait behind trigger plate. In the winter, dried foods are better because they are less likely to freeze and in the summer, when food is abundant for rabbits, choosing richer fruits or vegetables, like apples and carrots, will be more effective in trapping a rabbit.


If you are using a one door trap, place bait at the end of the cage, behind the trap opening. If you are using a two door trap, place bait between the two doors, in the center of the trap.
Some baits to use for rabbits are fruits and vegetables like apple cores, bananas, potato peelings, lettuce leafs, raw cabbage, carrots, dandelions, and leafy weeds.
If you find traditional baits aren't producing success, you can try using baits that are more unusual. Some ideas for these types of baits are cheesy biscuits crumbled up and peanut butter.
Rabbits may be able to smell your scent on the trap and will avoid the trap because they feel that something is wrong. To cover up your scent, drip or spray apple cider onto the trap., Now that you have placed your bait, it's time to set your trap. Follow the trap's instructions explaining how to set your trap. After you have set your trap, you'll want to check the trigger to make sure it is working properly. Gently press down on the trip plate, and the doors should immediately snap closed.If the rabbit you are trying to trap is on the smaller side, they may not be able to trip the trigger, so place a small weight on the trigger plate so that the combined weight of the two will be enough to make the trap effective.
It could also be good to camouflage your trap with twigs and leaves, because a metal trap can produce a glare in the sun, causing the rabbit to avoid it.

, After you have set your trap, you'll want to check it often to see if you have caught a rabbit. If a rabbit is caught and you neglect your trap, the rabbit can quickly become malnourished, so you want to check the trap daily to prevent harming the rabbit.


Keep in mind you may accidentally trap other animals in your trap. Raccoons are often lured into rabbit traps as well as other animals, so if you catch another animal release it immediately.
You may find that you are not having much success with your trap if you are trying to catch a rabbit in the summer. That's because during the summer, rabbits often have a much higher supply of food and nutrients available to them. The best time to trap a rabbit is in the winter, when food is more scarce and the rabbit will be in search of food.

, If you have checked your trap and found a rabbit in it, be careful when removing the rabbit as it is probably scared and may bite you. Consider wearing gloves when removing the rabbit to prevent disease from spreading if it bites you, and approach it cautiously to prevent from frightening it even further.If you have caught a rabbit in hopes to keep it from destroying your garden or flowerbeds, then relocate the rabbit at least five miles away, if local law permits. Try placing the rabbit in a covered area, for extra protection.

Find a location.,
Dig a hole.,
Cover the hole with twigs and leaves.,
Place bait.,
Check the trap regularly.,
Fill the hole back in.",How to Trap a Rabbit2," A pit trap is probably one of the simplest forms of trapping a rabbit, as it just requires using the natural habitat of a rabbit, but it is probably one of the least successful. To begin this process, you'll want to find a good location to dig your pit. Look for signs of a rabbit, like a rabbit den or warren, rabbit droppings, or rabbit tracks.

, After you've found a good location for your pit, dig a hole that is deep enough that the rabbit won't be able to escape once it gets caught. A rabbit can jump approximately one meter high, or three feet, and three meters long, so it's best to build a hole that is very deep and narrow, making it difficult for the rabbit to jump out., In order to camouflage the hole, you'll need to place some twigs and leaves on top of it that blend in with the rest of the environment. Be careful not to put too much foliage on top of the hole that it's sturdy enough for a rabbit to sit on. Use just the right amount of foliage that the rabbit believes it to be normal ground, but will fall through it if it sits on it.If you are unsure about the amount of foliage you have used, you can test out the trap by placing a five pound weight on top of it and see if the weight falls through. If it doesn't, then you have too much covering the hole and will need to remove some.

, After you have covered the hole adequately, you'll want to place bait on top of the hole to lure the rabbit in. You can use the same bait mentioned in the previous section -- foods like vegetables and fruits.

, Now that you've set the pit trap the only thing left is to check it daily, and once you've caught a rabbit, you can relocate it or kill it for food. The downside of this trap is it's easy to catch other animals in it, so when checking the trap, just be careful. You'll likely have some frightened animals inside of it that won't be afraid to bite you.


As with the cage trap, use gloves and caution when handling wild animals. It's likely they'll try to bite you and they may carry diseases or have rabies.

, Once you have caught the rabbit, fill the pit you created back in with dirt or foliage. You don't want another animal falling in it and injuring themselves or becoming malnourished, so always cover up and remove any traps you have set once you are finished using them.

Understand a snare.,
Look for signs of rabbits.,
Gather your materials.,
Create the noose.,
Create your base trigger.,
Create your hook trigger.,
Connect the noose.,
Connect the leader line.,
Test out the snare.,
Check your snare frequently.",How to Trap a Rabbit3," Before you compose a snare, it's important to know that this mechanism does more than just trap a rabbit. If you are trying to trap a rabbit to relocate it, do not use a snare. A snare is essentially a noose mechanism that will kill a rabbit if it gets trapped and should only be used for hunting.


Different states also have different laws about snares, so make sure you check your state's guidelines on hunting with snares.

, Before you set a snare, you'll want to find a location that will give you the most success. A snare is best used in a more wilderness setting, like a forest where rabbits are frequent and the signs are easily identified. You can identify rabbits by their droppings (small, round, dry pellets), burrows, or tracks.

, To make a rabbit snare you will need wire (copper strands, picture hanging wire, or craft wire), wood or two sticks, and a tree that is bent. These materials will be used to create the noose, two part trigger, leader line, and engine, all of which are part of a Trigger Spring Snare. This specific type of snare is more advanced, so you may want to try a simple snare first.The noose is the part of the snare that will actually trap the animal. The two part trigger consists of a hook and a base. The base is a piece of wood, stuck in the ground that connects to the hook, which is what the noose is tied to. The leader line is a cord that is connected to the engine and the hook. The engine is usually a tree, like a bent over sapling or an extended branch, that provides tension to the hook and holds the snared animal.
Essentially, the snare starts from the tree, which is bent over, and at the bent over part of the tree the leader line is connected, hanging down until it connects to the hook, which is a piece of wood that stands straight up and connects to the base, which is also straight up, but stuck in the ground. The noose then connects to the end of the hook.

, The length of the cord to create your noose needs to be about 18-24 inches long. First, begin by taking the end of your wire and create a loop, about the diameter of a pencil. You can take a pencil and wrap the wire around it, and then twist it together at the end to create your loop. Then, with the remaining wire, run a few inches of it through the loop, creating a noose. You'll connect the remaining end of the wire to the trigger., Your trigger is composed of two sticks or pieces of wood that are carved out to fit together. Taking a sturdy stick, make a straight carve, halfway into the stick, about an inch from the top of the stick. Then, carve down, parallel to the stick about an inch, and make another straight carve, from the middle of the stick to the outside of the stick. Carve out that piece of wood until you have a cavern in the wood that resembles a mouth.

, The hook trigger will be turned upside down, and slid into the base trigger. Taking your other piece of wood or stick, place it up to the mouth of the base stick, with the top of the hook stick at the bottom of the mouth. Then, mark a line where the top of the mouth of the base stick hits the hook stick. Carve a straight line about halfway into the stick, creating a pipe shape. Your hook should then fit into your base.

, Once you have created your trigger, stick the base into the ground until it feels sturdy, and then tie the loose end of your noose around the hook part of the trigger, right above where the hook fits into the base., This line will be suspended from the ""engine"" connecting to the hook of the trigger. Tie the copper wire around the end of the hook, above where the noose is tied. Then, pull the line upwards to the end of your engine and connect it securely. When a rabbit enters the snare, the leader line and hook should pull away from the base, and the rabbit will be suspended from the tree.


If you can't find a bent over tree, then you can connect your snare to a branch that is weighted down. The engine just needs to have some tension, so that it can withstand the initial spring jerk and it needs to be strong enough to suspend the animal in the air.
Having a sturdy engine also leads to a more humane death, as the animal will die quickly, and it also prevents other predators from eating the rabbit.

, Before you set up the snare and wait to catch a rabbit, you'll want to test the snare by using a log (about five to eight pounds). Slide the log through the noose, making sure the hook and engine are working together to spring the noose into the air. If it seems to be working you're good to go!

, Your snare needs to be checked several times a day if possible, so that you can collect your game before it starts to spoil and to prevent it from suffering longer. Once you have caught a rabbit, remove it and use as much of it as possible. The rabbit gave its life for you, so you don't want to waste it!

Approach the rabbit in a slow, calm manner.,
Grasp the rabbit’s scruff.,
Support the rabbit’s bottom with your other hand.,
Cover the rabbit’s eyes.,
Hold the rabbit like a football.,
Place the rabbit on a table or other surface.,
Use a towel to keep the rabbit still.,
Tighten your grip if the rabbit struggles.",How to Restrain a Rabbit," Rabbits scare easily, so it is important to go slow when you pick up your rabbit. Try not to make any sudden movements or do anything else that might scare the rabbit.For example, do not yell, jump up and down, or thrust your hand into the rabbit’s cage. Instead, try to speak in a low voice, approach the cage at a slow and steady pace, and then slowly reach into the rabbit’s cage.;
, When you reach into the rabbit’s cage, the best place to grasp the rabbit is by the scruff of its neck. Grabbing the rabbit’s scruff will restrain the rabbit, prevent it from biting or scratching you, and allow you to gently pull the rabbit out of the cage.Do not hold the rabbit by the scruff of his neck alone. Make sure that you are ready to support the rabbit’s bottom with your other hand right away.

, Rabbits will kick fast and hard if their back legs are not well-supported. Make sure that you place a hand under your rabbit’s bottom at the same moment that you lift him out of his cage. You should have one hand on the rabbit’s scruff and the other hand should be supporting the rabbit’s bottom., Since rabbits are prey animals, being lifted off of the ground can be a frightening experience. Rabbits associate being lifted off of the ground with being in danger. One way to calm down a rabbit when you pick it up is to place a small towel over his eyes. This will prevent the rabbit from seeing that he is not on the ground.

, You can restrain a rabbit just by holding it in your arms. The best way to hold a rabbit is similar to how you would hold a football. The rabbit’s body should be cradled by one of your arms and you should have your other hand on top of the rabbit. The rabbit should be tucked slightly under your elbow so that you cannot see his face.Never hold a rabbit by its ears, scruff, or around its chest. These holding methods can hurt a rabbit and cause unnecessary stress.Rabbits also have powerful legs and they can kick hard enough to injure themselves when their legs are not supported.

, Rabbits feel more secure when they are on a flat, solid surface, so try placing your rabbit on a table or on the floor. Keep one hand on the rabbit’s neck scruff and the other hand on the rabbit’s backside to keep him in place.If the rabbit struggles, try applying some more pressure to help him feel secure.

, You can also wrap a rabbit up in a towel to prevent him from struggling or hopping around.Start with the rabbit on a surface and then place a towel over the rabbit’s back so that the towel comes up to his neck.


Next, wrap the rabbit in the towel by tucking one edge under the rabbit and then turning the rabbit onto his side to wrap the towel around him. Keep wrapping the towel around the rabbit until he is bundled up to the neck and cannot escape.
Try a zippered canvas bag or restraint box. You can also use a zippered canvas cat bag or restraint box to restrain a rabbit.To use one of these devices, you will just need to put the rabbit into the bag or box and either zip it up or close the lid.

, A rabbit will not struggle if it is being held in a tight, secure way. If your rabbit is struggling, then you may want to tighten your grip or place the rabbit on a surface until you can get a better grip.Try pulling the rabbit in closer to your body. Rabbits are comforted by being pressed on from all sides, so you may even try holding the rabbit in between your thighs while you sit in a chair or on the ground.

In the wild, the only time rabbits are held is when they are being picked up by a predator—you certainly don’t want your mini lop to see you as the enemy!Give your mini lop time to become comfortable with you and see you as someone he can trust.


If you need to move him from one area to another, place him in a pet carrier or sturdy cardboard box that has some tasty treats in it. Leave it in his area for a few days so that he does not automatically associate it with going to the veterinarian.;
, Your mini lop will be good at sensing if you are about to pick him up. To prevent him from associating your presence with only being picked up, spend some quality bonding time with him. For example, sit calmly in his pen and let him come to you.Rabbits are independent animals, so you should give your mini lop the freedom to approach you when he feels like it.


When you are in his area, do not pay attention to him.While you wait for him to approach you, consider reading a book or magazine.
The more quiet time you spend with him, the more your mini lop will become comfortable with your presence.
Fortunately, lop-eared rabbits enjoy interacting with their owners,so it probably won’t be long before your mini lop comes to you for attention and affection.

, This is not as simple as just walking up to your mini lop. Making a direct approach may look aggressive to him, causing him to run in the opposite direction. Instead, walk towards him at a slight angle, as if you are about to walk right past him.To prevent weight gain, offer food that is part of his normal daily food ration.You may need to stop a short distance away from your mini lop and let him come to you.Eventually, he may allow you to walk up to him with the food.
You can also offer him food while you are sitting in his area.

, When you hold your mini lop, you will mainly be touching his chest, shoulders and bottom. Keep in mind that your mini lop is very perceptive—if you touch him only when you want to hold him, he will soon associate being touched in those three areas with being picked up.Your goal should be to touch him in those areas, regardless of whether you want to hold him.


Just like your mini lop needs time to become comfortable with you, he also needs time to adjust to being touched.
As you sit and spend time with him, touch him all over his body.
The more you touch the three ‘hold’ areas without picking him up, the less likely he will think you’re about to pick him up and hold him.Be patient with your mini lop. It may take a while before he begins to enjoy your touch.

, By now, you may be getting a little anxious to pick up your mini lop and hold him. Not so fast! You don’t want to risk weakening your bond with him by picking him before he’s ready. Get him used to the action of being held by putting one hand under his chest and applying gentle pressure.Approach his chest from his side so your hand reaches from one side of his chest to the other.
Use just enough pressure so he feels what you’re doing, but not so much that his feet leave the ground.Your mini lop may want to run away. If he does, let him do so and try again later.
When he stops running away, gently apply more pressure with your hand until his feet barely leave the ground.Place his feet back on the ground after a few seconds.
Give him a few treats with your other hand., When your mini lop feels comfortable with his front feet being off the ground, practice lifting his back feet up. Cup your hand around your mini lop’s bottom so your fingers wrap slightly under his body between his to back legs. Add a gentle yet increasing amount of pressure to lift up his back legs.His front legs should still be on the ground.
Return his back feet to the ground after a few seconds.
Give him treats with your other hand.

, Now it’s time to support his chest and bottom at the same time. Place one hand under your mini lop’s chest and run your other hand down his back before positioning it around his bottom. Lift only his front feet off the ground and then return them to the floor.Keep some treats on the ground that he can eat when you put his front back down.
You can try lifting his back end up, too.

, Your mini lop may want to move away when you are touching him. That’s okay! Let him get away without going after him. If you try to grab him, he may associate being touched with something negative—this would make it harder for you to pick him up and hold him.Your rabbit needs to continue to feel comfortable around you. When you give him freedom to move away, he will be more relaxed around you.
Give him treats to encourage him to stay nearby as you are touching him., It may have taken a few weeks, or maybe even longer, to get your mini lop comfortable with the idea of being held. Your patience has finally paid off! With your hands positioned under his chest and around his bottom, gently pick your mini lop off the ground. Start with holding him just slightly off the ground, then work up to holding him in your lap.You may want to hold his back legs with the hand that’s supporting his bottom. This would prevent him from kicking his back legs out.
Your mini lop should not be wriggling or struggling when you hold him.If he does, let him go.
Start by holding him for a few seconds, then slowly increase the amount of time you hold him.
Give him a treat when you can pick him up and hold him without him struggling., Your mini lop will want to feel secure in your arms. To do this, keep a firm hold on his chest and bottom. If your mini lop does not feel safe and secure when being held, he may begin to panic and struggle to escape, which could result in you getting scratched.If your mini lop begins to struggle, he may start kicking his back legs, which are surprisingly strong. He may kick them so hard that he breaks his back.

, Although your mini lop may not always feel comfortable being held, you should aim to hold him as often as you can (and as often as he will allow).It would be ideal to hold him every day,but keep in mind that your mini lop may not want to be held that often.


Read his body language. If he initiates affection with you, he may be in the mood to be held.
Frequent handling may help your mini lop maintain a calm temperament,but only if he is comfortable with the idea in the first place.

, As tiny as mini lops can be, they were bred to be hardy enough to be held by young children.However, children can be rough. If you have children, teach them how to properly pick up and hold your mini lop.


Do not allow your children to run with your mini lop in their arms. This could be very frightening to him.Keep a close eye on your children when they handle your mini lop.

Help your rabbit get comfortable with handling by petting the rabbit gently.,
Know how not to pick up a rabbit.,
Practice placing your palm under the rabbit's chest and gently lifting its front legs off the ground, then setting it back down.,
Gently use the loose skin behind the rabbit’s neck to hold onto its scruff.,
Use two hands to lift the rabbit up.,
Use the right approach.,
Coax the rabbit out of a hiding place, don't drag it out.,
Look for warning signs that the rabbit will not allow you to pick it up.,
Hold the bunny with the head slightly higher than the hindquarters.,
Lift the rabbit carefully to your side (or in front of your mid abdomen), under your arm.,
Pass your rabbit to another person correctly.,
Limit possible injury.,
Use a carrying case or a wrap for extra-wriggly rabbits.,
Lower the rabbit carefully to the ground (or a top-loading carrier) while holding the bunny in the “football hold.” There is a risk of releasing the rabbit when it is in your arms and the rabbit landing on the ground poorly and injuring itself.,
Place a rabbit in a front loading carrier by putting it in hind legs first with the rabbit facing you.,
Reward the rabbit with a treat.",How to Pick up a Rabbit," Start with short intervals and increase the time with the bunny. Consider placing a nice plate of greens out for the rabbit to eat while you stroke the rabbit to decrease any potential anxiety.


Don't make sudden moves or sounds that might alarm your rabbit. Be gentle and soothing when you pet the rabbit. Rabbits are prey animals, so when they feel threatened, they run and hide if they can.
Sit on the floor to minimize your size and avoid towering over the bunny.;
, Never pick up a rabbit by his ears, legs, or tail.Rabbits are very delicate and you could severely injure them if you pick them up incorrectly.Grabbing on to limbs, tails, or ears will cause the rabbit to react by pulling away. Doing so may cause a fracture or a dislocation or tearing of underlying muscle and soft tissue.A bunny new to the household should be picked up and restrained by adults at first. Children can pet the bunny while it is on the floor or while sitting in the child’s (or adult’s) lap sitting on the floor.
Staying close to the ground for a while is a good preventative measure. Should the rabbit try to escape, they will not fall a long distance and potentially injure themselves.

, Reward the rabbit with a treat afterward. This will help it get used to the feeling of being picked up., Do not pick the rabbit up by the scruff alone, but use this as a handle to prevent forward motion while you use your other hand arm to tuck the hind legs under the bunny and scrunch the bunny in a gentle “bunny ball.”


Your free hand that is not holding the scruff should be placed on the bunny’s rump. You should roll the back legs underneath, toward the front of the bunny, holding the feet up with your hand. This will prevent the rabbit from kicking out and potentially injuring itself.
There are differing opinions on whether or not to scruff a rabbit. Scruffing, done gently, does not injure the rabbit., Place one under his chest and one under its behind. The positioning should be comfortable for both you and the rabbit. Make sure you have a firm (but not tight) grip on the rabbit's body so that it doesn't leap from your hands when you lift.


Make sure to contain the hind legs securely, by keeping your hand on the rump and scrunching the hind legs up toward the bunny’s head. Remember, you are holding the hind legs so that they point forward, toward the head, the opposite direction of where the hind legs would be should the bunny kick out.
It may help to kneel to get closer to the rabbit, so you don't have to bend and lift. Get down on the ground with the rabbit.

, It's best to lift a rabbit either from a top-opening cage or a confined area in your house. It can be much more difficult to lift a rabbit from a side opening cage. Rabbits will often run and hide when approached, so trying to pick up a rabbit in a room with lots of furniture will also be difficult.


When removing a rabbit from a side or front opening carrier, do so with the hind legs first out of the opening. That way, if they get out of your grip, they will jump back into the carrier and not down to the ground.Use one hand to hold the bunny’s head away from you, toward the back of the cage, while gently holding on to the scruff. The other hand is used over the bunny’s rump to scrunch the hind legs up into the “bunny ball” hold. Then lift the bunny out, hind legs toward you, and place under your arm so the bunny’s head is given a place to hide.
If you are getting the bunny out of a top-opening carrier, you can use the same technique, just remember not to dangle the bunny by the scruff.
If this is a well handled and calm bunny, you are likely to be able to safely pick up the bunny with one hand under its chest and one hand scrunching the rump, without holding on to the scruff.
Be aware, that if the bunny feels like it might fall, it will struggle and kick and try to get down. If this happens, place the bunny back in the carrier and re-grip or go back to using the scruff to help with restraint.

, If your rabbit tends to run under furniture, coax it out with a treat before trying to pick it up. Better yet, manage the area to prevent the rabbit from being able to get away and hide so that it doesn't have access to hiding places that are difficult for you to access. Try using an exercise pen to confine the bunny, but still allowing them an area large enough to hop around.


Never pull on a rabbit's legs or tail to get it to move closer to you. It is better to gently get a hold of the scruff to prevent the rabbit from getting away, then you can get an arm around the rabbit’s body and contain the hind legs. Never forcefully scruff a rabbit or dangle it by the scruff. This will cause the rabbit injury.

, If a rabbit thumps a hind leg when you approach, be aware that this is a warning to you that you are in their territory and they are not thrilled with your presence. The rabbit may be more difficult to handle, so be prepared.


Again, remember to use confinement within an exercise pen or other area to help you manage the rabbit’s access to hiding places and allow you find and restrain the rabbit more easily.

, Do not point its head down because the rabbit may then try to jump down, out of your arms, and may hurt itself.

, The rabbit will feel more secure being able to hide a bit. Your rabbit should be held and carried securely under your arm, nestled comfortably under your “wing.”Some people call this the “football hold.”


If you are right handed, place the bunny’s head under your left arm. Wrap your left arm around the outside of the rabbit while using your left hand to continue to securely hold the rabbit’s hind legs under it.
Place your right hand gently over the bunny’s neck, ready to get a hold of the scruff should the bunny move suddenly.
Do not hold your rabbit extended outward or swing it through the air.

, Ideally, place the rabbit on a table and restrain it while the other person gets a hold of the bunny. Don't try to pass the bunny in mid air. This could lead to the rabbit getting loose and falling from a great height.

, If you ever feel like you are losing control when carrying the rabbit, immediately crouch down to the ground or to a table to decrease the distance that it might fall. This will also give you a surface upon which to regroup and re-grip the bunny.

, Some rabbits really dislike being handled and no amount of treats or petting will change their personalities. For these types, it's best to use a carrying case to move them from one place to the next, rather than attempting to pick them up.


Use one hand to hold the scruff to restrain the rabbit and get your other hand on the rump and “scrunch” the bunny in a “bunny ball” to transfer to the carrier.

, Be sure to keep a firm grip the entire time, because rabbits tend to try to jump once they can see the floor.

, This method decreases the chance of the bunny kicking out and injuring itself., After spending time in your arms without biting or leaping away, your obedient rabbit deserves a treat. Gently pet it as you give it a reward. The rabbit will realize that being picked up isn't so bad, and next time it may even go more smoothly.

Let the rabbit know that you're coming.,
Stay low to the ground as you approach your rabbit.,
Sit down and let the rabbit come to you.,
Show the rabbit your hand.,
Avoid startling the rabbit when showing him your hand.,
Make sure your rabbit is comfortable before you start petting him.,
Pet your rabbit in the right places.,
Pick up your rabbit with care.,
Pay attention to your rabbit's mood.,
Get your rabbit back in his cage carefully when you're finished.",How to Pet a Rabbit," Remember that rabbits are prey animals. That means they are naturally used to being hunted, so if you startle them they'll run away. Accordingly, you should always give your rabbit a warning that you're approaching so he won't get scared.Don't sneak up behind the rabbit. If you enter the room and your rabbit is facing away from you, give him a signal you're in the room. Speak softly or make light kissing noises. This way, he won't feel like you're sneaking up on him.;
, Rabbits can be startled by something large like you approaching them, even if they already know you're there. Especially if your rabbit has a nervous disposition or isn't used to being handled yet, approach slowly and try to stay low. That way you can avoid startling your rabbit as you approach., Grabbing your rabbit or forcing him to come over is a good way to scare him and get bitten. When you're close enough, you should let the rabbit come to you to avoid this. Allowing him to move at his own pace will ensure that he's comfortable and wants to come over to you. This will make it easier for you to pet him, play with him, and pick him up.If your rabbit is new to the house, he might be hesitant to approach you right away. It is important to not force him to come to you. Keep up this process for a few days until he begins approaching you to ensure that he is comfortable when you start petting him.

, Move it towards the rabbit gently, placing it at eye level and off to the side. Allow the rabbit to sniff your hand, at its convenience. You might also want to give your rabbit a treat at this point, especially if you just got him and he isn't used to you yet. Hand-feeding is a good bonding exercise, and it will also teach your rabbit that you aren't a threat and he can approach you safely., While the hand presentation is part of bonding, you could scare your rabbit if you do it improperly. Keep the following in mind to make sure your rabbit stays happy and comfortable during this process.Present your hand to the rabbit's front end, not back. Otherwise you'll scare him when he realizes your hand is approaching.
Rabbits can't see directly in front of their face or under their jaw. Bring your hand in from slightly off to the side to ensure that your rabbit sees it coming.
Do not put your hand below the rabbit's nose. While presenting your hand under the jaw shows submission to dogs and cats, it has the opposite presentation in rabbits, as a dominant rabbit will approach another and demand to be groomed by the other by lowering its head under the other rabbit's nose. If you approach a nervous rabbit this way, it will likely make it more nervous, and if you do this to a territorial or dominant rabbit, you might get nipped.

, Remember that rabbits can have nervous dispositions and may not enjoy getting pet unless they're ready for it. If your rabbit has approached you, it is a signal that he is comfortable and open to being pet. Until your rabbit approaches you himself, don't try to touch him.

, Rabbits can be particular about where they are touched. Their favorite areas are on the cheeks, forehead, shoulders, and back. These are areas where rabbits usually, groom each other, so they'll appreciate you petting them here.Stick with these areas to ensure your rabbit is happy and has a good experience.


Generally, don't try to rub their chins. Unlike cats or dogs, rabbits don't usually like getting their chins scratched and it puts you in easy reach to receive a bite. Also avoid trying to pet your rabbit's stomach or paws as these are vulnerable areas for them.

, Rabbits need to be gradually introduced to being picked up, possibly over several days or more. It is an unnatural experience that they have to get used to. If your rabbit has never been picked up before, don't try to pick him up right away. Read Pick up a Rabbit for an explanation on how to pick him up safely.

, Your rabbit will give you signals indicating whether or not he's happy. Pay close attention to these signals, because you wouldn't want to go on doing something that your rabbit doesn't like.Purring and light tooth clicking indicates that your rabbit is happy. Rolling over, climbing on you, placing his head on the ground, licking, and nudging you with his nose also indicate happiness and desire for attention. Keep petting your rabbit if he does these things- he's having a good time.
Growling, grunting, and squealing indicate fear or pain. Stop petting and put him down until he gets relaxed again.
Rabbits also sometimes go up on their hind legs and put out their front feet like they're going to punch you. This is a defensive posture and you should leave your rabbit alone if he does this.
If your rabbit turns around and tries to get away, let him go. He may be tired or scared, and forcing him to play will make it worse. Let him go back to his caged and rest before trying to play again.

, Rabbits, especially young ones, can be defiant and resist going into their cages. Since it can be dangerous to pick up your rabbit abruptly, you should only force him into his cage if it's an emergency. Rabbits will usually go into their cages by themselves when they're tired. If you're in a hurry, coax them inside by placing a treat in the cage. It also helps to make sure the cage is set up properly so your rabbit will be comfortable going back in.Read Raise a Healthy Bunny for details on how to set up your rabbit's cage and what treats are safe to give him.


Also don't force him out of the cage. Rabbits like to have a space that they can retreat to and relax. When they want to play or explore, they'll come out on their own. Leave your rabbit alone when he's in his cage, unless you suspect he may be hurt or sick. Otherwise, let him come out when he wants to.

It might be overwhelming to think about what adjustments you will need to make to care for your disabled rabbit. Taking him to your veterinarian will give you a better understanding of your rabbit’s disabilities and help you learn how to manage the disabilities at home.


Causes of disability in rabbits include injury, arthritis, and genetic deformities.Your veterinarian can identify the disability and explain complications of that disability (e.g., lack of bladder control, limited mobility).
Your veterinarian can make specific ‘lifestyle’ recommendations based on the type of disability.;
, Caring for a disabled rabbit takes a lot of work. The work can be rewarding, of course, but you must determine if you are ready to make that level of commitment. Consider your current life obligations and financial picture: do you have the time to provide extra care, and can you afford it?


Do not feel bad if you decide that you cannot make the full commitment to care for your disabled rabbit.
Contact local rabbit rescue groups in your area to ask if they can take in disabled rabbits.The rescue group could then work on finding someone who could give your disabled rabbit the care he needs and deserves.

, When a pet is disabled, its quality of life may be affected as well. As you think about your options for caring for your disabled rabbit, consider how much pain he is in (if any) and how much he seems to be enjoying life. Fortunately, your rabbit can still have a good quality of life with his disability, provide that you give him dedicated and proper care.Keep in mind that not all disabilities can be treated. If the disability cannot be treated or managed well, it may negatively affect your disabled rabbit’s quality of life.It can be difficult to see your rabbit suffer from a disability. Talk with your veterinarian if you are concerned about how your rabbit’s disability is affecting his quality of life.

, If you have decided to take on the responsibility of caring for your disabled rabbit, you will first need to create a comfortable place for him to eat, rest, and play. There are several housing options: an exercise pen, a human crib, a dog crate, and a cage. Each option has its benefits, so it will be up to you and your veterinarian to decide which option will work best for your rabbit.


Factors to consider when deciding on a housing option include your rabbit’s mobility and his ability to control his bladder.Your rabbit’s housing should be free of obstacles and allow you easy access to him.Exercise pens work great for disabled rabbits, since the pens have a natural openness and provide your rabbit with freedom to move around. Pens can also be manipulated to fit different spaces. For a disabled rabbit, the pen should be low enough so you can easily reach down and access him.Human cribs are also good choices. In addition to being open and easily accessible, a crib has built-in supportive bedding and keeps your disabled rabbit off the floor where he could become cold. If you can, find a crib with wheels so you can move it closer to where you are.Medium- to large-sized dog crates work well for disabled rabbits who should live in a more restricted space. Crates are also very portable and provide easy accessibility.Rabbit cages are generally not suitable for disabled rabbits, but can be useful to restrict a rabbit’s movement shortly after an injury. Fortunately, accessories such as food and water bowls are designed to work well in cages., Where you decide to put your disabled rabbit’s housing can play a large role in his overall care. Despite his disability, your rabbit will still want to feel like he is a part of your family.Pick a common area of your home where you and your family members tend to gather, such as the family room.


Even though your rabbit will be confined to an area of that room, he will likely appreciate feeling like he is still being included in your life.
Make sure the area where you house your rabbit is not loud.Your rabbit's housing should be in an area where the temperature is constant and not too hot. The area should also be free of drafts and out of direct sunlight., Comfortable bedding is essential for your disabled rabbit. Provide him with multiple layers of bedding. The bottom layer should be something thick and absorbable, such as a small area rug or bath mat with a rubber bottom. This layer keeps the floor from getting wet and provides extra cushion.The next layer should consist of some padding, such as disposable puppy pee pads, to absorb moisture.Washable pet pee pads are also available.Make sure the pads are fragrance free.Place several white towels on top of the padding to absorb moisture. The white color allows you to see when your rabbit goes to the bathroom.The very top bedding layer should be a synthetic wool or fleece, which will wick away wetness and provide your rabbit with some warmth and orthopedic support.Synthetic sheepskin is also effective at wicking away moisture.For the items that are washable, keep a large supply so you can still maintain your rabbit’s bedding while washing what has become soiled., If your disabled rabbit is still able to use a litterbox, it will probably be more difficult for him to do so. When you go to your local pet store, choose a litterbox that is large, has a low front, and has a shallow tray. In addition, select a litter that has some traction, such as paper pulp litter, so your rabbit does not lose his footing in the litterbox.Litterboxes with low fronts are ideal for rabbits with limited mobility. If you are not able to find a litterbox with a low front, you can make one by cutting down the long side of a regular, rectangular litterbox. Cover the cut edges with tape so your rabbit does not cut himself trying to get in or out of the litterbox.You could also place a washable pee pad or rubber-bottomed bath mat in the bottom of the litterbox for more traction., Since your rabbit may not be able to move around very much, it is very important that you accessorize his housing in a way that is convenient for him. For example, place his food and water bowls near his favorite spot so he does not have to move very far to eat or drink.Choose shallow food and water bowls, such as low ceramic dishes, that your rabbit can easily access.Although rabbits can drink from sipper bottles, your disabled rabbit will likely find it much easier to sip water from a bowl.Make a house out of a large cardboard box that your rabbit can easily get into and out of. Cut off the flaps and cut dome-sized openings on different sides of the box.Your rabbit may not be able to move much, but he should still have some toys to play with. To accommodate your rabbit’s disability, stay away from toys that are large, difficult to manipulate, and have sharp edges.Good examples are toys are ring tosses and a small ball with a bell.If your rabbit cannot have a cage mate, consider buying him a doll that resembles a rabbit. This doll can provide companionship and comfort for your rabbit., A balanced diet is important to the health of any rabbit, but even more so for the health of a disabled rabbit. Your rabbit’s disability may have a negative effect on his weight and health,so he will need a constant supply of healthy food. Components of a healthy diet include hay, pellets, vegetables and fruit.


Feed your rabbit an unlimited amount of fresh, high-quality hay. For disabled rabbits, hay’s high fiber content helps prevent digestive problems like gastrointestinal stasis. Of the different types of hay (e.g., timothy, alfalfa, orchard grass) alfalfa is great for disabled rabbits because it has a sweet taste and helps with weight gain.Select high-quality rabbit pellets. The pellets should about at least 20% fiber, 12 to 14% protein, and 1 to 1.5% fat. Alfalfa-based pellets are tasty and high in protein, which makes them ideal for disabled rabbits.Vegetables not only provide important nutrients, but also provide moisture that is important for bladder and kidney health in disabled rabbits.Fruits, although high in sugar, can be good if your disabled rabbit needs to gain weight. Fruits can cause digestive upset, so add them to his diet very slowly and watch for diarrhea.Provide your disabled rabbit with unlimited access to fresh, clean water.

, In addition to the staples of your disabled rabbit’s diet, it may be good to feed some extra herbs and supplements to boost his health. Fresh herbs include basil, fennel, and peppermint leaf.Examples of supplements are rolled oats, pumpkin, and flaxseed.Another good herb is blackberry leaf, which could help stimulate your rabbit's appetite.If your rabbit's disabilities are causing him stress, try feeding him lemon balm or lavender to relieve the stress.Rolled oats can help your rabbit increase or maintain his weight. Pumpkin is good for relieving digestive upset.Talk with your veterinarian before adding herbs and supplements to your rabbit’s diet.

, Your disabled rabbit’s ability and willingness to eat are good indicators of his quality of life. It’s a good sign if your rabbit still has a good appetite and is able to feed himself despite his disability.If your rabbit wants to eat, but is having trouble feeding himself, you can feed him softened food (e.g., softened pellets, baby carrots, applesauce) through a syringe.If you have to hand feed your rabbit, place the syringe on the side of his inner cheek and slowly dispense the contents. Give your rabbit a chance to swallow the food in small amounts.If your rabbit does not want to eat, your veterinarian may recommend appetite stimulants to encourage your rabbit to start eating again.

, Although healthy rabbits rarely need baths, your disabled rabbit will have trouble grooming himself and keeping himself clean. He may get urine, feces, or food stuck in his fur,and will probably get stinky from time to time. Your rabbit will appreciate your time and effort to keep him clean.


To give your disabled rabbit some traction during the bath, place a rubber mat in the bottom of a sink or tub. Place about one inch (2.5 cm) of lukewarm water in the sink or tub and gently lower him in hind end first.Use rabbit-specific shampoo to wash only the dirty area (most likely his hind end).You may want to wear some gloves so you do not come into direct contact with your rabbit’s urine or feces.
Baths can be stressful for rabbits,so talk to your rabbit in a soothing voice to keep him calm during the bath.You can also feed him treats.Rinse and dry him off completely.If your veterinarian has prescribed an ointment or cream for your rabbit’s skin, apply it to your rabbit’s bottom to prevent it from becoming raw or infected., In addition to keeping your disabled rabbit clean, you will also need to keep his coat healthy and free of tangles and mats. It is best to brush your rabbit every day.If you do not have one already, purchase a basic pet comb at your local pet store. Position your rabbit comfortably in your lap and comb him gently from front to back.Carefully use the comb around your rabbit’s eyes.Part of grooming your rabbit involves cleaning his scent glands, which are located near his genitals. To find them, look for two slits on either side of his anus. Use a Q-tip moistened with either petroleum jelly or warm water to gently swab away any build up or discharge.It will be easier to clean his scent glands when he is on his back, so you will want someone to help you with this.Do not groom your disabled rabbit’s feet, since they are very sensitive., Rabbit nails can become very long if not trimmed regularly. About once a week, check your rabbit’s nails and trim them if they are looking a little long. Trimming a rabbit’s nails usually takes two people, but, since your rabbit probably cannot move around very much, you may be able to trim his nails on your own.To trim his nails, you will need a pair of pet-specific clippers (guillotine style, preferably) and some styptic powder to stop any bleeding.Cornstarch can be used instead of styptic powder.
Before clipping, find the quick, which is the blood vessel running through each nail. Trim a little bit at a time to just above the quick.If you cut the quick on accident, dab the nail in the styptic powder or cornstarch.Take your rabbit to your veterinarian if you are not comfortable trimming the nails.

, Since your rabbit’s disability might make it difficult for him to clean his ears, you will also need to do this for him. You will need a few long-stemmed cotton swabs. Lightly dampen a swab with warm water and gently rub it around the inner part of his ear, focusing on areas where there is wax buildup.Use a gentle sweeping or scooping motion to get the wax out of the ear.Do not push the swab so far down in his ear that you cannot see the tip. This can push wax further down his ear, and possibly damage his eardrum.

, Although your rabbit will appreciate all of the things you do to care for him, he wouldn’t mind having some time to rest and relax with you. For example, hold him in your lap when you are watching TV or doing another quiet activity on the couch, such as napping or reading a book. If you have a yard, let him lay on the grass in the yard on a warm summer day., With a disability, your rabbit will not be able to move around as much, and may not have much energy to play. Even still, he will want your attention and interaction, so lay on the floor with him and help him play with his toys.Your interaction could be as simple as moving his toys closer to him so he can reach them more easily.

, Your rabbit’s disability may be painful and cause him distress. Giving him a massage could give him some much-needed relaxation, as well as improve his circulation and strengthen your bond with him.Other benefits of massage for your rabbit include improved mobility and muscle tone, pain relief, and better joint flexibility.There are different massage techniques you can use, such as effleurage (long, gliding strokes) and petrissage (kneading). You can even massage your rabbit in different ways according to his disability (e.g., arthritis, paralysis).Talk with your veterinarian to determine what type of massage would be best for your disabled rabbit.
Use pillows and blankets to prop up and support your rabbit during the massage.Whichever massage technique you use, massage your rabbit in a quiet area and keep a close watch on his body language. If he indicates that he doesn’t like the massage (muscle tensing, nipping), then stop the massage. On the other hand, keep on going if he is content (e.g., eyes closed, deep breathing).Do not use deep pressure when massaging your disabled rabbit.Avoid any type of pressure or kneading on your rabbit’s inner thighs, since there are major blood vessels in that area."

Work slowly with skittish rabbits.",How to Hold a Rabbit," Before holding a rabbit for the first time, it is best to let the rabbit get used to you.Get comfortable. If the rabbit's cage or hutch is on the ground, sit next to it. Height can often be intimidating to smaller animals and sitting down reduces height and can make you seem less intimidating.
Don't rush. Put your hand beside the rabbit's hutch or cage and encourage it to sniff you. Hold your hand there a few moments, speaking in soft, reassuring tones like you would with a human who may be frightened or uncomfortable.
Offer a treat. If the rabbit shows no signs of aggression, take a treat like lettuce or carrot, and put your hand inside the cage or hutch. Don't force the treat on the rabbit, but bring your hand close enough so it can smell the treat. A friendly rabbit will have no problem taking the treat from you.
Understand shyness. Just like some people, there are extroverted rabbits and introverted ones. Shyness doesn't mean the rabbit is aggressive or doesn't like you; it may just take longer for this rabbit to get to know you.;
, If you've given the rabbit a treat and it does not show signs of aggression or fear, pet the rabbit. Pet in long, slow strokes from the top of the head down the spine, stopping at the top of the hip. If the rabbit seems friendly, but hasn't moved toward you, curl your fingers under your hand, making it seem smaller and less threatening. Using the back of your hands or fingers, lightly stroke the top of the rabbit's head and ears.

, You want to pick the rabbit up in such a way that you are supporting the weight of its body at all times. The first step is sliding your dominant hand, palm up, under the rabbit's armpits, gently positioning your hand like a cradle. You'll want your hand to rest behind the elbows, but snug against the back of the forelegs.

, In one motion, you'll lift the rabbit with your dominant hand, while scooping under the rear and back legs with the other. Don't worry if it doesn't work the first time. Your rabbit may be skittish, or you may be a little awkward. Be patient, offering treats and pets until the rabbit seems relaxed again. Remember that the key is to lift and support the rabbit's front and back legs at the same time.


At all times, be ready to gently place the rabbit on the floor or back in the cage. This is in case the rabbit struggles, or tries to leap out of your arms which can cause physical injury.

, Cradling it close to your chest, gently hold the rabbit. Your body acts as a stabilizing force for the rabbit and makes it feel more secure. Sometimes, rabbits will even lean into your chest while you hold them. You can also re-position it a little so that its tummy touches your torso, being sure not to force it onto its back, which can frighten it.

, Pat gently with the scooping hand still in place. Rub the rabbit's ears and/or shoulders with the hand under the torso. If the rabbit relaxes, replace the hand holding his torso with the forearm of the hand holding his bottom. Using the hand from the same arm, cradle his chest between his forelegs. This way, the rabbit is in a secure position but can be petted with your other hand., After a while, it may be a good idea to sit down and let the rabbit rest against your torso or lap.


Find a sofa to sit on, or lean against a wall and gradually slide down until your bottom is on the floor. At this point, you may want to let the rabbit move freely around you and your lap.
Be sure to pet the rabbit and offer praise. This helps create a positive association with human interaction, as well as being picked up and held. It can also build confidence in shy rabbits.
Play with the rabbit. If bunnies associate getting picked up with play time, it can make them more comfortable with the process. Build a cardboard house for your rabbit to play in, or let it explore your own house. Set up objects like a bowling alley for the rabbit to knock down. As you get to know the rabbit, it's personality will unfold and you'll know what sorts of games it likes to play., When you are done petting the rabbit and letting it explore, pick it up again and gently put it back in its hutch or cage. It may anticipate being put down and start to struggle. Do not drop the rabbit but, at the same time, do not squeeze too firmly as this can cause injury.

, Some rabbits adore being picked up and petted. Other rabbits never come around to the idea. Some rabbits will allow themselves to be picked up only by people they trust. If you are new to the rabbit, it's important to ask questions of its owner to determine the temperament of the rabbit before attempting to pick it up.

, A tiny baby bunny can be scooped and cradled easily, but what about a 15 or 20 lb rabbit? Consider that these rabbits require greater upper body strength to hold and that it may be more difficult to stabilize their body weight. It is best to carry larger rabbits with their side against your body, letting their fore paws rest on upon the forearm of the hand supporting their torso., Rabbits have light bones compared with their body size, and these get more fragile with age. If working with an older rabbit, take into account that you might need to be more gentle or, for health reasons, minimize handling all together., Some rabbits may have had a bad experience in the past with being picked up or held. If you are working with a skittish rabbit that does not like to be held, get it used to the idea of moving with you by putting it in a carrier.Put something soft inside the carrier, like a towel or a bunny bed.
Introduce the carrier gradually, letting the rabbit play with or become familiar with the scent.
Put food an treats in the carrier so the rabbit associates it with good things. Eventually, your rabbit may hop inside the carrier when it knows you need to move it.

If you want your rabbit to be comfortable approaching you, then you will need to do some work to boost their confidence and prove you are not a predator.


Avoid chasing your pet rabbit, as this increases their stress and reinforces the idea that they should be fearful.
Though your rabbit looks fluffy and cuddly, they naturally will resist being held, especially if you carry them around high off the ground. Forcing this on your rabbit can cause them to struggle and kick, which may harm you and may even be fatal to the rabbit, should they fall on the ground.;
, Remove any other pets, turn off the television, and make the room as quiet and peaceful as possible. You want to create an environment in which your rabbit can feel relaxed and safe., To get your shy rabbit to approach you, try having some of their favorite treats on-hand. Little bits of carrot, apple, bananas, or oats should do the trick.

, Sit or lie flat on your belly and wait for your rabbit to leave their hutch. Do not remove them yourself or try to pull them out. Your bunny is naturally curious and will come to you in time.


It may take a while for your rabbit to approach, possibly even an hour. Stay as still and quiet as possible.

, Resist the urge to grab or even touch your rabbit. Let your rabbit sniff you, hop on you, and, if they find the treat in your hand, allow them to nibble on it while you hold it in your hand.


You may need to do this every day for some time to earn your rabbit's trust. Moving too early can undo your hard work, so be patient.

, As your rabbit gains confidence and begins to approach you regularly, slowly reach out and pet them gently on the side or on the flank. Avoid raising your hand above your rabbit's head, as this could frighten them.

, Rabbits are ground-dwelling animals and do not like being lifted high above the ground. When your rabbit is comfortable and happy with your touch, you can put them in your lap. Assume a seated position and carefully move the rabbit into your lap. Provide treats and gentle petting. Once your rabbit learns that you are safe, they will bond strongly with you., You may be in the process of getting your rabbit comfortable with your presence, but you may need to catch your rabbit quickly, such as if you must take them to the vet. In this case, try the following:


Drop a large bath towel over the rabbit, covering them completely.
Scoop the rabbit up in the towel, keeping their head covered. The darkness will be comforting to the rabbit.
Transfer the rabbit to a dark, secure box.

, Rabbits are smart and fast. In fact, pet rabbits can run up to 35 miles per hour, faster than a house cat.In addition, their back legs are designed for jumping, meaning they can leap far away from you quickly.Since your domestic rabbit's ancestors were not predators, they survived by running away and hiding well.You may need a couple of hours to catch a pet rabbit outside, as it will likely take you more than one attempt.Argente Crèmes, grey and white rabbits that pet owners often show, and English lops, brown and white bunnies with floppy ears, are both particularly skittish, so they might be harder to catch.Similarly, Belgian Hares, named so because they look like wild hares in dark brown, may also be difficult to catch as they are particularly quick and smart. Beverens, medium-gray bunnies, Rexes, bunnies with a spotted coat, and Lionheads, a fluffy brown bunny, are also smart., It's much easier to catch a rabbit if you have several people on your side. With more people around it's easier to herd the rabbit where you want her to go.

, You want to be ready when you do capture the rabbit. Therefore, have someone standing by with a carrier, so you can pop the bunny in once you grab her.

, The best way to catch a rabbit is to create a makeshift enclosure. Hopefully, you will already have something on hand to create this enclosure, such as exercise pen enclosures. Basically, you want something tall enough and wide enough that you can create an enclosure around a rabbit outside. When you eventually surround the rabbit, more than one person will need to be holding pieces of the enclosure as you make it smaller around the rabbit.


You can use 2-by-4s and chicken wire to make fence frames to have on hand. These should be at least 3 feet high, though many rabbits can jump higher than that. The width is up to you, but you should consider the length or width of your car if you plan to transport them. Hold the frames together with hinges.You can also use a puppy pen or deer fencing to create an enclosure., If you haven't already spotted the rabbit, look for signs of where she's been. You might see rabbit droppings. You might also see places where the rabbit has chewed on plants or where she's dug small holes. These signs will point you in the direction of the rabbit.


Sometimes it's easiest to just sit and watch the area. Leave out some treats that your rabbit likes, and see if she comes out.
Check for holes near fences, as that could be a sign she escaped the yard.

, If you are in a yard, it's best to close off any escape routes before trying to capture her. Shut the gate. Cover any holes you found near the fence line, so she can't escape that way.

, Roadways are, of course, dangerous for rabbits. If possible push your bunny away from these areas so she won't get hurt. You can guide her away from these areas by using people as barriers, as she'll likely run away from them., Watch the rabbit to see where she hides. Build a large enclosure around her using the exercise pens or wood-and-chicken-wire frames. The easiest way to surround the rabbit is to have several people holding different pieces, forming a large enclosure. Hold the pieces to the ground so the rabbit cannot escape underneath. Slowly work the enclosure smaller by taking out sections while still maintaining a tight circle, making it easier to trap the bunny. Just be sure you don't leave anywhere that she can escape., Once the enclosure is small enough, you should be able to gently pick up the rabbit.It is easiest to climb in the enclosure with the rabbit. When picking up the rabbit, make sure to support her back end, propping her feet against your body if possible.Secure the legs by wrapping your arm around the outside of her body and then around the underside of the rabbit. Use your other arm to wrap the other way around the body, securing the shoulders.
The best way to capture the rabbit is to get on the ground with her. Talk to her gently and see if she will come to you. She'll be less threatened by you if you're closer to her level.If that doesn't work, you may need more than one person to trap her in a corner. Scoop her up from a standing position.
Never pick up a rabbit by her ears. You'll hurt her and frighten it., Once you've capture her, place her in the carrier for easy transport. Even if you are just taking her back to the house, it's easiest to carry her secured in a carrier, as she may jump out of your arms. Have the carrier in the enclosure with you, so you don't risk her escaping again.

, If you fail at capturing your bunny, try calling animal control. If they are not too busy, the animal catchers may be willing to help you. They will have nets on hand, which will make the job easier, and they will know how to use the nets to capture your rabbit.Using a net to catch a rabbit is actually quite difficult. If you are not trained in catching animals this way, it's unlikely you'll be able to do it.However, if you can sneak up on the rabbit, you may be able to throw a net over it to catch it. Depending on how close you are to the rabbit, a bath towel or a sheet can be a useful aid. Try to corner the rabbit, so they cannot retreat, then throw the towel over the rabbit. Scoop the rabbit up in the towel.

, Most rabbits, even affectionate ones, will run before you can capture them. Because they are so quick, they can get away before you even get close, or they may run as you try to reach for them after petting them.


In addition, they will learn and will be even more skittish the next time you corner them.
They are also able to elbow themselves into small spaces that you won't be able to follow.
However, you can fool the rabbit into thinking you have an enclosure by holding a towel sideways and touching the ground. You can then corral the rabbit into a corner and throw the towel over them.

, Live traps can capture a rabbit, but rabbits also can outwit them. In addition, you need to keep a close eye on the trap, as other animals can kill rabbits who are inside.


If you do decide to use a live trap, try one that has openings on both sides, which will make it more likely that your bunny will enter.Also, with a live trap, make sure to entice your bunny in with a good treat, such as bananas or carrots., Not all domestic rabbits have lop ears, but all rabbits with lop ears are domestic. Lop ears are when the ears hang down (like basset hound ears) rather than stick back or up., Wild rabbits are usually smaller than domestic rabbits. Wild rabbits weigh in at 2 to 4 pounds. If you think the rabbit is bigger, she's more likely to be domestic., Wild rabbits all have the agouti coloring.That means they have variegated grey, brown, and tan fur. Domestic rabbits also sometimes have this coloring, but unlike their wild cousins, their bellies are usually lighter. They also come in a variety of other colors, including silver, palomino, chocolate, and tan, and they may have markings on their legs (often dark) or shoulder (often white), as well as spots, depending on the breed., Wild rabbits will be afraid of you and likely run as soon as they see you. Domestic rabbits may be more social. They may even come and ask for attention., Domestic rabbits will have a more curved forehead. On the other hand, wild rabbits are more triangular in their faces. Also, wild rabbits have thin ears, meaning you can almost see through them at the ends."

Start when it's young.,
Move slowly and gently.,
Pick up your rabbit close to the ground.,
Position your hand under the rabbit.,
Lift the rabbit.,
Support its weight.,
Handle an aggressive rabbit.,
Cover its eyes.",How to Carry a Rabbit1," It is best to get rabbits used to being handled early in their lives so that they will be accustomed to it later on. Rabbits who are not handled regularly can find human contact distressing. Make a point of picking up and carrying your rabbit a few times a week, and not just when it need to be transported (e.g. to the vet)., Pet your rabbit gently, and wait for it to relax and calm down. Be sure to talk gently to your rabbit and make slow, gentle movements. If possible, only handle your rabbit in a quiet environment (e.g. a quiet, empty room at home).Rabbits have very fragile bones, so be especially cautious when handling them.

, As a general rule, rabbits are more comfortable being picked up from the ground than from a table. Whenever possible, interact with your rabbit at ground level. This also reduces the risk of your rabbit being dropped from a great height., Place one hand under your rabbit’s chest. Position your fingers to be resting under its armpit (also known at the axilla). Make sure that the rabbit’s front limbs are over your hand, to prevent compression of its chest., Make sure that your hand is firmly braced around the rabbit. Slowly and gently lift it up. Hold the rabbit so that its limbs are facing away from you, to prevent kicking or scratching with sharp nails., As you lift up the rabbit, bring your other hand under the animal to support its weight. Position your full hand, palm up, under its rump, letting the rabbit’s weight rest on it. Hold the rabbit firmly to prevent kicking, which could damage its spine.For extra support, lean your rabbit’s back on your chest. Alternatively, lean the side of your rabbit against your chest and support its rump with your elbow. Gauge your rabbit’s comfort level with different positions for future reference.

, If your rabbit is especially unnerved by being picked up and seems aggressive, alter your holding strategy. Hold it with its limbs facing away from you and lift it firmly by the scruff of its neck. Make sure to support its rump firmly, with its hind limbs braced securely.This method of carrying should only be used for short distances.

, If your rabbit seems unnerved when being handled, try covering its eyes. Some rabbits feel more relaxed being carried when they do not see their surroundings. Use a towel or the crook of your arm to gently obstruct its view.Make sure that the rabbit’s nostrils (also called nares) are not blocked when you cover its eyes.

"
"
Show the rabbit it’s hurting you if it bites.,
Hold your rabbit correctly.,
Approach your rabbit carefully.",How to Calm a Vicious Rabbit1," Make a sudden yelping sound or squeal when and if your rabbit bites or nips you. This will act as a kind of signal that you’re in pain, and your rabbit will associate that with biting you. Tiny nips can just be your rabbit’s way of telling you to go away, or that you’re bugging it. They’re not trying to hurt you, just trying to let you know they don’t want to be touched or handled. Nips don’t usually hurt, and aren’t accompanied with aggression. Full bites are bad behavior that shouldn’t be encouraged or praised. These bites are painful, and the bunny might even latch onto you when he bites down.;
, Incorrect handling could be painful for your rabbit. Your rabbit might act out in aggression if it is handled incorrectly. Make sure you support its back legs, and avoid jerking your rabbit around at all. Be gentle, and support your rabbit’s spine.Gently wrapping your rabbit in a towel is a safe way to restrain it if it is acting aggressively and you need to handle it, like to administer medication. You’ll of course want to make sure the rabbit can breathe well and that its nose isn’t covered.

, If your rabbit bites or nips you when you reach out to it, it might simply be because you startled it. Rabbits can’t see very well up close; their distance vision is much stronger. So putting your hand right in front of your rabbit’s face can surprise it, which might make it feel as though it has to defend itself.Pet your rabbit from above. Try not to put your hand down over its nose. Let him begin to associate hands reaching for him as something positive, as it results in getting affection.
While you pet your rabbit, speak to it in a soothing voice. This will help him to relax and not be on the defensive.

Learn about vitamin deficiencies in bunnies.,
Take your bunny to your veterinarian.,
Provide your bunny with outdoor time or an artificial UVB light.,
Add vitamin supplements to your bunny's food.,
Watch your bunny for signs of vitamin toxicity.,
Learn the disadvantages of vitamin supplementation.",How to Feed Your Bunny Vitamins1," If your bunny is healthy and is eating a well-balanced diet, it is unlikely that he will need vitamin supplements. However, there may be times when your bunny will need a little extra help getting all of the vitamins he needs. If your bunny's health starts to change, you may need to start suspecting a vitamin deficiency.


A vitamin D deficiency causes bone and teeth softening, known as rickets in young bunnies and osteomalacia in adult bunnies.If your bunny is deficient in vitamin E, he could develop muscular dystrophy. In female bunnies, vitamin E deficiency can lead to the death of unborn and newly born kits (baby bunnies).Vitamin A deficiency primarily causes reproductive problems.Illness and stress can take a toll on your bunny’s body and increase his vitamin requirements.Your veterinarian can determine if your bunny is sick, or if he is experiencing stress.;
, It may be tempting to start giving your bunny vitamin supplements on your own. However, you may end up over supplementing your bunny's diet, which could make him very sick. Therefore, you should give supplements only under the recommendation of your veterinarian.For your appointment, bring in the bags of bunny food, or just the labels from the food bags. This will give your veterinarian a good idea of what you are feeding your bunny, and if the food is providing him with enough vitamins.Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination on your bunny and run some blood work to determine the specific vitamins in which your bunny is deficient.

, House rabbits are more likely to become vitamin D deficient because they do not get much sun. The sun that they do get comes in through windows, which reduces the UVB rays.


To prevent vitamin D deficiency in rabbits, you should allow your rabbit to have 30 to 60 minutes of supervised outdoor time every day. If daily outdoor time is not possible, then you can also purchase an artificial UVB lighting system for your rabbit's enclosure., Your veterinarian will recommend specific vitamin supplements for your bunny. The supplements will likely come in pill or tablet form that you can mix in with his food. Follow your veterinarian's instructions for how to add the supplements to your bunny's diet.


Following your veterinarian's recommendations will prevent you from giving your bunny too many vitamins, which could lead to serious disease.Do not add vitamins to your bunny's water. This is not an effective way of giving your bunny vitamins.

, Your veterinarian should be able to recommend safe vitamin supplements for your bunny. When you feed them to your bunny, watch him closely for signs that his vitamin intake is too high. For example, signs of vitamin D toxicity include weakness, lack of coordination, and diarrhea.Vitamin A toxicity causes low conception rates and increased infant mortality.The kits that survive might have slow growth rates and fluid on the brain (‘hydrocephaly’).Take your bunny to your veterinarian if your bunny becomes sick after vitamin supplementation.

, Vitamin supplementation may not be as easy as putting the supplement in your bunny’s food or water. Vitamin supplements can sometimes make water taste bad. They could even lead to bacterial growth in the water if you do not change the water frequently.Vitamins can be inactivated when exposed to air, water and light, meaning that the supplements could lose their effectiveness quickly.If you must give your bunny vitamin supplements, talk to your veterinarian about the best way to store and administer them so they don’t lose their effectiveness.

Ensure you have enough space for the cage.,
Consider the financial costs.,
Provide for all a rabbit’s nutritional needs.,
Ensure you can commit enough time.,
Be able to bunny proof your house.,
Have a rabbit friendly household.,
Recognise that rabbits need company.,
Be ready to feed and clean every day.,
Play and interact with your rabbit.,
Understand that it’s a long-term commitment.",How to Know if You're Ready to Care for a Bunny," Before you start thinking about whether or not you can commit the time and effort to look after a rabbit, you need to determine if you can meet the material and practical requirements. The first of these is enough space for your rabbit to live happily and healthily.


The hutch or cage should give the rabbit a minimum of 12 square feet of living space.
On top of this you should be able to provide a run or alternative exercise space that is at least 32 square feet.
Ideally, the living and exercise areas should be one large space, so the rabbit can move freely between the two.;
, There are significant ongoing financial costs in addition to the time you need to spend looking after a rabbit. You will have to commit a significant amount of money at the start to get you set-up and prepared for a rabbit, and then you will have to continue spending on food, hay, bedding and vets bills.


Your initial costs to get everything you need to house a rabbit are likely to be between $330 and $390. This includes the adoption fee, cable protectors, hay and other essentials.
You will then have to spend perhaps around $85 a month or food, hay, bedding and other ongoing essentials.Vets bills are unpredictable, and can be very expensive, so you may have to factor in pet insurance too.

, You should be sure that you have a good understanding of the particular nutritional needs of a rabbit, and be completely sure that you will be able to meet them. Rabbits don’t just need pellets, they need fresh vegetables, greens and a constant supply of fresh hay to chew on.


Rabbits also need constant access to clean fresh water.
You can give a rabbit occasional treats, such as fruits like apple and banana., Rabbits generally live for 10-12 years, and they will need a lot of care and affection throughout their lives. Make sure you are prepared to look after him for this long before going any further. As well as the long term commitment, think about the amount of time you will have to spend caring for your rabbit every day and every week.Rabbits need to be fed and watered every day, as well as being given a constant supply of fresh hay.
You will need to regularly clean out their houses thoroughly, and spot clean them daily.
You will also need to spend time with your rabbits and provide time and space to play and exercise.

, If your rabbit is going to be living in your house or spending any time in there, you need to be sure that you can completely bunny proof any areas he will be in. Rabbits are very curious creatures who like to chew and gnaw on anything they come across. This includes cables, wires, furniture, carpets and anything else they can find.You will have to get hard plastic covers for any cables within reach to keep your rabbit safe.
You should also keep house plants out of reach of your rabbits, as some are poisonous and could make a rabbit ill., You need to think of the environment you are considering bringing a rabbit into broadly. Ask yourself if you have a rabbit friendly family who will be enthusiastic and friendly. If you get a rabbit you might need help looking after him, so talk to your family about whether they would be able to help you out occasionally.


Try to agree on who is responsible for what. Perhaps you will take turns cleaning out the hutch, or feeding the bunny. Consider drawing up a rota.
You should also consider any pets you already have, and how these might get along with a new rabbit arrival.
It is perfectly possible for cats and dogs to get along with and become friends with a rabbit.
If you do already have a cat or a dog, think about how you will introduce them to a rabbit, and be prepared to help them get accustomed to each other.Dogs in particular can attack rabbits, so you should get some advice from your vet before bringing a dog and a rabbit together., Rabbits are very sociable creatures and are generally much happier with another rabbit as a companion. If you do decide to get a rabbit, there’s a fair chance you will feel the need to get a second rabbit too. You need to be prepared for this from the start and think about the extra costs.


Usually a neutered male and a spayed female of a similar size and breed are the best matches.
If you do get a second rabbit you will have to spend time helping them to socialise, and be attentive to their relationship., Taking care of a rabbit isn’t just about providing a safe and engaging environment for him. It is also about ensuring you can commit enough time to looking after him. You will have to feed him every day, and refresh his supply of fresh hay and water whenever necessary. You will also have to spot clean his enclosure every day, and give it a more thorough clean once a week.If you are unable to keep his environment clean, he may become ill.
It might be smelly work, but it’s an essential part of taking care of a bunny.

, You will also have to commit enough time to play and interact with your rabbit every day. Rabbits need to be let out of their cage or hutch for at least a few hours each day. You will have to be there to supervise to make sure they stay safe. The best time to do is this is generally around dusk when rabbits start to become active.Think about whether or not you are normally home around that time and will be able to sit out with a rabbit while he explores and exercises.
In this time you will be able to interact with him and bond. Rabbits tend to be shy, but can become very friendly once they get to know someone.

, Finally, you should remember that looking after a rabbit is a serious long-term commitment. Rabbits can live for more than ten years, and they need a secure, safe and loving home all their lives. They are not low maintenance pets, they require a lot of care and decision to get a rabbit should be taken by the whole family.Rabbits are great fun and make excellent pets, but you need to be certain that you can provide the level of care they require.
Every rabbit is different, but a pet rabbit’s biology and behaviour is very similar to a wild rabbit. As such, pet rabbits have complicated needs and you need to be sensitive to that."
"
Obtain a carrier specifically for rabbits.,
Choose the right size carrier.,
Line the floor of the carrier with a grippy, odor absorbing material.,
Add hay and a secured water bottle.,
Allow your bunny to explore the carrier before traveling.,
Strap the carrier into the car with a seat belt or place it securely on the floor behind a seat.,
Keep the car cool at all times.,
Bring the bunny inside with you overnight if it’s warm outside.,
Check on your rabbit during travel.,
Look for signs of overheating.,
Learn airline regulations ahead of time if you are traveling by air with your rabbit.,
Give your rabbit time.,
Recreate his normal environment as much as possible.,
Watch for signs of illness.",How to Transport a Rabbit," Rabbit travel cages should be rigid, non-collapsible, well-ventilated, and secure to ensure that the rabbit cannot chew through or escape them. Your cage should also have a top opening option to allow nervous rabbits to be removed easily.


Cardboard boxes are not appropriate because they can be chewed through and become unsafe if the rabbit urinates or if it rains.
Travel cages for rabbits are available at pet stores and online.;
, The carrier should be smaller than the bunny’s normal cage but large enough for all the rabbits being transported to enter easily, lie comfortably in any direction, and turn around unimpeded. More than one rabbit can be transported in one cage, but you will want to be sure the cage is big enough for all of them to be comfortable.


The cage should also be small enough to provide feelings of security and to prevent the rabbit from getting slammed into the wall during movement. You’ll also want to have a partially covered section in it to recreate the safety of a small burrow. If the cage comes partially covered, be sure there is adequate ventilation., You want to make sure your rabbit doesn’t slide around, especially if the bottom of the carrier is not wire. Even if it is wire, that can be uncomfortable for the rabbit to lie on for more than a couple of hours.


Puppy training pads work pretty well for lining the bottom of a bunny travel cage. These are available at pet stores.
You can also line the bottom with newsprint or a towel and then add pine shavings or a litter for odor absorption. Many people going this route use a rabbit litter, or for less expensive options, bird litter or pine cat litter.Or you can have a towel at the bottom, with a puppy training pad on top, and a small towel or blanket to snuggle up in and to prevent the rabbit from sliding.



, Most rabbits won’t eat much during travel due to increased stress, but hay is a nice snack to include just in case. Don’t put a regular food dish in the carrier, because it could injure the bunny during movement. Most travel size water bottles for rabbits (available at pet stores) are 4-6 ounces, and can be easily attached to the side of the cage with spring clips.


Allow your bunny time to get used to drinking water from the travel water bottle before travel, and be sure to use water from home as much as possible during the trip. Rabbits can be fussy about changing water sources, and you want to avoid having him get dehydrated especially if the travel time will be longer than a few hours.If your rabbit refuses to drink water from the bottle while traveling, if someone is in the back seat with the rabbit, have them safely take the rabbit out and put some of the water on their hand and have the rabbit lap it.
Some rabbits won't eat hay on the drive either. If this is the case, provide a piece of celery or carrot.

, Don’t push the bunny into the carrier because this will cause him to associate stress and fear with the carrier. Leave the door of the carrier open and entice him to go in there with snacks. Let him just be in there for a while with the door open, so he can come and go as he pleases. It’s best to start doing this a day or two before the actual travel date, so he gets used to the carrier and isn’t afraid of it., You want to avoid the cage moving around. Place the side of the cage toward the front of the car, so that the bunny won’t hit his face if the car needs to brake suddenly.


Never place a bunny carrier in the closed-in trunk of a car. It’s too dark and scary, and he could run out of air!
Bunnies can ride in a covered truck bed or trailer if they are well ventilated. However, avoid this if it’s hot outside because rabbits are sensitive to heat. The rabbit carrier will need to be strapped in tightly. , Run the AC if it’s hot or even warm outside. Rabbits are more sensitive to heat than we are. Park in shaded areas when you stop and leave the windows down if it’s cool enough outside; or if it’s hot, leave the car on and the air conditioning running. You can bring two keys with you to be able to lock the doors while you’re out of the car.


If possible, travel during cooler parts of the day, like early in the morning or after the sun has gone down in the evening.
It’s not likely it will ever be too cold for a bunny in the car, unless the temperatures are below freezing outside. If it’s safe enough for you to travel, it’s safe for the bunny to stay in an unheated car., If you’re staying in a hotel, check ahead of time to be sure that they allow rabbits in the room. If the hotel doesn’t allow it, then be sure you wait to stop until after the sun has gone down and the temperatures have dropped.


Lock the car doors and leave the windows down enough to provide ventilation overnight. Park in the shade so that the early morning sun doesn’t stress or overheat your bunny., Be sure that there is a continuous supply of water in the water bottle. When you stop, offer treats like apples or carrots. You can leave these in the carrier during travel; he may not eat them, but it’s nice to have them in there. Just remove them if they start to go bad.


Offer a vitamin supplement such as Vita-Stress to help with the strain of transporting your bunny., If your bunny overheats, you’ll need to immediately get him to a cooler place and be sure he’s out of the sun. Dampen his ears with cool (not cold) water to help get his temperature back down to normal. Another trick to preventing overheating in a rabbit, if he cannot be kept in air conditioning, is to keep secured soda bottles full of frozen water in the cage. Signs of overheating in a rabbit are:


Fast, shallow breathing
Hot ears
Listlessness
Wetness around the nose area
Tossing head back while breathing rapidly from an open mouth, It’s possible to travel by air with a rabbit. If you absolutely need to take your rabbit on a plane, because you are moving, find out ahead of time what his experience will be like during the trip.


Find an airline that allows pets. A few popular ones are Delta, Continental, Frontier, United, and WestJet. Each airline has different prices and regulations regarding pets, however, so do your research.Get an airline approved carrier. You’ll have to conform to the guidelines of the airline regarding the type of carrier you can transport your rabbit in. Again, this will depend on the airline.
Check the dates. Many airlines only allow pet travel during certain months of the year, when the weather makes it safe enough for the animals to travel.
Use a cart for walking around the airport with the carrier. Rabbit carriers can get pretty heavy with a rabbit inside, so at the airport be sure to use a wheeled cart and secure the cage onto it to wheel it around., It will take your rabbit time to become accustomed to a new location, whether it’s temporary or permanent. He may not be extremely friendly or seem like himself during the adjustment period because of the stress of travel. In time, he will start investigating his surroundings out of curiosity – just be sure to let this happen on its own and don’t force him., As soon as possible after the transport, put him back in his normal cage or set up his room like it was at home. Offer the same type of food he was eating before, and give him back some familiar toys. Spend time with him talking and petting him just like you did at home. , Because travel is stressful to rabbits, you’ll want to keep an eye on his health after the transport. Because rabbits are prey animals, they tend to try to hide their illnesses and injuries. If your rabbit seems sick, you’ll need to bring him to a vet as soon as possible. Signs of illness include:


Teeth grinding (especially paired with hunched posture – is a sign of pain)
Tilted head
Open-mouth breathing
Blood in urine or anywhere in his cage/home
Limping or paralysis
Enlarged abdomen that seems painful to the touch
Vocalizing (crying)
Decrease in eating or drinking that lasts more than a couple of days after travel
Drooling, slobbering, loss of chin hairs (all indicate a dental problem in a rabbit)
Discharge from nose, sneezing or coughing, difficulty breathing (indicate a respiratory infection)
Change in stool (diarrhea or decreased stools)
Hair loss, itchiness, flaking skin, or lumps on the skin
Biting, growling, or attacking (indicates substantial pain in a usually gentle animal)

Choose the right carrier.,
Line the carrier.,
Get your rabbit comfortable with the carrier.,
Place your rabbit into the carrier.,
Prevent overheating.",How to Carry a Rabbit2," Look for a carrying case made out of plastic, with ventilation holes to prevent overheating, and a firmly attached handle.. The plastic should be thick enough to be chew-proof, and the access and ventilation areas should be made of strong wire.Your carrier should be large enough for your rabbit to sit up straight and lay down comfortably inside, but small enough to make your rabbit feel secure, and prevent it from sliding or rolling around during transport. If your rabbit is large and you need a big carrier, consider choosing a model with wheels or a shoulder strap to move it more easily.

, A nervous rabbit is likely to urinate in its carrier, so line the inside surface with paper towels or hay before placing it inside. Hay might also serve as something for your uneasy rabbit to nibble on to calm its nerves. Place enough hay or paper towels inside to absorb urine so that it doesn’t gather on your pet’s coat., Before you use the carrier, leave it out in the open inside your rabbit’s home enclosure for it to explore on its own. Getting familiar with the carrier will reduce your rabbit’s anxiety about it later on. Place it on the ground with the door open, and leave snacks inside., Never push or force your rabbit into its carrier. Entice it to enter with snacks or toys, and gentle encouragement. Always give yourself enough time to be patient about the process before transporting your rabbit to an appointment.Once your rabbit is in the carrier, be as quiet and gentle as possible about locking the door behind them.

, Do your best to keep your rabbit cool and comfortable during transport. Avoid travelling during the warmest point of the day. Make sure that your rabbit has access to water during the trip."

Create a good living space.,
Monitor your rabbit's health.,
Groom your rabbit.",How to Carry a Rabbit3," Make sure that your rabbit has a wire cage or hutch at least 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet deep to live in. Make sure that the parts of your home where your rabbit might play when it's out of its cage are ""bunny-proofed"". Clear the area of any loose electrical wires it might chew, chemicals or cleaners it might ingest, or dangerous items it might harm itself on., Observe your rabbit to ensure that it is healthy and content. Regularly check its eyes, nose and ears to make sure that they are clean, and its front teeth to make sure that they are in good condition. Look for matted fur (which can indicate drooling or tooth problems), and keep track of its eating habits to note irregularities and prevent overeating.If you notice any health issues, bring your rabbit to the vet for an exam as soon as possible.

, Keep your rabbit healthy and happy by grooming it regularly. Keep your rabbit's fur clean and untangled by brushing every 2-3 days and spot cleaning when needed, and trim its nails every 4-6 weeks. If your rabbit has long fur, kep it trimmed to an inch to prevent mats and knots.

"
Be kind to your rabbit.,
Create a safe environment.,
Take your time socializing your bunny.,
Try not to put your bunny in stressful situations.,
Instruct children on how to interact with your rabbit.",How to Calm a Vicious Rabbit2," Hitting your rabbit, yelling at it, or trying to force it to show you affection are all things you should never do. If you have a rabbit with aggressive or vicious tendencies, hitting the bunny will only make it more scared and stressed out. You want to earn its trust so that it will feel more comfortable around you., Try putting your bunny and its cage into a small room, like the bathroom. Close the door, and then open the door to your bunny’s cage. Sit in the room with your rabbit, but let it decide when it wants to come out of its cage. Ignore your rabbit while you let it sniff you and hop around the room. Don’t pick your bunny up or even pet it. Try this a few times. Eventually, your rabbit will be used to you, and won’t see you as a threat.

, Rather than jumping right into holding or cuddling your bunny, take some time to let it warm up to you. This applies for any new people (or even other animals) that your bunny will encounter in its everyday life. If you let your bunny warm up to people at its own pace without forcing it, it will feel more relaxed and willing to interact.At first, you might try wearing gloves to protect your hands when handling your rabbit. Then, after some time and a few sessions of letting your rabbit get to know you and it hasn’t shown aggression or viciousness, you can take the gloves off.

, Keep an eye on your rabbit to see what things might be triggering its vicious response. It could be a certain noise, like the garbage disposal or the hair dryer, or it could be someone moving too quickly. Once you identify the things that seem to trigger the bad behavior, make sure to avoid those triggers.Stress can lead to aggression in rabbits. Aggression is their way of defending or protecting themselves when they feel threatened. If you work to avoid putting your rabbit in the situations that make it feel stressed or threatened, its aggressive and vicious behaviors will likely lessen.

, Children sometimes misunderstand the proper way to handle and interact with animals, and your rabbit might bite or nip a child that handles it incorrectly. Encourage children to touch your rabbit gently, speak softly, and avoid startling it.

"
"
Have your rabbit neutered or spayed.,
Visit the vet.,
Understand that rabbits are often territorial.",How to Calm a Vicious Rabbit3," One of the leading causes of aggression in rabbits is hormones. Rabbits that are not spayed or neutered are far more likely to become aggressive when they become mature, usually around 3-9 months of age. Getting your rabbit spayed or neutered could drastically improve its behavioral issues.Some rabbit owners might think that breeding their female rabbit will have the same effect on her behavior as having her spayed. This isn’t true. Breeding your female rabbit isn’t an alternative to having her spayed. Any change that might appear in her behavior while she’s pregnant is only temporary, and those aggressive traits will reappear after she has given birth.

, Aggression or viciousness might come about as a response to being in pain or being ill, so if your bunny shows this type of behavior—especially if it is sudden—make sure you get it to the vet to make sure it isn’t suffering from any kind of ailment or injury.At the vet, make sure you ask about your bunny’s overall health. Ask about ways you might work to correct the bad behavior, and see if your vet has any suggestions or advice pertaining to your particular rabbit. If the vet says anything you aren’t clear about, ask questions, and get the information you need.
You can do a quick check of your own at home before seeing a vet. Some signs of sickness might be runny eyes or nose, a spike in or lowering of body temperature (best felt through touching their ears), or even a loss of appetite. Any of these could be signs of a problem, so take your bunny to the vet if it displays any or some combination of them.

, Avoid trying to pull your rabbit out of his cage. Don’t take out its toys, food bowls, or anything else from its cage while it’s in it. Wait until it isn’t in its cage to clean it. If your rabbit bites you when you are reaching into its cage, it is likely being protective.The best thing to do when reaching into your rabbit’s cage is to reach in just to pet it. Give your rabbit a little affectionate rub each time you reach in. Then, your rabbit will eventually learn that the hand reaching into the cage isn’t a threat, but rather something positive.

Feed your bunny grass hay.,
Incorporate fresh vegetables into your bunny’s diet.,
Provide your bunny with commercial rabbit pellets.,
Allow your bunny to eat some of his feces.",How to Feed Your Bunny Vitamins2," Feeding your bunny a healthy, well-balanced diet is the best way to ensure he gets all of the vitamins he needs. Grass hay is a staple of a bunny’s diet and is an excellent source of vitamins. In addition to being a great vitamin source, grass hay provides your bunny with other nutrients (e.g., protein, carbohydrates, fiber) and helps prevent digestive upset. Give your bunny an unlimited supply of grass hay.Limit your bunny's intake of alfalfa hay. Alfalfa hay is very high in beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A. Too much vitamin A could lead to reproductive problems.Alfalfa hay is also high in vitamin D. Vitamin D toxicity can make your bunny very sick., Fresh vegetables are one of the best sources of vitamins for your bunny. A variety of fresh vegetables will give your bunny enough vitamins so that he will not need vitamin supplementation. Examples of vegetables to feed your bunny are leafy greens (e.g., collard, mustard), green peppers, radish tops, and clover.Vitamin A is an essential vitamin for bunnies.Feed your bunny at least one vitamin A-rich vegetable (e.g., collard greens, kale, and spinach) per day.Fresh leafy greens also provide your bunny with vitamin C.To keep your bunny interested in his food, feed him vegetables that have different colors.To ensure he gets all of the vitamins he needs, feed him three different types of vegetables per day.Introduce new vegetables to his diet one at a time to lessen the likelihood of digestive upset. If a certain vegetable gives him diarrhea, remove it from his diet., Pellets are another good vitamin source for bunnies and are nutritionally balanced.Since vitamin D toxicity can make bunnies very sick, commercial rabbit pellets contain only one-third to one-half the toxic amount of vitamin D (≥ 2,300 International Units per kilogram of body weight).Commercial pellets are formulated to contain enough vitamins and minerals to meet your bunny’s nutritional requirements.Vitamins can start breaking down in pelleted food. Store the pellets for only three to four weeks to prevent vitamin loss., Interestingly, bunnies will eat their own feces (‘cecotrophy’) to meet their vitamin needs, particularly the vitamin B complex.As unappetizing as it may seem to you, cecotrophy is a necessary aspect of your bunny’s diet. Bunnies produce two types of feces, one of which is a soft pellet covered with mucus (‘cecotroph’).As soon as your bunny excretes cecotrophs, he will turn around and eat them directly from his anus.If your bunny is obese, he may not be able to reach back to his anus to eat the cecotrophs, resulting in a vitamin deficiency."
"
Keep your rabbit’s hay in a cool, dry area.,
Store pellets in an air-tight tin.,
Use food within four weeks of opening.,
Throw away fruits and vegetables that have gone off.",How to Feed Your Bunny Vitamins3," It is important to keep your rabbit’s hay cool and dry to prevent it from getting moldy or damp. Mold and dampness can degrade the hay and they can also make your rabbit sick.


Leave the bag of hay open to allow for good air circulation, but make sure insects and rodents do not get in the bag.If your rabbit’s hay becomes damp and/or moldy, then discard it right away. Do not feed this hay to your rabbit., Your rabbit’s pellets can degrade and lose their nutritional value and vitamin potency if they are exposed to too much air. To reduce exposure to air, store the bag of pellets in a container with a tight lid, such large air-tight tin.


Storing your rabbit’s food in this way will also help to keep out insects and rodents. Keep the sealed container in a cool and dry place as well, such as in a pantry., Your rabbit’s food has a shelf-life of about four weeks, so make sure that you note the date when you open a bag of pellets and use the entire bag within four weeks of opening it. Otherwise, the food may not retain as much of its nutritional value or it may even become rancid.

, Make sure that you toss out anything that you would not eat yourself. Your rabbit can get sick from fruits and vegetables that have gone bad, just like you can.

Decide if your rabbit should stay outdoors at all.,
Feed your rabbit more than carrots.,
Keep its home clean.,
Don’t leave your rabbit lonely.,
Give your rabbit daily exercise and play time.",How to Care for an Outdoor Rabbit1," Traditionally, pet rabbits have often been kept outside in a pen or “hutch.” And, since you see wild bunnies hopping around all the time, you may assume that your pet will do fine outside as well. But there are many factors to consider.


Some organizations now strongly urge that you keep house rabbits indoors at all times. Domesticated rabbits have lost the instincts and skills that keep their wild companions alive, and are not creatures that are suited to isolation, extreme conditions, or surprises (from predators or otherwise).Others contend that it is acceptable to keep rabbits outside during the daytime, when the risk of predators is lower. Domesticated rabbits can die of shock from the mere sight of a predator, so even a secure enclosure may not keep your bunny safe from a raccoon, fox, or neighborhood cat.Still others still say that, with proper preparation and care, full-time outdoor living is fine. As your rabbit’s caretaker, the decision is yours.;
, Bugs Bunny may have done fine with a single-veggie diet, but real rabbits require lots of hay and diet diversity.


The staple of your rabbit’s diet should be hay, which should be available at your pet supply store. This should make up about 75% of its diet.Each day, add in some leafy greens and a handful of rabbit pellets, which offer important nutrients. Add various vegetables (yes, including carrots) and some fruits to the mix., A rabbit will typically establish one or two litter areas in its enclosure (let the rabbit decide where, and then place a bunny litter box there), but keeping the area clean in general is important for health and happiness.


Do some general clean-up daily, removing soiled straw, etc. Perform a more thorough cleaning at least every one-to-two months, removing and replacing bedding materials and the like.Soiled and/or damp bedding will encourage flies, which can bring on maggots that can infest your rabbit and cause “fly strike,” a potentially fatal illness., Wild rabbits are sociable creatures, and that quality has not been bred out of their domesticated cousins. So, if you’re going to have a pet rabbit, spend time with it, and consider giving it a friend or two.


Check on your rabbit at least once or twice a day, and spend some time with it. Hold it, or let it roam free a bit (in your bathroom, for instance, or an outdoor “rabbit run” enclosure).
Many rabbits prefer a companion, so think about adding another compatible bunny — ideally one of similar size and age. Make sure they are spayed or neutered, especially if you have boy and girl bunnies together — you know what they say about rabbits!, Rabbits are meant to be active creatures, running and hopping about, and need at least three hours of ""free range"" time per day for exercise.""Free range,"" however, does not mean loose and unsupervised in the yard, unless you want your bunny pal to become lunch for your neighbor's cat. Your rabbit must either be supervised or placed in a secure ""bunny run"" that allows plenty of room for horizontal and vertical movement.
Rabbits are also curious, sociable, and intelligent, and thus benefit from play time (and so will you!). Games like ""bunny bowling"" (the rabbit knocking over plastic pins), ""fetch"" (with you doing the fetching!), and ""cardboard castle"" (which is inevitably destroyed) are among the many play options.Rabbits enjoy playing with paper, cardboard, hard plastic, or untreated wood toys as well. Avoid treated wood and some varieties such as cherry, redwood, and peach, as these may be toxic."

Approach slowly.,
Do not try to corner your rabbit.,
Talk quietly to your rabbit.,
Get down on your rabbit’s level.,
Pet your rabbit to calm it down.",How to Handle Rabbits1," Walk slowly toward your rabbit. Pick it up carefully, gently, and slowly. Sudden movements will scare the rabbit., If you push your rabbit into a corner it might be easier for you to catch it, but your rabbit will also feel nervous. This can cause your rabbit to struggle and scratch., Speak in a low, calm tone to your rabbit. Do not make any loud noises as your approach your rabbit., Squat so that you don’t tower over your bunny. This will calm it down. It is also a good position from which to pick it up and to interact with it for a bit before picking it up., After carefully approaching the bunny and speaking reassuringly to it, begin petting it. This will help calm it down and get it accustomed to your touch.Rabbits generally like to be rubbed on the forehead and cheeks. They also like to have their backs scratched. They prefer not to be touched on the ears, neck, belly, feet or tail."

Decide what kind of supplier you are looking for.,
Ask people for recommendations.,
Make a list of what seem to be the best choices: that is, the ones people recommend the most.

,
Visit everywhere on your list, asking questions and looking carefully at your surroundings.,
Narrow down your list.,
Choose your new bunny!

",How to Choose Where to Purchase Your Rabbit," They all have their advantages! The main kinds of suppliers are:



Pet shops. Sell a wide range of rabbits and are often cheap; however, bad pet shops can sell you sickly, underfed, immature rabbits at a high risk of dying.

Rescue centers and SPCA's. Are more likely to sell adults, and will often take the time to match you up to a suitable pet, as well as the fact that you will be rescuing a rabbit who had a bad start in life; however, some rabbits may have psychological problems, and you are less likely to find kittens (baby rabbits) and pedigrees.

Rabbit breeders. Are more likely to stock good specimens of certain breeds, and supply all ages of rabbits; however, like pet shops, they may only be in it for the money, abusing the female rabbits and turning them into breeding machines, and feeding to the bare minimum.

Friends who have rabbits. This is usually the best choice. You are more likely to know the mother and possibly the father, so have a better idea how the rabbit will turn out, you can ask your friend for help with your rabbit later on, and you can visit often to choose your favorite bunny.;
, Target people who you know have healthy, happy rabbits and ask them what breeder/shop/rescue center they recommend.

,, Ask questions that have one right answer, that you know the answer to, and see if they are answered correctly. If not, that probably isn't the best place to get your bunny. Make sure:


There is no overcrowding
The surroundings are clean, and do not smell
The rabbits look happy and healthy
Every enclosure contains at least one container of clean water and hay

, By now you should have only one or at the most two. If there are still two left and you can't decide, look at their rabbits and decide which one has the rabbit you want.

Prepare a proper home.,
Protect your rabbit from predators and itself.,
Keep things dry.,
Beat the summer heat.,
Make winter warmer.",How to Care for an Outdoor Rabbit2," The days of thinking it acceptable to keep a pet rabbit in a small, isolated “hutch” are past. Rabbits need a dry, clean, ventilated, safe, well-placed, and relatively roomy home to thrive.


Modern outdoor “hutches,” with multiple levels and/or rooms, are suitable for pet rabbits. You can also construct your own bunny home. Look for plans online, but make sure the home will be secure and relatively weather-tight.As one example, you can create an exercise pen (or “rabbit run”) for your bunny to use daily out of wooden framing, rabbit fencing, and a plywood top and bottom. It should be at least 8’ L x 32” W x 32” H to give your rabbit enough room to run and hop about., As noted, domesticated rabbits can die simply from the shock of seeing a predator, so making sure other animals can’t get in and your bunny can’t get out are essential.


If you’ve ever had wild rabbits invade your flower bed or garden patch, you know they’ll eat just about anything. So, especially if your rabbit ever runs free in your enclosed yard, avoid having poisonous plants around. Also, anywhere your rabbit will be, take care to secure electrical wiring and keep it out of tooth-range.Regarding plants that can be toxic for rabbits: the list is actually quite extensive, so consult it carefully. Just a few examples include: aloe, begonia, daffodil bulb, Easter lily, and geranium.

, When it comes to an outdoor rabbit home, dampness leads to dirtiness leads to sickness, such as the “fly strike” mentioned elsewhere here.Give your rabbit home a roof that resists rain — it can be plywood, corrugated panels, or even plastic sheeting or a tarpaulin. Repair and replace the roof as necessary to keep the rain out.
During heavy rain or snow, consider moving your rabbit (by having a mobile home or second home) to a drier location such as a porch, garage, basement, or just in the main house. A bad thunderstorm can frighten a pet rabbit to death, so bring it in if possible.

, If you’ve spotted wild rabbits near your home in the summertime, they’ve probably been lounging in the shade or in a hole they’ve dug in your yard. Rabbits like to stay comfortably cool year-round.Place your rabbit’s home in a shady area, and/or provide shade with a roof or screening material. Make sure the enclosure is well-ventilated to prevent overheating, however.
You can also try freezing plastic water bottles and nestling them in the straw flooring. This will provide your rabbit with some cool spots to lounge.
Make sure your rabbit always has a fresh water supply in warm weather.

, With a properly insulated and protected home, rabbits can withstand the winter cold, although you may consider just keeping them inside — at least at night — during the coldest time of year.Before winter arrives, repair the rabbit’s home, taking special care to fix any leaks or damp spots. Damp is bad, and damp and cold is especially bad for rabbit health.
Add additional bedding as insulation. You can also line walls and floors with layers of newspaper. Consider covering areas of fencing with plastic sheeting, and covering the home with a tarp or blanket at night. You want to reduce drafts and hold in warmth, but make sure you allow some ventilation.You can purchase special heaters for a rabbit home, but make sure any electrical wiring is out of reach. There are also special bunny heating pads, or you can just nestle (securely closed) plastic bottles full of warm (not hot) water in the bedding several times per day.
Check on your rabbit friend more often than usual in cold weather. Make sure its water supply is not frozen, and provide extra food to give it the energy it needs to fend off cold weather."

Wear a long sleeve shirt.,
Scoop up your rabbit with a hand under its torso.,
Wrap your other arm around your rabbit’s hindquarters.,
Hold your rabbit as gently as possible.,
Squat when placing your rabbit back on the ground.,
Wrap your bunny in a towel if it struggles.",How to Handle Rabbits2," Rabbits often resist being picked up by scratching and clawing. This can cause you to drop your rabbit and hurt it. Wear a long sleeve shirt so that your rabbit won’t be able to hurt you., Your bunny will want all four feet securely pressed against you, either your hand or body. So, it is good to place one hand underneath, securing all four feet against your arm, as if the bunny were standing on your arm.Place your thumb around the rabbit’s side and your forefinger around its chest to hold it secure.Never try to pick up your rabbit by an extremity, like its ears, tail, or the scruff on the back of its neck.

, Your arm should reach around your rabbit’s back and across its body. Press it against your chest, to hold it securely., If your rabbit isn’t socialized and resists being held, you might need to hold it somewhat tightly against you. However, if your bunny is cooperative, you can reduce its stress levels by holding it more gently against you., When you are done with your rabbit, slowly bring it closer to the ground by squatting. Do not lean over and drop your rabbit suddenly. Place it on a surface that is ground level, flat, and not slippery., If your rabbit squirms or scratches when you hold it, you can put a towel around it to protect yourself. Throw the towel over it and then scoop it up, wrapping the towel around the bottom of the rabbit."
"
Start holding your rabbit at an early age.,
Hold your bunny in a kneeling position when you start.,
Cover your rabbit’s eyes.,
Closely supervise children when they are with a rabbit.",How to Handle Rabbits3," Your bunny is more likely to get accustomed to human contact if it is socialized from an early age. If it isn’t held a lot at an early age, it might never take to being held.


Some rabbits never will become comfortable with being held., Your bunny will be less nervous if you don’t pick them up too high in the air. You should start by squatting close to the ground and holding your rabbit in your arms, just a foot or two off the ground. As your bunny becomes better socialized, you can try to stand up normally with your bunny.This also makes it less likely that your rabbit will hurt itself if it jumps out of your arms.

, If you cover your rabbit’s eyes with a towel or your arm, this can calm it down. This is a good way to start socializing your bunny. Be careful, however, that you don’t obstruct the rabbit’s breathing., Any bad experiences with humans can reverse your work to socialize the bunny. Be careful about allowing children or strangers to hold the rabbit. If they do, be sure to explain explicitly how the rabbit should be held and supervise the process closely."

Visit the breeder that you are getting the rabbit from.,
Look at the rabbits.,
Note that you should bond with the bunny before you make you final pick.

,
Check the health of the body and fur.,
Find the rabbits' personalities.,
Look for sparkling eyes.,
Teeth should meet properly at the front with the upper incisors going over the bottom (much like the human bite).,
Check for clean and dry ears.,
Ensure the rabbit’s nose is dry without discharge and check the inside of the front legs.,
Calm breathing is very important to ensure the rabbit has no breathing difficulty or cold.,
Consider the sex of the rabbit.,
Talk to the breeder.",How to Choose a Pet Rabbit," Look at the location the rabbits are in and check that it's clean, has water and food, and seems neat and pleasant.;
, Find a few you like the appearance of and ask the breeder to separate these from the rest of the bunnies so you can choose one.

,, Look over the rabbit’s body for proper weight, and signs swelling, skin disease. Ensure no baldness or inflamed skin as the coat should cover the body evenly, nicely and fully.

, What do you see? Do you see a cuddly, soft rabbit or a wild, crazy rabbit? Consider what kind of personality you want your rabbit to have, and ask the breeder to remove the rabbits whose personalities you don't like.

, Make sure the eyes of the rabbit are bright and free from discharge, meaning no crying tears.

, Avoid rabbits with teeth that meet evenly or have an underbite, without curling or excessive overlap. Improper tooth position is a chronic problem that can stop the rabbit from eating and will only get worse without frequent vet visits for trimming.

, Be sure there is no waxy discharge in the ear. This is caused by ear mites and is easy to treat, but it can be signs of neglect.

, Matting there suggests a runny nose because rabbits wipe their noses with their feet. Also, check that the rabbit has clean underparts.

, Breathing will be very fast, especially if it is scared or hot. The area it lives in should be clean. Droppings of the rabbit should be firm and dry.

, Do you think you want a girl or a boy? Boys tend to be naturally more cuddly and love the attention. Girls are more outgoing, but less cuddly.

, Breeders understand the nature of the parents and have known the babies for the longest; they understand their rabbits' personalities more than anyone.


Make sure that the breeder has handled the kits (baby rabbits) from the first weeks they are old enough to do so. This will make it more likely that the rabbits are friendly toward humans and less likely to be scared by people.

Decide whether your rabbit will live inside or outside.,
Get a rabbit hutch.,
Cover the bottom of the hutch with bedding.,
Get a litter tray.",How to Care for a New Pet Rabbit1," Before bringing your new pet home you need to decide if you intend the bunny to be a house rabbit or live outdoors in a run in the yard. House rabbits are popular pets but there are a few factors to consider. While you will have to do more cleaning and training for a rabbit that lives indoors with you, you will not have as much social contact with a rabbit that lives outside.


If you decide to keep your rabbit inside, you will need to rabbit proof your house. Rabbits chew anything and everything, including electrical cables and the legs of your antique furniture. Make sure you are able to 'rabbit proof' your home so that cables are all tidied away out of reach of the rabbit, and there is no item that you would be upset if it got damaged by gnawing.
If you decide to keep your rabbit inside you will also need to litter box train it. It is not hygienic to have the rabbit ranging around the house, pooping and peeing wherever they please. The solution is to litter train the rabbit to use a litter box. However, most rabbits poop mostly in one particular spot, so you can use this to your advantage by placing a litter tray in whichever spot they usually poop. If you have a male rabbit who is spraying urine everywhere, you may need to get him desexed.
If you decide to keep your rabbit outside you will need to commit to spending time socializing it every day. Make it a part of your schedule, otherwise the rabbit may become anxious and fearful in your company.;
, The hutch (or rabbit house) should be at least 2 feet (0.61 m) wide and 4 feet long, and tall enough to let the rabbit stand up to its full height.


Outdoor hutches are most commonly made of wood with a door fitted at the front made of chicken wire. This allows for good ventilation and for the rabbit to see out. The wood offers a degree of thermal protection to insulate the rabbit from the elements, and is sturdy, protecting the rabbit from predators.
An outdoor hutch will need to have a run attached to it, so that your rabbit can exercise. The run should be a minimum of 4 feet (1.2 m) by 8 ft by 2ft tall, for a rabbit under 2kg.Many indoor hutches are made of plastic with a wire roof. This has the advantage of being lightweight, so you can move it around the house easily.
If you can't find a hutch you like, make your own! It isn't as simple as buying one, but it can be much better for your rabbit. Make sure the sides are made of wire but the floor is not.

, You must provide bedding that is soft, warm and absorbent. Cover the entire base to a minimum depth of 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm). This cushions the backs of the rabbit's hind legs, which are prone to pressure sores if not enough padding is provided.


Commonly used substrates for bedding include wood chips, hay, or straw. Of these, straw is the warmest and softest and makes the best bedding material, hay is second best (and is more expensive than straw), and sawdust it third best., You will need to litter train your rabbit if you are keeping it inside. The litter tray will need to fit inside the hutch and not take up more than a third of the floor space.

Call your local wildlife conservation office for help.",How to Care for a Baby Wild Rabbit," A mother rabbit can be very secretive; she leaves the nest during the day to keep predators away. She has not abandoned her babies. If you find a nest of bunnies leave them alone. If it is obvious that they need help (the mother is dead on the road, for instance), you will need to take them to a vet or wildlife rehabilitator.


A wild cottontail (US) rabbit that is not old enough to be weaned yet, may have a white spot on its forehead. Some babies are born without any spot. Some rabbits will retain the ""blaze"" throughout life and others will lose it as they age. The presence or absence of a blaze does not indicate the bunny's age or need for care.
In the case of a baby rabbit which is being removed from a dangerous situation (such as a predator), consider this a temporary measure. Keep the baby in a safe, quiet place until the danger has passed, then simply return it to the area where it was found. A mother rabbit will not reject a baby if it has human scent on it. This is the rabbit's best chance for survival. However, if the baby has been attacked by a cat, any wound contaminated by a claw or tooth will KILL the baby within a few days. It needs to be taken to a wildlife rehabilitator or a veterinarian and given a rabbit-safe antibiotic.;
, A wooden or plastic box with high sides is quite ideal. Line the box with pesticide-free soil, and follow with a layer of dried hay (not wet grass clippings).


Scoop out a circular ""nest"" in the hay for the babies to stay in. If you can, line it with fur from the the actual nest or fur from a pet rabbit. Do not use hair from another species, particularly not from a predator.
If you do not have access to rabbit fur, line the nest with a thick layer of tissues or soft cloths.
Place one end of the box on top of a hot pad, heated bed, or an incubator to keep it warm. Place only one side of the box on the heat so that the babies can move if they feel too warm., You may use gloves to handle the rabbits. They can carry diseases and can draw blood from a bite. Most adult wild rabbits are infested with fleas, but most babies are free of them, but may have a tick or two that needs to be removed. If you are squeamish about removing a tick, ask someone with experience. You do need to be very careful with ticks as they MAY carry diseases transmissible to humans. It is best to keep the rabbit in an area away from human (and other animal) living areas. Also, it is okay to allow a baby cottontail to get used to human scent. They will revert back to their wild instincts as they mature.


Handle the babies as little as possible. They can become distressed from excessive handling and die.
Gently place a little of the fur, tissue, low pile plush fabric or a terry cloth washcloth on top of the rabbits for warmth and security.
Be aware that wild rabbits can pass diseases to domestic rabbits. Use careful sanitation procedures after handling the wild rabbit, or its waste, especially if you have other rabbits.

, If the rabbits can walk, they will need to be covered to prevent them from jumping out. Even at a few weeks old, they can be very adept at jumping! You may need to be sure the top is kept shaded from light.

, After that, you can move them to a small hutch.

, If a rabbit is hopping about, it may need only constant access to fresh greens, hay and water. You can offer formula in a shallow dish even to older bunnies. Once it is eating the greens (no pesticides or herbicides) well and hopping and running about, it is ready to be released in an area preferably with lots of cover for this little prey animal.


Any wild rabbit should have constant access to hay, water and fresh greens of the type it would be able to eat in the wild. Even very young rabbits will nibble on greens and hay.
At first, baby rabbits that have been left alone will likely be dehydrated. Feed Gatorade Lite rather than Pedialyte for the first few feedings. Pedialyte is fine for most species, but has too many carbohydrates for bunnies.

, Mother rabbits feed at dusk and dawn for only about five minutes, so baby rabbits (depending on size and age) may only need to be fed twice a day, however formula is not as nutrient rich as mother's milk, so more frequent feedings are often necessary. Nursing baby rabbits should have a small, round belly (not bloated) after feeding. When the belly no longer looks round, it is time for another feeding. Most rehabilitators feed a combination of KMR (Kitten Milk Replacer) and Multi-Milk, available from rehabilitator supply stores. Probiotics should be added to the mixture, if available. The mixture should be thick as mother rabbit's milk is thicker than most other small mammals. This usually means approximately 3 parts solids (by volume) to 4 parts distilled water.
Do not warm the formula directly, but warm water in a container and float the formula container in that. Use an eye dropper or better yet a syringe with a mini Miracle nipple attached. Use a 2.5 cc syringe with tiny babies and graduate to 5 cc syringes as the bunny's capacity increases. Keep the baby in a sitting position so it does not aspirate! Be ready with tissue in hand to QUICKLY blot any milk that appear in the nostrils!
NEVER feed a baby rabbit cow’s milk.

, Bloat as well as diarrhea due to overeating is a common cause of death in wild rabbits. The maximum quantity for each feeding depends on the age of the bunny. Be aware that cottontail bunnies are smaller and should be given less than the recommended amounts. General guidelines for feeding amounts:


Newborn to one week old: 2-2.5 cc/ml each feeding, twice per day
1-2 weeks old: 5-7 cc/ml each feeding, twice per day (less if the rabbit is very small)
2-3 weeks: 7-13 cc/ml each feeding, twice per day (less if the rabbit is very small)
At 2-3 weeks, also start introducing them to 'timothy hay', oat hay, pellets and water (add fresh greens for wild rabbits)
3-6 weeks: 13-15cc/ml each feeding twice per day (less if the rabbit is very small).

, Cottontails usually wean around 3-4 weeks, so you should not give formula past 6 weeks. Wild Jackrabbits wean after 9 weeks, so after 9 weeks slowly replace formula with a dish of cut up tiny bananas and apple pieces.

, Allow the bunnies to feed at their own pace, and be very gentle while handling them. If you try to get the baby to drink too fast, it could choke and die., If the baby rabbits are so young as to have their eyes only partially opened, it can help to wrap them in a small warm piece of cloth covering their eyes and ears, so as not to scare them.

, Very carefully prepare to feed the newborn bunny by putting the teat of the bottle in its mouth.


Tilt the bunny slightly backwards and proceed to get the teat between its side teeth. Note that it is impossible to insert the teat straight between their front teeth.
Once the teat is in between the side teeth, proceed to slide it around to the front.
Gently squeeze the bottle to allow a small amount of formula to come out.
Within a couple of minutes, the baby rabbits should start sucking.
Continue to feed the with this formula for around 3 to 4 days, twice per day, with the last feed being around dusk as the mother would do.

, Newborn cottontails need to be stimulated to urinate and poop following the feeding. This is done by gently stroking the bunny’s genital and anal area with a moist q-tip or cotton ball to mimic the licking of a mother rabbit., As soon as baby rabbits can walk, they should spend a few hours outside on a grass lawn.


Keep them in a wire cage for protection. You may want to monitor them to keep them safe from predators and other danger.

, When the bunnies are four days old or older, put a small flat container lid of water and a small flat container lid of the formula in their hutch.


Keep a vigilant eye on the rabbit babies to see how they are doing. They should begin to eat the formula and drink the water without help.
Check the hutch for wetness. Try to replace spilled formula so that they are eating the appropriate amount.
Refill formula and water in the evening and the morning. Be sure you do not overfeed the bunnies formula.
Do not put a dish with deep water in the bunny area, as the bunnies could drown in it., After the bunnies have mastered eating the formula and drinking the water on their own, you can start leaving other treats in their hutch. Some items to try are:


Fresh picked grass
Dry hay looking grass
Small pieces of bread
Clover hay
Timothy hay
Pieces of apple
Oats

, Bunnies will need to have constant access to clean, fresh water. This aids in digestion and keeps them hydrated and healthy.

, When the rabbits are somewhat self-sufficient, wean them off of formula and allow them to feed themselves grass and other vegetation. Be sure the bunnies are an appropriate weaning age (3-5 weeks for cottontails and 9+ weeks for wild Jackrabbits).

, The bunnies need to prepare for being released into the wild, so you should stop touching them if at all possible. They will become less dependent on you and more self-sufficient.

, Place them in a wire cage with a roof outside of your home.Be sure that the bottom of the cage is wire, so they can graze, and check that all the holes are small enough that they cannot slip through.


Move the cage to different spots in your yard so that the bunnies have a regular supply of new vegetation.
Continue to supply extra vegetation in addition to the grass.

, Upgrade them into a larger hutch outside on the grass and continue to feed them all the extra veggies twice a day. The hutch should have an open or a wire bottom and should be secure to keep the bunnies safe from predators.

, When the bunnies are about eight or nine inches long in a sitting position, they are big enough to be released into the wild in a safe place.If they are not self-sufficient, keep them a little longer, but do not let them grow to maturity in captivity.

, If a rabbit that is big enough to release still cannot provide for itself, call an expert. They will know what to do for your particular situation.

Bring your rabbit in for regular checkups.,
Recognize when your rabbit is aging.,
Provide a healthy emotional life for your rabbit.,
Pay attention to bunny’s potty time.,
Check the cage for a foul smell indicative of urine or feces.,
Ensure your rabbit is getting the right amount of calcium.,
Check the bottoms of bunny’s feet regularly.,
Encourage your bunny to move about.,
Keep your bunny on soft surfaces like hay, grass, or earth.,
Encourage healthy eating.,
Feed your bunny appropriately for its weight.,
Look for malocclusions.,
Check your bunny’s eyes.Bunny’s eyes should be colorful, bright, and alert with no signs of discharge.,
Check your bunny’s nose.,
Check your bunny’s hearing.Older bunnies, like older people, might lose their hearing.,
Check your bunny’s heart and lungs.",How to Care For an Elderly Rabbit," Your rabbit may develop health problems which offer no outward signs, but will be obvious to a vet when looking at routine bloodwork results or examining your rabbit’s physique. Elevated enzymes or liver disease might be caught early if you continue to take your rabbit in for regular checkups.


From the time a rabbit is four years old, he or she should see the vet at least once each year. When the rabbit surpasses seven years of age, take him or her to get bloodwork done at least twice each year.
If the vet your rabbit sees in old age is not the same as the vet who treated your rabbit when they were younger, contact the vet who saw the rabbit when they were younger in order to obtain baseline bloodwork values.
You might want to provide your vet with a urine sample for urinalysis. To do so, place the rabbit in a small cage with a metal mesh or grate floor. Place the cage above a plastic tray to collect the urine when the rabbit passes it.;
, The average lifespan of a rabbit is between 7 - 10 years, but rabbits have been known to live up to 18 years.Lifespans vary from rabbit to rabbit. No matter how old your rabbit gets, you’ll start to notice signs of aging after around four years old. Keep an eye out for these potential changes in your bunny:


Small white hairs might develop behind its ears.
It might sleep more than it used to.
Its coat might become more coarse, or thinner and finer.
Mobility might be reduced.
Weight might go up or down, and appetite might decrease.

, Play with your bunny frequently, pet it gently and lovingly, and keep it happy in its old age. These activities will keep it happy. Your bunny won’t always be happy, though; if it is not, be cognizant and respectful of your rabbit’s inner emotional life.


If you kept two or more rabbits and one passes away, allow the other rabbit(s) to grieve. A rabbit who lived with a companion for many years should be allowed to say goodbye when and its companion goes to bunny heavenWhen the bunny loses interest in the body, remove it for burial or cremation. Give extra attention and affection to the remaining bunny for several days as it grieves.
While a bunny who has passed away can never be replaced, consider getting a new friend for your aging bunny. Having a playmate to interact with can keep your pet active, curious, and engaged when you’re not around.

, Older rabbits might not be able to curve their spine properly, and could end up soiling themselves during urination. Check its fur, especially its back legs, for wetness or fur clumps due to urine. If the problem is chronic, your bunny can develop urine scald, a condition which causes the rabbit to suffer from inflamed or irritated skin and fur loss.If your pet develops urine scald, ask your vet for an appropriate treatment which you can apply to the inflamed area. There are several available, but they generally work to relieve pain and fight infections. Ensure your cream, powder, or ointment is zinc-free.

, Keep your cage clean and ensure your cage’s top layer of bedding works to wick away moisture from the surface.Check your pet’s bottom regularly. If you see an accumulation of fecal matter or urine stains on its hindquarters or around its anus, give it a bath and contact your vet about the situation.

, If your rabbit has thick or pasty urine, it might need a reduction in its calcium intake. Identify sources of calcium in its diet and find an appropriate substitute for the other nutrients which might be lost when removing the source of excess calcium. For instance, if you feed your rabbit a helping of food pellets with each meal and they contain 100% of your rabbit’s daily value of calcium, reduce the pellet serving by half, and find another type of pellet which is calcium-free to make up for the other half of your rabbit’s calories in each meal.

, They might develop sores or cuts which can be come painful and infected. In this case, your vet can bandage or prescribe medication to ease the pain in bunny’s feet.Check your bunny’s nails. As your bunny ages, its nails might start to curl outward and become thicker. Keep your bunny’s nails trimmed and neat, or they might tear and cause bunny pain.You might also notice small callouses beginning to develop on the bunny’s nail bed., Give it time in a safe, enclosed area to explore and hop about freely. Movement and exercise will keep it spy. However, in its old age, your bunny might not want to hop around as much. In this case, do not force it to do so.


Bunny may move around less frequently or with greater difficulty. If you see this, your bunny might have developed arthritis or joint inflammation, and should be taken to a vet.
Consider adding more litter boxes to your rabbit hutch or cage if your rabbit has difficulty moving.
You might also want to lower the sides of the litter box or provide a ramp on a gentle incline. Change your bunny’s litter box at least once a week.

, Avoid setting your rabbit loose on hardwood floors or wire cages.Hard surfaces can exacerbate pain in your rabbit’s legs and feet.


Keep soft bedding on the floor of your rabbit hutch or cage. Pinewood shavings are typically considered the best option.Change the bedding regularly to ensure it does not become damp.

, Offer your rabbit tasty treats that are also high in nutrients such as spinach, carrots, lettuce, rabbit pellets, or timothy hay. These foods will help the rabbit keep healthy in its old age. Timothy hay can be fed in unlimited quantities; veggies should be fed at a rate of two cups per six pounds of body weight.Be sure that your rabbit is drinking and eating several times a day. Make sure that its water bowl/bottle is never empty.

, Monitor changes in your bunny’s weight and adjust its diet accordingly. Older rabbits often need food pellets, which are available at local pet stores.These will give your bunny a calorie boost to make up for the loss of bone mass and muscle. Pellets of timothy hay are best, though alfalfa pellets might be needed if your rabbit is having trouble keeping on weight. Pellets should be administered at a rate of ¼ cup per six pounds of bunny weight.


Alternatively, if your bunny has put on excess pounds in its old age, work to reduce its weight. Like humans, bunnies can develop arthritis, heart disease, and other health problems related to excess weight. Ask your doctor what your bunny’s target weight should be and adjust its diet as necessary.

, The development of molar malocclusions – misalignments of the jaw -- are common in smaller breeds like lops. If you see your bunny has difficulty eating, drools when eating, moves its mouth in seeming discomfort, or paws at its face, you should bring your bunny to the vet. Other signs of molar malocclusions include a bunny who takes food but then spits it out, a bunny who has a very wet face after eating, or a bunny who turns down food regularly.


To feed a bunny with malocclusions, offer small chunks of fruit and veggies, and cut up your bunny’s greens. Smaller pieces are easier to chew.
Check your bunny’s teeth for abnormalities monthly.Problems with both incisors and molars might visible. Your rabbit’s teeth should be straight and the gums should have a healthy pink color.

, If you see significant streaks at the corners of the eyes or tears, or your bunny cannot open and close their eyes easily, your bunny might have any number of eye issues, from cataracts to eye infections. If this is the case, take your bunny to a vet immediately.


Older bunnies may develop cataracts.Cataracts are small imperfections which develop over the lens of the eye, making vision difficult. If you notice your bunny is having trouble locating things, seems unsure where to go in new surroundings, or demonstrates a sensitivity to light, they might have cataracts. While they are not painful and do not require treatment, cataracts should be monitored.

, Take your bunny to the vet if you see yellow or green discharge around bunny’s nose. Your bunny’s nose should be fresh and clean.If your rabbit sneezes or sniffles often, they might have contracted an illness. Monitor your pet for repeated sneezing or prolonged sniffling sessions and report them to a vet if they persist., Approach a deaf or hearing-impaired rabbit slowly from the front so it can see you. Approaching another way, especially from behind, will startle your bunny. Over the long term, this can lead to increased stress levels.

, Listen for clear, normal breathing.Use a stethoscope to listen to bunny’s heart.


Listening to bunny’s heart and lungs when he or she is young will give a baseline against which to recognize and measure irregular heartbeats and breathing when they are older. Checking your rabbit's heart rate and breathing is an important part of ensuring good bunny health at every age.

Gently transfer your rabbit from its carrier to its hutch.,
Leave the rabbit undisturbed for 24 hours.,
Start interacting with your rabbit after 24 hours.,
Try picking up the rabbit.,
Groom your rabbit.",How to Care for a New Pet Rabbit2," Rabbits are a prey species, which means when they are stressed they want to hide. Moving home is a big deal for a bunny, and so when you bring them home leave them in the quiet to settle in.

, This will help it grow accustomed to the new sights, sounds, and smells of their new home without the added challenge of strange people staring at them.

, Take it slowly. Spend as long as time allows each day sitting beside the hutch talking to the rabbit. If the rabbit is already tame, then open the hutch door and stroke along the rabbit's back.


Avoid hovering your hand over the rabbit's head as this is what a predator would do.

, If the rabbit doesn't run away when you gently pet it, then sit on the ground and gently lift rabbit out and onto your lap. Sitting on the ground is less frightening to bunny, because they are ground dwelling and being high in the air is unnerving for them.To pick up your rabbit, place a hand on its chest and another on its bottom, and carefully lift it so that its side is parallel to your chest, and it is sitting on one of your arms while the other forms a barrier so it can't fall off. Then place it on your lap.
If the rabbit is not used to being picked up and runs away, do not forcibly remove the rabbit. Instead, take your time and tempt the rabbit out with an extra tasty treat. Once the rabbit gets used to your voice, and realises you are no threat, it will eventually go for the treat. Once bunny is regularly staying out to receive the treat, you can start to stroke their back. Once they accept this, at that stage you can try to pick bunny up.
Remember, rabbits are prey animals. Unlike dogs or cats, their mothers do not carry them, so the only situation in the wild in which they would be picked up would be when a predator was carrying them. Some rabbits just don't like being picked up, so if your rabbit won't let you pick it up, leave it be.

, Grooming your rabbit is another great way to bond. Use a comb and a soft brush, and once bunny is happy being stroked, use the brush to groom it.


This is another good way to teach rabbit your company is a good thing, and perhaps try this first if the rabbit is still skittish about being picked up.

"

Ask the previous owner what the rabbit ate.,
Know what to feed your rabbit.,
Know what foods to avoid giving your rabbit.,
Don't overfeed your rabbit.,
Provide fresh drinking water at all times, in a clean, algae free drinker.",How to Care for a New Pet Rabbit3," In the short term, offer the rabbit that same food. Too many changes at once are likely to upset the rabbit and food is one thing you can keep constant (at least for a few days).


As the rabbit gets more confident, if its diet is not ideal, start to change its food.

, Rabbits are herbivorous and their ideal food is growing grass. Grass provides the correct balance of nutrients and fiber, which grinds down their teeth and gets their gut to work. However, it's not possible to provide good quality growing grass all year round, especially for an indoor rabbit, so a compromise always has to be reached.


The best food for your rabbit is growing grass but you will most likely need to supplement the grass with other foods. Fresh green hay is the best alternative to grass. If feeding pellets, only offer small amounts, the rest of the diet should be hay.

, Just because they are herbivores, doesn't mean that rabbits should be eating any plant-based diet.


Try to avoid muesli type feeds. These are far from ideal, and avoid using if at all possible. A muesli food has identifiable ingredients such as squashed peas, corn, wheat, nuts, and biscuit. The problem is the rabbit will eat the tasty bits and leave the nutritious parts. This leads to weak bones and overgrown teeth, and the rabbits also tend to become overweight.
It is an old wives tale that rabbit's under 6 months of age should not get fresh greens and vegetables. The trick is to give in moderation as a daily treat. Small pieces of fruit may be given on occasion, but should be strictly limited due to their high sugar content. All new foods should be introduced slowly over time.
If any digestive upset is noticed, offer the rabbit unlimited water, unlimited hay and some old fashioned (long cooking) oats. Remove all other types of food and restrict the rabbit to this diet for three days. If the digestion has returned to normal, you may reintroduce other foods again slowly, one at a time.
Also, any food can potentially cause problems if eaten to excess. Carrots contain a lot of oxalate, and if given everyday can predispose the rabbit to bladder stones.
A safe way to feed vegetables is to never give the same thing two days in a row - thus you may give cucumber / Monday, red pepper / Tuesday, carrot / Wednesday, broccoli / Thursday and so on., Find out how much food your rabbit needs based on its weight and breed. You must feed them every day, but do not feed too much based on their weight.


If you have a big or standard size rabbit, and you are feeding them grass, you have to feed them a lot, making sure they get enough calories every day, which means they are eating almost constantly. If you are feeding your rabbit pellets (which is not recommended), they will get enough calories much faster, in as little as 20 minutes.
Try to be consistent with the times of day you feed them.

, Mix up water with Apple Cider Vinegar (the cloudy type is best) for your rabbit. Add two capfuls of vinegar to one gallon and use that to fill your rabbit's water container. The Apple Cider Vinegar provides many health benefits for the rabbit such as shiny coat, boosts the immune system and helps to maintain healthy intestinal bacteria.


Rabbit sipper bottles are a good idea because the water is held in a reservoir attached to the hutch, and does not get contaminated by bedding, food, or pellets that may get kicked into a bowl of water. Likewise bowls of water are prone to being tipped over, which could be disastrous on a hot day if the rabbit is left with nothing to drink.






If your rabbit prefers drinking from a bowl, get a heavy one that they cannot tip.
If your rabbit lives outside in the winter, you should get a heated water bottle, so their water supply does not freeze.

Let your rabbit out while you are home, if you have an indoor rabbit.,
Take your rabbit outside.,
Spend time with the rabbit.,
Provide your rabbit with toys.",How to Care for a New Pet Rabbit4," A house rabbit gets a good dose of both exercise and mental stimulation, especially if it is allowed out when you are home. Let the rabbit be free to follow you around and even watch TV with you!

, If you have an indoor rabbit, take it outside but be sure it cannot escape. If you have an outdoor rabbit, let it out into the yard once in a while.


Your outdoor hutch should have a run attached to it, so your rabbit can exercise when it wants, but you will get more interaction with it if you let the rabbit out in the yard to play with you and to get some training.
Never leave your rabbit alone outside. Birds could snatch away your precious bunny.
You can even purchase a rabbit harness and leash, so you can take your rabbit for a hop around the block.

, Do activities such as grooming or training or just spend time playing with it. Rabbits are slow learners but you can teach them simple tricks and they can be clicker trained., They love to be playful. Rabbits are also active and curious, and need a good or wide variety of toys to keep them occupied and out of mischief!.You can use cardboard boxes of all shapes and sizes as toys.


A great free toy is a toilet paper roll stuffed with hay (after the toilet paper has been used up, of course). Most rabbits love this toy. It gives them something to toss around, gnaw and a snack! It's also a great way to recycle!
Cat toys often make good rabbit toys. A small plastic ball with a bell inside is usually fun for them to push around. Another idea is the type of baby rattle made like a keyring. Rabbits love to toss them around and shake them.
Remember that rabbits will gnaw anything they can reach. Check toys every day and remove anything that seems like it might become unsafe. Most (unpainted, unvarnished) wood is safe for rabbits to chew, as are paper products, such as cardboard, but always use common sense. Check items for things which might cause problems, such as staples, glue, paint, varnish, glossy labels, etc and remove any plastic toys the rabbit has managed to gnaw small pieces from.

Clean and change the bedding in the litter box frequently.,
Get your rabbit neutered.,
Get your rabbit vaccinated.,
Do not bathe your rabbit.",How to Care for a New Pet Rabbit5," Rabbit droppings are very dry and round, so they aren't hard to clean up. Try to put a little bit of hay into the litter box, because rabbits like to eat while they use the bathroom. This encourages them to keep going to the litter box.


Don't wait too long to clean the cage. It will get disgusting, smelly, and is not good for your rabbit's health.

, Neutered rabbits make better pets as they are less territorial and less prone to aggression. Rabbits can be desexed from around 12 weeks of age. If you have more than one rabbit (of either sex), then this young age is strongly advised or you may have a rabbit population explosion on your hands., From 12 weeks of age rabbit's can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and viral hemorrhagic diarrhea. Both diseases are fatal to rabbits. One annual injection is all it takes to keep the rabbit protected.Also speak to your vet about a course of fenbendazole against a common rabbit parasite called Encephalitozoon Cuniculi. A high percentage of rabbits carry this parasite, which can cause neurological problems, kidney failure, or blindness in later life. A single course once a year is advisable to keep your pet safe.

, There is no need to give a rabbit a bath as they clean themselves frequently and the oil on their bodies is natural, not harmful. Water can get in their ears and their ears can get infected. Also, the stress of a bath can be very bad for your rabbit's health.


Rabbits are very clean animals and should never NEED a bath. If your rabbit gets a messy bottom, this is often the result of a problem.

Watery poop is fatal to rabbits. If your rabbit has watery poop, you must seek emergency medical treatment immediately.
Clumpy poo on the bunny's bottom may be the sign of too rich a diet, or a rabbit who has become too chunky to properly clean itself. In this case, it is fine (and important) to give a bunny 'butt bath'. This should be done very gently with just a few inches of lukewarm water. Set the bunny's bottom (only!) in the water and use your hand to gently loosen and clean the clumpy mess. Once clean, remove and thoroughly dry the bunny.
It is extremely important to address whatever caused the clumpy poo. Restrict food to unlimited hay and some oats for three days. In the case of a very chunky rabbit, make sure the rabbit is getting plenty of exercise. Rabbits were not designed to sit around!


If the outdoor hutch your rabbits are in does not protect from thunderstorms, snow, or rain, you need to offer protection to keep your rabbit healthy.

In addition, young rabbits in pet stores may be especially prone to digestive problems,given the stress of living in a pet store and the significant dietary changes.


When you visit a pet store, ask the staff about where the animals come from. Reconsider buying a rabbit from a pet store if you cannot verify that the rabbits came from a reputable breeder, animal shelter, or rabbit rescue.;
, Compared with the staff at a pet store, the staff at an animal shelter or rescue group is more likely to have in depth knowledge of rabbit care.In addition, rabbits tend to be healthier and better socialized at an animal shelter or rescue group than a pet store.Visit the shelter or rescue group before purchasing your rabbit. Ask questions about how the organization cares for its rabbits, how rabbits are determined to be adoptable, the process of adopting a rabbit, and what post-adoption care is available.Animal shelters and rescue groups often partner together to find good homes for the rabbits in their care.Visit the websites https://www.petfinder.com/ and http://rabbit.org/ (House Rabbit Society) if you are unsure about where to find animal shelters or rabbit rescue groups in your area.
Also consider finding a rabbit through private rabbit adoption agencies.Rabbits from shelters are usually cheaper than rabbits from pet shops or breeders, since they're usually desexed, vaccinated, wormed and microchipped, while most pet shop rabbits and many breeder rabbits are not. They might cost a bit more at the shelter, but in the long run it will be cheaper to buy them there, since desexing, microchipping, vaccinating and worming rabbits can cost you hundreds of dollars.

, Buying your rabbit from a rabbit breeder is another option. Be aware, though, that not all breeders provide the proper rabbit care or are even knowledgeable about proper breeding practices. Unfortunately, some breeders may simply be trying to make money on the side To identify a reputable breeder, ask for recommendations from an exotic veterinarian or a trusted friend who owns rabbits. You can also visit rabbit shows to learn about rabbit breeders in your area A good breeder should be motivated by a genuine love for what they do, not solely by profit. They should be happy to provide with information about rabbits. They should also check to see if their customers are capable of looking after rabbits.
When you visit the breeder, take a close look at the breeding facility. It should be clean and well maintained, and the rabbits should be healthy and happy.Ask the breeder about his or her breeding practices, and ask to see breeding and genetics records.A reputable breeder should be able to provide you with references of others who have purchased rabbits from him or her. In addition, he or she should have a good relationship with an exotic veterinarian.If you are interested in a particular breeder, make sure that he or she provides you with a written health guarantee. The breeder should give you time to read through and understand the guarantee before you purchase a rabbit., Although a rabbit from a reputable animal shelter, rescue group, or breeder is likely to be healthy, it is still a good idea to check the rabbit for signs of illness. For example, if the rabbit has a runny nose or has trouble breathing, he may have a respiratory infection. If the rabbit is tilting his head, he may have an inner ear infection.If you are not sure how to examine the rabbit, ask the breeder, animal shelter staff, or an exotic veterinarian to walk you through a physical exam of the rabbit. They can help you understand the signs of health and illness.
If the rabbit appears ill, ask about how the rabbit would be treated, and if the rabbit would still be adoptable following treatment.

, A rabbit should not be bought until it is at least eight weeks old. By this age, the rabbit will be fully weaned from his mother and will be able to eat solid foods.Wherever you buy your rabbit, make sure that they do not sell rabbits that are less than eight weeks old—this could be a sign of unethical breeding practices.

, Rabbits are very social animals, and can get very lonely without a mate.That being said, it is not quite as simple as buying two or more rabbits at a time. Rabbits can be very picky about their mates, so you will need to put some thought into owning multiple rabbits.


It is recommended to have male-female pairings, but same-sex pairings can work as well.Two females should be fine, but two males will usually fight.
Make sure the rabbits are neutered or spayed before putting them together. Intact rabbits can display aggressive behavior towards their mates, as well as develop a destructive chewing habit, due to sexual frustration.It may be helpful to set up a time and neutral area for the two rabbits to meet. Animal shelters may have a separate room where rabbits can interact with each other. This would help you determine whether the pairing will work., Your rabbit will need a number of supplies in order to live a happy and healthy life at your home. For example, you will need a large, multi-level enclosure, which can be purchased at your local pet store.In addition, you will need food dishes, a water bottle, a litter box with litter, and plenty of chew toys.You will also need to purchase bedding (e.g., aspen chips, paper, straw) to line the bottom of the enclosure.A litter scoop and disinfectant will be useful for cleaning your rabbit’s cage.Your rabbit will also need a “nest” box in which he can sleep and rest.In addition to purchasing fresh vegetables from the grocery store, you should also purchase fresh pellets and hay from the pet store to feed your rabbit.The staff at your local pet store can give you additional assistance with purchasing all of the necessary supplies for your rabbit.

, The initial and long-term costs of owning a rabbit can add up quickly. Initial costs are usually between $300 and $400, and long-term care may cost you about $1000/year—not including veterinary care.Before you buy a rabbit, analyze your budget to determine if you can comfortably afford to care for one.


Initial costs include housing, food dishes, electrical cord protectors (rabbits like to chew), a litter box, and toys.Ongoing costs include fresh vegetables, hay, and litter.Incidental costs, such as veterinary care and furniture and toy replacement,can increase the cost of care.

, Having a pet rabbit can be time consuming. For example, you would need to feed your rabbit twice daily, tidy his cage once daily, and thoroughly clean his cage once a week.In addition, you would need to provide your rabbit with daily mental stimulation (e.g., chew toys, playtime).Your rabbit would need at least one hour per day of playtime outside of his cage (e.g., play pen, rabbit-proof room).Healthy pet rabbits can live up to 10 years.Think about whether you are ready to make a 10-year commitment to care for a rabbit.

, Just like other animals, rabbits can have different personalities and temperaments. Some may enjoy being held, and others may resist being held so much that they will injure themselves trying to escape.Some rabbits may enjoy being petted,and others may not care for much human interaction.


Being aware of these temperaments, and others, may help you determine if having a pet rabbit is right for you.
A rabbit’s personality is often influenced by how it has been socialized with people.Rabbits may not be a good choice if you have young children, since young children may not understand that a rabbit does not necessarily like to be held and cuddled., There are nearly 50 rabbit breeds that are recognized in the United States.It may seem like an arduous task to research all breeds, but it would certainly be time well spent. It is important to note that some breeds make good pets, and others are better suited for shows or breeding.Popular pet rabbit breeds include the Lionhead rabbit, the English lop, and the Dutch rabbit.The website https://www.arba.net/breeds.htm is an excellent source of information about the rabbit breeds that are recognized in the United States.
Consider talking with rabbit owners, exotic veterinarians, or rabbit breeders for additional guidance on choosing a pet rabbit breed.

, As cute as they are, baby rabbits like to chew on just about everything. The chewing action helps them strengthen their jaw muscles and learn about their environment,but can mean destruction if you do not keep an eye on them. In addition, baby rabbits do not like to be held for very long,which could lengthen the time it takes for the rabbit to bond with you.


‘Teenage’ rabbits (around three months old) are very energetic and can get bored easily.If you want a teenage rabbit, make sure you have enough toys and extra time to keep him entertained.
Adult rabbits, when spayed or neutered, are more amenable to being held. Adult rabbits are probably suitable if you have young children., Females tend to be grumpy, and males tend to be aggressive, before being spayed or neutered.Although the choice is yours, it may be less important to choose a sex than to ensure that the rabbit is spayed or neutered before you purchase it.

, People can be allergic to rabbits, or to the hay that rabbits eat.An allergist will be able to determine if you or anyone in your home has a rabbit or hay allergy.If an allergy is identified, consider finding another type of animal to own as a pet.
One reason rabbits end up in shelters is because the owner, or a member of the owner’s household, is allergic to rabbits or hay.Identifying these allergies beforehand can prevent the emotional hardship of having to give your rabbit to an animal shelter or rescue group.

Schedule regular veterinary visits.",How to Trim Your Rabbit's Nails," Before you begin trimming your rabbit's nails, you'll want to make sure you've got everything you need. Failing to plan ahead can leave you with a squirming, uncooperative rabbit and a lot of scratches. Make sure you have:


a long-sleeved shirt and long pants for yourself (to prevent scratches)
a towel to wrap the bunny in
a flashlight (optional) to find the quick
nail clippers - some people prefer to use human nail clippers for rabbits, while others prefer a special rabbit nail clipperstyptic powder, styptic pads, Kwik-Stop, or Cut-Stop to stop the bleeding if you cut too close;
, It will be incredibly difficult to attempt to trim your rabbit's nails alone. You probably won't be able to hold the rabbit's body, find the quick, and trim the nails on your own without dropping or injuring the rabbit, so it's best to have someone assist you.Wrap the rabbit in a clean towel with his paws sticking out. Make sure your rabbit's head is not covered by the towel, as this may frighten him and/or affect his ability to breathe.
Make sure your friend is sitting down while holding the rabbit. If the rabbit squirms out of your friend's hands and falls while she's standing, the rabbit may become injured., Once your friend is holding the wrapped up rabbit, you'll need your friend to get him into position. It's best to have your friend cradle him while also restraining him to protect your rabbit from squirming and/or falling.


Ensure that the rabbit is held in place in your friend's lap. Lay the rabbit belly-up and upside down, with his head pointed toward your friend's knees.
Laying a rabbit upside down with his head lower than the rest of his body puts him into a calmer, ""trance-like"" state.Have your friend use one hand to support the rabbit around his chest. This will help reduce the chances of him squirming free while you work.

, The quick is the term for the vein that runs through your rabbit's nails. The nail grows around and below the quick, so it's important to only trim the excess nail that has grown past the quick without damaging the nerves there.You'll need to find the quick on each nail before cutting. Take extra care not to rush this part, as cutting into the quick can be very painful for your rabbit and will cause him to bleed.
Use a flashlight to find where the vein/quick extends to in each nail. This may be particularly useful if your rabbit has darker nails, which can make it difficult to find the quick with the naked eye.

, Make sure you've identified the quick before cutting into the nail. Once you're ready, proceed with caution and make sure the rabbit is restrained.


Position the nail clippers in place just below the vein.Make sure you cut approximately two millimeters away from the quick.
Clip firmly to ensure that the nail is cut all the way through. Otherwise, if you only cut halfway through, your rabbit may become frightened and start to thrash and squirm.

, Once you've successfully trimmed one nail, you'll get a pretty good sense of how the rest of the nails go. Some rabbits who have grown up getting regular nail trimmings will get used to it and won't fight as much. Other rabbits may be frightened, and will need extra restraint and reassurance.


Make sure you get each of the nails on all four paws.
Give your rabbit a treat when you're finished. He may come to associate the discomfort of nail trimmings with a treat, which could make him calmer in the future.
Trim your rabbit's nails every four to six weeks to prevent injuries and overgrown nails.If you don't feel capable of trimming your rabbit's nails on your own, you can take him to a groomer or a veterinarian for instructions on how to trim the nails. You can also pay to have a groomer (or your vet) trim the nails for you.

, Sometimes no matter how careful you are, you might accidentally cut into the quick. If your rabbit is squirming and struggling, it may be difficult to tell which nail is bleeding, but it's important to determine where to apply pressure and any styptic products (if necessary).


Try to restrain the rabbit.
You should be able to tell which paw is bleeding, so while your friend restrains the rabbit's body you'll need to hold that paw and examine it.

, Once you've determined which nail is bleeding, you'll need to put pressure on it. Just like a cut on a human, putting pressure will reduce the flow of blood to the site of the injury, which will help it clot and heal faster.


Use clean gauze, a clean paper towel, or both.
Put pressure directly on the wound - in this case, the tip of the nail.Applying pressure may be enough to stop the bleeding for a small wound. If it keeps bleeding, you'll need to use a styptic product.

, Styptic products stop the bleeding when you've accidentally drawn blood. If the quick was cut and won't stop bleeding from pressure alone, you'll need to apply a styptic product to the injured nail.If you're using a styptic powder, wipe away the blood and press a pinch of the powder directly into the tip of the bleeding nail.
If you don't have a styptic powder on hand, you can improvise by using cornstarch or flour in the same way you would apply a styptic product.
Some people find that gently pressing an injured nail into a bar of mild bath soap can help stop the bleeding.

, Before you set your rabbit loose in the house or return him to his cage, it's important that you make sure the bleeding has stopped first. Leaving your rabbit unattended or placing him in his cage (which could cause his nail to get stuck in the grate and further injure it) can cause continued bleeding and additional injuries.Wait for about 5 to 10 minutes to ensure the bleeding has stopped before leaving your rabbit unattended or returning him to his cage.

, Rabbits shed their coat every three months. Rabbits will try to lick their coats clean like a cat, but unlike cats they cannot vomit up hairballs. If you don't brush your rabbit regularly he may develop a hairball blockage in his stomach, which could cause him to starve to death.Brush your rabbit at least once every week.
Choose a bristle or pin brush to avoid injuring your rabbit's skin.
Brush in the natural direction of hair growth - typically, this will be from head to tail., Even if you groom your rabbit regularly, he may develop mats from time to time. Mats are tangled clusters of hair that begin growing together. This can cause irritations and infections on the skin below the mat. However, rabbits have exceptionally sensitive skin, and cutting a mat out with scissors could cause serious injuries to the rabbit.Check your rabbit for mats every time you brush him.
If you find a mat, do not cut it out with scissors.
Use a mat splitter or mat rake to tease out mats and detangle them without cutting.

, While you're grooming your rabbit, it may be a good idea to check his ears for signs of infection. Ear infections are quite common among rabbits, so check on his ears periodically to ensure that your rabbit is in good health. If you observe any signs of an ear infection, it's important to take your rabbit to the vet as soon as possible. Common signs of an ear infection include:


pain/sensitivity to touch
frequent head shaking
redness/swelling, especially in the external ear canal
thick, white fluid in the ear canal (which may sometimes be creamy in texture)
excessive ear wax
odor in and around the ear
crusts forming around the ear canal
digging at the floor and/or holding down the ear (a sign of pain)
lack of appetite or interest in food
patchy hair or loss of hair around the ears
scaled skin around the ear canal

, A rabbit's teeth will continue to grow, just like his nails. Usually access to chew toys will help manage the growth of teeth, but occasionally an injury occurs that makes it difficult for your rabbit to chew his wooden toys or eat his food. Check his teeth periodically to make sure they're in good health.You'll probably only be able to see the front teeth (incisors) in your rabbit's mouth.
The incisors should be even. That means both top teeth should be the same length, and so should both bottom teeth.
Make sure there are no cracks in the teeth, no loose teeth, and no food or debris trapped between the teeth.
If you observe any problems, contact your vet immediately, as your rabbit may need medical help.

, The best way to prevent health problems is to be proactive in your veterinary visits. No matter what type of pet you have, it's important to ensure that he gets regular checkups and is able to get treatment for any ailments that arise.


Rabbits should visit the vet at least once every year.
Older rabbits (over five years old) may need to see the vet twice a year.Let your vet know about any problems you've observed or concerns you have about your rabbit's health.

Do not place your rabbit on a slippery surface when trimming its nails.",How to Trim Rabbit Toenails," Your rabbit may become nervous during the trimming process. Therefore, get your supplies together ahead of time. Lay them out around the area where you're going to clip your rabbit's toenails.You will need a pair of nail clippers. You can get clippers specifically made for small animals or you can use a regular pair.
You will need some kind of blood stopping powder. In the event you accidentally cut into your rabbit's quick, you will have to apply blood stopping powder. This powder can be purchased online or at a local pet store.
You will need an old towel to help restrain your rabbit while you clip.;
, In the wild, rabbits are preyed upon by larger animals. Your rabbit may become startled easily, especially if approached unexpectedly. When you approach your rabbit, speak to it in a calm voice to put it at ease. You want your rabbit to be relaxed going into the nail clipping process.


Use soothing, low tones as you speak.
Before touching your rabbits, put your hands out so your rabbit can see them. Do not simply grab your rabbit, as this can cause it anxiety.

, You want to make sure your rabbit can't squirm or kick too much during the trimming process. Gently wrap your rabbit in an old towel before you begin trimming its nails.Go slowly as you wrap your rabbit in the towel. Your rabbit may be frightened or squirm slightly. Talk softly to your rabbit throughout the process to keep it calm.
Wrap your rabbit loosely. Rabbits dislike being restrained.You do not need to cover your rabbit's head. Just cover its body.

, You want your rabbit to be seated on your lap with its paws exposed. Make sure the rabbit has all four feet somewhere on your lap. Rabbits get nervous if all their feet are not on a solid surface. This may make the clipping experience more stressful for you and your rabbit., There is a vein located inside each nail known as the quick. If you trim into the quick, this will cause your rabbit to bleed excessively. Make sure you locate the quick before you begin to trim a nail.The quick should be visible to the naked eye if your rabbit has clear claws. It will be a thin pink or red line just inside the nail.
If your rabbit has darker paws, try shining a flashlight under the nail. This may make the quick more visible.

, You want to keep a safe distance from the quick as you clip your rabbit's nails. You only need to clip the sharp tip of the nail. Never clip into the quick. Work with one nail at a time to assure precision.If your rabbit is particularly nervous, you may have to ask a friend to help. One person can hold and soothe the rabbit, while the other person clips the rabbit's nails.

, Rabbits dislike being restrained. Try to avoid holding your rabbit too tightly as you clip its nails. Keep the rabbit seated in your lap and pull it gently against your stomach. If you use too much force to keep your rabbit still, it will become agitated.If your rabbit is squirming too much, it's better to take a break and try again later than to restrain the rabbit too forcefully.

, If you trim into the quick, your rabbit's nail will begin to bleed. You should treat the bleeding promptly to reduce blood loss. You can apply your blood stopping powder to the bleeding nail. Follow instructions on the package. Then, apply pressure with a cotton ball.If bleeding does not stop on its own, you should contact a veterinarian.

, Not all rabbits will allow you to trim their nails. Some rabbits may be too skittish to adequately restrain at home. If you're nervous about trimming your rabbit's nails, take it to a vet. It's better to have a vet trim the nails safely than risk injuring your rabbit., It's best to set your rabbit on your lap when you trim its nails. However, if you choose not to, be careful of what surface you use. Avoid a slippery surface. This could cause your rabbit to slide and injure itself during the clipping process.Place a towel down on the surface you choose. This will make the rabbit feel more secure.

,,, During the summer and hotter weather, this step isn't as important while during the cooler winter, you don't want your rabbit to freeze.

, Now you have a clean rabbit!

Smell your rabbit.,
Make sure your rabbit uses a litter tray to ensure all urine and droppings are contained.,
Clean the rabbits living area at least 1-2 times per week.,
Rinse the litter box and other areas with white or cider vinegar to cut smells.

,
Take your rabbit to the vet immediately for a check-up if your rabbit smells when its cage is clean and he/she has been neutered.,
If your rabbit is ill and has a dirty bottom, very gently rinse off the area with lukewarm water or a baby wipe if desired.,
Remember not to keep your rabbit's cage outside.",How to Stop a Rabbit from Smelling," A healthy rabbit should not smell as, unlike most pets, rabbits are naturally odorless animals. If he/she does smell, you are either not taking care of it properly or he/she is ill.;
, Use a cat litter such as Yesterday's News. Do not use clumping litters or wood shavings as these can cause serious health problems for rabbits. Note: Your rabbit must be spayed or neutered! An unfixed rabbit will not use its litter box well and rabbits must be fixed to avoid serious health risks such as cancer.

, Replace all bedding.

,, A clean, healthy rabbit will never smell, and any odor is a sign of a potentially serious medical condition. Remember to only use a rabbit-savvy vet that has experience with rabbits. Ask your local rabbit shelter for a recommendation if you need to find one.

, Use your hands to wet clean any matted fur. You might need another person to help you hold the rabbit. A ""butt bath"" should only be used for medical purposes and only if necessary. Otherwise absolutely do not bathe your rabbit! Rabbits are not meant to get wet and bathing can cause serious health problems such as hypothermia. Putting a rabbit in water can also cause it to go into shock and have a heart attack.

, Today's pet rabbits are very different from the wild rabbits they descended from and cannot survive outside; keeping a rabbit outdoors will cut its lifespan in half on average. Outdoor cages are also harder to clean and put your rabbit at risk for many diseases.

"
"
Start with your local shelter.,
Contact a rabbit rescue group.,
Visit the shelter.,
Ask about adoption policies.",How to Adopt a Rabbit from a Shelter1," Your local animal shelter is the best place to start looking. Do a google search or visit the Petfinder website to find an animal shelter near you.Shelters typically receive a lot of rabbits a few weeks after Easter.This is an ideal time to find a rabbit to adopt.


It is unlikely, but if the shelter does not have any rabbits, ask them to put you on the waiting list so you can be notified.;
, If you are unable to adopt from a shelter, a rabbit rescue group is a good alternative. Many rescue groups are affiliated with local animal shelters. Like shelters, rescue groups take very good care of the rabbits until they can find a home for them. Visit the House Rabbit Society webpage to find a rescue group in your area.If you adopt through a rescue group, find out as much information about the organization as possible. Ask some questions such as:What is their adoption policy?
How do they decide which rabbits are adoptable and which rabbits are not?
How do they care for the animals?
Do they offer any post-adoption services?
Rabbits that are found by rescue groups may be living in a foster home with a volunteer.

, Once you have found a shelter, go and look around. Pay attention to how the rabbits are housed. The rabbits should be indoors and in a cat room or in a separate room for small animals. Each cage should have:A litterbox
Hay
Food and water
Rug
Toys
A card that details the rabbit's personality
If the rabbits are not housed in a good environment, consider adopting from a different shelter.

, Adoption policies will vary at each shelter. It is important that you understand and are comfortable with the policy before you begin the adoption process. Some questions you may ask include:


What is the adoption fee?
What is included in the adoption fee (e.g. medical exam, spay and neutering, etc.)?
What paperwork is required?
Are there any post-adoption services?
How long is the adoption process?

"
"
Ask about the rabbit's previous living conditions.,
Learn the rabbit's personality.,
Examine the health of the rabbit.,
Determine the breed of the rabbit.,
Consider the age of the rabbit.",How to Adopt a Rabbit from a Shelter2," Your rabbit lived a life before it arrived at the shelter. It may have been abused, abandoned, or neglected. These factors can impact how you will care for your rabbit and the personality of your rabbit. Knowing the history of the rabbit will help you decide if it is the right rabbit for you.Also ask if the rabbit was housed indoors or outdoors. Outdoor rabbits are more susceptible to diseases from insects and parasites, poisonous plants, loneliness, and isolation.
If a rabbit lived in a rough environment, it may need more care and attention.

, Spend time with the rabbit to determine its personality. Also ask the shelter staff about the rabbit's personality. A rabbit's personality determines the type of relationship you will have with your pet.If you like a lot of interaction, look for a rabbit that is more playful and enjoys a lot of attention.
You may have to visit the rabbit multiple times before you get an idea of its personality.
Go with your gut when choosing a rabbit. Do you feel a connection to the rabbit? Are you drawn to the rabbit and vice versa? Does the rabbit enjoy being petted? Does the rabbit take a while to warm up to you?
If there are other people in your house, all of you should spend time with the rabbit.
See how the rabbit behaves both inside and outside of the cage.

, Ask about the health history of the rabbit, and then examine the rabbit yourself. Check the coat, teeth, claws, eyes, and body of the rabbit.The coat should be glossy and clean. There should be no visible wounds or abscesses on the body.
The teeth and ears should be clean, and the rabbit's eyes should be bright.
There should be no discharge coming from the nose, eyes, or ear.
Teeth and claws should be trimmed.
None of the fur should be matted. Check the fur under the tail for matting and discoloration. These are signs that the rabbit may have diarrhea.
Ask if the rabbit has been spayed and neutered.

, If you are an inexperienced rabbit owner, small and medium breeds (e.g. Netherland Dwarf and Dutch) are best. If you have experience, you may consider a larger breed (e.g. Californian, Flemish Giant, or Angora).Two breeds of rabbits require extra attention:English lops have long ears that drag on the ground and are prone to infection and injury.
Angoras have very long hair, are prone to hairballs, and require a lot of daily maintenance.

, The ideal age to adopt is between 9 and 12 weeks of age. At this age, rabbits are easy to handle and train. However, young rabbits like to explore and do not want to held a lot. If you have young children, a baby bunny is not a good idea.A rabbit's personality also changes a lot during the first year of life due to hormone changes and growth.
An older rabbit is more stable and predictable.

"
Fill out an application.,
Pay your adoption fee.,
Use post-adoption services.",How to Adopt a Rabbit from a Shelter3," Once you have found a rabbit, it is time to fill out the application. The application will ask you a variety of questions. Always provide honest answers. Typical information you will need to provide includes:The rabbit that you are interested in.
Household information (e.g. location, landlord permission, number of people in the house, children in the house, family allergies)
Why do you want to adopt a rabbit?
Who will be the primary caregiver for the rabbit?
Do you have everything you need for the rabbit?
Are there other animals in the home?
Is your home rabbit proofed?
How will you feel if your rabbit chews things and/or poops and urinates outside of the litter box?
Under what circumstances would you get rid of/return the rabbit?
Do you have a rabbit veterinarian in place?
If the shelter does not feel like you are ready to be a rabbit owner, you may not be able to adopt a rabbit yet.

, Be prepared to pay your adoption fee on the same day as the adoption. Some shelters will not hold your rabbit for you. If you are not prepared to pay, someone else may adopt the rabbit you have chosen.Adoption fees can vary widely. Some shelters just simply ask for a recommended donation while others have a set price. Some shelters will even provide you with a cage with a small donation.
Some places may offer a discount if you buy a pair of rabbits instead of just one.

, Many shelters offer post-adoption services. Take advantage of these resources because they can help you take care of your rabbit. Typical post-adoption services include reduced-cost medical care, rabbit training tips, and recommendations and referrals to other resources for your rabbit.During the first week when you bring your rabbit home, you may notice a health condition (e.g. parasite, infections, etc.) that was acquired while living in the shelter. Call the shelter immediately and let them know. They may treat your rabbit for free.Your shelter is always a resource if you have questions about your rabbit so stay in contact with them.

The bunny should be able to lay down and stretch out comfortably and still have room for food and water and a litter box. Outdoor hutches for rabbits can be purchased or you can build one yourself. The hutch should have room for the rabbit to nest, hop around, space for food and water and a litterbox.
Get an exercise pen to provide extra space for the rabbit to move around.
Big bunnies will need larger accommodations. The rabbit needs to be able to move around and lay down freely. Make sure to have a large enough cage so that your rabbit can play!;
, Look for a cage with a solid bottom and sides made out of wire designed for rabbits. Think of this as the “den” for the rabbit to sleep in and a source of food and water. The plan should be that the bunny spends 8-12 hours or so outside of the cage in an exercise pen or a room for bunny-safe exploration.If you find a cage with a wire bottom, put a solid wood plank inside to line the bottom. Wire cage bottoms can hurt rabbits' feet.
An outdoor hutch should be sturdy and provide protection from the weather and predators.You can buy or build a hutch. You will need to make sure the rabbits are protected from predators and the elements.
Do not house your rabbit outdoors in a hutch all by itself. Rabbits are highly social animals, so get a companion rabbit when they are both young and have the rabbits spayed or neutered.

, There are also some specialty beddings made of recycled wood pulp that work well.Rabbits like to make cozy nests, so fill the bottom of the cage with soft natural material to keep them comfortable.


Hay, in addition to being great bedding, is the most important part of a rabbits diet, so make sure you choose the right hay for your rabbit. Timothy or grass hays are appropriate for rabbits. Avoid alfalfa hay as it is too high in calories, protein and calcium for long term feeding of most adult rabbits., You'll want to be able to let your bunny out to hop around, so place the cage in a room that you don't mind sharing and that is safe for the bunny. For instance, remove all electrical cords, small objects, and furniture of value from the room and avoid having chemicals or plants that may harm the rabbit in the room.Rabbits like to chew cords but you can buy cord protectors from hardware stores to stop your rabbit from chewing them.
Use a baby gate or exercise pen for dogs to prevent full access to the house to avoid damage to the furnishings and the bunny.

, Rabbits will naturally use the same spot as a ""restroom"" over and over, usually one corner of the cage. Line a small litter box (available at pet stores) with newspaper, then fill it with hay, or litter made specifically for rabbits, and place it in the rabbit's preferred corner.


Consider putting a second litter box in the rabbit's play area.

, Rabbits are burrowing prey animals, so providing hiding places, like logs or cardboard boxes, is good for their well-being. One or two per rabbit, depending on how much space you have, will give the rabbits plenty of room to huddle.

, If you don't provide rabbit chews as snacks, it may chew on your furniture or other items you have lying around.Make sure your rabbit always has something safe to chew on. This will wear down its teeth and prevent injury.

, This is the main component of a rabbit's diet and so it should be available at all times. Timothy, oat, and brome hay are good choices. Put it out on a daily basis in a clean area of the rabbit's cage.


For young growing rabbits (up to 7 months) or pregnant or lactating rabbits, feed alfalfa hay and pellets to provide extra calories needed for these life stages.Dried ready grass hay is available from pet shops and feed stores or you can grow a tray of grass specially for the rabbit.

, These contain protein and fiber, essential for growing bunnies. Adult rabbits should get 1/8 cup for every 5 pounds of body weight. Rabbits are herbivores and even hay and vegetables can make them gain weight. Pellets are more concentrated energy than hay and should be fed sparingly.
Remember that your rabbit can't live on pellets alone. It is very important for the rabbit’s digestive tract to have long stem indigestible fiber in the form of Timothy or grass hay to prevent hairballs (trichobezoars) and to keep its digestive system happy and healthy. Chewing on long stem fiber also helps to wear down the rabbit’s continuously growing (hypsodont) teeth and prevent dental problems.Baby rabbits can have as many alfalfa pellets as they want until they are 6-7 months of age.

, Rabbits are famous for loving carrots, but these should only be given occasionally, as they have a high sugar content.Wash the veggies completely and, if possible, feed organic greens.


Provide leafy greens like spinach as well as collards and turnip greens. In addition mustard greens, cilantro/parsley, watercress, celery, and dandelion leaves are good vegetables for your rabbit.Two cups of vegetables a day is a good amount for most adult rabbits.
Introduce greens a little at a time to avoid digestive upset. Younger rabbits, 12 weeks an older, you can add in one veggie a week, about a half an ounce at a time to avoid disrupting the cecum.You can also feed your rabbit fruits like apples, blueberries, strawberries and bananas as special treats. Fruit is high in sugar, and should be fed sparingly, about 1 to 2 ounces per 6 pounds of body weight., Some vegetables aren't good for rabbits, including corn, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage, beans, peas, potatoes, beets, onions, kale and rhubarb. Also avoid feeding the rabbit with bamboo, seeds, grains, and any type of meat.


Human foods such as bread, chocolate, candy, dairy, and anything cooked should not be given to rabbits.Do not give your bunny light lettuce (such as iceberg). It may kill them by causing diarrhea and digestive upset of the good bacteria in the gut. Romaine is best, but make sure it's organic if possible, and wash it before offering it to your rabbit.
Never give rabbits grass cuttings, as this will cause serious health problems. You can allow a rabbit to eat grass that has not been sprayed with herbicides or pesticides and let the bunny choose what to eat on the lawn. However, avoid cut grass that has been heated and crushed by the mower. The process of cutting it will hasten the fermentation process and can lead to bunny digestive problems., Fresh water must always be available and changed daily. You can put it in a bowl or in a bottle of the sort used to feed hamsters, but rabbit size, although a bowl of water can be easily spilled. Make sure it never runs out and clean it out frequently to prevent contamination.


Make sure, if using a water bottle, that it is working properly and is not stuck open or closed.

, When you first get a rabbit leave it in its cage or hutch so it can get used to its home. Don't approach it straight away and start playing with it, as it hasn't really settled in yet and doesn't really know you and trust you yet.


Approach a new rabbit slowly and calmly so the rabbit doesn't get scared. Rabbits get scared very easy, can't see very well, so you should speak before approaching.

, Rabbits love to hop and run around, and to stay healthy they need the opportunity to do so for several hours every single day. You can play with your bunny or leave it to enjoy itself on its own (but keeping an eye on it), but don't neglect this important element of rabbit care.


Make sure your rabbit is either fenced in a pen that is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in the ground and 3 feet (0.9 m) out of the ground, or on a rabbit harness and leash.If you'd like to play with the bunny outside, make sure you're in a fenced-in area, and never leave it unattended.
Keep cats, dogs, and predatory birds away from the bunny at all times.

, They like to chew up cardboard boxes and old phone books. You can also try playing with your bunny by tossing a small ball or stuffed toy.

, Rabbits have fragile bodies and must be handled with care. Put a hand under its rear and front area and hold it close to your body. Never pick up a rabbit by his ears.Most rabbits enjoy being petted.Don't handle the rabbit roughly or pet it when it is clearly not enjoying it. Rabbits get stressed out easily when they aren't comfortable., Bonding with your rabbits can be slightly difficult to begin with, as they like being given treats and a little scratch behind the ears occasionally, but much to people's surprise, a lot of the time they enjoy being picked up less. This is because (especially when you first get them) they don't like being taken out of their comfort zone and this can leave them feeling exposed. Don't be disheartened if at the beginning they bite and scratch furiously every time you try. It is like this for virtually every new rabbit owner. Remember to be gentle and calm, and don't get angry at yourself or the rabbit. Keep working at it, when you do it successfully, give them a small treat such as apple to let them know they have done a good job.


When you have bonded with your rabbits, interact with them as much as possible. This helps to build a happy and great relationship which is very rewarding as rabbits are curious and playful animals, and will give out as much love as they get back.

, Rabbits are social animals and they enjoy playing with other members of their species. Caring for two bunnies isn't much harder than caring for one, so you might want to invest in a second pet so they'll both be happy.


Make sure the bunnies are spayed or neutered, especially if you're housing them in the same cage.
Be sure to get one that is a good fit with the rabbit you already have.If you think you want more than one rabbit, get litter-mates at the same time so they are the same age and similar size. Have the bunnies spayed or neutered right away so you don’t have unwanted litters and you prevent some hormonally driven behavior issues.

, You will need to introduce them slowly to prevent fighting. Rabbits can be territorial. A male and female or two females will likely be easier matches than two males, unless they are babies.


Have the rabbits in cages far apart on neutral ground for a few days and watch what they do. If they are thumping and agitated, place the rabbits further apart or in separate rooms for a few more days and then bring them back in eyesight. This would be a good time, when introducing them, to have yummy veggies to distract the rabbits but also increase the positive association of the presence of the other rabbit.
Gradually decrease the distance between the cages until they are next to each other, but still safe from “attack.” As long as they are peacefully co-existing in cages next to each other, continue this arrangement for at least a week.
Then, you can place them in exercise pens with a barrier between them and, if all is okay, allow the rabbits to meet without a barrier, under supervision for a short period of time. Place yummy greens in there, two to three piles, to reinforce all is good.When rabbits are laying down together or grooming each other, bunny life is good.

, Make sure the bunny is under supervision while you work. Empty the dirty hay or shavings from the cage, wash it with hot, soapy water, rinse it thoroughly, and let it dry. Fill it with clean hay or shavings.


You should wash out the water dish or bottle every day.
The litter box needs to be changed out every day, and thoroughly disinfected every week or so with a 10% bleach or 10% white vinegar solution. Rinse well and allow to dry. If the litter box is plastic or metal, you can also place it in the dishwasher.
Have more than one litter box, so that you can switch a clean one while the other box is dirty or in the process of being cleaned.
Rabbit urine is very alkaline and crystals can build up on the surface of the litter box and require the use of a descaling solution.

, Optimum temperature for rabbits is 61 to 72oF. If your rabbit is outside, provide plenty of shade and, if it gets really hot, bring them indoors to air conditioning or place frozen water bottles in the hutch to help the rabbit keep cool. Rabbits can die of heat stroke.


The rabbit’s ears are really the main temperature control part of their bodies.
If they were in the wild, the rabbit would go underground where it is cool to get out of the heat.

, Bathing isn't necessary, but you can use a soft-bristled brush to carefully remove hair every day or two. If you have two rabbits, you may notice them grooming each other.


Rabbit shampoo can be purchased if your rabbit is extremely dirty. Rabbits generally do not need to be bathed unless they get very dirty and are not able to groom themselves properly.
Discuss bathing frequency with your veterinarian, but in general, bathing a rabbit every 1-2 months, if at all, is plenty.

, Rabbits need annual checkups to make sure they're healthy. Many veterinarians who treat cats and dogs do not have expertise in treating bunnies, so you may need to find a vet who treats ""exotic"" animals.


Depending on where you live, your veterinarian may recommend vaccination for certain diseases like Myxomatosis if you live in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Myxomatosis vaccination is not currently recommended.Your veterinarian will do an examination and discuss their findings and make recommendations based on your rabbit’s current condition. Managing healthy dentition in rabbits may require anesthesia to fully examine the teeth and address any sharp points discovered on the back teeth (premolars and molars)., Knowing how your rabbit is feeling is extremely important if you want your bunny to be happy and healthy.


If a rabbit's ears are flat on its back, its eyes are bulging and it body is tense and hunched up, it is scared. If a rabbit is really terrified, it may be trembling and breathing heavily.
If a rabbit is very relaxed chilled out, it will be laying stretched out with its front paws in front of it, or it may have all its paws tucked beneath its body. It may also be laying on its side. Its ears may be flat on its back.
Sometimes, when a rabbit is extremely happy and excited, it will jump into the air and flick its body. This is called a binky. Many rabbits will run around very quickly before binkying. Sometimes, if a rabbit is feeling lazy, it won't do a proper binky, but will remain on the ground and do a sort of shuddery-flick.

Use styptic powder on your rabbit's nails, if necessary.",How to Cut a Rabbit's Claws," All rabbit's nails grow at different paces, so there isn't a concrete rule on how often nails should be clipped. Generally you should inspect your rabbit's nails once a month. If the nail curves at all, it is too long and it needs to be clipped. If you can hear your rabbit's nails hitting the floor when he hops, this is another indication that it's time to clip his nails.


Wild rabbits don't need pedicures — their claws wear down from digging, foraging, and other routine tasks. Domestic rabbits, however, do not use their claws so much, and it is your job to make sure that they don't grow too long or sharp.Rabbits have four nails on their rear feet. On their front paws, they have the four toenails, and then the dewclaw. The dewclaw sits slightly higher than the other toenails, on the inside of the paw.;
, People typically use both dog- and cat-claw trimmers to cut rabbit claws. Either option will do the job, so your choice is mostly a matter of personal preference. Make sure to choose a clipper that matches the size of your rabbit: if you have a very small rabbit, it will be much easier to cut its claws with a small set of clippers. Some nail clippers actually include a safety to ensure that you don't cut too much.Scissor-style clippers. These clippers are usually used to trim cat nails. As the name suggests, they look and work just like scissors. You may enjoy the freedom of motion and movement these clippers offer over the next style.
Guillotine-style clippers. These clippers are typically used for dogs because they can handle thicker nails. Much like a guillotine, these clippers have a circular hole into which you slip the nail. Squeeze the handle, and a blade cuts the nail. Guillotine clippers may give you slightly more control than the scissors.

, It's possible that if you cut your rabbit's nails too short, they will bleed a little. There is a blood vessel—called a quick—inside each of your rabbit's claws, and it may begin to bleed profusely if snipped. Styptic powder acts as a quick anti-clotting agent, so it is good to have some on hand when trimming your rabbit's nails.To stop the bleeding, simply grab a pinch of styptic powder and dab it on the source of the bleeding You can also use plain baking flour as a makeshift coagulant.You can buy styptic pencils or styptic powder in most drugstores. Styptic pencils make it easy to quickly deploy the anti-bleeding substance, and they may be easier to find than pure styptic powder.

, If you've never cut a rabbit's claws before, it might be hard for you to simultaneously restrain the animal and clip the nails. A partner can stabilize the rabbit while you work on the nails. If no one is available, you can still cut the rabbit's nails by yourself.

, If you rush the procedure, you might stress the rabbit out. If your rabbit is uneasy, it may panic and thrash around while you try to restrain it or trim it. Hold your rabbit in your lap, gently, and stroke it for a while before you start the cutting process. Wait for your rabbit to relax — it should be still, peaceful, and breathing deeply. If its eyes are closed or partially closed, it's probably comfortable.







, It's important to keep your rabbit still while you trim his nails; some rabbits may panic and thrash about if they feel threatened. Be gentle, firm, and reassuring to keep your rabbit calm and immobile. Rabbits are fragile, and you can hurt them if you restrain them too roughly. Hold him in place, and only apply pressure if he starts to struggle or tries to get away.









Never press down on the rabbit's back or spine. It is easy to break a rabbit's back — it does not take much.
If your rabbit panics and struggles, apply moderate pressure to his flanks. The flanks include the sides of his body and the haunches of his legs. This pressure mimics being squeezed together with other rabbits in a burrow, and it can help to calm a stressed-out rabbit.

, Place the rabbit on the edge of a table, then use your forearm to hold him against your body. You generally need to sit while doing this. Cup your hand underneath his chest, and use your elbow to keep his hindquarters pressed against you. Make sure your rabbit is comfortable in this position. Only hold him tightly if he begins to struggle.Try cradling your rabbit in your lap the way you'd hold a baby. Rest the rabbit's back upon your legs, and lay its head in the crook of your elbow. Use one hand to hold out a paw, and the other hand to clip.

, Cover up everything but the head, and make sure not to trap the ears. This will help keep the rabbit still and comfortable. . Once the rabbit is wrapped up, pull out one foot at a time and clip the nails. Place each paw back inside the towel before taking out the next one.


Hold the rabbit on your lap, or lay him onto a non-slippery surface: lay a towel or mat on top of a sofa or table. The important thing is that your rabbit is calm, comfortable, and immobile.
If your rabbit is afraid of heights, sit on the floor with him. You'll be able to tell that he is afraid if he squirms and visibly panics when you lift him to a high place.

, If you wrap your rabbit in a towel, your helper can restrain it on a surface by holding it gently on each side of its body.You may also ask your helper to pick up your rabbit and hold it while you do the clipping. If your rabbit has a habit of squirming, this may not be the best choice, because your partner could get scratched and drop him. This should work fine, however, if your rabbit tends to behave calmly around people.

, Like dogs and cats, rabbits have a blood vessel (the quick) inside each of their claws. If you cut the quick, your rabbit will bleed painfully and profusely — so make sure that you identify the blood vessel before you start chopping away. The quick usually looks like a red or dark spot inside the root of the nail.


If your rabbit has white or clear nails, you should be able to find the quick without much trouble. The blood vessel will be red or pink, so simply cut the white part of the nail above the red section.
If your rabbit has darker-colored nails, shine a flashlight on the nails to find the blood vessel. The quick should be a visible dark spot inside an otherwise translucent nail. Make note of the quick's location, and only cut the nail above that spot.If you still can't find the quick, you can estimate its location by feeling the claw. Pick a location about halfway down the claw, and use the dull end of your clippers to press down firmly. If your rabbit tries to pull his paw back or struggles, you're probably pressing the blood vessel. Try again slightly further up the claw toward the point. If the rabbit doesn't react, it's probably safe to start cutting from that point.

, It is better to make tiny, frequent cuts than to cut too much once the nails grow long. Clip your rabbit's claws every 4-6 weeks, depending on how active it is.

, Make sure that your rabbit is properly restrained. Start with the front nails: push away the fur around a claw, locate the quick, and determine where to cut. Make the cut quickly and neatly, with the least amount of movement possible. Clip the white or translucent tip of each claw, well above the quick. Before you clip, apply a slight pressure as a ""test clip"" — if the rabbit recoils its paw, there's a good chance that you're about to clip the blood vessel.









You may need to flip your bunny over onto its back to trim the rear paws. Do this very carefully so that you don't hurt or disturb the rabbit. Bunnies with enough exercise may not need their back nails trimmed — hopping, digging, and general activity wear the nails down naturally.
Remember to clip the dewclaw on each of the front paws. If the dewclaw grows too long, it may get caught on something and hurt your rabbit.

, Find the quick and clip the nail for each paw until you're finished. Be methodical, and take your time. Take a break between feet if your rabbit is struggling or the procedure is taking a while. This is especially important if you are using a towel for restraint — unwrap your rabbit for a few minutes to keep it from overheating. Try using treats as a reward to make your rabbit more comfortable.








, Mistakes happen, even if you've done your best to locate the blood vessels in the nail. Rabbits are prone to sudden movements, and you may accidentally lop off more than you plan to. Don't worry — act quickly and calmly, and the cut will heal.

, Clip them if necessary.

, When you do the belly and legs, put the rabbit on its back in your lap. Use a towel to create a ""hammock"" to make your rabbit more relaxed. If you use a grooming table, put a non-skid surface, for instance a carpet, on it.

,,,,, You can use a cat brush with bristles.

, Pull it apart with your fingers. Then comb out the mat. If your rabbit is severely matted, work with the mats an hour a day. Just make sure you don't tire your rabbit too much. You need to use clippers if your rabbit has a lot of mats. Don't clip more than 20 minutes. Then let your rabbit rest for 10 minutes before you move on. Look for any sign of stress in the rabbit. If your rabbit is stressed, stop and continue the next day. If the rabbit has a mat very close to the skin, let it outgrow so it can be removed with safety.

Brush the rabbit to remove bits of dirt.,
Spot clean the rabbit when necessary.,
Use a mat splitter for clumped fur.,
Trim your rabbit's nails.,
Do not submerge the rabbit in water.",How to Bathe Your Pet Rabbit1," Many rabbits loved to be brushed, and it's a great way to help them keep their fur clean. Buy a brush made specifically for rabbit fur (often finer-toothed than brushes intended for dogs). Every few days, gently hold your rabbit while brushing its fur. Focus on areas that have bits of bedding or dirt. When you're finished, wash the brush and dry it.


Be sure to handle the rabbit very gently. Not all rabbits enjoy the experience of being brushed. If yours seems startled or upset by brushing, stop the process and try again later.
Long-haired rabbits require a little extra fur care. Keep your rabbit's fur trimmed to an inch or so so that it won't become tangled. This will help cut back on shedding and keep the fur clean.;
, If your rabbit hops into a mud puddle, you might want to help it get clean by doing a little spot cleaning. Luckily you can spot clean your rabbit without using water. This is highly advisable, since many rabbits go into shock when they get wet. Sprinkle some cornstarch over the dirty spot and use a fur comb to work out the dirt. Keep going until the fur is clean.


Even if your rabbit is completely covered in mud, it's better to use this dry cleaning method than to dip your rabbit in water. Working section by section, carefully break up the mud clumps, comb out the fur, and use cornstarch to work out the smaller bits of dirt.
If absolutely necessary, use water to clean small areas of fur. Dampen a washcloth with warm water and use it to moisten the fur; try not to let the water reach the rabbit's skin. When the patch of fur is clean, use a hair dryer on the coolest setting to gently blow the fur dry. Normal rabbit body temperature ranges from 101F – 103F. Because rabbit skin is very delicate, and rabbits are sensitive to heat, never use a blow dryer on a setting higher than “warm,” and constantly monitor the temperature of the air on the bunny’s skin by placing your hand in its path.

, If your rabbit has mats in its fur, the best tool for the job is a mat splitter. This breaks up the mat gently without harming the rabbit. Avoid using a scissors; rabbits are jumpy, and it would be easily to accidentally cut your rabbit while you work., This grooming task is necessary for rabbits that spend most of their time indoors. When rabbits don't have the chance to wear down their nails by digging around outside, the nails can grow long and sharp. Use a rabbit nail trimmer to take care of your rabbit's nails, or ask your veterinarian to do it for you at your next appointment.


Do not have your rabbit declawed. Rabbits are highly prone to infection, and declawing leaves their paws open to bacteria.Make sure the rabbit's living space is always kept clean and dry to promote good foot health.

, It bears repeating that dousing a rabbit with water can cause it to get hypothermia or go into shock, both of which can be fatal. Some unique rabbits don't mind getting wet; a few rabbit owners have even been surprised that their beloved bunnies like to swim. However, if your rabbit has not exhibited an affinity for water, it's best not to risk getting it wet. Rabbits are very sensitive and even one water bath can cause permanent damage."
"
Cleanse around the anus with a cotton ball dipped in water.,
Purchase a rabbit-safe shampoo at a pet store.,
Use soap only if absolutely necessary.,
Blow dry the fur on the lowest setting.,
Use this method for cleansing dried urine (urine scald) as well.,
Keep fur trimmed short so the rabbit won't get damp.",How to Bathe Your Pet Rabbit2," Rabbits have scent glands around their anus, and the excretion can build up and begin to smell after awhile. To clean this area, simply dip a cotton ball or cotton swab into warm water. Swab the area to remove all traces of excretion. If you repeat this often enough, no further cleansing should be necessary.Your rabbit may grow nervous and jumpy while you clean this area. Have a partner help you by holding and stroking the rabbit while you cleanse the scent gland area.
Rabbits also have scent glands under their chins, but these do not produce a bad smell and do not need to be cleaned.

, These are safe for rabbits and is much safer than using regular soap.

, If the excretion has been left to build up for a long time, you may need more than water to clean it. Fill a small bowl with warm water and add a few drops of gentle baby shampoo or castile soap. Dip a cotton ball in the solution and gently cleanse around the rabbit's anus, taking care to wet only the area that needs to be cleaned. Repeat until the area no longer has traces of excretion.Make sure you don't leave any traces of soap on the rabbit. This can cause skin irritation.
Do not use cold water; make sure it is sufficiently warm. Otherwise the rabbit may get cold and go into shock.

, It's not a good idea to let the rabbit's body air dry, since the longer the rabbit is wet, the higher the risk of a problem developing. Use a hair dryer on a warm, low setting (not the cool or hot setting) and make a few passes over the wet part of the rabbit's behind. Continue until the fur there is completely dry.


Realize that your rabbit may get scared very easily of the sound of a blow dryer. If this is the case, make sure you have a super absorbent towel on hand that is soft. Rub your rabbit until s/he is dry.

, Some rabbits experience incontinence, the inability to hold their urine properly. Older rabbits or rabbits with an underlying medical problem commonly experience this issue. Dried urine can build up on the fur, causing a bad smell and leaving the rabbit uncomfortable. If this happens to your rabbit,


Clean the area using a cotton ball dipped into water.
Dry the area thoroughly with a hair dryer on a warm, low setting.

Again, your rabbit may get frightened. Use a super soft towel or blanket instead if necessary.


Take your rabbit to the vet to seek treatment for the underlying problem causing incontinence.

, Long hair around the anus and underside of the rabbit can trap moisture close to the rabbit's body. Keeping the fur in these areas shaved or trimmed short helps the skin underneath dry faster and keeps the area clean. Ask your vet how to best maintain the fur on your particular breed of rabbit."

Choose a flea solution formulated for rabbits.,
Apply the suggested dosage between the rabbit's shoulder blades.,
Use a flea comb to remove fleas and nits.,
Clean the rabbit's living area thoroughly.,
Do not use flea bombs or other external chemicals.",How to Bathe Your Pet Rabbit3," If you notice that your rabbit has fleas, talk to your vet about using a flea solution made for rabbits. Advantage, Program and Revolution are all designed specifically to get rid of fleas on rabbits without damaging their delicate skin or otherwise impacting their system.Do not use a solution made for cats or dogs, even if it says it is also safe for use on rabbits. It's better to use one of the formulas made just for rabbits.
Never submerge your rabbit in a flea dip of any kind, even if the packaging suggests it's safe to do so.

, Follow the instructions from your vet or on the packaging to apply a small amount of the liquid solution to the area between your rabbit's shoulder blades. This is the safest spot to apply it since the rabbit can't reach back and scratch or lick it away.


Most flea solutions require multiple applications over the course of a month.
If you're not sure how much to apply, talk to your vet before taking action.

, If you prefer a natural solution, an old-fashioned flea comb does the job. In order to use this method, it's important to have a good relationship with your rabbit, since combing out fleas and nits can be quite time consuming. Have a partner hold your rabbit while you meticulously comb through its fur to pick out fleas and nits. Be sure to cover the rabbit's entire body.


Check the rabbit again after a few days. In most cases you'll need to repeat the process two or three times to account for new nits hatching. After a few weeks, the fleas and their nits should be gone.
In between cleanings, sanitize the flea comb by boiling it in water for five minutes.

, If you found fleas on your rabbit, they have probably infested its living space (and yours) as well. Sanitize the rabbit's cage and change the bedding several times during the treatment period. Boil the rabbit's dishes and toys for five minutes to get rid of all traces of fleas, and wash blankets in very hot water. If fleas have infested your carpeting, do the following:


Cover the carpet with a layer of diatomaceous earth or baking soda. Let it sit there for eight hours or overnight. This dries out the fleas' eggs.
Vacuum the powder and dispose of the vacuum bag.
Repeat the process every few days until all traces of fleas are gone.
When your rabbit is safely in its cage, you can also catch live fleas by plugging in nightlights close to the floor. Place a bowl of soapy water under each light, and the fleas will jump in. Remove the bowls before letting your rabbit out to play.

, Rabbits are quite sensitive to chemicals, and the heavy pesticides used in flea bombs are no exception. Avoid using any type of chemical solution around your rabbit. If you feel using a flea bomb or spray is the only way to get rid of the fleas, keep your rabbit in a safe location during the application process. Clean the room thoroughly with water and white vinegar to get rid of traces of the pesticides before reintroducing your rabbit to the area."

",How to Get Rid of Sticky Bottoms in Rabbits," Make sure there aren't too many pellets in your bunny's diet, so it is not overweight. Overweight bunnies can't reach their bottoms to clean off the soft droppings, also known as cecotropes, to stay healthy.;
, Give your bunny more hay. Putting more hay in your bunny's diet will help it digest food easily since hay is a good source of fiber and essential nutrients for your bunny. For an older bunny timothy hay is better. For a younger bunny alfalfa based hay is the best kind. If this doesn't work, it may be necessary to eliminate pellet food altogether.

Brush your rabbit at least once a week.,
Make your rabbit comfortable.,
Adjust your brushing regimen for the time of year.,
Understand the important of brushing.,
Remove more fur with water.,
Remove the last bit of excess fur.",How to Groom a Rabbit1," The first function of this is removing loose fur. Long-haired varieties like the Angora need to be brushed every day or two. You only need to brush short-haired breeds like the Netherland Dwarf once a week.Gently and thoroughly brush the rabbit's back with a soft-bristle brush. This will bring loose hair to the top of the coat.


Always brush in the direction of the fur, and do not brush too hard. Be careful not to hurt the rabbit!
Use a pin brush for basic brushing, and a wide-toothed comb for rabbits with long fur. A bristle brush makes a good once over to smooth the fur and get any extra shed hair. A mat rake will help remove tangles that are too big for the other brushes.
Brush using a pin brush or wide toothed brush, depending on your rabbit's fur. When the brush stops picking up shed hairs, use the bristle brush to collect the rest.;
, Brushing is the first step to making it feel at ease, but there are additional techniques. Lay a towel over your lap and gently support it along the length of your thighs. Rabbits love to lay on their backs while you slowly brush their tummies and underarms. This can send rabbits into a relaxed, sleep-like state. It might even make little noises of satisfaction., Brush your rabbit more often when it's shedding. Rabbits shed about every three months. They tend to shed most heavily in the fall and spring, and comparatively lightly during the summer and winter.Rabbits shed a few different ways.


Some rabbits take a few weeks to lose their old coat of fur. You may need to brush your rabbit every few days or multiple times each day depending on its coat length and how quickly it sheds.
Other rabbits shed their entire old coats within a day. It is especially important that you do not neglect these rabbits once they start shedding.

, Rabbits lick themselves like cats to keep clean, and they can get hairballs if they consume too much hair. Unlike cats, however, rabbits are physically incapable of vomiting. Hairballs can cause stomach obstructions and quickly become life threatening by blocking the stomach exit. Remove loose hair as soon as possible or your rabbit will do it during grooming., Wet your hands with the spritzer bottle and gently stroke your rabbit from behind the ears all the way back to the tail. Make sure to do this several times, stroking the sides and belly of the rabbit as well. Your wet hands will help remove the excess fur that your brush brings to the top of the coat. You can often remove a very large percentage of the loose hair by just pulling it out with your hand.

, A wire-slicker brush is the best way to get the last bit out. This is especially important during shedding season, when the rabbit is both losing and producing more fur. Use your wire brush to remove mats and tangles, then use a softer brush to stroke along the grain of the fur. Never brush the fur against the grain, or the wire brush will severely damage your rabbit's fur.

Prepare your rabbit for the bath.,
Clean the rabbit's rear end.,
Clean your rabbit's scent glands.,
Wipe the fur clean.,
Bathe in moderation.",How to Groom a Rabbit2," Moisten a clean towel with a grooming spray. Use the towel to wipe dirty spots on the rabbit. Do not use soap on your rabbit, unless the product is specifically made for rabbits.

, Use a clean towel or wet-wipe to wipe off any crusted feces or debris. This will help prevent any illnesses that might result from unsanitary conditions. If there are feces stuck to your rabbit's fur, it is usually because your rabbit is overweight and unable to clean itself. Take your rabbit to a vet and ask about weight-loss options., Find these just above their bottom when you are holding them upright. To clean the scent glands out, get a cotton bud and wet it with warm water. You may need someone to help you hold the rabbit securely upside down. Gently swab the scent glands until any discharge comes off. If you have any trouble doing this, ask your vet to do it for you. , Go over the rabbits' coat with a pet-friendly wet wipe. If your rabbit tends to be oily, try pet-friendly wipes made for removing oils.

, Only bathe your rabbit if it is extremely dirty or has soiled itself. Fill your sink or a small tub with clean, warm water, and slowly wash your rabbit without dunking it completely. Wash everything except for the face and the ears. Then, soap up your rabbit with the rabbit shampoo. Make sure to scrub the legs and bottom to remove all the feces. Then, drain your sink, and rinse your rabbit off.

Be gentle with your rabbit.,
Keep the rabbit's eyes free of fur and hay.,
Clip your rabbit's nails.,
Trim your rabbit's fur.,
Check for fleas.",How to Groom a Rabbit3," Pick your rabbit up carefully, and hold it tightly so that it cannot thrash around. Restrain the rabbit by wrapping it snugly in a towel, like a burrito. Leave only the head exposed. A struggling rabbit is difficult to handle, it could even break its back. Rabbits are very social creatures. You should have few issues with handling your bunny as long as you spend quality time bonding with it.

, This will help prevent the irritation and potential infection of your rabbit's eyes. Use moist cotton balls to gently clean the area around the eye. If your rabbit has a heavy amount of fur around its eyes, try using a mascara brush or a small flea comb to comb back the fur from the eye.Never directly touch the rabbit's eye. This can cause more harm than good.
If there is something in the rabbit's eye, take it to a veterinarian or look for a rabbit-approved eye wash solution. You may be able to wash the surface of the eye with focused water drops from an eye-dropper.

, Rabbits need their claws trimmed every 4-6 weeks. The claws are like fingernails, and never stop growing. Most indoor rabbits won't wear their claws down enough, so they need to be clipped before they grow out of hand. Hold your bunny on its back like you would cradle a baby, then gently clip its nails. Be cautious not to cut too far, as this will cause immense pain and bleeding in the rabbit. You can buy a special rabbit nail clipper to make this process easier, or you can (very carefully) wield a standard human nail clipper.


Try to make it a good experience with treats so your rabbit will be more comfortable with you handling its feet.Make sure to only trim the white part of the nails. Leave the pink roots (the blood vessels) alone! It helps to shine a light from underneath the claw so you can ensure that you don't clip the blood vessel. If you clip the blood vessel apply styptic powder or flour to help clot the bleeding. Apply pressure for about a minute.

, If your long-haired rabbit that keeps developing hairballs and matted fur, try cutting the fur down to an inch or so. You can use scissors or a pair of standard trimming shears. This way, the rabbit won't get cold, but it will be much less likely to develop loose hair.Do not trim the fur all the way to the skin. Fur offers natural protection against heat, cold, and anything that may injure the rabbit., If your rabbit seems to be scratching itself more than normal, try splaying its fur to check for fleas. If you do notice any fleas, run through the rabbit's fur with a flea comb to remove them.You may need to take more drastic measures like a spray or a flea collar.

Get your rabbit annual veterinary exams.,
Assess you rabbit's health regularly.,
Get to know your rabbit's temperament.,
Give your rabbit toys and amusements.,
Spend a lot of time with your rabbit.",How to Care for Palomino Rabbits," You will want to purchase a well-constructed and spacious cage for your Palomino rabbit to live in when its not allowed to roam. The ideal cage size varies depending on the size of the rabbit, but a minimum size for the cage should be 12 square feet.The cage should be wide enough that your rabbit can stretch out fully, high enough that its head doesn’t touch the ceiling when it stands on its hind legs, and long enough for the rabbit to hop 3-4 times.;
, The cage should also have enough room for all of the necessary supplies: a cat litter box, food and water dishes, and a box for the rabbit to rest in. When you buy these supplies, make sure they fit easily into the cage.


You have two choices to provide water in: a sipper bottle or a ceramic water dish. While sipper bottles are easier to keep clean, rabbits seem to like to drink out of ceramic dishes.
Only use litter made from pelleted paper, as sometimes rabbits will snack on their litter. Pelleted paper won’t hurt an adventurous eater and will pass through the body without harm. This can be purchased on-line or through a pet store which carries rabbit supplies.

, If you are not comfortable letting your rabbit roam in a room, you still need to provide it with the ability to exercise. Use a puppy exercise pen to let your bunny hop around in to get exercise.


Make sure the rabbit can easily access its cage when it is out and about, and also place one or two extra litter boxes in the room or pen, so your bunny always has an easy toileting area.
When you first bring your rabbit home confine it to its cage until you know for sure it will use the litter box.After your rabbit is reliably using its litter box to go to the bathroom in you can let it out of the cage and into your rabbit proof room or pen for exercise.

, You don’t have to rabbit proof your entire house. Generally people chose one or two rooms where the rabbit will have access, like a living room or other room where the family hangs out.

, Before you even bring your Palomino rabbit home, you will need to rabbit proof your house or your bunny will destroy things with its constant chewing. Cover cords with hard plastic tubing (split lengthwise and tuck cords inside), spiral wrap, or any of the available concealers to keep them out of sight. Rabbits will chew exposed electrical cords and, if so, they can burn or electrocute themselves in the process., A rabbit’s teeth continuously grow so they need to constantly chew to keep the teeth at their proper length. Rabbits will chew on any and all wooden objects around them, including trim, door edges and furniture legs. They may also decide to chew up your wallpaper, sheetrock, and carpet up to as high as they can stand on their back legs.


Watch your bunny carefully when it is out and give it an acceptable chewing object if it tries to go after these things., Items you can keep out for your bunny to chew on include fresh branches (aspen, willow, apple), alfalfa cubes, hay, rolled up cotton towels, paper towel cardboard tubes stuffed with dry hay, or untreated fresh pine boards.These should be readily available to the rabbit, so that it chooses these over your furniture or your cords.

, Your rabbit needs to be able to drink water whenever it desires it. Make sure to always put out fresh water daily. Also remember to clean the water and food bowls once a week (at minimum) with a good scrubbing in warm water and dish soap.

, A rabbit has special dietary needs that need to be strictly adhered to or it will become seriously ill. The most important requirement is appropriate fiber with plenty of moisture, to keep its gut working properly and smoothly.


Timothy hay is frequently sold for rabbits. Alfalfa and clover hay has too much protein and calcium to feed to a rabbit, unless it is a treat., Throw out any uneaten or spoiled pellets before putting fresh pellets in the rabbit’s dish. Pellets are made so that they are balanced nutritionally for the rabbit. Young rabbits can have unlimited access to pellets while they are growing, however, a Palomino adult rabbit can have ¼ to ½ cup of pellets a day. , These can include lettuce (not iceberg though), bok choy, arugula, broccoli stems and leaves, and carrot tops are great fiber and water sources for a rabbit. Feed up to 2-3 cups a day to a full grown Palomino rabbit. However, slowly introduce new greens to a rabbit so it doesn’t cause diarrhea., There are foods that can cause severe intestinal upset and may kill a rabbit. Never feed these to a rabbit:


Human foods, other than leafy green vegetables.
Corn and other grains or seeds. Corn hulls can also hurt the rabbit.
Only give small amounts of starchy vegetables, like carrots and small pieces of fruit. These are considered treats not a main part of the diet.

, If you do not plan on breeding your rabbit, you should have it neutered (male) or spayed (females) when it is 4-6 months of age. Neutering or spaying helps prevent a number of serious issues in rabbits including:


Preventing unwanted pregnancies if you have rabbits of opposite sexes.
Decreasing negative behaviors, such as urine spraying and aggression.
Lowering the risk of life-threatening illnesses, like uterine cancer and infections.

, You will need to bring your rabbit to the veterinarian once a year for a check-up. While your are there remember to bring any concerns that you have up with the veterinarian.


One key thing the veterinarian should do is to check your rabbit's teeth. They will need to make sure the teeth are wearing down appropriately. Some rabbits have misaligned teeth that do not wear evenly that can lead to overgrown teeth that cut into the lip or make the rabbit unable to eat properly.
If the teeth need trimming leave it to the veterinarian to clip them. Otherwise you risk cracking your rabbit's tooth, which can become infected or abscessed.

, It is your job to watch out for signs of ill health or injury. Between veterinary visits watch for signs of illness, some of which may be very serious. If your rabbit exhibits any of these signs, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible to have it examined and treated:Eye or nasal discharge
Drooling (which may indicate overgrown teeth)
Not eating or drinking
Swellings, reddened skin, or fur loss anywhere on the body
Not hopping or moving like normal or unable to use back legs
Diarrhea or a lack of droppings for a day
Dark red urine
Fever of more than 105 °F

, Some rabbit's love to hang out with their humans, while others do not. While it is important bond with your pet and let it warm up to you, you should also accept its natural temperament to some degree.


For example, if your rabbit doesn't like being picked up, then don't try to do it unless necessary.

, You don't even have to buy them, as a rabbit can be fully engaged by a cardboard box or a cardboard tube. For example, cardboard boxes with small holes cut in the side make a good hiding spot for your bunny. They can also be thrown away and replaced cheaply when the bunny is done chewing on them.


Cardboard boxes can also be put together to make a fun tunnel for your rabbit to run through.
A small, thick cardboard box stuffed with hay makes a fun chew station for your rabbit.
Cardboard rolls from paper towels or toilet paper also make fun toys for rabbits.

, Due to its friendly nature, make sure you spend time each day with your Palomino rabbit so it doesn’t become too lonely. This is a very important part of keeping it healthy and happy.


Sitting with your rabbit while it explores and nibbles on hay, brushing it to remove loose fur, tossing toys away from it to chase, or just stroking it will let the rabbit know it is a loved and valued household member.

Brush your rabbit regularly.,
Trim the rabbit’s nails.,
Clean your rabbit’s eyes.,
Clean the ears.,
Clean out the scent glands.",How to Keep a Rabbit Clean1," Use a soft brush to run through your rabbit’s fur to remove loose hairs as well as dirt and other debris. This will help keep your rabbit’s coat looking shiny and new. Plus, rabbits love being brushed, so it can be pleasant bonding time with your pet.After brushing, you may notice small tufts of fur sticking out of the coat. Go ahead and pull them out, your rabbit will not mind.
Rabbits will groom themselves regularly, though they cannot vomit like cats, so they are susceptible to hairballs if they swallow too much hair. Removing loose hairs will help prevent your rabbit from choking.Brush more frequently during shedding times, which occur about every 3 months.;
, Your rabbit’s nails will keep growing, so check them once a week to see if they need trimming. They will probably need to be clipped about every month. Nails that are too long become uncomfortable for the rabbit, and can cause toe, nail, or foot injuries, or gait issues.You can do this on your own with a pair of rabbit nail clippers. Make sure your rabbit is lying on its back with the feet up so they are easy for you to get to, and gently clip the nails on one foot at a time. Make sure your rabbit is secure so it can’t kick or scurry away. Once you are finished, you can give your rabbit a treat as a reward.
When cutting, a good rule of thumb is to trim the nail to the same length as the fur. Hold up the rabbit’s foot, and trim off the edge in one motion. You shouldn’t cut a nail more than once.
If your rabbit has sensitive nails, and struggles some, lightly close the clippers on the area you wish to cut. If your rabbit reacts, move a little further down the nail and away from the skin.
It can be helpful to shine a light underneath the nail so you can see where you are cutting. You don’t want to clip the blood vessel at the base of the nail.
Baby rabbits will have very sharp, but very small nails. These are probably best trimmed with a emery board instead of the full-size clippers.

, Watch your rabbit’s eyes to keep an eye out for watery eyes or eye discharge. In addition to being a sign of other problems, discharge on your rabbit’s cheeks can cause the skin there to become chafed and have the skin peel off. If you notice anything, a clean tissue should be enough wipe this away. Just be careful not to touch your rabbit’s actual eye.If there is a lot of gunk, or it seems like your rabbit has a lot of tears, take it to the vet to make sure there isn’t a more serious problem.

, Check your rabbit’s ears for waxy buildup. If you notice any, you can remove it by softly rubbing the ear with a cotton swab. Make sure you don’t push the wax into the ear, and do not reach into the ear canal.If you have a problem with wax in the ears, your vet may also recommend some wax removal products that you can apply.Make sure you use a cotton ball and not a smaller swab like a q-tip. If your bunny twitches or jumps during cleaning, you can accidentally push it into the ear, puncturing an eardrum and causing your rabbit to go deaf., Rabbits mark their territory using scent glands under their chin and around their anus. The ones on the rear can get some buildup, which can be uncomfortable for your rabbit, and smell. Lay your rabbit on its back to get a clear look at its rear area. Dip a cotton swap into mineral oil or warm water, and gently dab around the gland to loosen the buildup."
"
Identify any soiled areas.,
Hold your rabbit so its problem areas are easily reached.,
Remove stains with a baby wipe.",How to Keep Your Rabbit's Fur Clean and Untangled1," Spot-cleaning your rabbit is the recommended method for keeping its coat clean. The first thing you’ll need to do is identify any areas of its coat that are dirty. In general, a rabbit’s problem areas are their backside, tail, feet, and belly because these are all places they may be unable to reach easily on their own. Look for dirt, food, and feces stains, as well as wet spots, which are often urine., Once you have identified any soiled spots on your rabbit’s coat, place your rabbit in a position that is both comfortable for them and that makes it easy for you to reach the soiled areas.


Most of the time, you will need to position your rabbit on its back. To do so, either hold your rabbit belly-up in one arm or sit on the floor with your legs outstretched and lay your bunny belly-up on top of your legs. Make sure you are able to hold your rabbit securely in whichever position you choose.
If the soiled area is on your bunny’s back or sides, you can simply lay a towel out on the floor or a large table and sit your rabbit on its feet to clean its fur.Ensure your rabbit’s back is cushioned and its neck and back are supported in whichever position you put it. This will help prevent any injuries., Now that you have your rabbit in a position that lets you easily access the stains on its fur, gently rub the fur and skin with a baby wipe to remove any dirt, food, feces, or urine. After you have targeted all the soiled areas, give your rabbit an all-over wipe-down with a clean wipe.


Look for baby wipes that are fragrance-free, alcohol-free, and hypo-allergenic. In addition, choose one that contains aloe and Vitamin E. These will be gentle on your rabbit’s sensitive skin."

Make sure your rabbit needs a bath.,
Lay your rabbit down belly up.,
Apply Baby Cornstarch Powder.,
Brush out the remaining pieces.,
Clean up the remaining powder.,
Give your rabbit a wet bath.,
Take your rabbit to the vet.",How to Keep a Rabbit Clean2," The only time you need to bathe your rabbit is if it has a messy bottom, which comes from having runny stool or urine leakage. The residue on your rabbit’s rear is both unsanitary and uncomfortable, and you’ll need to bath him to get it off., You’ll want to make sure the soiled parts of its rear are easily visible and accessible. The rabbit can be on a bunched up towel sitting on your lap, or lying comfortably on the floor.Make sure you cushion your rabbit’s back and neck so that they are well supported in case he decides to start kicking.
While your rabbit is lying there, stroke it smoothly and talk soothingly to keep things calm and relaxed.

, Put it all over the affected areas, and gently rub it into the messy parts of the fur down to the skin. As the powder coats the dried poop, it should fall out of the skin easily.Do not use powders that contain talc, as it is a respiratory irritant, and can even cause cancer in rabbits.

, If there are a few stubborn pieces that rubbing won’t get out, use a fine-toothed flea comb to pull them out. Just be careful not to pull too hard, as rabbit skin is very delicate, and can tear easily., Once you are finished, pat your bunny’s bottom to get any excess powder off. If you need to, a small handheld vacuum would work too. Use the vacuum to pick up whatever falls off to clean up the area as well., If the dry bath doesn’t do the trick, you’ll need to provide a wet bath. This can be a tough procedure, and you will need to be very careful. Rabbits do not like going into water, and can go into shock if they are put into it. Make sure you don’t give your rabbit a wet bath unless it is absolutely needed.Fill a bathroom sink or small basin with about 2.5 inches of lukewarm water. Mix in a tablespoon of hypoallergenic, non-medicated shampoo. It is best to get a shampoo specifically intended for rabbits, and not one used on people.Slowly lower your rabbit’s rear into the water. Gently wash the solution over the affected areas, then rinse with lukewarm water.
Dry off your rabbit’s bottom. First use a soft towel, being careful not to rub too hard. Then use a blow dryer set on low to finish drying. Keep one hand close to the rabbit’s skin so you can feel if the air is too warm.
Clip fur away from the irritated skin, then apply a soothing balm.

, After you have cleaned off your bunny, go to the vet for an examination. Incontinence could be a sign of other health problems, and the vet will need to determine the cause."

Create a rabbit habitat.,
Train your rabbit to use a litterbox.,
Sweep the habitat floor.,
Clean up stains.",How to Keep a Rabbit Clean3," Even if you allow your rabbit to roam freely around your house, it is a good idea to have an area for the rabbit to stay when you are not around. This should be a safe, nesting area, so include a bed, toys, a soft towel or carpet to sit on, and a litterbox. This kind of regular restricted space is also good for cleaning., Rabbits are fairly clever and easy to house-train. Get yours to restrict the number of places it goes to the bathroom, which will keep the habitat cleaner, and make clean-up easier for you.Get a small tray with low walls so your rabbit can get into it, and fill with paper or untreated wood chips, then hay. Make sure you keep the tray near places your rabbit usually uses the bathroom so it’ll get used the box as a place to go. If you notice your rabbit squatting, carry it over to the box.
Remember to clean and disinfect the tray at least once a week.
Do not use oil-treated wood chips like pine or cedar, or cat litters.

, Get excess hay, fur, or other items off the floor, which will make a cleaner area for your rabbit to stay in. Throw away the excess stuff to get it out of the room., Look for stains on floors or rugs. If you notice any, use a vinegar spray on the spot, then wipe up with a dry paper towel. If the stains are really set in, or have otherwise ruined the rug, throw it out and replace it."
"
Apply baby cornstarch powder.,
Work the powder around the soiled area.,
Slide the debris out of the fur.,
Pat the powdered areas.",How to Keep Your Rabbit's Fur Clean and Untangled2," You may not be able to remove dried-on messes, like mud or your rabbit’s droppings, by spot-cleaning with a baby wipe. Giving your rabbit a dry bath can help take care of these stubborn, dried-on messes. The first step in giving your rabbit a dry bath is to sprinkle baby cornstarch powder liberally over these areas.Do not use a baby powder that contains talc, or talcum powder. This can be harmful to rabbits., Use your fingers to work the powder around the soiled area, into the fur and down to the skin. Coating these messes with powder should allow them to break free from the fur and slide off.

, Use your fingers to gently pull down on the dried debris, removing it from your rabbit’s coat. Rabbit skin is surprisingly delicate, so keep your hand pressed against your rabbit’s skin at the top of the soiled area to keep from tearing it.


For especially stubborn messes, use a fine-toothed comb to gently work the debris out of the fur after you’ve applied the cornstarch powder. To do so, start at the top of the stain (closest to the skin) and lightly tease the dirt away from the skin. Place your hand on your rabbit’s skin to keep from pulling too hard., Use your hand to pat down the powdered areas to remove any remaining cornstarch. In addition, use a hand-held vacuum to vacuum the air around your bunny to remove any powder from the air and keep your bunny from ingesting it.You can also use a soft wash cloth or microfiber cloth to clean any remaining powder from your rabbit."

Work shampoo through your rabbit’s fur.,
Drain your sink.,
Fill your sink with clean water.,
Lower your bunny into the clean water.,
Dry your rabbit.,
Use a hairdryer to finish drying.",How to Keep Your Rabbit's Fur Clean and Untangled3," If your bunny is particularly soiled, you can give it a “butt bath.” This is a wet bath that focuses mostly on their backside and belly (if needed). Wet baths can be very stressful for rabbits, however, so do this only in situations where spot-cleaning and a dry bath didn’t work. First, fill a clean bathroom or kitchen sink with approximately 2 ½ inches of warm water.It may be helpful to use a sink that has a hose attachment for rinsing.
You can also use a small kitty litter tub, a baby bath, or even a slanted paint pan. Use whichever works best for you and your rabbit.
Place a non-slip mat on the bottom of your sink, tub, or pan. This will help keep your rabbit from slipping on the smooth, wet surface., Next, add a tablespoon of rabbit-safe shampoo to your water and mix it well. Rabbits have extremely sensitive skin so using a shampoo made specifically for bunnies is important., Wrap one arm around your bunny, underneath its elbows, and hold it firmly so that its head and shoulders are pressed against your chest. Use your other hand to hold underneath your rabbit’s back legs.


It is important that you are gentle, but firm when holding your bunny. You need to make sure it isn’t able to twist or wiggle too much. Pay attention to its actions to make sure you’re not hurting it., Lower your bunny’s hind end into the sink until its back feet touch the bottom. At this point you can remove your hand from underneath its back legs., Use one hand to gently rub your bunny’s hind end and belly with the soapy water. Work the shampoo through its fur and down to the skin.


Do not wet above your rabbits belly unless absolutely necessary, as this will be extra stressful for it.
If your bunny is especially dirty, you may have to drain and refill your sink with fresh soapy water a few times to get them completely clean. , Once the soiled areas of your rabbit are clean, drain the soapy water from your sink and rinse any residual shampoo from it., Next, fill your sink with clean, warm water to rinse the shampoo from your rabbit’s fur., At this point, lower your rabbit’s back end into the clean water. Use your hand to gently rub its fur in order to remove the shampoo from it.


You may have to empty and refill your sink multiple times to get all of the shampoo residue out of your pet’s fur. Do this until the water remains clean and shampoo-free.
You can also use a small hose to rinse the shampoo from your rabbit’s fur., Lift your rabbit out of the bath and place them on a towel or other soft surface where it will have some traction. Using your hands, gently wring the water out of your rabbit’s fur as best you can. Gently pat or rub your rabbit with a towel to get additional water out of its coat.


Be very gentle when wringing the water from your rabbit’s fur and when using a towel to dry it. Pulling or rubbing too hard can damage your rabbit’s skin.Microfiber towels are a good choice for drying your rabbit. They are softer and more absorbent than most other towels., Finish drying your rabbit’s fur with a hairdryer. Use the dryer on a medium-warm setting, never hot. Hold the blow dryer at least six inches away from your rabbit at all times and try to keep your hand near where you are blowing the heat to further monitor the temperature.


You can use a fine-toothed comb to separate the fur while you’re drying it to speed up the drying process."
"
Brush your rabbit every two to three days.,
Brush your rabbit daily when it is shedding.,
Trim your rabbit’s fur as needed.",How to Keep Your Rabbit's Fur Clean and Untangled4," Like cats, rabbits lick themselves to self-clean. However, unlike cats, rabbits cannot vomit so any hairballs your rabbit ingests will stay in its stomach, blocking the stomach exit and causing serious health issues. Brushing your rabbit regularly can help cut down on the amount of loose fur it ingests, in addition to keeping its fur mat-free. Short-haired rabbits need to be brushed every three days to prevent hairballs and tangles in their fur. Long-haired rabbits should be brushed every day.


Use a bristle-brush instead of a metal-toothed brush, as this will be gentler on your rabbit’s skin. Look for a brush made specifically for rabbits.
You can follow up brushing with a rubber grooming tool or another hand-held finishing tool to help get any additional loose hairs. A damp washcloth will also work to remove loose hairs.How much your rabbit needs brushed depends on their breed. As a general rule, the longer the hair, the more often you need to brush., Rabbits shed approximately every three months. During this time, you’ll generally need to brush your short-haired rabbit once a day and your long-haired rabbit multiple times a day.


The rate at which rabbits shed varies. Some rabbits will shed their coats over several weeks, while others shed it all within a few days. Pay attention to the shedding patterns of your rabbit and adjust how often you brush them accordingly. For example, rabbits that shed over the course of several weeks may need brushed only once a day, but rabbits that shed over a few days need to be brushed multiple times per day., Short-haired rabbits don’t usually need their fur trimmed, but long-haired rabbits often do. If you have a long-haired rabbit, it is a good idea to keep its hair trimmed to one inch in length. This will help prevent mats and cut down on shedding.


Don’t trim the hair around your rabbit’s feet. Doing so can cause your rabbit to get sores from a lack of padding.
It is suggested that you keep the fur on your long-haired rabbit’s belly and between its legs trimmed short or even shaved. This hair is especially vulnerable to mats and tangles.
You can use either scissors or electric small animal clippers to trim your rabbit’s hair. Be very careful, however, because rabbits’ skin is very delicate and you can easily cause a serious injury if you cut them with the scissors or clippers.
It is best to have someone help you hold your rabbit still if you choose to trim its fur. If you are trimming its belly, between its legs, or its backside, have one person hold the rabbit straight up and down with its back pressed against the person’s chest. They should have one hand placed under the front legs and the other holding the back legs to prevent the rabbit from kicking and hurting itself."

Go to a professional groomer.",How to Keep Your Rabbit's Fur Clean and Untangled5," If your rabbit has a mat in its fur, you’ll first want to try and work the mat out using a mat splitter or mat rake. Use these tools to carefully separate the mat, combing it out a tiny section at a time.


Press your hand on top of the skin at the top of the mat to keep from tearing your rabbit’s skin.
It may take you several sessions to get the mat out. Be patient and gentle to keep from hurting your bunny., If you’re dealing with an especially difficult mat, you may have to shave your rabbit in order to remove it. The most difficult mats to remove are sheet mats, or those that form a solid block in your rabbit’s coat. If you encounter a mat like this, shaving may be your only option. To shave your rabbit, purchase a good pair of clippers that will allow you to have enough control to get into tight spaces.


Ask your veterinarian or groomer for recommendations on a good pair of clippers., Because of the delicate nature of your rabbit’s skin, it might be a good idea to take your bunny to a professional groomer in order to remove any stubborn mats. They will have the right tools and knowledge to get the mats out without cutting or irritating your rabbit’s skin."

Take him to the vet for regular checkups.",How to Care for Mini Lop Rabbits," Mini lops are small creatures, but they like to have plenty of space to hop around. Look for a cage or hutch designed specifically for rabbits. It should be 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) wide and 2 feet (0.6 m) deep. The bottom and sides should be made of wire, not glass, because the bunny will need plenty of fresh air to flow through the cage.If you decide to go with an outdoor hutch, place it in a shady spot so that the rabbit doesn't overheat during the summer. You might need to heat the hutch during winter if the temperature drops low. It's also important to keep potential predators away. Foxes, dogs, cats, and birds of prey are all quite dangerous to a rabbit.;
, If you have a wire cage, first line it with wooden planks so that the rabbit's feet won't get caught, then cover the wood with hay or blankets. This way your rabbit will be able to build a soft, cozy nest.


Use only hay that is approved for use in a bunny cage. Never use old hay or hay from a source you don't know and trust, and never use pine or cedar wood shavings. The fumes can hurt rabbits' internal organs.

, If you place a small litter box in the mini lop's cage, he will relieve himself in that same spot instead of going elsewhere, making cleanup much easier. You can find a small, rabbit-sized litter box at pet stores. Line the litter box with newspaper, then place hay or newspaper pellets on top.

, Many owners of mini lops like to take their rabbits out to play. Limit your rabbit's play space to one area that has been thoroughly ""rabbit-proofed"" so that the mini lop won't get hurt. Remove electrical cords and wires, fragile or heavy items that could fall over, and other items you don't want nibbled.

, Rabbits both nest in and eat loads of hay, so you should put lots of fresh hay in the cage every day. Timothy hay and brome hay are good choices for rabbit feed. There's no need to set the hay in a dish; just sprinkle it all around the cage., Rabbit pellets contain essential nutrients like protein and fiber. When your mini lop is still a baby, give it unlimited pellets. Adult mini lops can get 1/8 cup of pellets for every 5 pounds of body weight. Throughout the rabbit's life, provide fresh vegetables to enhance its diet. 2 cups a day of spinach, collard greens, and turnip greens is the best choice, but you can also feed your rabbit the occasional carrot.


You can also feed your rabbit a small amount of fruit, such as cut up apples, bananas and strawberries.
Do not feed your rabbit the following vegetables, which can hurt its stomach: corn, tomatoes, cabbage, iceberg lettuce, potatoes, peas, onions, beets and rhubarb.
Never feed your rabbit the following foods: seeds, grains, meat, chocolate, dairy, and any other cooked ""human"" food.

, Rabbits' teeth grow continuously throughout their lives, and it's important to provide them with something to chew on so they won't get long and uncomfortable. You can buy rabbit chews at the pet store, and give your rabbit a new one every week or so.

, Rabbits need access to plenty of fresh water. Buy a water bottle designed for a rabbit cage (it'll look similar to those used in hamster cages) or set out some water in a small dish. Make sure you change the water every day and clean out the dish frequently.Make sure you put the bottle low enough for the mini lop to reach.

, When you're handling a rabbit, the first rule to remember is that you should never pick one up by the ears. A rabbit's ears are fragile and sensitive, and this could cause permanent damage. Instead, place one hand under his rear area and the other between his front legs. Bring the rabbit close to your chest and hold him there securely. When you're ready to put him down, crouch down and gently rest him on the floor.


Do not drop your rabbit or let him jump to the floor from your arms. The impact could hurt his legs.
Do not lift your rabbit from the scruff of his neck. Rabbits don't have extra skin there like cats do.

, Mini lops are pretty sturdy as far as rabbits go, but they don't like being handled roughly. Pat your mini lop gently on the head, back and sides. Never toss him, push him or pull him by the legs, ears or tail. If your bunny is afraid, don't force him to play.

, Rabbits naturally love to hop around, and they need to be able to do so for a few hours every day to stay healthy. Take your bunny out of his cage and play with him every day. If you have an enclosed outdoor area, you can let the bunny play by himself, but don't let him out of your sight for too long.


It is extremely dangerous to walk a rabbit on a lead! If a rabbit is scared, the lead can get wrapped around their neck. Rabbits can be scared to death as well. A lead is uncomfortable, scary and dangerous for your rabbit!
Never let your bunny play outside the cage completely unattended. Keep cats, dogs, and other predators away.

, Don't let your bunny get bored in his cage. He needs interesting items to explore and chew on. Put a few cardboard boxes or old phone books in the cage for him to chew on. You can also play with your bunny using a soft cat toy or ball.

, Bunnies love to play together, and your mini lop will be happier with a friend. Be sure to get a second mini lop, and not another type of rabbit. And make sure both bunnies are spayed or neutered so you don't end up with a litter of babies on your hands.

, A rabbit's cage or hutch should be cleaned out every week. Have a friend supervise your bunny while you give the cage a thoroughly cleaning. Throw out the old hay and newspaper, wash the cage with hot, soapy water, dry it, and fill it with clean hay and newspaper.


Clean out the pellet dish and water bottle every few days.
Change the litter box every day.

, Bunnies don't like to be bathed, since they take care of that themselves. However, they do well with light brushing. Use a soft-bristled brush to take care of your bunny's fur every once in a while. Mini lops molt when they're adults, and when you see this happening, you can help remove the fur using a wire brush.


If your rabbit gets dirty outside, you can wash him using rabbit shampoo. Never use human shampoo on a rabbit.
If you notice your rabbit's nails getting too long, you may need to trim them.

, It may be difficult to find a vet who will look at your rabbit, since some animal vets only treat cats and dogs. Look for an ""exotic animal"" vet if your local vet won't see your rabbit. Take him in for an annual checkup and any time you notice symptoms of illness, which could include the following:


A runny nose or eye
Refusal to eat
Red urine
High temperature
Diarrhea
A permanently tilted head
Lumps or abscesses under the fur

Have the rabbit's cage set up before you bring it home.,
Make sure your home is rabbit proof if the rabbit will be living inside.,
Bring your bunny home.,
Feed your rabbit.,
Brush your lionhead rabbit daily.,
Get your lionhead rabbit proper preventative health care.,
Be vigilant for signs of ill health.",How to Care for Lionhead Rabbits," Don't rush into a purchase, and never ever buy on impulse because you happen to see a pretty lionhead rabbit in a pet store. Do your homework first and think through whether you can provide adequate lifelong care for a lionhead. Know that they can live up to ten years, so this is a long term commitment., Be aware that the initial purchase price of a lionhead can be small relative to the cost of ongoing maintenance. There is the purchase cost of runs and hutches, bedding, and feedstuffs. There is also the cost of veterinary treatment, possible nail clips and teeth filing, and preventative healthcare, such as products to prevent fly strike (when flies breed on the skin) and vaccinations.Also, there could be unexpected expenses, such as if your rabbit falls ill and you rack up veterinary bills.

, Shelters are a good option and it is entirely possible that you will find a lionhead that needs rehoming. Large charities work hand-in-hand with vets, and so your new rabbit is likely to have been checked over and passed as healthy.


Many charities often get litters of unwanted rabbits handed in, when the owners thought they had two rabbits of the same gender, whereas they had a male and female, so there is every chance of finding the bunny you want at a shelter.

, Contact The British Rabbit Council (BRC) or The American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) for a list of breeders in your area.Make an appointment to visit a breeder and see their rabbits. Check that the rabbits are kept in spacious conditions, with plenty of resources such as clean bedding, food, shelters, and toys. The rabbits should look alert and inquisitive, and have bright eyes free from discharges, sleek glossy coats, and not runny noses, coughing or sneezing. Take a look at the pellets in the run and make sure they are dry, rather than runny or diarrhea.

, Be aware that pet store rabbits have been shipped and may be suffering from stress, which can predispose rabbits to disease and illness. It is also difficult to get an appreciation of the conditions in which the rabbit was bred, and hence know if this was done in an ethical and kind way.


Encouraging unscrupulous breeders is undesirable as it perpetuates unnecessary distress for the animals.

, It is good to keep rabbits as indoor pets because outdoor rabbits can be ""forgotten"" about and neglected more easily.However, one disadvantage of keeping a rabbit indoors is its lack of exposure to grass, sunshine, and fresh air, which are all part of its basic needs.


Get a run that is predator-proof and escape-proof to keep the rabbit safe outside. Consider building the run yourself.
You may want to compromise and just put your rabbit outside in good weather, or else train it to wear a harness so you can take it out but keep control.

, If the cage is in the house, it should be set up in an area where the rabbit will be able to see you, but can have peace and quiet as well. Your rabbit's cage should have an area for it to bed down full of bedding, as well as a dish of food and a bowl of water.


Your lionhead should never be in a cage with soft wood (cedar or pine) bedding because it can cause respiratory problems. Choose a safe, recycled brand of bedding or use a towel that is soft.
Buy the cage large enough so the bunny can move around. It should be at least 8x the length of your rabbit. Even better than a cage is a large pen or bedroom, and the best of all is free-range! You can make a rabbit safe room and put a gate in the doorway to keep bunny in. Rabbits are super easy to litterbox train. Put a dish for his food in the cage, and don't forget about the water! The cage at left is not suitable for a rabbit, it is too small. The run is also quite small, a shed with an attached 10 foot run is best. Make sure you pave the floor so bunnies can not dig out and around it so predators can not dig in. Large flat paving stones work well.
If you have more than one lionhead be sure to bond them before putting together unless they are baby siblings. Be sure to get them neutered before sexual activity begins, usually by four months old.

, Rabbits make excellent house pets but you do need to prepare. Most importantly know that rabbits gnaw and chew, and will happily chew on electrical cables, with disastrous consequences. Lie down on floor levels and look for anything the rabbit could pick up and chew. Remove all hazards or make them safe, such as placing cable protectors over electrical wires.

, Give your bunny a few days to settle in. Talk with it frequently, but don't take it out of the cage. Also don't let children touch it either.

, Talk to your vet about the right diet for your rabbit. In general, your rabbit should be fed a limited amount of pellets (about 1/8 cup per pound of body weight), fresh greens, and unlimited amounts of Timothy hay (or alfalfa hay if the rabbit is less than seven months old).

Treats such as apples, carrots, bananas, etc, can be fed in small quantities (a couple of tablespoons per day).
Always make sure your rabbit has water all the time.
As a rule of thumb, any one food will be high in a particular nutrient. To avoid the rabbit eating excessive amount of any one nutrient, which could result in a health problem (for example excessive oxalate in carrots that can cause bladder stones), never feed the same fresh food two days running. By providing variety in their diet, you avoid this pitfall.
Never, on any account, feed your rabbit human foods, such as sweet biscuits. The rabbit's metabolism is not designed to cope with sugar and it will induce diabetes in your rabbit.
Make sure your rabbit has plenty of fiber to help prevent against wool block (hairballs), keep teeth healthy, and groom your lionhead daily for the same reason.

, The lionhead has a soft downy coat, and if it grooms and swallows excessive amounts of soft fur this can lead to bowel obstructions. To avoid this, and to get some great bonding time with your bunny, brush your lionhead daily.


During the time of year that your lionhead is shedding most (spring and autumn), groom it more often.
Pay particular attention to the longer fur, or 'mane,' between the rabbit's ears. It is important to keep this hair in order. Comb it through to avoid knots and tangles, but you should be gentle around the delicate parts of the rabbit's face, especially its eyes.
Check your Lionhead's rear end every day. Fly strike happens when urine or fecal soiling occurs on the rabbit's rear. This attracts flies, that then lay eggs in the soiled fur. Those eggs hatch out into maggots, which then burrow into the rabbit's flesh.
To avoid this, check the fur for soiling every day, and immediately clean the rabbit's rear with damp cotton wool if it is soiled. Be vigilant for small white dots stuck to the fur (fly eggs) and remove them immediately. If you see maggots, contact your vet for an emergency appointment.

, Your rabbit should be checked by a rabbit-friendly veterinarian at least once a year. Vaccinations are an important part of protecting your rabbit's health, and do vary from state to state and indeed between countries, so speak to the veterinarian about what is appropriate for your area. Vaccines are currently available to protect your rabbit against HVD (hemorrhagic viral diarrhea) and myxomatosis. HVD is caused by a hardy virus, which you can walk in on your shoes, so even if you have a house rabbit, you should consider vaccination.


In the UK, vets routinely give a course of worming treatment against a parasite called Encephalitozoon cuniculi which causes neurological damage, kidney failure, and eyesight problems in middle to older aged rabbits. It is thought that around 75% of rabbits carry this parasite, although not all become ill from it. If you live in the UK and this is a concern for you then speak to your vet about treatment with a product containing fenbendazole.Be aware that female rabbits are at high risk of developing uterine cancer. With this awareness, vets now recommend routine desexing of female rabbits at a young age, from around 5 months., Warning signs of a problem include a wet chin (dental issues), watery eyes, or a discharge from the eyes (infection or overgrown tooth roots), weight loss, being unusually withdrawn, or diarrhea. Also check that your rabbit is eating regularly. If a rabbit doesn't eat for 24 hours its gut tends to ""go to sleep"" and a vicious circle of decline starts.


If you are worried immediately contact your vet.
Lionheads should weigh between 2.5 and 3.8 pounds (if they are purebred). If it weighs 4 pounds or over, it is either overweight or pregnant (or is a mixed breed of rabbit that one parent was not a dwarf). To tell if your rabbit is over or underweight, you can run your hand over its spine, gently pressing down. If you can't feel the spine at all, your rabbit is overweight. The spine should feel smooth, with rounded bumps. If the bumps feel almost jagged and very noticeable, the rabbit is underweight.

Spay or neuter your rabbit.",How to Care for Jersey Wooly Rabbits," Your Jersey Wooly rabbit will need a cage with a minimum size of one square foot per pound of full grown rabbit. The Jersey Wooly rabbit averages around three pounds, so your cage needs to be at least three square feet in area. The width should be one and a half times the length of the fully grown rabbit, while the cage length should be three times the length of the bunny.That is the room just for the rabbit itself.The cage will also need to have room for a litter box, her food and water dishes, and a box for her to rest in, so aim for at least six square feet of floor space in the cage.
Make sure not to place your rabbit in an aquarium or a cage with solid walls. This restricts airflow and can harm your rabbit.;
, Because your Jersey Wooly rabbit has small feet, the wrong floor can cause her to get injured. Your Jersey Wooly can get her feet stuck in a wire floor. Make sure to give the bunny cage a solid floor instead of a wire floor. Wire floors may also cause sores to form on the bottom of your rabbit’s feet.Carpeting or wooden flooring along the bottom of the cage works well, as does a piece of fleece fabric. Fleece won’t block the digestive tract if the rabbit eats it.

, You need to make sure you provide your bunny with a sleeping area. Your rabbit will eat the bedding, so make sure you make it from a material that is safe for her to eat. Safe materials to make bedding from include meadow or timothy hay, natural fiber blanket made from natural fibers, or other organic products.Provide enough bedding so she can move it around and burrow in it.


Don’t use harmful materials for bedding, such as straw, cardboard, newspaper, wood shavings, sawdust, cat litter, or cedar or pine products.

, Your rabbit needs a place to go to the bathroom. Put a litter box in your bunny’s cage. For your small Jersey Wooly rabbit, you can use a medium sized plastic cat litter pan. Place fresh hay inside the litter box and rabbit-safe bedding under the hay.The litter box needs two sides: a kitchen side and a bathroom side. Your rabbit will nibble hay in her litter box, so the kitchen side will contain clean hay away from the bathroom side.


You should confine her to this cage until she is consistently using the litter box.

, Rabbits are naturally skittish and like to hide from predators, loud noises, or other things that scare them. You need to provide hiding places for your Jersey Wooly rabbit. This can be any enclosed space away from sounds, lights, and drafts. Make sure the hiding place has two openings, otherwise your rabbit won’t use it.


Good hiding places are cardboard boxes and tunnels made out of cardboard tubes.
You can also purchase rabbit hiding places from the pet store. Hiding places can be anywhere in your house as long as they are away from high-traffic areas., Choose one room to let your rabbit roam around freely in. This room needs to meet all your rabbit’s needs, so it needs a litter box, a hay feeder, food dishes, and water bowl.


Inside the room, you can set up cardboard houses, bunny condos, puppy pens, or rabbit cages., One of a rabbit’s favorite activities is chewing. In the bunny room, cover up wires or remove them completely. You can place electrical cords in hard plastic tubing split lengthwise with the cords tucked inside. Place cords behind woodwork or trim, wrap them in spiral wrap or use concealers to keep them out of sight., Since your rabbit will love to chew, she will chew on trim, door edges, furniture, wallpaper, sheetrock, and carpet if you let her. Protect the room by putting boards over places your bunny can chew that she shouldn’t.To keep your rabbit from burrowing up into the furniture, put cardboard or 2x4s under it. Cover the wall with clear plastic panels to keep the rabbit from chewing.
To discourage your rabbit from chewing on inappropriate objects, give her an acceptable chewing toy if she tries to chew on something else.

, Make sure your rabbit has a lot of toys and objects to chew on. You can leave out alfalfa cubes, cardboard tubes stuffed with grass hay, fresh apple, willow, or aspen branches, or rolled up cotton towels.


You can make homemade toys for your rabbit, like a cardboard box stuffed with hay, cardboard rolls from paper towels, gift wrap, or toilet paper, or multiple cardboard boxes lined up to make a rabbit tunnel. You can also stuff a paper sack with shredded newspaper (and a few treats) to give your rabbit a digging adventure.

, Hay is the food your rabbit will eat the most of during the day. The Jersey Wooly rabbit needs high quality grass hay. Grass hay should be fed in unlimited amounts. Don’t feed your rabbit alfalfa hay as a meal or part of her daily diet. It should only be fed to a rabbit as an occasional treat.Give your rabbit fresh hay every day. Never let it get wet or spoiled.

, Rabbits also eat pellets, which contain all the nutrients a rabbit needs. An adult Jersey Wooly rabbit can have ⅛ to ¼ cup of pellets daily.Give your rabbit fresh pellets every day.

, Your rabbit needs green leafy vegetables provide fiber and moisture to her diet. You can feed your rabbit bok choy, broccoli stems and leaves, carrot tops, dandelion greens, and all kinds of lettuce, except iceberg lettuce. Feed your Jersey Wooly ½ to 1 loose cup of these a day, spread over three to four servings., You can give your bunnies treats daily, but in limited quantities. Because the Jersey Wooly rabbit is so small, feed her only a tablespoon of treats a day. Treats include fresh fruit and starchy vegetables, like carrots.Don’t feed your rabbit any other human foods, especially corn or other grains.

, Your rabbit needs access to a water dish in her cage. Rabbits can drink from a sipper bottle or a ceramic dish. Rabbits tend to prefer ceramic dishes.Make sure there are multiple water dishes in your rabbit room.

, Bunnies like clean spaces. Make sure to keep your rabbit’s bedding clean. Check it regularly, once every day or two, to make sure it doesn’t need changing. If your rabbit goes to the bathroom in the bedding, she needs a larger area to roam and move around.


Clean the litter box every day. A rabbit will avoid a dirty litter box. Throw everything away in the litter box, wash the box, and replace the bedding.
Unclean bedding can lead to fleas, flies, and other pests, which can be harmful to your rabbit.

, Your Jersey Wooly rabbit will live a healthy life as long as a proper diet is fed to her. However, take your rabbit to the veterinarian once a year for an examination. The vet will check your rabbit’s teeth to make sure they are wearing properly or see if they need to be trimmed.If your rabbit refuses to eat or drink, has diarrhea, does not poop for a day, has eye or nasal discharge, drools, shows swelling, has reddened skin or fur loss anywhere on the body, does not hop or move like normal or is unable to use back legs, has dark, red urine, or a fever of more than 105 °F (40.6 °C), you need to take her to see the vet., Rabbit’s should be neutered (if male) or spayed (if female) at four to six months of age. This has many benefits, such as eliminating unwanted pregnancy, aggression, urine spraying, and reproductive system cancer and infections."

Use baby wipes.,
Put your rabbit in a comfortable position.,
Wipe the bunny on the soiled area.",How to Clean Your Rabbit Without Bathing It1," Baby wipes are the easiest method of cleaning your rabbit without bathing it. Use baby wipes that are fragrance-free, alcohol-free and hypo-allergenic for best results. You want a wipe that is strong enough to clean your bunny without tearing, and which is soft so that it won’t hurt your bunny’s skin.


Some wipes come fortified with vitamin E or aloe. These are fine to use on a rabbit.;
, You might find it easiest to do the spot-cleaning by holding the rabbit in your lap, or between your knees as you sit on the floor. You’ll want to hold your bunny in a position that allows you to clean his dirty parts, which will usually mean he should be held belly-up.You can use a towel to help you hold the bunny in place.
If the area that requires cleaning can be reached by keeping the bunny upright, you can simply place him on a towel on the floor.

, Using the baby wipes, gently rub away any debris, soil, or residue from the bunny’s fur. If needed, clean around the bunny’s bottom or privates, which might be stained with urine if your rabbit is having incontinence issues.Try to get the skin as clean as possible, but always be very gentle. The bunny’s skin is very delicate.
When you’ve cleaned away the debris, give the rabbit another quick rub with a clean wipe.

Provide some dark leafy greens.,
Let your New Zealand rabbit have a treat now and then.,
Make sure that your New Zealand rabbit always has water.,
Prevent your New Zealand rabbit from eating certain foods.",How to Care for New Zealand Rabbits1," Hay is a staple food for New Zealand rabbits. Hay provides the essential nutrients that your rabbit needs and it also helps to wear down her teeth, which never stop growing.Make sure that your New Zealand rabbit always has access to an unlimited supply of fresh hay.Give her new fresh hay least once per day and check now and then to see if she needs more.


Never give your New Zealand rabbit corn, or other grains or seeds. Just stick to hay.
Timothy hay is a great choice as primary feed for your New Zealand rabbit.;
, Plain pellets can also provide your New Zealand rabbit with some nutrition, but rabbits only need a small amount of pellets each day. Limit your rabbit’s pellet intake to about ¼ cup per day.


For a bigger rabbit or for a rabbit that is not gaining weight properly, you may need to offer more than ¼ cup per day. Check with your veterinarian for a recommendation based on your rabbit’s size and other needs., Dark leafy greens also provide your rabbit with a good source of nutrients and your rabbit will enjoy nibbling on these. Try to give your New Zealand rabbit a couple pieces of dark leafy greens each day. Some dark, leafy greens that your rabbit may enjoy include:basil
cilantro
collard greens
parsley
kale
mustard greens
turnip greens

, New Zealand rabbits like to chew on crunchy veggies, fruits, and seeds, so try to offer a crunchy treat once per day. Some good choices for your New Zealand rabbit include:apple slices
carrot slices
hulled sunflower seeds

, Your New Zealand rabbit always needs to have access to fresh, clean water. A sipper bottle is ideal for your rabbit because it will not spill or get dirt or feces in it like a water dish. That means that you won’t have to deal with a toppled dish of water or a dish that your rabbit has contaminated with feces.

Purchase baby cornstarch powder.,
Put your bunny in bathing position.,
Apply the cornstarch powder.,
Use a fine-tooth comb if needed.,
Pat the powdered areas when you’re finished.",How to Clean Your Rabbit Without Bathing It2," Baby cornstarch powder can be found in the baby supplies section of your grocery store. Only baby-safe cornstarch is safe to use on your rabbit.Never use powder that contains talc, as talc causes respiratory irritation in bunnies. It may even be carcinogenic.
Don’t use commercial flea powders or pesticides.

, Keep his belly turned up towards you. You may want to hold him in your lap on a towel for this bathing. Make sure he’s well cushioned and comfortable.


Stroke your bunny to reassure him that he’s safe.
You can keep him laying on the floor as long as he’s in no danger of running away. You want him to remain still and calm while you bathe him.

, Focus especially on any areas that are soiled. If your bunny has a messy bottom, you’ll want to make sure plenty of cornstarch is sprinkled around this area.Gently work the powder through the thick hairs and down to the skin. Make sure that you’re covering any soiled area well.
This will likely feel good to your bunny, like petting. Talk to him reassuringly throughout the process.

, Most of the debris should fall away as you work the cornstarch through the rabbit’s fur, but occasionally you’ll need to comb the fur to clean it. Be careful to do this very gently.A flea comb will be best for this purpose, as its teeth are very fine.
Don’t tug at knotted masses or hairs. Instead, work gently from the outside, teasing loose any matted material.

, Rubbing the bunny well should leave behind all excess cornstarch, soil, and loose fur. The cornstarch bath usually only takes a few minutes, and your bunny will be clean at the end.You might want to have a small hand-held vacuum cleaner nearby so that you can immediately clean up the excess matter.
Rabbits don’t usually mind a dry bath and will remain quiet through the process.

Take a good look at the cage.,
Throw away the old bedding.,
Scrub the cage with a brush.",How to Clean Your Rabbit Without Bathing It3," If you have a stinky rabbit, chances are you need to give the cage a good cleaning. Because rabbits are known for their careful grooming habits, a bad-smelling bunny is often picking up those smells from a poorly kept cage.Bunnies will do their best to keep themselves clean and well-groomed.
Your bunny’s cage should be washed out once a week, and droppings cleaned out daily.
A rabbit’s bedding can smell strongly of urine and feces if it hasn’t been changed in a while.

, You’ll want to completely replace the bedding with fresh material. Pellet-shaped bedding will work best for a rabbit, with a newspaper base to prevent the bunny’s feet from injury.Never use pine or cedar shavings for bedding, as these shavings will alter a rabbit’s ability to respond to medication.Metal or plastic cages are best. Wood can degrade with time.

, Don’t use strong cleaning products, such as Lysol or another disinfectant, as these leave residue that may be toxic to your rabbit. Instead, use a mild vinegar-water mix.For best results, place the cage in the sun to dry. Sunlight will naturally disinfect your rabbit’s cage.
Every few months, you may want to clean the cage with water in which a very small amount of bleach (1 part bleach to 5 parts water) has been dissolved.

Choose a cage for your New Zealand rabbit.,
Add a hiding place.,
Include a litter box.,
Keep your New Zealand rabbit in your house.",How to Care for New Zealand Rabbits2," New Zealand rabbits are medium size, and they need plenty of room to hop and play. Make sure that you provide your New Zealand rabbit with a cage that is at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) long by 24 inches wide by 18 inches (45.7 cm) high.Do not get a wire bottom cage because these types of cages can hurt your rabbit’s feet. Choose a cage that has a solid metal bottom instead.Puppy playpens also work well as rabbit enclosures. A puppy playpen will give your New Zealand rabbit lots of space to hop around.
You may also consider getting a special rabbit condo enclosure.These types of enclosures have lots of hiding places and tunnels for rabbits to explore and enjoy.

, Rabbits like to hide now and then to feel more secure. Try adding a cardboard box or a wooden nest box to your rabbit’s cage so that she can retreat if she feels nervous or frightened.A cardboard box provides a nice hiding spot for your New Zealand rabbit and your rabbit can also move the box around and chew on it.

, If you don’t want you New Zealand rabbit urinating and defecating all over the cage, then you can place a small litter box in the corner of your rabbit’s cage. Line the litter box with a few sheets of newspaper and then lay some hay over the newspaper. Dump out the contents of the box once per day and refill with new materials.If your New Zealand rabbit is not using her litter box, then try moving the litter box to the corner that she is using as a toilet spot.
Try placing a few litter boxes around your house so that your rabbit can use them as needed.
Never use cedar or pine shavings in your rabbit’s litter box. These materials may cause your rabbit to develop respiratory and liver problems., If you keep your rabbit outside, then she will be at risk of premature death for a variety of reasons. Rabbits do not do well outside because they are prone to overheating and hypothermia, they frighten easily, and they require companionship. Even if predators cannot gain access to your rabbit in her cage, she may have a heart attack from fear.
A pet rabbit kept outside may develop antisocial behavior issues, such as aggression, so keeping a rabbit outside will make it into a poor pet.

Make sure that your New Zealand rabbit gets at least two hours of exercise every day. To allow your rabbit to run and hop enough to get exercise, you will need to let her out of her cage to at least once per day.Keep your rabbit indoors when you let her out to exercise. You may even want to keep her confined to one room. For example, you could keep her in your bedroom or put up a couple of baby gates to make sure she stays in a specific area of your house.

, New Zealand rabbits will chew on any cords they encounter. This can kill your rabbit and ruin your electronics, so it is important to stop your New Zealand rabbit from doing so.


Try hiding electrical cords with some hard plastic tubing or spiral wrap. Another option is to just keep all of the cords off of the ground so that your rabbit cannot reach them., Make sure that your rabbit does not chew on your walls and furniture. A New Zealand rabbit will chew on any wooden object. This may include wall trim, door edges, chairs, and table legs.


Keep in mind that your New Zealand rabbit might also try to chew on other things such as a rug, some loose carpeting, or a bit of loose wallpaper.If you catch your rabbit chewing on something that he should not be chewing on, don’t get mad or punish him. Just pick him up gently, move him somewhere else and provide him with a cardboard box or a piece of a raw carrot to distract him from the other object.

, Your New Zealand rabbit’s teeth will never stop growing, so she needs to keep chewing on things to wear them down. Otherwise, your rabbit may need a visit to veterinarian to have her teeth trimmed. To avoid the need to trim your rabbit’s teeth, make sure that she has plenty of things to chew on at all times.Try giving your New Zealand rabbit some alfalfa cubes, untreated pine boards, cotton towels, cardboard boxes, or apple branches., To keep your New Zealand rabbit healthy, you will need to take him to see a veterinarian once per year for a checkup.

runny eyes and nose
drooling
fever of 105 °F (40.6 °C) or more, Unless you plan to breed your New Zealand rabbit, you should get him or her neutered or spayed. Spaying and neutering your rabbits will prevent unwanted litters and it will also help to keep your rabbit healthy. If you do not spay or neuter your rabbit, then he or she may act out with hormonal behaviors, like fighting or spraying. If you have a female rabbit that is not spayed, then she will have a much higher risk of getting uterine cancer as well.If your rabbits are not spayed and neutered, then make sure that you keep them separated.

, Your New Zealand rabbit will benefit from a once weekly brushing session. Otherwise, you may end up with lots of hair on your furniture, carpet, and clothes.

Look for a cage with a minimum size of one square foot per pound of full grown rabbit. For a Holland Lop rabbit, that is at least a four foot square cage. They are very active, so make sure your rabbit has plenty of run to run around.The width should be one and a half times the length of the fully grown rabbit, while the cage length should be three times the length of the bunny. For example, if the rabbit is 12 inches (30.5 cm) long, the width should be 18 inches (45.7 cm) and the length should be 36 inches (91.4 cm). That is the room just for the rabbit itself.


You will want it to also have room for a litter box, her food and water dishes, and a box for her to rest in, so aim for at least twice that amount of floor space in the cage.;
, Make sure to give the bunny cage a solid floor instead of a wire floor. Wire floors can cause sores on the bottom of your rabbit’s feet, and small rabbits such as the Holland Lop can get their feet stuck and get injured. Place a piece of carpeting or wooden flooring along the bottom of the cage.


You can also use a piece of fleece fabric, because it won’t leave long strings in the digestive tract if the rabbit eats it.
You can also put newspaper under the cage, just don’t use newspaper as bedding., There are advantages to either habitat. Rabbits that live indoors usually have longer lives and are happier and more social. Rabbits that live outdoors are skittish, susceptible to temperature and weather changes, predators, mites, flies, fleas, and other complications.


If you want to keep your rabbit inside, but have limited space for her to play, you can set up an outdoor cage for her to run around and play.
Outdoor hutches are easier to clean and give the rabbit more room to play and run around. If you play your hutch outside, make sure to keep it away from direct sunlight, drafts, damp areas, humidity, extreme temperatures, or loud noises. The hutch should have a roof to protect her from the rain. Make sure the hutch is protected from predators, including dogs and cats.

, The cage needs bedding, which will act as your rabbit’s sleeping area. The bedding should be edible, since your rabbit will eat it. Meadow or timothy hay, natural fiber blanket, pelleted paper, or other organic products make good bedding materials.Make sure to give her enough so she can shape it, move it, and burrow in it how she wants.
Check the bedding daily and clean as necessary. Your rabbit shouldn’t be going to the bathroom in the bedding, so if this occurs, you need to give the rabbit a larger area to roam, exercise, and move around. Unclean bedding can lead to fleas, flies, and other pests.
Don’t use straw, cardboard, newspaper, wood shavings, sawdust, cat litter, or cedar or pine products as bedding. It can harm your rabbit.

, Place a box inside your bunny’s cage to act as a litter box. For a small Holland lop rabbit, a medium sized plastic cat litter pan will be sufficient. It is better to get a bigger litter box than a smaller one. Inside the litter box, place fresh hay. You can also place bunny-safe pet bedding under the hay.Make a kitchen end and a bathroom end of the box. The bathroom end will be where they do their business, while the kitchen end will be where they will nibble clean hay.
If you have multiple bunnies, get a very large litter box or individual boxes for each bunny.
Change your bunny’s hay often to keep it clean. Bunny’s will use a clean litter box, but avoid a dirty one. Don’t go two days without changing the litter box. To clean, just dump everything into the trash, add more bunny-safe bedding, and wash the box.
You should confine him to this cage until he is consistently using the litter box.

, Rabbits are naturally skittish and like to hide from predators, loud noises, or other things that scare them. You need to provide hiding places for your rabbits, such as a cardboard box, a system of tunnels made out of cardboard tubes, or a low enclosed area easily accessible. You can also purchase rabbit hiding places from the pet store., If you keep your rabbit inside, you can choose one room to let your bunny run around in. This room should have a litter box, a hay feeder, food dishes, and water bowl in one area. Place a mat under it to protect it from messes. Inside the room, you can set up cardboard castles, bunny condos, puppy pens, or rabbit cages., Rabbits chew constantly. If you are going to let your bunny run around a room, you need to protect your bunny by covering up wires or removing them. Hide and protect electrical cords with hard plastic tubing split lengthwise with the cords tucked inside inside. You can also tuck cords behind wood work or trim, wrap them in spiral wrap, or use concealers to keep them out of sight., Rabbits will chew on trim, door edges, and furniture legs. They may also chew wallpaper, sheetrock, and carpet. Place a board over any places that your bunny may want to chew. Place cardboard or 2x4s under furniture so the rabbit doesn’t burrow up into the soft underside of it. You can also place clear plastic panels over the wall to keep the rabbit from chewing on it.Watch your bunny carefully when she is running around the room and give her an acceptable chewing object if she tries to go after furniture or part of the house.

, To help deter your rabbit from chewing things she shouldn’t, you should provide plenty of things for the rabbit to chew on. These include alfalfa cubes, grass hay stuffed in cardboard tubes, fresh branches (apple, willow or aspen only), or rolled up cotton towels.

, You can use a sipper bottle or a ceramic dish for a water dish. While a sipper bottle will be easier to keep clean, rabbits seem to prefer drinking out of ceramic dishes.If you let your rabbit run around in a room, make sure there is plenty water available for her.

, Rabbits need the correct amount of fiber each day, along with moisture, to maintain a healthy gut. If not, they can suffer ill health and may even die. One of the mainstays of a Holland Lop’s diet is a high quality grass hay.Grass hay should be fed in unlimited amounts. Make sure to toss any spoiled or wet hay in the garbage and give your Holland Lop fresh hay daily.


Grass hay is better for a rabbit than alfalfa hay, which is too high in protein and calcium to be fed as anything other than as a treat.

, Another staple of a rabbit’s diet is a commercial rabbit pellet. This is better than grain or seed mixes as it is properly formulated for a bunny to provide all nutrients they need. If a bunny has a seed or grain mix, she will pick out the parts she likes and leave behind those she doesn’t, leaving her diet unbalanced.


An adult Holland Lop rabbit can have ⅛ to ¼ cup of pellets daily.
Make sure to change the pellets daily so your rabbit can have fresh pellets.

, Green leafy vegetables are needed to provide fiber and moisture to the diet. Good choices are all kinds of lettuce, except iceberg which is nutritionally deficient, bok choy, broccoli stems and leaves, carrot tops, and dandelion greens. Only feed your Holland Lop ½ to 1 loose cup of these a day.

, Bunnies can have starchy vegetables, like carrot roots, and fresh fruit, but only a few tablespoons a day. Never feed any other human foods to rabbits, nor corn or other grains. Stick to hay, pellets, and leafy vegetables as the majority of the bunny’s diet.

, Most Holland Lop rabbits are healthy as long as a proper diet is fed to them. However, once a year she needs a veterinarian examination to make sure all is well. This examination will include a tooth check to make sure the teeth are wearing properly. If not, the veterinarian may need to trim them so the mouth or teeth don’t become injured.

, Your bunny should be neutered if he is a male or spayed if she is a female when he or she is four to six months of age. This stops unwanted litters if you have two rabbits of the opposite sex, plus stops bad behaviors like aggression or urine spraying. It also eliminates reproductive system cancer and infections., For the most part, rabbits with proper diets are healthy. However, you should be aware of the signs of illness, which include refusing to eat or drink, diarrhea, not pooping for a day, eye or nasal discharge, drooling, swellings, reddened skin, or fur loss anywhere on the body, not hopping or moving like normal or unable to use back legs, dark, red urine, or a fever of more than 105 °F.Never ignore these signs. If you see them, contact your veterinarian immediately for an examination.

If your rabbit is going to the bathroom in his bedding, you need to give the rabbit a larger area to roam, exercise, and move around.

, Rabbits need a place to hide from things that scare them, so they feel safe and secure. Place a cardboard box or a nest box for your rabbit to do so. The hiding place should be placed somewhere where he can rapidly move underneath it or inside it, but be small enough to make the rabbit feel secure.The boxes should have holes at both ends so the rabbit will use it. You can place the hiding place boxes in ""hidden"" places in your house, like under furniture, in closets, or in corners of the room. If your rabbit has made a habit of using places for hiding spots you'd rather them not be, like under your bed, put a box there with multiple openings to keep the rabbit in the box and away from your carpet and bed frame.


Make sure to have one hiding place per rabbit.
The hiding place should be located away from sights and sounds that could scare your rabbit. Place the hiding place away from other animals, people, drafts, and sunlight. Make sure the hiding place is quiet.
Cardboard boxes stuffed with hay make inexpensive chewing and hiding spots for rabbits.

, Confine your rabbit in his cage with a litter box in a corner he has already soiled. He will use the litterbox to keep his cage clean. Make sure the litter box sides are low so he can hop in and out easily. Try placing hay or a few of his droppings in the litter box to encourage him to use it.If you let your rabbit run around the house, consider setting up multiple litter boxes.

, Sipper bottles are easier to keep clean than bowls, but rabbits prefer to drink from bowls. One of each could be provided to see which works best in your rabbit’s situation. Regardless of container used, clean it and put in fresh water at least once a day.If using a bowl, make sure it is heavy enough not to tip over.

, The Himalayan rabbit loves to chew. If you are keeping your rabbit inside, you will need to carefully rabbit proof your home to protect him and your stuff from damage.


Protect electrical cords with spiral wrap, hard plastic tubing and concealers, or by keeping them out of reach.

Always keep an acceptable chewing alternative out for your rabbit. Make sure he knows where it is. If you catch him starting to chew on something he shouldn’t, give him the alternative. You can use items like hay, alfalfa cubes, cotton towels, and aspen, willow, or apple branches., A rabbit needs at least 4 hours of exercise daily in order to be fit both physically and mentally. You can provide an exercise pen or area for your rabbit, so your rabbit can run around. Place cardboard tubes or boxes in the area for the rabbit to run through and jump on. Move them daily so your rabbit will be curious about the changes.You can even get on the floor and play with your bunny.


Hide food and treats around his exercise areas so he can forage for his food.
Make cheap, homemade toys, like a paper sack stuffed with shredded newspaper and a few treats, cardboard rolls from paper towels stuffed with hay, or tunnels made from cardboard boxes.
Provide a digging box for your rabbit. Place a bunch of newspaper and toilet paper in a box, and the rabbit will spend days shredding the paper.
If your rabbit has a large area to roam around, sometimes he may get used to that and stay in the same spot. If this happens, confine him in a smaller area for a few hours, then release him so he will want to roam.

, The best diet for a rabbit consists of grass-type hay, commercial rabbit pellets, leafy green vegetables, and water. The rabbit’s intestinal tract needs the fibers and water found in these foods for it to function properly and prevent dangerous illness.


Your Himalayan rabbit should always have access to clean, dry grass hay. This helps to keep his teeth and digestive tract healthy.
Himalayan rabbits should have between 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup of high quality (15-18% protein) pellets per day. Most Himalayans eat about 1/3 cup, but monitor your rabbits weight - if it is losing or gaining weight you might have to adjust how much feed it gets. Young Himalayans - under six months - can generally be given as much pellets as they want, but if the rabbit does not eat them all, they will have to be replaced, as rabbits may refuse to eat stale food.
Vegetables and green foods are, contrary to popular belief, neither required for a rabbits diet, or good for them. If you do desire to give your Himalayan fresh food, try dark, leafy greens, such as kale, spinach or parsley.

, Dry treats that are popular with rabbits are black oil sunflower seeds and rolled oats.


Alfalfa or clover hay. These are tasty but way too rich for a rabbit to ingest daily. It can be used as an occasional treat, or given to nursing does.Starchy vegetables, like carrot bottoms, and fruit. These are also tasty but have too much sugar and starch for the rabbit. Feed no more than 2 tablespoons of fruit daily. Don’t feed a rabbit bananas. They are too fatty and can become addictive for the rabbit.
Do not feed human foods (other than the above mentioned vegetables and fruits) to the rabbit. Corn is also not good for rabbits since the hulls can cause problems in the digestive tract. Seed or grain mixes may give your rabbit an unbalanced diet since he can pick and choose the seeds and grains out of these mixes.

, Since Himalayan rabbits have short fur, they require minimal grooming. You can brush your rabbit once a week, or run your hand over his fur with damp hands to move excess hair., The color on the Himalayan rabbit can change depending on the temperature. The colored patches of hair can darken if exposed to cooler temperatures, but lighten if exposed to warmer temperatures. If your rabbit lies next to something cold, his white fur can get dark spots on him., It may be neutered (if he is a male) or spayed (if she is a female) when he is four to six months of age. This operation is very risky, and Himalayan rabbits do not do well under anesthesia. Since they tend to be less hormonal than other breeds, and do not spray or become territorial as easily, it is highly advised by those who keep Himalayan rabbits to not spay or neuter a Himalayan except to prevent unwanted pregnancies. #Take your rabbit to the veterinarian once a year. You should take your rabbit to the vet for an examination once a year. A tooth check should be done to see if the teeth need trimming. Himalayan rabbits do not generally have any teeth problems, though, due to their long facial structure. , Most rabbits are very healthy, but sometimes they become sick and show signs. Look for eye or nose discharge, drooling, refusing to eat or drink, swelling, reddened skin, or fur loss, not hopping or moving like normal or unable to use back legs, diarrhea or a lack of droppings for a day, dark, red urine, or a fever more than 105 °F. Bright, orange red urine is normal, especially during a change in seasons - the red urine to be watched out for is when it has darker specks in it, which can indicate blood. If you see any of these signs or any other concerning sign contact your veterinarian for advice.

Because of this, you should feed your rabbit a pellet with a decent amount of protein, which can be between 15 to 18%.


The rabbit pellet protein will be listed on the label of the food pellet you buy. The first ingredient should be crude protein followed by a combination of crude fat, crude fiber, and other nutrients., You need to keep your Havana clean in order to keep her coat as lush as possible. The excrement in her cage should be cleaned out at least once every day to every two days. If you don't, your rabbit may be at risk of flystrike, which is where a fly lays its eggs in her fur and is then bred in her skin.


This is no necessarily deadly, but it causes major problems for your rabbits health and will leave obvious marks on her skin and fur., Although your Havana rabbit should be healthy with a proper diet and habitat, she should be taken in once a year to the veterinarian for a check-up. Your vet will give her a physical examination to make sure she is growing properly, is healthy overall, and that her teeth are growing in correctly and aren't too long.


If her teeth are too long, she may need to have her teeth trimmed by your vet to ensure she can eat correctly and so they won't cause problems., If you are not planning on breeding your rabbit, you should have her spayed (or neutered if your rabbit is male). This should be done when she is four to six months old. This will help prevent unwanted breeding as well as stop aggressive behaviors and prevent cancer or infections in her reproductive system., Although you take care of your rabbit, she may get sick. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, you should take her to the vet immediately. Common symptoms to look out for that signal that you rabbit may be sick include:


Decrease or halt in appetite or water consumption
Diarrhea
Lack of defecating for 24 hours
Discharge from the eyes or nasal passage
Drooling, which may be a sign of overgrown teeth
Swelling or reddening of the skin
Loss of the fur anywhere on her body
Inability to use her back legs, which makes it difficult for her to hop or move her back legs
Dark or red urine
Fever, which is a temperature of more than 105 °F"

Buy an indoor cage.,
Build an exercise pen.",How to Care for Dwarf Rabbits1," Some people like to let their rabbits roam freely in their home. This may not be an option for you, however. Either way, your rabbit will need a cage. This cage should be a place where it can be safe, and not interrupted. Your cage can have a plastic or wooden bottom, but wire will hurt your dwarf rabbit's feet. This cage should be filled about 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep with bedding. Carefresh and Yesterday's News are good brands. In the cage should be a litter box, a hideaway box, a food bowl, hay rack, and a water bottle.;
, You can put the pen outside if your lawn isn't fertilized and doesn't have other animals using it. Otherwise, you can designate an enclosed area in the house to let your dwarf rabbit to play. However, if you build a pen indoors, you should read how to rabbit proof your home.

Feed them hay.,
Feed them pellets.,
Give them fresh fruits and vegetables.",How to Care for Dwarf Rabbits2," Hay is the main part of any rabbit's diet. Your dwarf rabbit should always have a fresh, unlimited supply of hay available to him at all times. Do not feed your rabbit alfalfa hay as it is bad for them. Feed them timothy hay or some kind of grass hay.

, Choose a good quality rabbit brand that doesn't contain extra seeds or sugar. You should feed 1/4 a cup of pellets per 5 pounds of rabbit. Timothy hay is good for rabbits over 7 weeks old.

, 2 cups a day of greens should be fed to your rabbit. A piece of carrot, apple(without seeds), banana, or strawberry are a great treat for your dwarf rabbit. Make sure you research what fruits and vegetables are safe for your rabbit to eat as some can be toxic.

Buy hard plastic baby toys or rabbit toys.,
Collect cardboard tubes.,
Make a rice filled egg.",How to Care for Dwarf Rabbits3," Not the kind for teething, but hard ones they cannot chew apart like keys and rattles to hang on the top of their cage.

, You can fill a cardboard toilet paper tube with hay or simply just place the tube in the cage and let your dwarf rabbit have a go at it. You can also make a rabbit hideaway by cutting the bottom off of a cardboard box and cutting doors and windows.

, Here's an idea: take a plastic Easter egg, fill it with dry rice, and hot glue it shut. Simple, and your dwarf rabbit will love to rattle it around. Just make sure to take adorable out the toy at night- your dwarf rabbit will most likely wake you up!

Buy a colander/bowl set.,
Cover up the bowl with a plastic bag.

,
Pickup a good litter absorber product from the pet store.,
Spread some litter absorber on the plastic bag in the bowl.

,
Put the colander on top.And its done.

,
Train your rabbit to use the new box.,
Remember clean the littler box twice a week.",How to Make a Litter Box for Your Rabbit," It might sound funny, but a cheap plastic colander/strainer can work wonders as a litter box for a rabbit. What you want is one of the cheap plastic supermarket varieties, which come in two pieces: the top portion is the filter/colander (with holes in it), and the bottom part is the bowl to catch the water.This will make a perfect dry litter box.


Be careful with the size of the bowl you are buying; if it's too small your rabbit will end up shooting the litter outside of the littler box and if its too big it will be hard for them to claim in.;
,, You might end up wanting to try a few different brands of rabbit and cat litter. Consider one with a scent to reduce the odor.

,,, Place a piece of tissue which you have used to wipe your rabbit's mess in the littler box, and place the littler box just next to the cage entrance. By doing this so, your rabbit will have to get in and out of the litter box every time he get out of the cage and vice versa.


He will definitely explore the litter box, and thanks to the rabbit's nature, once he identified his own smell from the tissue, he'll know what the purpose is. Slowly he will find it comfortable to throw his mess there than anywhere else and it will become his permanent littering location.
Once your rabbit learned to use the litter box frequently,you can move the litter box further away,but not too far from the previous location.Increase the distance slowly everyday and after a month or so you can place the litter box anywhere but make sure that your rabbit has easy access to it.

, You will find it very easy and convenient to clean the litter box.

Create the base of the maze.,
Make the walls of the maze.,
Design the maze.,
Create the inner walls of the maze.,
Create holding pens.,
Let your rabbit explore the maze.",How to Build a Maze for Your Rabbit1," Lay out a flat piece of cardboard to use as the base floor. Choose a piece as long as the maze you want to make. A good size to start with is two feet by two feet. As you perfect your maze-making skills, you can get more adventurous with bigger sized mazes.


You can also start building directly on the floor if you prefer. However, this means that you might have more to clean up at the end since your rabbit might go to the bathroom on the floor or make some other kind of mess. A cardboard base will help contain the mess to the toy maze and not let it escape into your home as much.;
, You can create walls for your maze by cutting ten-inch high strips from flat cardboard, the same length and width as the maze floor. Glue the strips around the perimeter to create the structure's walls. Each lane should be wide enough for your rabbit to move around easily – probably at least six inches wide, depending on the size of your rabbit.You can also use some heavy duty tape (like duct tape or packaging tape) as an alternative to glue to keep the walls of the maze in place.

, Draw a blueprint on the maze floor. You can even include divergent paths and dead ends to challenge your rabbit. However, try not to make it too difficult.You might want to start out with a fairly simple design that only has one dead end, for example, and build up to a more complicated pattern over time.

, Cut additional ten-inch high cardboard strips and glue them into your maze according to the design you created. Make sure all of the pieces are attached sturdily so your rabbit can run through the maze without knocking them over.


To attach the inner walls of the maze to the base, you can use glue or tape. Just make sure the walls stay firmly in place.

, Do this by cutting ten-inch high cardboard strips to use as barriers that fit tightly in the path at the beginning and the end of the maze. Secure them sturdily to the base to create separate start and finish pens.


Make sure your holding pens are secured tightly and that there are no spaces around the edges for your rabbit to escape.
You can secure the walls of the holding pens by creating slits in the cardboard sides that allow the pen door to slide into place. Then you can simply remove the wall by pulling the cardboard door out to let your rabbit out of the pen., Place your rabbit in the start pen and put a few pieces of your rabbit’s favorite foods in the finish pen to entice your bunny to finish the maze. Lift up both pens and watch your rabbit find its way through the maze."
"
Gather some boxes.,
Design your maze.,
Cut holes in the boxes.,
Put the boxes together.,
Set your rabbit loose in the maze.",How to Build a Maze for Your Rabbit2," It is important that the boxes all be about the same size, or at least that they fit together end-to-end with no gaps in between the boxes. You’ll be cutting holes in the boxes and you don’t want your bunny to be able to squeeze out of the maze in gaps between the boxes.


You’ll probably need at least five boxes, depending on the size of the boxes and the amount of space you have to build the maze. If you have more space, you can use more boxes.

, Put the boxes together and decide where to cut the holes. You’ll want to put holes only on some sides so that the rabbit is led towards the end of the maze. However, you might also include a few dead ends to keep your rabbit thinking.To make a dead end in the maze, you’ll just cut a hole in a box that goes one direction, but then have no other holes in the box it leads into. That way, your rabbit will have to turn around and go back the way it came to continue the maze.

, Once you have designed your maze, start cutting holes in the boxes with scissors or an X-Acto/utility knife. Make sure the holes are big enough for your rabbit to hop through without getting stuck or feeling restricted.It might be helpful to decide what size and shape you want the holes to be beforehand and create a template. Then you can simply trace the template on each box where you want the hole to be so that you’re sure all the holes will be big enough for your bunny.
Make sure you use extreme caution when using a sharp blade of any kind. If you are a kid, ask your parents to help you or supervise you during this step.

, Once you have cut holes in all the boxes, you’ll need to make sure the maze sticks together. If you forget this step, the boxes may start sliding apart as your rabbit hops around inside.


Use glue or double-sided tape (or tape that you fold around to make it double sided) to stick the sides of each box together. You could even tape together the top edges of the boxes for added security.

, Now your maze is complete and you can let your rabbit wander through. Try putting some treats at the end of the maze to entice your rabbit to go all the way to the end.You can also add some newspaper or bedding throughout the maze to make it more comfortable for your rabbit.

"
"
Buy a prefabricated maze for your bunny.,
Create a maze out of tunnel toys.,
Create a maze with a combination of cardboard and tunnels.",How to Build a Maze for Your Rabbit3," You can often find already made maze items specifically intended for use by rabbits. There are websites online that carry these items, but you can also check in your local pet store to see what they carry in stock.


You will likely have to do a little assembly to put the maze together.

, A popular toy for pet rabbits (and many other types of pets) is the tunnel. This toy gives your rabbit a chance to explore in narrow spaces, an activity that they really enjoy. These types of toys will also help keep your bunny out of smaller spaces that you would prefer it avoid – like under your furniture.To create a maze with a tunnel toy, you simply need to stick several of them together in a pattern of some sort. You can use Velcro or tape, depending on the material your tunnel toys are made out of.Combine the tunnel toys in various ways to make a fun and interesting maze for your rabbit.
If you can’t find any tunnel toys made specifically for rabbits, you can use some that were made for cats. These tunnel toys will be easier to find., You can make an even more exciting maze for your pet rabbit by building one out of cardboard boxes and tunnel toys that you stick together in various ways.Where the tunnel will intersect with the cardboard box, you’ll need to trace the outline of the tunnel on the box and cut out the hold. That way, the tunnel will fit snugly into the side of the cardboard box and there won’t be any chance your bunny could escape out of the hole.

Know rabbits need to run.,
Understand the purpose of a run.,
Establish a good size.,
Include a hutch.,
Always pick a shady location.",How to Build a Rabbit Run1," Rabbits need a great deal of exercise because they are prey animals; in the wild, they must say in shape to stay alive. They will need to run and jump for at least two to three hours a day.If your rabbit has the run of the house, then you don't necessarily need a run unless you feel the need to take your rabbit outside.;
, A run provides a great place for your rabbit to exercise, keeping them contained. However, it also protects them from predators. Runs are enclosed on all sides and the top, so most predators cannot get in., Any cage that you keep your rabbit in for extended periods of time should be at least 2 feet by 4 feet, at least for medium rabbits or smaller. However, if you can, you should make the run bigger for your rabbit., If you plan on leaving your bunnies outside, they also need a shelter, known as a hutch. A run is great for exercise, but a hutch is the bunnies' home.

, If you don't have a shady location available to you, you should cover your hutch with more than just wire. You can use anything that will provide shade, even a tarp."
"
Gather your materials.,
Attach two pieces together.,
Continue moving around the pen.,
Create a door.,
Consider replacing the zip ties.,
Build a roof.,
Build a floor for a more permanent run.",How to Build a Rabbit Run2," You'll need a cage kit, which comes with wire modular pieces. You'll also need some zip ties or hinges or a hammer and nails, available at most home improvement stores., Place two pieces next to each other. Use two zip ties, one at the top and one at the bottom, to bring the two pieces together. If the pieces aren't very high, you may need to make another layer on top. Use the zip ties to add the top layer as well. You want it to be 3 to 4 feet high., Continue adding pieces to the pen, until you have one that is an appropriate size. For instance, if your pieces are 2 feet wide, you'll need at least two pieces on each side and one piece on each end., The easiest way to create a door is to attach one panel only one side. That way, it will swing out, up, or down. You can keep it closed with a clip or clothespin., You may want to replace the zip ties with a hinge or metal j clips, which are more secure and more visually appealing. The zip ties can be helpful for keeping the cage in place while you work.


If you leave the zip ties, make sure they are facing outward. Your bunny is likely to chew on anything inside the cage, so point the ends of the zip ties outward. Make sure you pull them tight and clip off any excess.

, Use the same pieces to build a roof. Lay the piece on top, and attach on the sides and in the corner. Keep attaching the pieces to each other and the sides until you have a solid roof., If you plan on leaving bunnies in this run unsupervised outside, then you need to add wire pieces across the floor, too. Rabbits can burrow out from under the cage.However, you need a more solid floor for your rabbit's feet, so use either wood or a very thick layer of straw on the bottom.Indoors, you can use utility mats to cover the bottom instead of wire, as they won't burrow into your floor."
"
Design your run first.,
Buy the appropriate panels.,
Decide on a location.,
Add wire if needed.,
Join the panels.,
Don't forget to use a door.",How to Build a Rabbit Run3," Aviary panels come in several styles. Basically, they are made with a wood frame and wire. Some are wire all along the side, while other panels have door openings or are solid wood on one end.Generally, they are long enough that you can build a pen you can walk into. However, you can also turn them so the length runs along the ground, creating a much shorter pen. For instance, you could use the kind of panels that are solid on one end to create an impromptu hutch for your rabbit., Once you've decided on a design, buy panels to match your design. You should be able to find these at farm and tractor stores or home improvement stores. They were originally designed for birds, which is why farm and tractor stores may have them., If you put the aviary panels over concrete, you do not need to build in a mesh floor. However, if you are building it over grass or dirt, you will need to add in wire underneath the grass.

, Use wire meant to keep gophers out, referred to as ""gopher wire."" You can lay it out under the cage. You can hammer in ground staples to keep it in place. Normally, this wire would go under the sod, but as that's not usually an option with rabbit hutches, you can add it on top of the grass.However, be sure to cover the bottom of the cage with plenty of fresh straw to protect your rabbit's feet and to change the straw out regularly.Be sure to push the wire ends into the ground, so no one gets scratched on them.
You can also put in a wood floor, if you prefer.

, You can use screws or nails to join the panels, just as you would any wooden frame. If you use screws, you can take it apart later and make it into a new configuration if you would like.Another simple option is brackets and screws.To join using brackets and screws, lay the panels flat on the floor. Make sure they are as close as possible. Lay out 6 brackets along the seam. Use a drill to pre-drill holes where the screws will go. Drill in the screws. For corners, use corner brackets., The easiest way to leave a door on your hutch is to use an aviary panel with a door already installed.However, you can also use hinges instead of brackets on one of the panels, so that it swings out. The hinges are installed basically the same way as the brackets; you'll also need to add a latch for your door.

Keep your Florida white rabbit indoors.,
Give your Florida white rabbit somewhere to hide.,
Provide a litter box.",How to Care for Florida White Rabbits2," Florida white rabbits are smaller than some breeds, but they still need room to hop and play. Your rabbit will need a cage that is 30 inches long by 24 inches wide by 18 inches high or larger.Avoid wire bottom cages because these can injure your rabbit. Go with a solid metal bottom cage instead.You can also go with a puppy playpen or get your rabbit a special rabbit condo type enclosure., Do not keep your Florida white rabbit outside. Keeping your rabbit outside will expose her to the elements, predators, and loneliness.Rabbits that are kept outside are more easily forgotten about and neglected, and may become fearful of humans, which can be a problem for a pet rabbit. Although a cage may protect your rabbit from rain and predators, a rabbit can have a heart attack from the sight of a predator.


However, research now indicates rabbits kept purely indoors are prone to Vitamin D deficiency which can cause dental problems and weak bones. It is a good idea to take your rabbit outside on a harness, or expose her to natural sunlight every day.

, Rabbits seem to feel safer when they can retreat to a hiding spot, so make sure that you put a cardboard box or wooden nest box you’re your rabbit’s cage.

, Your Florida white rabbit will chew on cords if he encounters them. Not only is this dangerous for your rabbit, it may also damage your electronic goods. To prevent your rabbit from chewing on cords, you can hide cords with hard plastic tubing, spiral wrap, or just keep them out of reach., Rabbits will chew on almost any wooden object, which includes wall trim, doors, chairs, and table legs. Your Florida white rabbit might also try to chew on loose wallpaper, carpeting, and sheetrock.Watch your Florida white rabbit when he spends time outside of his cage and stop him if he starts chewing on something that is off limits.

, A rabbit’s teeth never stop growing, so you will need to be sure that your Florida white rabbit always has something to chew on. If you do not provide things for your rabbit to chew on, then his teeth may grow too long and you may have to pay a veterinarian to trim them.If you catch your rabbit chewing on something that is off-limits, don’t punish him. Just give him something else to chew on. For example, you can give your Florida rabbit alfalfa cubes, cotton towels, untreated pine boards, cardboard boxes, or apple branches., Your rabbit needs to see the veterinarian once per year for a checkup. If your rabbit seems sick, then you should also take your rabbit to the veterinarian. Signs of a problem include:runny eyes and nose
watery diarrhea

Prepare the rabbit’s home.,
Set the hutch in a common room.,
Have food ready.,
Use a pet carrier.,
Let the rabbit get used to its hutch.,
Let the rabbit get used to your home.,
Sit with your bunny.,
Start petting your bunny.,
Start handling your rabbit.,
Allow the bunny as much time as it needs.,
Keep playing.,
Spend time with your rabbit daily.,
Acclimate your bunny to strangers.",How to Win a Rabbit's Trust," This should be done before your rabbit arrives for the first time so that it can get used to its new home (and you!) quickly. You will need an assortment of accessories in order for your rabbit to be comfortable.


Accessories needed for a hutch are water bottle, food trough or heavy food crock, large plastic litter box, and litter like you would purchase for a cat.You may want to add cedar pet bedding to keep the hutch smelling fresh.;
, To help your rabbit trust his home, place your hutch on the floor in a room where you spend a lot of time. Shutting a rabbit away in a room will make it unsure of the outside world. The more exposure your rabbit has to you, the more it will trust you.


Do not place the hutch near a heater or TV or stereo. Loud noises frighten rabbits. They are used to a quiet, peaceful existence. You'll know your rabbit is frightened when it lays it ears flat against its head.Keep the hutch away from direct sunlight, as through a window. Heat and rabbits do not mix well, and rabbits can die from becoming overheated., To reinforce the idea that your rabbit can trust you, have food on hand. A nice crunchy carrot is a good way to make your rabbit feel comfortable and to attract it to you during playtime.


Rabbits like to chew for enjoyment, but mainly because their teeth are always growing and chewing keeps them trimmed. Offer them crunchy fresh vegetables such as carrots, celery, and lettuce.You can also offer wood, cotton towels, and un-treated grass mats.

, To help your rabbit trust you during car rides, place it in a pet carrier. This prevents the rabbit from feeling overwhelmed, and makes its transport safer and more comfortable.


Rabbits do not like car trips, so making them comfortable is important so they continue to trust you. Remember that they don't like loud noises.
You must protect your bunny from the heat. Place a cool, damp towel over the carrier and place a frozen bottle of water next to it., If you're bringing your rabbit home for the first time, transfer it directly from the pet carrier to the hutch. Make sure the hutch is located in a common room like the living room or kitchen and near the door, at least for the first day.


Before placing your rabbit into the arms of excited family members or on the floor in a common room, allow the bunny to sit in its hutch for 12-24 hours. This allows it to get used to the sounds and smells of your home while feeling secure.
Let your bunny learn that its cage is a safe place where food and shelter is. If your rabbit doesn't know that, it will never learn to trust the person who put it there.
Never allow anything even remotely dangerous into the hutch, and make sure it's always well stocked with food and water.

, Once the rabbit has been in its hutch for 12-24 hours and appears to have calmed down, you may open the door and let it hop out.


Get down on the same level as the rabbit. Letting your rabbit come to you in its own time will assist in the bonding process and help it learn to trust you. Don’t interfere with the bunny at first. Rabbits are naturally curious, and they will come to you on their own., After a few days of sitting with your rabbit while it explores, it should accept your presence. At this point, you may allow the rabbit to climb on you. Be sure not to pull it up.


No sudden movements or touching or stroking the rabbit. This will allow it to get used to your presence and relax with you there. Sudden movements frighten rabbits and will delay developing their trust.
Allow the rabbit to climb on you. Try to avoid any jerking. The rabbit must learn that you aren't something that's going to lure it closer and then grab it. Your bunny must learn that you are safe to be around and can be trusted.

, After several days of allowing the rabbit to accept your presence and crawl into your lap, you can start stroking its head and the sides of its face.


Don't be excessive, but let it know that stroking is completely harmless and a way you are expressing love.
Do not crowd your rabbit. Just stroke it when it sits down next to you or crawls into your lap.

, Begin slowly, picking it up twice a day, during designated playtimes.


After a couple of days of this, the bunny will finally know that you are safe to be around.

, If your rabbit still won’t approach you after sitting with it during playtime for several days, don’t force it. Continue to help the rabbit acclimate by doing things you’d normally do in the same room.


You can try cooking while the bunny plays, or watching TV at a low volume if it’s in the living room or den.
Eventually your bunny will trust you. Keep offering healthy snacks and getting down on its level to show you aren’t a threat.

, Don't stop playing with your bunny just because it trusts you. You should play with it every day to maintain your good relationship and build on the trust you've already created.


Bring a healthy snack to each playtime in order to encourage your rabbit to believe you are safe.

, Try daily sessions of half-hour increments of just sitting with your rabbit.


When your rabbit seems more comfortable in your arms (it will never be completely comfortable), pick it up for a short cuddle occasionally.

, If you know you are going to have guests over, explain to them that bunnies need time to get used to strangers. Do not take your bunny out of its hutch around strangers until everyone has been briefed on how to treat the rabbit.


This is especially important if small children will be around the bunny. Because children are louder and less coordinated than adults, it is easy for them to accidentally be rough with rabbits. Instruct small children in how to handle a rabbit, and supervise their interactions at all times.

Begin interacting gradually.",How to Understand Your Rabbit," Realize that your rabbit will probably be silent most of the time. As a prey species, rabbits have learned to be quiet in order to escape the notice of predators.Some rabbits do make an occasional noise, either when very happy, scared, or as a warning.


This makes them very different from purring cats and dogs which use a whole vocal range to communicate.;
, Rabbits have a limited repertoire of noises they make when they're happy. These include a very quiet purr, a soft clicking noise, and a very quiet grinding of the teeth noise, which means she is content.These can be very quiet, so you'll need to pay close attention in order to hear the sounds. Your rabbit may softly grind her teeth or click while you're petting her in her favorite spot, like behind the ears or under the chin.
Be aware teeth grinding can be a sign of distress, but in this case the noise is louder.

, The classic warning signal is a thump with a back leg to warn other members of the group of danger. A rabbit that feels threatened and is angry enough to attack may make a series of grunting or growling sounds. Likewise loud teeth-grinding is another warning sound of annoyance. Some rabbits, faced with a threat, will hiss.If you have two rabbits (one male and one female) and the male starts grunting, move him immediately, unless you are attempting to breed them. A grunting male is a sure sign that he is attempting to mate or breed with the female.

, Rabbits have a particularly penetrating and distressing scream. They reserve this for when they are extremely frightened or actually being attacked. If your rabbit screams, she may be in danger or pain.If you notice your rabbit in pain, check for signs of obvious external injury and contact your rabbit's veterinarian immediately. Your rabbit may have a life threatening injury or internal issue that needs to be addressed right away.
However, a rabbit's instinct as a prey species means when they are hurt they are most likely to hide or stay very still to avoid attracting attention, so do not rely on noise alone to alert you to discomfort.

, Much of a rabbit's body language is subtle and understated, but you may see him relax. A relaxed rabbit may lie on his belly with his back legs stretched out behind him. He may also squat with all legs tucked beneath him and his ears softly held against his head.A rabbit's ears are early warning radars for danger, so ears in a neutral position indicate relaxation.

, Your rabbit might try to make himself as small as possible, pulling his head and neck into his body and generally trying to disappear. He'll also avoid making direct eye contact with the rabbit (or person) he is submitting to.A submissive rabbit is usually signalling to other rabbits in the warren that he is no threat.

, If frightened, your rabbit will press his ears hard against his head (trying to reduce his silhouette so a predator doesn't spot him) and his facial muscles will appear taut and tense. This has the effect of making his eyes appear to pop out of his head.This is similar to a submissive rabbit, trying to make himself as small as possible.

, Your rabbit will rapidly shake his head from side to side. He will also thump a hind paw against the ground to make a drumming sound.If really irritated, he may even lunge at another rabbit or you.

, These are fun actions to look for. Your rabbit may perform binkies, or happy hops and twists in the air. Your rabbit may also run around your feet, showing that he's thoroughly enjoying life. He may also move his jaw as if chewing. All of these actions show that your rabbit is enjoying freedom of movement and is happy.


If your rabbit isn't neutered, running around your feet may also indicate that your rabbit thinks you are an acceptable mate.
Your rabbit might also lick your hands and face while he is being petted. This may be a sign that you are very special to him. He may even rub his chin on you, thereby marking you as its territory by leaving its scent.

, Your rabbit will give you plenty of clues that he needs your attention. These include: lightly nudging you with his nose, tugging on your clothes, climbing up your leg, hopping onto your lap, or nipping at your ankles. If your bunny nips at your ankles for attention, you can train him to stop by walking out of the room whenever he or she does this. Reward more polite behavior by petting him, talking to him, or giving him treats.


Your rabbit might also make a noise that sounds like a goose honking. This signals that he's annoyed or wants attention. If your bunny is not neutered, he may make this sound when being amorous towards you or a soft toy.
If your rabbit hops a few steps away, remains with its back to you, isn't occupied with anything else, and occasionally turns its head to see if you are still watching it, it is offended at something you've done. You can apologize by feeding him a treat, or giving a couple of pets on the head. You can also repeat this act to your rabbit if it does something to offend you. It will most likely come by to apologize, either with a few kisses or quick bumps.

, Your rabbit may eat his droppings. There is no need for you to be concerned if your bunny does this. It's natural and should not be discouraged. You may also see your rabbit pushing out his bottom and tail before urinating.


Rabbits need to digest some foods twice and they take these droppings directly from their bottoms. He might make a low pitched squeak when he does this.

, You can think of a rabbit as a 'listener' rather than a 'talker' because their lives are tuned to being on alert for danger. They use a highly developed sense of smell (hence the constant nose twitching), hearing (those wonderful long ears), and prominent eyes to watch for threats.


This means it is even more important that you understand your rabbit, so you know what she does and doesn't like. This can minimize her stress.

, Nature intended rabbits to live underground in tunnels during the day, emerging at dusk and dawn (when it's more difficult for predator's eyes to spot them) to graze on grass and plants. Because they spend the majority of their time in the dark, rabbits make limited use of visual signals, such as nuanced facial expressions or body language., Being picked up by a human can be a terrifying experience to some pet rabbits who go into a catatonic state, where the rabbit lies absolutely still, eyes open and staring, and does a good impression of being dead.Rabbits are ground dwelling animals. In the wild, the only time they leave the ground is when they're picked up by a predator.

, If that's the case, she will either scrabble, wriggle, and fight so hard you get scratched, or she will go completely still. Far from indicating she appreciates being cuddled, a rabbit that keeps deathly still in your arms is actually pretending to be dead in order to make the predator (you!) give her up as a bad meal and put her back down.If your rabbit reacts in this way to being picked up, sit on the ground and encourage her to sit on your lap. This way her paws are in contact with a horizontal surface and she can learn to associate you with safety, rather than an instinctively alien and scary experience.
If it's essential to pick the rabbit up, place a towel over her eyes, and use the rest of the towel to scoop her up. The darkness will help calm her.

, An aggressive rabbit has learnt to bite and scratch in order to avoid being picked up. Be aware that your rabbit is doing this out of fear and unease around humans.Gradually gain your rabbit's trust. Don't try forcing your rabbit to cuddle or sit in your lap.

, Hiding can decrease his stress levels, so he may feel comforted knowing that he has lots of places to hide. This will also make your rabbit feel more secure., At first, do not attempt to handle him, but offer treats (dandelions!) so that he associates tasty foods with human company. Sit down beside the hutch every day, talking in a soothing voice and giving treats, so he learns humans are no threat.You can offer several kinds of fruits to your rabbit, such as grapes, apples, blueberries, and raspberries. Be sure to only give a very small amount, like a single grape or a couple of raspberries., As your rabbit starts to venture out of his hiding place for treats, try to touch him briefly while he eats a treat. As the days and weeks go by, increase the amount of time you touch him until he's comfortable. Then you can try to entice him onto your lap (seated on the ground of course). This is also a great way of gaining a timid, frightened rabbit's trust."

Be sure that you can commit to providing a healthy and happy home for the rabbit for as long as it lives., If you are looking for a rabbit to train as a house rabbit, then the Dutch rabbit is a good choice. They are intelligent and respond well to being trained, and they pick up litter box training quickly. Their even temperament makes them reliable with children, however, it should be noted that rabbits (regardless of breed) are all prey animals. This means they dislike being picked up and are easily startled.


Fear can easily send a rabbit into shock, and likewise their delicate bones are easily fractured by rough handling. All of this means that your pet rabbit should be treated with respect, and children (especially under the age of 10) should be supervised with a rabbit at all times., Only consider getting a rabbit if you can provide a calm, predator free environment for it. Think twice if you already own dogs or cats, as the rabbit may then live in a perpetual state of fear, being expected to live in close confines with its natural enemy.


Also, be prepared to spend time every day cleaning the rabbit's living space and spending quality time interacting and playing, so that the rabbit won't become bored or lonely. If you can't commit to this, then get a cuddly toy rather than a pet rabbit.

, You should make financial provision to provide veterinary care for your Dutch rabbit should they become ill. Be aware that rabbit medicine and surgery is much more advanced than previously. However, not all veterinarians are knowledgeable about the species or comfortable treating them. For the sake of your new furry friend it is best to ask around and find an ""exotics"" vet who has further qualifications in treating rabbits, or at very least is interested in them and undertakes CPD (continuing professional development) in the species.


Also, proper veterinary care for rabbits costs the same as for a cat or dog, so don't expect it to cost less just because the initial purchase price of the pet was lower.
Prepare for veterinary expenses by taking out pet insurance, with some insurance companies now offering rabbit policies.
Make a list of potential costs and add them up before buying the rabbit. Any prospective rabbit keeper must be prepared to provide for all their pet's needs in terms of housing, good diet, health care, mental stimulation and exercise.

, Your first decision is to decide where to house your rabbit. The ASPCA encourage indoor rabbits, as they are less likely to be 'forgotten' about than a rabbit that is out of sight in a yard.


If you do house your Dutch rabbit outdoors, you need to make sure they have shelter from the rain, sun, and wind, and that the enclosure is predator proof.

, A wide variety of indoor cages and hutches are available. They can range from a whole room that is rabbit-proofed, to a puppy crate, to rabbit condos.Whatever your choice, the important thing is the rabbit has plenty of space to move around, plus specific areas for a litter tray, food and water, and a hide.


If you have more than one rabbit then each animal should have the option of a separate hide so they can withdraw if they feel overwhelmed for any reason.
The minimum length of an indoor hutch and run should be 4 foot (1.2 m), but preferably 5 foot, and these are usually half as wide as they are long. They should be high enough to let the rabbit stand up on its hind legs without its ears touching the top. However, even with a run of this size, the rabbit should be allowed free roaming time everyday, so it gets plenty of exercise and time to forage, explore, and prevent boredom., Within the hutch you should provide a litter tray. Rabbits are clean animals and Dutch rabbits especially will rapidly learn to use a toilet area. Paper-pulp type litter is ideal, as it is less harmful to the rabbit if eaten than clay-based cat litters (which you should avoid).


Each rabbit should have its own shelter, where it can retreat if it feels stressed. If a rabbit is stressed its natural instinct is to hide, and providing hiding places goes a long way to reducing additional stress.

, Wire floors are NOT acceptable, as they damage the rabbit's feet. If the cage has a wire floor either remove it or cover with with plywood. Dutch rabbits are liable to get pododermatitis, which is the equivalent of pressure sores on the back of their hocks (equivalent to the human ankle). This is painful and debilitating and the most common cause is rough or mesh flooring, or sitting in soiled bedding that is not changed often enough.


Make sure the floor is covered with a minimum of 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) depth of bedding. There are numerous substances that can be used for bedding, including straw (warm and soft), paper pulp (recycled material, safe and high absorbent), and shredded cardboard.Traditionally sawdust was used for rabbit bedding but this can be dusty and also contains oils that are irritating to the rabbit's lungs and therefore best avoided., Spot clean the litter tray daily and removed urine soil and pellets. Clean the tray fully with disinfectant once a week, or sooner if the tray starts to smell.


Be aware that rabbits pass two different types of pellets: a small dry pellet that is entirely waste material and a larger sticky cecotrophy. The cecotrophy represents food that has passed through the gut but still contains nutrition and the rabbit needs to re-eat it. Never remove cecotropes from the litter tray or you could be depriving your rabbit of valuable nutrition.

, It is important that it can drink whenever it wants to. Be sure the water is clean and that its water dish or water bottle is also clean.

, In the wild rabbits forage and eat vegetation, shoots, leaves, herbage, and grass. This is a high fiber, low calorie diet. The rabbit spends many hours continually chewing in order to get the nutrition they need. In the domestic setting grazing on a lawn mimics this diet, but if this is not possible then hay is the next best option.


The rabbit should have good quality green hay available 24/7 as the main portion of their diet. The chewing required keeps their teeth in trim and it provides vital fiber that keeps their digestion healthy.

, It is acceptable to give a small portion of rabbit kibble each day, around the amount one rabbit can eat in 20 minutes. Do not give so many pellets that the rabbit can graze on it all day. Rabbits that are fed a high proportion of their diet as kibble are prone to weight gain, and this can cause them health problems such as sore hocks, skin infections, fly strike, and arthritis.


Choose an extruded diet, which means each biscuit is identical. Avoid muesli type dry foods as the rabbit will selectively eat the tasty parts, which are also the unhealthy part (low fiber, low calcium, high calorie) and leave the less tasty but nutrition rich components.

, Rotate what you give so the rabbit never gets the same food two days running.Be aware that fruit is high in sugar and should be fed in small quantities to avoid your Dutch rabbit becoming overweight.


Fresh foods to avoid include tomato leaves, potato tops, bracken, laburnum, yew, oak leaves, poppies, and rhubarb leaves

, Female rabbits are does, and male rabbits are bucks. Does can get pregnant from around 4 - 5 months of age, and males can breed at roughly the same age. Thus, there is a high risk of pregnancy if both sexes are housed together. Desexing is strongly advised, and helps to make males less territorial and therefore better pets. There is a strong health benefit to neutering the females as does are at a high risk of uterine adenocarcinoma (womb cancer) and removing the womb during surgery removes this risk.


Desexing is commonly performed from around 4 months of age.

, Get your Dutch rabbit checked by a vet soon after purchase. A yearly check up is also advised. In the UK it is usual to vaccinate annually against myxomatosis and viral hemorrhagic disease. Your veterinarian should tell you what vaccinations are common, and important, in your area.

, Be alert for signs that your Dutch rabbit might be unwell. These include not eating (even if just for 12 - 24 hours you should seek urgent veterinary attention), lack of pellet production, a wet chin, limping, sneezing or wheezing, a wet nose, discharge from the eyes, excessive scratching, and diarrhea.Seek urgent veterinary attention if you see any of these symptoms, as rabbit's deteriorate rapidly when they are ill.

, Be sure to allow your rabbit a chance to roam free in the house each day. If you don't want to let the rabbit roam the house, at least take it out of its cage and let it hop around one area or in a pen.


Ensure the house is ""rabbit proof."" This means putting all electrical cables out of reach, as rabbits will gnaw through them and electrocute themselves.

, Brush the rabbit daily. This helps you to bond with each other, it builds trust, and it gets the rabbit used to being touched.

, These can be as simple as cardboard tubes with a food treat in the center, held in place by plugs of hay. The rabbit has to remove the plugs of hay to get the treat. This is fun for the rabbit and it stimulates its mind.

, Never lift a rabbit by the ears. A 'rugby ball' hold is ideal, with the weight of the rabbit's body supported along your forearm with its rear end snuggled into your elbow and the opposite hand steadying its head.


If you are not confident picking a rabbit up, then consider wrapping it in a towel so it is supported and its claws don't scratch you.

, If you are unable to give your Dutch rabbit a lot of attention, consider getting two rabbits so they keep each other company. If you keep a male and female, then it is essential to neuter them. Alternatively, get two rabbits of the same gender from the same litter and then they should grow up together and tolerate each other well.

You might need to wear clothing or gloves to protect yourself from biting when you interact with the rabbit. You should be able to tell if you need to take this precaution. For instance, if every time you go near the rabbit, it tries to bite you, that's a good indication you need to protect yourself., Start by spending time with it near or in its cage, if it's big enough. Open the door, and sit near the opening if it's not big enough for you to get in. Let the bunny come up and sniff you. Letting it take its time will give it a chance to get to know you.You may even consider laying down, if the bunny is merely shy. If you loom above the bunny, it will likely see you as a predator.However, you may not want to lay down if the bunny keeps lunging at you and trying to bite.

, Sometimes, you need to follow the lead of the rabbit. Rabbits are like cats in that it's best to wait until the animal asks for attention. One way a rabbit may ask for attention is to lean against the side of the cage. If you notice this behavior, you can try to stroke the rabbit's head through the bars with your fingers, talking softly and sweetly to it as you approach., In a rabbit-proof room, let the rabbit out. Sit on the floor at the rabbit's level. Give it a chance to get curious about you. As the rabbit approaches you and sniffs, give the rabbit a treat. Every time the rabbit comes back to you, give it another treat. That way, the rabbit comes to associate you with good food.You only want to use treats the first couple of times. After that, switch to pellets you take out of its daily quantities.
You can also use veggies the rabbit likes. The rabbit should be eating leafy greens, so that's a good place to start, such as parsley, green or red leaf lettuce, beet greens (red Swiss chard), bok choy, mustard greens, or collard greens. You can also use small amounts of fruit, such as strawberries, pears, or oranges (no peels on the oranges).To rabbit-proof a room, all cords need to be hidden (such as in plastic tubing) or out of reach. You also need to remove any plants that are toxic to bunnies, which you can look up on sites like this one: http://rabbit.org/poisonous-plants/. For instance, some toxic plants include daffodils, irises, tomato leaves, and mistletoe. You may also need to block off areas the rabbit may want to chew, such as blocking baseboards with a board. You can also use a small, movable pet fence to create a safe area., Once your rabbit gets to know you, try petting it when it approaches. The best way to do this step is to place your hand above the head, not in front of it. If your hand is front of the rabbit, it has a chance to leap forward and bite you. If you're merely above it, you can gently put your hand down and pat it on the head, and it is less likely to bite you.


Try leaving your hand on its head for a second, then using your thumb to stroke its forehead.
You can also stroke their ears where they meet the head.
If it tries to bite, you can say, ""No!"" You can also gently press down on its head so that it can't lunge forward.

, You can't tame your rabbit in a day. You also can't visit with your rabbit once a week and expect it to get tame. You must spend time each day petting your rabbit and letting it get to know you. In fact, you can increase the time you spend with it a little each day.

, Once your rabbit is accustomed to you, trying picking it up. When picking it up, use a hand underneath the chest between the legs. Use the other hand to support its back end. Don't try to lift it by the back of the neck (the scruff), the legs, or the ears. You could seriously hurt your rabbit.Your rabbit is likely to be scared by this approach because it is similar to being caught by a predator.
Remember, some rabbits may never like being picked up, though of course it is necessary from time to time. You can use this hold for moving the rabbit short distances.
For longer distances, hold the bunny, stomach down, against your chest. Have one hand under its rump and one hand across its shoulders. Loop your thumb over a front leg to keep it from jumping over your shoulder and hurting itself.

, One way to encourage socialization is to remove the rabbit's smaller house from the cage. A shy rabbit will spend much of its time inside the house, so removing it forces it to come out and socialize with you. Remember, though, the house is where the rabbit feels safe, so be sure to put it back., Getting the rabbit spayed or neutered is an important part of taming a rabbit. Rabbits that are not spayed or neutered have hormones running through their body, which in turn can make them more aggressive. Take the rabbit to a vet that works with rabbits and other exotic pets.


For instance, a rabbit that circles you and tries to nip is saying she's wanting sex. By spaying her, you can cut down on this behavior.
However, remember that this step will take time to take effect. Expect a month's wait after the rabbit is spayed or neutered for this step to really help., Just like a cat, a rabbit will purr when happy. This sound helps you understand when the rabbit is happy, so you can repeat behaviors the rabbit likes. Unlike a cat, a rabbit's purr is made with its teeth, so listen for the sound coming from the mouth., Striking back with aggression or even an angry tone when a rabbit is aggressive only makes it more aggressive. Instead, treat every advance with a happy tone, such as, ""Hi, I'm glad you've come to see me."" You can still move your limbs out of the way, but with calmness and deliberateness., While you need to stay calm, you can help your rabbit learn that biting hurts. If your rabbit nips, it's okay to make a sound like ""Ow!"" or even a high-pitched ""EEK!"" That cues the rabbit in to the fact that it's hurting you. In turn, you're encouraging the rabbit to stop the behavior, partially because you're startling it., Every rabbit is going to have things it doesn't like. For instance, your rabbit may not like to see you mess with its litterbox. Alternatively, your rabbit may not like its paws touched. Another thing your rabbit may not like is having someone in its cage. Once you figure out what upsets your rabbit, you can take steps to minimize those triggers.

, Sometimes, your rabbit will let you know it doesn't want to come out of its cage by moving to the back. If you need the rabbit to come out of the cage, don't drag it out. Rather, open the cage and let it hop out in its own time. If it doesn't want to come out, consider offering a treat outside the cage. You can even put a treat in a carrier so the rabbit has something to hop into., Clicker training is when you use positive reinforcement to encourage good behaviors. The clicker is a small device that makes a clicking noise. You can find them at many pet stores, and they are often used in dog training. You reward good behaviors and click at the same time, so the rabbit comes to associate the clicking sound with happy things.You can also use a simple clicking pen for this sound.
Associate the clicker with good things. Give the rabbit food, and as the rabbit takes a bite, make the clicking noise. If it startles the rabbit, you can muffle it a bit. You can also sound the clicker first, then give the bunny a small treat.
Repeat several times, training in small bits each day to get your bunny used to the clicker sound. You can test to see if your bunny understands by making the noise when the bunny is doing something else. If it turns towards you, looking for food, the rabbit understands., For instance, maybe you want the rabbit to come when you call it. Once you have the rabbit coming to the clicker, you can start working on its name. As you make the clicking sound, also call the rabbit's name. Reward the rabbit with food as it comes towards you.Practice this step every day. After a few days, take out the clicking step to try just calling the rabbit's name.
The reason you start with clicking is it is a short, identifiable sound that's easy for the bunny to understand. Moving to the name will take a little time.

, Once you get the rabbit to come to you on cue, you can work on petting and touching. Start by training the rabbit to touch its nose to your hand. After that, work towards petting the rabbit, rewarding with clicking and treats.As the rabbit approaches you, hold out your hand. If your rabbit comes up to sniff or touch your hand, reward the rabbit with a click and a treat. Move your hand around to different places, and then hold still so the rabbit can approach. Every time the rabbit comes close to or touches your hand, immediately click and deliver a treat.
When your rabbit seems confident, start gently moving your hand over its head as it touches you. As you press towards the rabbit, click and give a treat. That way, it associates you touching it with food.
Once you pet its head with confidence, try touching other areas, such as its rump or paw. In fact, you can use head pets for a reward for touching other areas once your rabbit finds it enjoyable.
If your rabbit seems upset by the petting, move back to just getting it to touch your hand until the rabbit seems happy and confident again.

, One way to encourage the training to go faster is to wait until it's dinnertime. Then, use the training session to feed it part of its dinner. That way, the rabbit will be more motivated to come over to the food because it's hungry."

Before you start gathering toys for your rabbit, try to get to know him and figure out his preferences. Knowing what stimuli he responds to can help you plan playtime.


At first, allow your rabbit to leave his cage/pen on his own and come to you. Let him explore a rabbit safe area.Pay attention to what he interacts with, and how. Some rabbits are shredders, meaning they like to tear apart paper and tissues in play. Some like to toss toys with their teeth and chase after them. Some enjoy knocking things over. Pay attention to your rabbit's behavior and see what kind of games he likes to indulge in.Rabbits are easily scared, so try to avoid making any sudden movements. Never yell at a rabbit, as this will encourage your rabbit to stay away from you.;
, Choose a variety of toys you can use to play with your rabbit at home. Base your selection off your rabbit's specific personality.


For a rabbit who enjoys throwing, you can buy rabbit safe toys at a local pet store or department store. Bird toys also work well for this kind of play, as they're made to be easy to grip. If you're on a budget, you can use cardboard tubes from paper towel or toilet paper to save money.Rabbits who like to chew and dig can funnel this behavior into play. Straw mats and boxes full of shredded or scrap paper can provide hours of entertainment. Plastic baby toys and plastic balls are also great, as they're sturdy and will withstand a lot of play before they need replacing.Logic toys are great for curious rabbits, and can be found at pet stores. These toys generally involve a plastic or cardboard box that contains an enticing item, like a rubber ball or a treat. The rabbit must figure out how to open the box in order to get his reward.As some rabbits love pushing things over, consider investing in children's bowling pins. Rabbits will love knocking them over and then having you reposition them., While playing with your rabbit is great fun, you need to make sure your bunny is entertained even when you're not present. This way, rabbits won't develop undue stress while you're out and act out via biting, chewing, or being otherwise destructive.


Many rabbit owners recommend building a cardboard castle for their rabbits. That means gathering old cardboard boxes and stacking them together and then cutting out holes for passageways and entrances. Rabbits who are chewers or curious rabbits particularly enjoy the cardboard castle. If you keep your rabbit in a room rather than a cage when you're away, or if you have a pen for your rabbit, this might be a good option. If your rabbit is confined to a cage during the day, this might be difficult.If your rabbit digs, provide plenty of sawdust or straw in his cage while you're away. If he gets bored, he'll be able to burrow., Rabbits tend to thrive on routine. The best way to encourage your rabbit to play with you is to have regularly scheduled playdates.


Rabbits are generally the most active early in the morning, so this might be a good time to play with them if you're able. If not, a lot of rabbits are also active towards nighttime.Be careful when initiating playtime. Rabbits prefer to be left alone when eating, using the litter box, grooming themselves, and sleeping. If you notice your rabbit engaging in these behaviors, let him finish before initiating play. However, it's a good idea to open your rabbit's cage or pen while he's engaging in these behaviors as this signals to him that it's time to play and he can leave the cage when he's ready., You want to make sure your rabbit feels safe and comfortable with you as a playmate. You should make sure they don't perceive you as a giant.


Try to get down on the rabbit's level. You can sit, crouch, or lie down on the floor.Allow the rabbit the option of sitting on your lap or interacting with you physically. Some rabbits are cuddly and become ""lap rabbits"" with time, but most prefer independence during playtime., Rabbits can be timid, especially at first. You should not push playtime or certain toys if your rabbit seems uninterested. Let the rabbit adjust at his own pace..


Do not engage in rough house with a rabbit the way you would with a cat or dog. Rabbits are naturally timid and this could easily result in your rabbit feeling frightened around you.Greet your rabbit cheerfully before you open his cage, saying his name and something friendly like, ""Good morning."" This way, she will associate you with pleasantness and be more likely to want to interact.Pet your rabbit while giving him other positive feedback, such as friendly verbal cues or treats. You want him to associate your touch with safety and happiness., Rabbits might be nervous when they begin playing, which can lead to aggressive behaviors. To keep your rabbit happy, try using treats as a means to lure him out of the cage.


Many pet store rabbit treats are high calorie and not great for a rabbit's longterm health. Opt for healthy snacks instead, such as raisins, small pieces of apples, pineapple, celery, strawberry, and shredded wheat with no frosting.While treats are a great start, do not overfeed your rabbit. Allow your rabbit to have a few snacks when he enters the play area, but do not indulge him with treats every time he asks., Rabbits do sometimes bite. It's not always an overt act of aggression. Sometimes it's a response to stress or an attempt at affection, but the behavior is a problem for owners.


Do not scold a rabbit. As rabbits are naturally timid, scolding does more harm than good in terms of discouraging biting.When a rabbit bites, gently push him away. Say something nice to him and pet him afterwards. Repeat this behavior as needed until a rabbit no longer acts out by biting., Rabbits are independent animals, and you need to respect this. Let them make decisions about playtime.


Rabbits will signal when they're ready to play. They will circles their owners feet or tug at sleeves and pant legs. Wait for your rabbit to signal he's ready to play before bringing out the toys.When your rabbit loses interest in a game, and tries to return to his cage, let him. Rabbits often want to be alone and they'll resist playtime if it becomes something that feels forced.If a rabbit is engaged in another task, let him finish before trying to get him to play.
Rabbits do not always want to play for the same amount of time. Some days, your rabbit might want to play for an hour and other days only 10 minutes. Do not push your rabbit to play more or less than he wants.

Do not attempt to stop the rabbit from running away. This will only make her more stressed. This can lead to her death, since rabbits can suffer a heart attack or go into shock, which causes her gut to go into stasis, which will cause her to starve.;
, In order for the rabbit to get used to you and not see you as hostile, you should decrease your height when approaching her. This will make it seem less threatening to her. If she does approach you, do not react to her at first. Sit immobile for as long as it takes, which may be hours. It may also take multiple tries over many days, as she gets used to you., If you smell like other animals that are predators of rabbits, such as dogs or cats, she may not approach you. Put on freshly washed clothes and wash your hands before going outside to ensure you don't smell like any other animal., When you are trying to get the rabbit to trust you, leave a trail of tasty food the rabbit will like to lead her towards you. This includes leafy green like arugula, dandelion leaves, and carrot slices. This will help her trust you and go towards taming her., When you are trying to tame her, talk to the rabbit in a calm, gentle, low voice. This will help soothe her and not cause extra alarm.


Never shout at the rabbit or make loud noises. This will cause her to run away and hide.

, If you do manage to scare the rabbit, she may completely freeze. A rabbit uses this reflex to fool predators into thinking she is dead or to help her hide. If the rabbit approaches you in this manner, she is not happy to see you and does not want you to pick her up. She is actually terrified.You may be tempted and be able to pick her up in this catatonic state, but this is not a good way to help the rabbit. This will likely send her into shock and cause major problems for her. This can cause a heart attack or shock and eventual death., If you do pick her up, do not lift the rabbit in the air. Since rabbits are ground dwellers, picking her up is extremely terrifying. This can also lead to heart attack or shock for her.You may also permanently injure the rabbit's legs if you pick her up., If you want catch the rabbit without handling her, which may be a better and less frightening option, think about making a humane trap for her. Talk to a local wildlife society or animal welfare charity to see if they have one. You can also purchase one at a pet store.


You can also make a simple box trap with a cardboard box that will close once the rabbit enters it. To make this kind of trap, prop a box up on a stick, and poke a hole in the cardboard box. Then, tie a carrot or other treat from a string and loop it through the hole and tie it to the stick. When the rabbit enters the box and grabs the treat, the string will pull the stick and the box will come down., To lure the rabbit inside the cage, put down some tasty treats for him inside of it. This includes carrots, leafy greens, or dandelion leaves., If you want the rabbit to come to your trap, you need to put it somewhere that is well sheltered and protected. This will make the rabbit feel safe enough to come to your trap and eat the food you left in it., Rabbits are typically most active at sunrise and sunset, so make sure your traps are fresh and ready at these times. Make sure you check the traps after these times to see if you managed to catch them., Once you catch the rabbit, cover the trap with a blanket so she feels safe. Pick up the trap and then move it to a new location where you want the rabbit to be and open the trap so she can run out.


Make sure wherever you send her is safe for rabbits. You can ask your local wildlife rescue organization or animal control facility for advice.

Play with your rabbit.",How to Tell if Your Rabbit Is Lonely," In the wild, it would be with other rabbits 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you only have one rabbit, you can give it some companionship, but it will still be lonely at night or when you are away at work.Sometimes a female rabbit will be fine on its own. If you do not notice hyperactivity or withdraw with a female rabbit, it is possible that she might be content by herself.On other occasions, a rabbit will be too territorial to get along with another rabbit. At that point, you should consider getting a different species of pet. These will provoke fewer territorial feelings, but can still be a source of company.;
, When a bunny nudges you with its nose it is trying to tell you to do something. Often this means that it wants you to pet or play with it. It can escalate this behavior to even more direct and forceful modes of expression.


This nudging might progress to soft biting. This is also a way to get your attention. If you pretend to be hurt, the bunny should respond by nipping more softly and less frequently.
Your bunny might even begin to dig with its front and or back legs directly on top of you, as if it were trying to dig you up. This is definitely a plea for attention. , A lonely rabbit will sometimes become hyperactive and angry. Although it is not uncommon for rabbits to dig at things, this destructive behavior will accelerate rapidly. Watch for the rabbit gnawing at carpet and other furniture. Their behavior can even become self-destructive.


A lonely rabbit can begin to pull at its fur and overeat. It might even damage its own teeth while pulling at the bars of its cage., Alternatively, some rabbits will become depressed. They will withdraw from you and others, refusing to interact even when you reach out to them. It will take some more effort to get these rabbits back in a good mood.A withdrawn rabbit might hide or stay in its cage. It might not respond when you try to pet or play with it.

, The best companion for a rabbit is another rabbit of the opposite gender and approximately the same age. Two bonded rabbits should snuggle frequently and make quiet sounds of affection. Be careful though, when introducing a new rabbit to your household, some rabbits just can’t get along with each other.


Consider finding a group of rabbits that have experience together, because you know that they will get along. If you are introducing a new bunny into the household, try to get it from a shelter. That way, if they don’t get along, you can exchange it for a new one at little to no additional expense.You can try keeping a single rabbit, but it will require a considerable time commitment on your part to keep it happy. Be prepared to spend time with it everyday.Don’t forget to have your rabbits spayed and neutered. If you don’t, you might very quickly be responsible for a litter of babies., If your rabbits have a tough introduction, they might never get along well. Begin by leaving them in separate spaces and introducing them to each other about 20 minutes a day under close supervision. Introduce them to each other in a neutral space, that neither of them perceives to be their own territory. Once they show signs of bonding, like cuddling and rubbing their noses, they can share the same space.


Keep a water bottle on hand to discipline the rabbits if they fight.
Ideally, you should bring both rabbits back home at the same time. That way, neither of them will perceive it as their territory and they will have no cause to fight over it. If you already have one of the rabbits, try to get them to socialize in a room that don't often spend time in.Males and females make the best pairings., If you have introduced several new bunnies and found that yours is too territorial for friends, you should try to find a pet of a different species to act as a companion. Guinea pigs, birds, and cats are often easier for bunnies to get along with than other rabbits.


Rabbits also shouldn't be allowed to live with other rabbits that aren't spayed or neutered. If your bunny has not been fixed and is too old to endure a procedure, you might also be better of finding a companion of a different species., Rabbits love to explore, move, and sniff around. You should let your rabbit out of its cage daily. However, you should also make sure that it doesn’t tear up your house. Watch it closely or create a room specifically for your bunny, with fewer valuables and no carpet., Rabbits like to be close to the ground. While it might seem like picking it up would be a good way to bond, your bunny probably will not appreciate that. You should get down on its level and spend time near the ground with it. If it seems receptive, get closer and pet it.If the rabbit is not comfortable with you being in its space, it will begin to growl. Take a step back and give it some time to approach you.It might take some time for your rabbit to warm up to you if it is shy. Take it slow.

, Rabbits are most comfortable being pet when they are relaxing after a meal. Approach it slowly and pet it on its forehead, cheek, or back. They usually do not like to be pet on their ears, stomach, tails, or neck, or feet., Bunnies love to get out and a play. They particularly like to knock things over, dig, and toss small toys. Give your rabbit something like bowling pins that it can run into and knock over. Buy some toys or even make homemade toys.


For toys that your rabbit can toss around, consider hard plastic baby toys and plastic balls with bells inside. Often a simple piece of cardboard will do, like the inside of a roll of toilet paper.
If your rabbit loves to dig, consider making a pit for it to dig in. Consider a straw mat or boxes full of shredded paper"

Spay and neuter your rabbits.,

Deal with resistant bonding.",How to Introduce Rabbits," Any combination of rabbits can live together. Whether it is male/male, female/female, or male/female, rabbits can learn to live together no matter what sex they are. The most natural coupling is male/female because this is how they typically form in the wild.


If you buy your rabbits at a young age or buy them together, it doesn't matter what sex they are because they are likely to bond with ease. They may also already be bonded when you buy them.
It is easier to bring a female home to a male rabbit because female rabbits are quite protective of their territory. However, two female rabbits will likely get a long faster than two males.;
, When you are introducing rabbits to one another who are going to be living together, they must be spayed or neutered. This is so the rabbits won't fight as much or breed. Each female should be spayed and males should be neutered anywhere from 2-6 weeks before you begin the introduction process. This allows time for the rabbits to heal and the hormones to dissipate.


You need to make sure you keep male rabbits away from unspayed female rabbits right after they are neutered. They can remain fertile for up to 2 weeks after they are neutered.If you buy your rabbits as babies from the same litter, you still need to spay or neuter them as soon as possible. They will bond closely when they are young, but if they reach sexual maturity before you have them fixed, then they will fight and break their bonds, most likely for good., Once you bring your rabbits home, you need to place them in adjoining cages or hutches, rather than immediately putting the new rabbit in the old rabbit's cage. Putting the rabbits in a cage together could trigger fighting, since original rabbit will be upset with the new rabbit in his territory.


If you want the rabbits to share a cage, it is best to make the original cage as ""neutral"" as possible, and leave the existing rabbit in it. Make it ""neutral"" by cleaning it out and moving it to a new spot, replace the existing cage furniture and add a new shelter, bowls, and bedding, so they smell less strongly of the existing rabbit (hence weakening his view of it as his territory).
If you don't have cages for your rabbits, put them in adjoining rooms and separate them with a baby gate., When you first put the rabbits close together, they will be very curious about each other. You should expect them to touch noses through the cage and will likely show signs of courtship, such as honking and circling. After they are like this for a little while, they will become more relaxed with one another, even laying down beside one another on the edges of the cage. This should take a few days.


If your rabbits are taking a long time to get to this stage, you should try feeding them near one another so they get used to eating near each other.
They will display courtship behavior even though they are spayed and neutered. This is how they communicate with one another., You need to understand that the introduction process takes time. If you introduce your rabbits too quickly, your rabbits can injure themselves and each other. You will also make it much harder or impossible to properly introduce your rabbits if you put them together too quickly.


Watch your rabbits for when they are ready to meet face to face. This can take a few days or weeks, depending on the personality of your rabbits.
If you put your rabbits together too quickly, they will likely fight, which will cause the rabbits to see each other as a threat and make it difficult for them to bond., Once you think they are ready to see each other face to face, you need to find somewhere that is unfamiliar to both of the rabbits. This is so they can meet on even territory that doesn't belong to either of them. Places in your home such as bathrooms are good for the rabbit's introduction. Once both rabbits are in the room, crouch down onto their level and stay on the floor with them.


Make sure you remove all the things in the room that could get knocked off and harm them if they start moving around or jumping.
It is also a good idea to have a cardboard box with a hole in either end so the rabbits can retreat if they get too nervous or scared.

, You have to watch them closely, especially when you first introduce them. There are three common scenarios that might occur when you put the rabbits in the room together. The most common is that both rabbits will be wary of each other first, but one rabbit will take the lead and start to assert dominance on the other. That rabbit will take the lead and approach the other, sniffing, circling, and possibly trying to mount the other rabbit. As much as this might look like mating, it is a play for dominance. Keep a watch to make sure the less dominant rabbit doesn't hurt the more dominant one as they learn each other.Another scenario that could play out is that they will automatically attack one another. This is rare, but you cannot miss it when it happens. Because of this, you should always wear thick gloves when you introduce your rabbits for the first time. When this happens, you need to intervene quickly so the rabbits don't hurt one another. You should then put them back in separate cages and let them get more acquainted before trying again.
In another rare occurrence, your rabbits may approach each other as equals automatically. They will sniff and nuzzle each other and enjoy each other right away., Rabbit fighting is apparent when it happens. The rabbits will jump at each other and start clawing, biting, hissing, and trying to harm one another. To help prevent or stop fighting, you need to have a spray bottle, turned to stream, on hand when you introduce your rabbits. If you think the rabbits might start fighting, you should spray them to stop the behavior. This may also help when they first start fighting, as long as it isn't too vicious. Spraying them will also help encourage them to groom one another, which will help bonding as well.


Nipping at each other is not considered fighting. This is a way for them to communicate with each other, to get attention, and to show curiosity.
Mounting and circling may turn into fighting. If the dominant rabbit is mounting head to tail, you need to move them around. If the less dominant rabbit were to bite the genitals of the dominant rabbit, it could cause serious damage., You should only leave the rabbits together 10-20 minutes at a time, especially in the beginning. As they get more familiar with each other, you can increase the time to 30-40 minutes after the first few days. Once they start laying down together and grooming each other, the rabbits are bonded and can live together without supervision now.


You can add small obstacles or hide vegetables to help give the rabbits something to play with as they get to know each other.It can take a few days or a few weeks. It just depends on your particular rabbits and their temperaments. Keep at it until your rabbits are bonded., Sometimes, rabbits will continue to be aggressive or not make much progress in terms of bonding. If this happens to your rabbits, you can try to, essentially, force the issue. On a day where you are going to be home all day, set up a decent sized exercise pin in your living room and gather gloves and a spray bottle. Put the rabbits in the pin and pop in a movie. Keep an eye on them while you watch, making sure to spray them if they seem aggressive or look like they are going to fight.


After awhile, they will get tired of being sprayed and will start sulking. Eventually, one rabbit will go over to another and show submission, which starts the official bonding process.
You can also read a book or play a game with friends or family while you wait. Just make sure you pay attention to them so you can stop any hint at fighting.

This means that they are content.If your rabbit’s ears are lying back against its head but are not touching, this can be a sign that it is frightened. Look at other body language cues to verify if your rabbit seems to be resting or agitated. If the rabbit’s eyes are half closed and it is lying down, it is probably happy. If it is growling, it is probably angry and afraid.;
, If your rabbit is taking a break from exercise, it will often place its ears straight out and back, instead of lying completely down. This is a semi-relaxed pose and generally means that your rabbit wants to take a break before getting back to exercise., If your rabbit shakes its ears and then jumps, it is excited about something.

Open the door to your rabbit's cage. Make sure you're in a closed, rabbit-safe room. Do not pick your rabbit up and force him out of the cage. Allow him to make the decision to leave the cage on his own.
Let your rabbit come to you first. Sit in the room with your rabbit and allow him approach you on his own. If you see him coming your way, then you can start approaching him as well.
Talk to your rabbit calmly as you approach him. Offer him praise and reassurance so he knows you are not a threat.Unless you need to move your rabbit somewhere, it's best not to pick him up until he knows you. Rabbits may feel restrained when held and take the gesture as a threat. Instead of picking up your rabbit, try petting him slowly between the eyes as you get close to him.;
, In your rabbit's eyes, you look like a giant. If you want him to feel comfortable in your presence, try getting down to his level. This will lessen some of your rabbit's fear.


Try playing with your rabbit in a closed-off, rabbit safe room. Lie down on the floor so you're about eye level with your rabbit.Allow your rabbit to come to you. Rabbits are curious by nature. Your rabbit may sniff you or climb on you. Don't be alarmed by these behaviors. They're actually a sign your rabbit feels comfortable in your presence., Do not try to rush the bonding process with a new rabbit. This will only serve to alienate your rabbit and reverse any progress you've made. Have patience and allow things to happen at their own pace.


Let your rabbit choose the pace of the socialization process. Do not try to approach him if he's uninterested in you. If he does not want to come out of his cage one day, don't force him.Rabbits are all different. Some will be social very quickly while others may take a few weeks or months to bond with their owner. It's very important you let your rabbit's unique personality control the bonding process. Rabbits have good memories and if you do something to scare them, like forcing them out of their cage, it may take them awhile to trust you again., Food can be a great tool to bond with your rabbit. If your rabbit associates you with positive experiences, like getting treats, he'll be more eager to bond with you.


Try feeding your rabbit pellets from the palm of your hand. When you're refilling his food dish in the morning, see if he'll take a few pellets directly from you before you fill his bowl.When playing with your rabbit on the floor, offer him treats like fruits and veggies. Some owners put a bit of food on their backs while lying on their stomachs. This encourages your rabbit to climb on you, allowing him to get comfortable in your presence., You want to make sure you know how to read your rabbit. This way, you can tell if you're bonding with him successfully. You should be able to tell when your rabbit's feeling content and safe and when he needs his space.

If your rabbit spins in circles while making a honking noise, this means he's excited. If your rabbit spins and honks when he sees you, this a sign he's growing to like you.Rabbits grind their teeth both to show contentment and pain. A rabbit may grind his teeth when you're petting him, for example, if he's enjoying himself. However, pay close attention to the nature of the grinding as it can also be a sign of distress. If the grinding is loud and your rabbit's body is hunched up and tense, stop doing what you're doing. This is a sign your rabbit is upset.Rabbits may also growl to show anger. When annoyed, a rabbit may run away from you while kicking out with his back feet. In the wild, rabbits kick dirt at potential threats. If your rabbit is growling or kicking at you, it's a sign you're doing something to upset him."

Lie on the floor while your rabbit explores.",How to Get Your Bunny Used to You," You don't want to be fussing around looking for bedding or food bowls when you bring your rabbit home. She will be stressed after travel and desperate to retreat somewhere dark and quiet. Make sure you have a hutch that is large enough for an adult rabbit. It should be about two hops wide, three hops long, and tall enough for the rabbit to stand upright in. Have food, treats, water dispensers, toys, and straw ready.;
, Place the hutch in a quiet room that doesn't have noisy equipment such as a tumble dryer. Deep bed the hutch with straw or hay. Make a secluded sleeping area such as a sturdy wooden box stuffed with straw within the hutch.


Make sure other household pets (cats and dogs) can't sniff at the hutch. This will terrify the rabbit since dogs and cats are predators.

, Your rabbit will also appreciate having other hiding places around the house. Scatter several wide-diameter cardboard tubes or shoe boxes. This way, she has several places to hide or bolt if she gets scared while investigating.


Giving her hiding places doesn't teach her to hide. It just lets her do what feels natural. If she knows there are plenty of safe places available, then she'll be more likely to venture out in the first place., Quietly lift her from the carrier and place her in the hutch. Speak softly and handle her gently but firmly. If your rabbit seems nervous or anxious in the carrier, cover her with a towel before picking her up. The darkness of the towel (like being safe in a burrow) has a naturally calming effect which makes her feel safe and calm.


Be sure to support your rabbit's belly and hind legs with your hands when you move her to the hutch. Don't squeeze her.

, Don't handle your rabbit or lift her out of the hutch for the first 3 days after you bring her home. Let your rabbit become familiar and comfortable in her hutch. She may spend the first day hiding, but this is normal, so don't worry.Once she gets used to the sounds and smells, she will start to venture out. She may run and hide when she first hears a noise, but will grow bolder when she realizes it's not a threat.


Young rabbits are more curious than adults, so this process may be quicker for a youngster.

, Rabbits are likely to feel threatened by other household pets, even the scent of them. So wash your hands after handling your other pets and before touching your rabbit., Once your rabbit has had a chance to settle in and a few days have gone by, start hand-feeding her. Start by sitting next to her cage and just talk to her in a calm voice. If she bolts, just keep quietly talking and wait for her to come to you. Open the door and offer her a tasty treat, like a dandelion. If your rabbit doesn't have the confidence to come up to the dandelion, set it halfway between the two of you.

, When you feed or talk to your rabbit, rest your hand on the straw near the door. This way, she'll get used to your company while she eats.Top up her food bowl and chat to her as you do. Since rabbits learn by experience, she will soon associate you with food (a good thing). This will help calm your rabbit.

, Once she's comfortable eating in your presence, you can start to gently touch her. Don't overdo it by trying to pick her up. She may become stressed and try to fight back. Instead, quietly reach inside the hutch and touch her back or flank. If she doesn't run away, gently stroke her.


Avoid putting your hand over the top of her head. Objects passing over the rabbit's head signal danger (such as a hawk flying over a rabbit). This is likely to make the bunny scared.Make sure to approach her from the side or back.

, Once she's used to being stroked in her hutch, you can try picking her up. Sit on the ground, lift the rabbit out and put her on your lap on ground level. Keep some dandelions handy so that she has something tasty to nibble to distract her. Keep the session short, about one minute to start with. This way she won't start to panic. With practice you can keep your rabbit out longer and longer.


You should also keep a towel nearby in case your rabbit gets distressed. Then you can cover her with a towel. This will calm her. You can also scoop her up in the towel, which means you are less likely to get scratched if she panics., Once your rabbit is used to your presence and being picked up, you may want to let her roam in the house. Always supervise her, and start with one small room so that she doesn't feel overwhelmed. Check the room first and make sure there are no gaps for her to hide and get stuck in. Make sure there are no electrical cables for her to chew.


Rabbits will chew anything, so be alert and remove anything you don't want damaged.

, While your rabbit checks out her new environment, you should lie flat on the floor. This makes your height less intimidating for your rabbit and lets her sniff and investigate without feeling threatened. A good tip is to keep a treat in your pocket or hand, and reward her brave behavior with a snack.Keep the sessions short and sweet at first, no longer than 10 - 15 minutes. This way your rabbit won't get overtired.

Respect your rabbit!,
Get your bunny to love you.,
Learn more about these animals.,
Play with your bunny at least once a day.,
Never feed cereals, grains, nuts, seeds, corn, beans, peas, breads, biscuits, sweets, sugar, breakfast cereals, chocolate or any garden plants that are toxic to rabbits.

,
Bunnies are intelligent, playful and curious.,
Don't expect your bunny to have an immediate rapport with your bunny.",How to Love Your Rabbit," If he's seems tired, leave him alone. If he doesn't seem to want to be petted, don't pet him. If he seems wants exercise, let him out of the cage for a while. Watch his body behavior and respect his emotions.;
, It can be very hard to love a bunny who nips you every time you touch him. Give him his favorite food, be gentle, etc., and do things for him that would make you happy.

, There's lots of myths about them which really aren't true. It would be much better to know who you're caring for.

, Take him out and play with him. Don't show him off to other people, as this can make him feel uncomfortable.

,, Chew toys are essential for dental health as well as providing mental stimulation to prevent your rabbit from being bored or potentially destructive.




, Rewards will be reaped if the introductions are supervised and patiently increased. Rabbits are prey animals and instinctively feel initially threatened.



"
"
Open your rabbit's cage.,
Get down on the floor.,
Do something that does not involve moving around, loud noises, or the rabbit.,
Continue doing this for at least half an hour daily.

,
Eventually, your rabbit will see that you don't pose a threat.,
Your rabbit may begin to feel more comfortable around you and stay near you for longer periods of time.,
With time and patience, your rabbit should start to see you as a friend, or at least, a good source of treats.

,
Don't be afraid if your rabbit decides not to come out one day.,
Offer treats.",How to Befriend a Shy Rabbit," Ideally, you have a cage where the rabbit can enter or exit at will. But if you don't, set the rabbit on the floor of an enclosed, rabbit proof area.;
, Rabbits tend to find people much less threatening (and more interesting) when they're down at floor level. Lie down if you can, sit if you can't.

, You can watch a TV show or listen to music, so long as neither one is too loud. Read a book. Do a crossword. Talk to someone you like on the phone. (Make sure the conversation is pleasant and low key.) You can even do homework or pay bills, so long as you're calm and quiet.

,, He or she will probably come over to investigate you and may even hop up on you. Don't make physical contact just yet. You can talk to the rabbit in a soft, gentle voice.

, At this point, you can start interacting with your rabbit a little more. Healthy treats are a good way to encourage your rabbit to come and see you. If your rabbit seems particularly comfortable around you, you can try petting him or her. Start by stroking the forehead with just two fingers and see what your rabbit thinks.

,, This is quite ordinary and does not mean your rabbit has become shy again.

, Treats usually lure the rabbit, just be silent, patient, and don't move. Make sure the bunny knows it isn't a trap.

Recognize that your bunny is begging for food with its ears up.,
Watch for signs of ear trouble with shaking ears.,
Be attentive to the differences between a resting and frightened rabbit.",How to Read Bunny Ear Signals2," Rabbits tend to sit on their hind legs with their nose and ears in the air when they are alert. Domesticated rabbits often assume this position when they are trying to get their owner’s attention and get fed., If your bunny shakes its ears and then starts scratching at them, it is trying to get something out of its ear. Often, this is just harmless hair. However, if your bunny has been doing it frequently, it might be because it has ear mites., If your rabbits’ ears are resting against its head, but they are not touching, this can be a sign that it is frightened, rather than resting. If your bunny is frightened, it is also likely to have bulging eyes and will bare its teeth. It will often thump its feet when it is frightened."
"
Watch for alert ears that stand up and/or twitch.,
Watch for a semi-alert rabbit to keep one ear up and one down.,
Look for an inquisitive bunny to put its ears forward.",How to Read Bunny Ear Signals3," When your rabbit’s ears are standing straight up in the air or are twitching, they are listening attentively for something. This generally means that they are alert and aware of something in their surroundings., When your rabbit has one ear standing straight up and the other lying down, it is listening for sounds, but also trying to relax. This is common for a bunny that is enjoying some sun., When rabbits are interested in something, they will often stand on all fours and stretch their tail and their head out. Their nose and ears will be stretched out forward to inspect what is in front of them."
"
Choose a pair that bonds well.,
Allow the rabbits to interact through separate cages.,
Have the first meeting on neutral territory.,
Let the rabbits interact for 20 minutes a day.,
Try allowing them to share a cage when the relationship seems stable.",How to Socialize Your Rabbit2," If you want to introduce two rabbits, consider the pair. Certain combinations of rabbits, like males and females, bond easier than others. If possible, choose a second rabbit that has a good chance of bonding with your first.


You should spay or neuter rabbits before pairing them. If you have a male and female pair, this prevents breeding. Hormonal-driven aggression is also less likely in spayed or neutered rabbits.
Two males or two females are more likely to fight with one another. If you're getting a second adult rabbit, things will go smoother if you pick a rabbit of a different gender.Two babies usually bond very well. An adult and baby may bond easier than an adult and another adult.If at all possible, get two rabbits at the same time. It's much easier for a pair to bond if both of them are in new, neutral territory., Unless a pair has lived together previously, you should never throw two rabbits together right away. Keep the rabbits in separate cages, but in the same room. Allow them to observe one another through their cages.You might want to try swapping toys or bedding between cages. This gives your rabbits a chance to get used to one another's smells.

, When you feel ready to let your rabbits interact, choose a neutral territory. Rabbits can get territorial and even aggressive if another rabbit is in their territory. Therefore, choose a location in your home neither rabbit frequents. For example, you can introduce them on the kitchen counter or in a closed off room, like your bathroom.Keep a few obstacles in the room, like toys and nest boxes. You can also add some food in the middle of the room. This may encourage the rabbits to interact.You should observe your rabbits closely during their first introduction. There is always a risk of fighting. If your rabbits do fight, break them up immediately. You can use a spray bottle to quell them or pull the rabbits apart. It's a good idea to wear protective gloves during the first introduction. In the event of a fight, separate the rabbits and try again the next day., If the first introduction is fairly successful, allow the rabbits to start interacting about 20 minutes a day. Again, keep them in a neutral territory. Observe interactions so you can break up any potential fights.Watch for aggressive body language, as this may mean a fight is brewing. If your rabbits seem to be getting hostile with one another, it's a good idea to separate them. If your rabbit's tail is erect, his body is tense, and his ears are back, this is a sign of aggression. Also, watch for noises like growling. These can indicate the rabbit feels threatened., If your rabbits seem comfortable together, try keeping them in the same cage. For the first couple of weeks, observe your rabbits at all times when they're sharing a cage. Make sure they're in separate cages at night. If all seems well after a few weeks, you can safely leave your rabbits in the cage together unsupervised. Most rabbits enjoy having a companion as it lessens loneliness when their owners are away at work or school."
"
Spay or neuter your rabbit.,
Reintroduce rabbits if they're separated for an extended period.,
Approach your rabbit from the side.,
Introduce your rabbit to new people slowly.",How to Socialize Your Rabbit3," Spaying and neutering your rabbits can reduce hormone-driven behaviors which can interfere with the socialization process. If possible, adopt a rabbit who has already been spayed or neutered. If your rabbit has not been spayed or neutered at adoption, talk to your vet about making an appointment.In addition to helping with socialization, spaying female rabbits reduces the risk of uterine cancer., Most rabbits will bond for life after the initial introduction process. However, if your rabbits are separated for a long time repeat the introduction process. Rabbits have decent memories and will probably remember their cage mates. However, it's better safe than sorry. You do not want your rabbits to fight with one another, which can lead to injury and even death.Rabbits do grieve. In the event one of your rabbits dies, wait a few months before getting a new rabbit. Your surviving rabbit may react poorly to a new cage mate if he is still mourning the loss of his friend., Rabbits eyes are placed on either side of their heads. This means rabbits cannot see directly in front of themselves. Never approach a rabbit directly in front, as he will not be able to see you coming. This can be very scary. Always approach your rabbit from the side so he knows you're coming., If your rabbit has bonded with you, he may be more friendly with other people. However, you should still err on the side of caution. With new people, allow your rabbit to choose when and if he wants to interact with others.


If you have a new household member, allow that person to spend some time alone in a room with the rabbit. Instruct that person to follow a similar regimen to the one you used to bond with your rabbit. Allow the rabbit to come to the new person first. Encourage the new person to use treats and toys to win the rabbit's favor. If your rabbit has already been socialized with you, the process may go quicker this time around.
If you have friends over that want to see your rabbit, encourage them to allow the rabbit to sniff their hands before they pet or handle him. Coax your rabbit out of the cage if your friends want to play with him. If he seems skittish or unhappy, inform your friends your rabbit needs some space. Leave the rabbit alone for an hour or so before trying to introduce him to your friends again.

Practice obedience training.,
Find a neutral space.,
Put the rabbit in a safe environment, such as a travel cage.,
Secure the dog.,
Ask for help.",How to Introduce a Dog and a Rabbit2," Your dog should be trained well and able to respond well to voice commands. Your dog should be able to listen and respond to your command. You will be in control of this introduction.Your dog should know basic commands like sit, stay, and lie down. You can teach your best friend these simple commands in a few ways:


Take obedience training classes. Many vets can recommend a good dog trainer. Some pet stores even offer puppy socialization and obedience classes. You and your dog can not only learn helpful commands, but also work on creating a strong bond. Your dog will be more likely to listen and pay attention to you if she feels comfortable with you as an owner and authority figure. Practice commands with your dog. If you and your dog need a refresher course on basic commands like sit, you should practice with your dog in a comfortable place like at home. Practicing these commands will allow the dog to become familiar with your cues and she will be more willing to listen to you. You want these commands to be comfortable with both you and the dog.

, You do not want either pet to feel territorial in the introductory space. You also want a place where you can control both animals. A good introductory place might be a living room or family room. You want to avoid places where either animal eats or sleep, as they may feel territorial of the space. You do not want either animal to feel pressured. A neutral space can help the animal to not have additional external stresses. Meeting new friends is stressful enough! Make sure you dog is not feeling confined with too tight of a leash or collar.
The neutral space will help you relax as well. You want to be able to be comfortable in this space and be able to observe interactions. Pick a place that is comfortable for all involved.

, For the first meeting, you may want to keep the rabbit in a safe space in which the rabbit cannot run away. This will also keep your rabbit safe if something unpredictable happens.

, During the first meeting, you want to make sure you have your dog under firm control. Experts suggest keeping your dog sitting or lying down. This allows you to keep a firm eye on the dog, as well as a way to control him.

, Ask a family member or friend to help by holding your rabbit or dog. You want the most supervision possible and having an extra set of hands and eyes will work to your advantage. .

"
Introduce them slowly.,
Bring them closer together.,
Keep an eye on them.,
Keep sessions short.",How to Introduce a Dog and a Rabbit3," Do not make sudden moves or throw the two animals together too quickly. You should bring one animal into the room with the other to let them get used to each other scents. Give them time to acquaint themselves. You do not want to put pressure on either animal and scare them.
Be positive with the slow introduction. Encourage your pets with positive verbal cues like: ""Good girl,"" or ""Gentle."" Your pets should hear and react your authoritative and gentle tones.

, The next step is to bring them closer together. You may want to let the rabbit approach the dog. This may help not trigger the rabbit’s natural instinct to run, which may trigger the dog’s instinct to hunt Watch the body language during this introduction. If the rabbit is kicking, breathing hard, or trying to escape, then remove the dog from the room and let the rabbit calm down. Also be aware that a stressed rabbit may sit in a hunkered down position and attempt to 'play dead.' If the rabbit is not running away, it does not necessarily mean he is accepting the dog's presence - he may just be too frightened to move.
If the dog is acting too excited, take time to calm the dog down by having it sit and stay for a few minutes while she calms down.

, Under no circumstances, do not leave the two animals alone with each other during the first couple of meetings. No matter how much they seem to be getting along, you do not want to take any chances.


Make sure each animal is in the right mood for a meeting. Animals, like people, can have bad days. You do not want the first few meetings to happen if an animal is ill or under stress.

, Too long exposure to each other may cause too much excitement. This may cause accidental injury to either animal. Watch the excitement level of both animals; once one starts to show symptoms of stress, it is time to stop.

"
"
Practice the routine.,
Always pay attention to your pets.,
Separate feeding areas.,
Be patient.",How to Introduce a Dog and a Rabbit4," Your pets may not hit it off right away, and that’s okay. Practice introducing your pets to each other until it becomes a routine. Eventually, your pets will get used to seeing and smelling each other.

, Just like children, you do not want to leave your pets unattended! Something may happen to trigger an aggressive instinct in your dog. Perhaps a loud noise might spook the rabbit. Keep an eye on your pets to ensure they are safe. , Animals can be territorial around feeding time or feeding areas. Feed your pets in different rooms. If either shows aggression when eating, try feeding them at different times. Other territorial places may include where the animal sleeps or relieves himself. Keep a watchful eye when the rabbit and dog interact near these places.
They may act territorial toward you. They may grow jealous of the other with your attention. Make sure you show each animal care without riling protective instincts from the other one.

, Making new friends can be challenging! Give your pets time to get used to you, your house, and each other.

Check if your rabbit is pregnant.,
Expect the pregnancy of your doe to run for 31 to 33 days.It is possible that a doe with a smaller litter (say four kits or less) will have a slightly longer pregnancy than a doe with a litter that is larger than four.,
Provide proper and complete nutrition for your doe during pregnancy.,
Provide your doe with a nest box.,
Be aware of the possible problems associated with a rabbit pregnancy.,
Know what to expect at the birth (kindling).,
Once all kits are born, check to see if everything is fine.,
Take care of the kits and the doe together.,
Find suitable homes for the kits.",How to Take Care of a Pregnant Rabbit," Medium to large size rabbits are sexually mature at 4 to 4.5 months, while giant breeds are ready at 6 to 9 months.If your female rabbit is at this stage of maturity and you have reason to suspect that she has been breeding, then check for pregnancy as follows. A pregnancy can be detected between 10 to 14 days after mating, with 12 days being optimal;between these days, the fetuses will start to grow rapidly, causing them to be detectable by touch, and they will feel like the size of grapes.Be gentle when feeling for them! Be aware that false pregnancy is common in rabbits,so even if you find all the signs, you are probably best checking in with your vet as well. These are some of the other signs that your rabbit is pregnant:


In the third week, your doe may begin to show increased abdomen size. You may also see slight movement.
She starts to have mood swings and is easily annoyed. She may also not want to be held or stroked. Your doe may begin growling at you or act differently towards you. She may begin resting on her side more to deal with discomfort of the growing kits engorging her abdomen space.
When there are around two to three days left of pregnancy, she will begin nesting. This typically consists of her pulling out her fur.
Note that none of these signs alone are sufficient to diagnose pregnancy. Rabbits do have false pregnancies due to hormonal fluctuations,they can also gain weight and dig in the bowls for other reasons. And conversely, many pregnant does show no signs of pregnancy until a few minutes before they are ready to kindle.;
, The main concern is to know the start of the pregnancy (you may need your vet's help), as the time of birthing should not go beyond 32 days, in which case your doe needs to see the vet promptly.Without inducing labor after day 32, a litter of dead kits is likely by day 34., Your doe will need special changes to her diet to ensure that she is getting adequate nutrition; a doe with nutritional deficiencies may abort or reabsorb the fetuses.Due to her carrying more weight, she will need extra nutrition to her eating habits. Provide her with high quality food along with fresh, clean unlimited amounts of water.


Slowly make changes to her diet (rabbits should always experience gradual dietary changes) to include foods like: carrots, celery, cucumber, lettuce, rabbit pellets, stacks of hay, tomatoes, parsley. A diet of alfalfa hay instead of grass hay should be instituted, as well as offering more rabbit pellets than normal.Ensure access to clean water at all times.
As she is pregnant, her body will be demanding more. Mix up the vegetables above into a salad with a bowl of water.
A couple of days before delivery, cut back on food but not water.Doing so will mean that your doe will have a less chance of experiencing medical problems such as mastitis and ketosis.Cut the diet down to fifty percent of normal amount two days before the expected birth date.Once over, gradually go back to her normal diet and she should be back to normal within one to two weeks of kindling., A nest box is where she will give birth and take care of her young. The nest box is essential because kits are born naked, blind, and deaf and have no ability to regulate their own temperature until day 7.Nest boxes can be purchased from pet stores, and should at least 4 inches (10cm) wider and longer than the doe. The nest box should be provided to your doe 26 days into her gestation period.Your doe will pick fur from her own body (dewlap, belly, and thighs) for her nest box,but you can help her by providing her with straw and paper.
If you decide to build your own nesting box, use clean wood, but never use plywood or particle board, as these products contain high concentrations of formaldehyde, which is toxic and can cause not only epithelial respiratory drying, but also permanent respiratory passage and neurological damage.

, Forewarned is always forearmed and you're better at preventing problems if you know what might crop up. With a pregnant rabbit, the following problems can arise:


Mastitis – This is an inflammation of the mammary glands found on the rabbit's belly. At the time of being about to deliver, your doe's mammary glands will fill with milk for feeding the kits. Mastitis occurs if bacteria gets into the milk duct and travels into the mammary gland. This can occur as a result of a poorly formed gland (talk to your vet about checking your doe's glands prior to birth), or because she is in an unhygienic environment (ensure that her bedding, her nest, her housing, etc., are impeccably clean and non-abrasive).The real tragedy is that an infected gland that is not caught in time will pass infected milk on to the kits and they'll die.Check the doe every day post-birth to see any signs of swelling or redness, indicators of possible mastitis; if the mammary glands are blue, then the infection is very severe.Other signs include refusing to drink and eat, running a fever, and appearing depressed.Get her straight to the vet as she needs immediate antibiotic care.
Pregnancy toxemia – This can occur in a doe that has not received adequate nutrition during pregnancy (and false pregnancy), so it is important to ensure that your doe gets a high energy diet for late pregnancy, that she does not fast, and that she does not get obese.It can occur either late in pregnancy or after delivery and occurs most in Dutch, Polish, and English rabbit breeds.The symptoms include acting depressed, weakness, lack of coordination, and convulsions.If left untreated, she can die within hours, so get her to the vet immediately for treatment with an IV drip and dextrose.Killing her young – Some does will kill and eat their young.The reasons for this vary and it pays to remove any possible reasons: ensure that the nesting area is warm at all times, remove kits that fail to nurse, keep the nest clean, and keep other pets (especially dogs) away from the nest to reduce the doe's nervousness.Do not use a rabbit for breeding if she kills two litters in a row., You should have a good idea of your rabbit's gestation period, either because you know from breeding timing, or you have consulted with your vet and got an agreed date of expected delivery. Some things to be aware of when your doe is giving birth include:


Kindling usually occurs in the morning.Most rabbit births occur quickly, born head or feet first. However, some labor can continue for a day or two, before all kits have arrived.Dystocia, or a problem giving birth, is not usual with rabbits, so you probably won't need to help her give birth. Do be sure that the area is quiet, free of anything that could make her nervous, such as noise, other pets, unusual lights, too much heat or cold, etc. Anything that causes her to be too excited or threatened can bring her to harm or eat her kits.

, Make sure they are healthy, breathing and drinking their mother's milk. A litter can contain up to a dozen kits. Once born, the dam will nurse them, but not continuously. Provide her with continuous fresh water as it's vital for a nursing rabbit.


It can be fun having newborn rabbits, but do not disturb the dam or the kits. Disturbing them can stress and frighten them.
Wait a couple hours, then offer your doe a favourite treat to keep her occupied while you check the kits. Remove any dead kits, as they can rot and infect the healthy ones. Once done, cover them back up with nesting material and leave them be.
If you find that there are more kits than the nipples (8 to 10 nipples), they can be fostered in the first three days to a doe with a smaller litter.Just be sure to cover them with the fur from the new doe to get them accepted, and try moving the stronger, larger kits to increase the success of the transfer.Unfortunately, raising kits by hand tends to have a high death rate.Does will nurse only once to twice daily, with each kit getting about three minutes of feeding time., Kits will nurse at least until about 4 to 5 weeks,as which point they are weaned by the doe slowing down her milk production. Keep an eye on the doe's general health and the manner in which she interacts with her kits. If there is any aggressive behavior, deal with it as needed or call your vet to discuss. Some things to bear in mind with new kits:Kits with a sunken stomach are not getting enough milk; a full stomach is a sign of proper feeding.
Some people recommend not to touch newborn rabbits as they will get the human scent on them and the dam will eat them out of fear or rejection. This is a myth! Domestic rabbits are already used to the smell and presence of humans. Most importantly,you should handle a kit if it falls out of the nest, as she won't try to put it back in.
Upon opening their eyes at about 10 days of age, check for eyes stuck shut or for infections.
Until the age of 8 months, keep kits fed on rabbit pellets.
Leave the kits with mother until 6-7 weeks of age. At this point, if the litter is large, you can remove the largest pair or trio and place them in their own cage. This will give a chance to the smaller ones to nurse for a week longer and catch up in weight.
Kits should all be removed from mother by 8 weeks, as the doe may get nippy at them and try to shake them off. This also gives the kit a chance to explore its new environment.

, Whether or not the breeding was intentional, it's important to find a good home for the rabbit babies. If the pregnancy was accidental, take all precautions to prevent impregnation again in the future; the phrase ""to breed like rabbits"" isn't a cliché without good reason and there is such an over-abundance of rabbits in the world that human-caused additions are not helping. Consider getting your does spayed and your bucks neutered to prevent future ""surprise"" pregnancies, if this one was such. If re-breeding for showing, as pets, or other purposes, it is best to wait 35 to 42 days after the birth of the initial litter, to give her time to recuperate and care for her current litter.For information on breeding rabbits, see How to breed rabbits for more information.


Be aware! Re-breeding can occur any time from 72 hours after your doe has given birth!This means taking care to keep her away from male rabbits from the moment of birth.

This means that it's important to separate the rabbits into same sex groups before or around 3 months of age.It can be difficult to find the sex of a rabbit that is a few days old. You can attempt it at a younger age, but to definitively find the sex of your rabbits, wait until they are at least 4 weeks old.;
, If you are not used to finding the sex of rabbits, it's best to start with an adult. If you have the parents of a litter of rabbits, you can take a look at the anatomy of the mother and father rabbit. This will help you see what a fully developed rabbit looks like.


If you are still not confident, you can ask your veterinary clinic for help. Take your rabbits to your local veterinarian for help if necessary., Pick a rabbit to start with. Like most mammals, the rabbit's genitals are between his back legs. To see this area, the rabbit needs to lie on his back. It is helpful to have an extra person around to hold the rabbit so you have both hands free. Get your helper to sit in a chair and cover her lap with a towel. This is in case the rabbit urinates.


Tell her to use one hand to grasp the rabbit's scruff and use her other hand to scoop under his rump. She should then lift and turn the rabbit onto his back. Lay the rabbit with his head towards her stomach and tail on the edge of her knees. This will give you easy access to the genital area.You may want to wear gloves since you are going to be touching a rabbit's genital regions. It is more hygienic as well as safer. You may unintentionally spread disease to the rabbit or to your other rabbits if you don't., If you are checking a rabbit by yourself, flip the rabbit onto his back. To do this, place your index finger between the rabbit's ears and grasp the base of the head with your thumb on one side and your other three fingers on the other. With your other hand, cradle the rump and scoop the rabbit up.


Once you have flipped your rabbit, place it between the arm holding the head and your body and let go of the rump. Your rabbit should be secure in one arm.
You can also lay the rabbit on a low table. Gently but firmly hold them at all times. Make sure the table is low enough that, if the rabbit squirms enough to get away, jumping off the table won't injure him., To find the sex of your rabbit, examine the rabbit's external genitalia. While he is on his back, part the fur between his legs. You or your assistant should gently hold him in place while you part the fur with your hand.


If he starts to squirm too much, try to sooth him by talking to him and petting him. You don't want him to get hurt while you are working. , Male rabbits have testicles, which are visible on the outside of their bodies. These are located in his groin between the back legs. Rabbit testicles are long and narrow, rather than round and ball-like as on dogs. Look for two torpedo shaped bulges, one on either side below the skin. They are usually slightly furred and purple in color.


The scrotum can be covered in fur, so you may need to dampen the fur in this area with water to make the testicles clearer to see.
Testicles can usually be detected from 10 weeks of age. Before this age, they can be tiny and hard to spot reliably. However, no matter the rabbit's age, it's easy to check before you look for the penis.
In a well-developed adult male rabbit, the answer will be obvious because you can spot his testicles right away.If you don't spot testicles straight away, be aware that frightened rabbits can pull their testicles into the abdomen and make them disappear. Talk to the rabbit, stroke his side, and see if you can encourage him to relax. Then check a second time. If you still don't see them, it is inconclusive. Check the genital openings instead., You now need to look to see if your rabbit has a vulva or a penis. To locate these, gently part the fur between the back legs until you identify a small mound. This area is the vent and contains the opening to the anus and the reproductive tract. To see it more clearly, apply gentle pressure on either side, which opens up the area and makes things clearer to see.


The genital opening is the one farthest from the tail. Apply gentle pressure with a finger and thumb on either side of the opening. If the rabbit is female, you will see a slit like structure, commonly described as a letter I. If the rabbit is male you will see a round structure, which can be described as an O.
The opening closest to the tail is the anus. This is identical in both males and females. If you look closely, you can check it is the anus by watching for the muscular winking of the anal ring., If you want to be extra sure, or it you cannot distinguish between the I and the O, you can double check your finding. Apply gentle pressure at the base of the opening, pushing gently towards the rabbit's back.


If a penis is present, it will sometimes protrude and become more obvious as a tube like structure.
If a vulva is present, the lips tend to peel back in a petal shape. , There are some people that say you can tell the gender of a rabbit by looking at his physical characteristics. Although mature adult bucks can have a heavier skull than female rabbits, this is not a reliable way to sex a rabbit. Unfortunately, the external physical characteristics, such as the size and shape, are not distinctive enough between the genders to make this useful with regards to determining the sex of your rabbit.


Always check the rabbit's genitalia to be completely sure of the sex of your rabbit. , Checking your rabbit's sex at home is usually effective. If it is important that you know the sex of your rabbit for breeding or other purposes, take your rabbit to your vet for verification. The vet will be able to tell for sure what the sex of your rabbit is.


If you have multiple rabbits, you can take them at the same time.

Spend time together alone.,
Open the rabbit’s hutch at floor level.,
Let your rabbit come to you.,
Offer a treat.,
Be patient.,
Hold off on touching.,
Repeat this process daily.",How to Earn Your Rabbit's Trust1," Rabbits can easily be startled or overwhelmed by the noise and movement of multiple people. Similarly, other pets are likely to terrify a pet rabbit until they’re used to their presence. In order to start earning your rabbit’s trust, join your rabbit in the room where it lives without any other humans or animals present., A door out of the hutch at floor level is especially important. You want to avoid reaching in and out of the rabbit’s hutch, as this is the space where they need to feel safe. Accordingly, give your rabbit the freedom to choose when they come out of their hutch by choosing a hutch with a door that will allow them to leave and re-enter comfortably., After opening the hutch, take a few steps away. Lie or crouch on the floor away from the hutch. Wait for your rabbit to approach. Stay calm, as your rabbit may sense your frustration or impatience and become frightened. Rest assured that your rabbit’s curiosity will cause them to come say hello., To motivate the rabbit to come out and spend time with you, offer a treat. Place the treat in the palm of your outstretched hand. Go with small pieces of carrots, apples, or bananas. A pinch of oats may also be enticing to your rabbit.Veggies and fruits should not amount to more than 10% of the rabbit’s total diet. Rabbits should eat mostly hay.Never feed your rabbit anything with chocolate, caffeine, or high amounts of sugar or fat.

, At first, this process will be rather slow. Don’t expect to open the hutch, lie down, and immediately have a rabbit eating out of your hand. The rabbit must feel safe enough to leave its hutch. Accordingly, they must determine that you are not a threat before they will approach. Send the message that you are a friend by staying calm, with a relaxed posture and slow, infrequent movement.This process may take an hour or so. Your rabbit’s natural curiosity will eventually compel them to come and investigate.

, As your rabbit approaches, it may be tempting to reach out and greet them with a quick pet. Don’t! Simply let the rabbit smell you. They may even hop onto you to or burrow around your body to investigate. Allow them to familiarize themselves with you, as this will teach them you are not dangerous.If the rabbit begins to eat the treat you’ve offered, hold your hand still.

, After doing this several times, your rabbit will begin to emerge from their hutch more quickly. Start touching with gentle, slow scratches on your rabbit’s head. If the rabbit pulls away, let them go and don’t touch them again that day. Never chase them – this will cause them to fear you."
"
Increase cuddling at the rabbit’s pace.,
Offer something for your rabbit to chew.,
Try some nose nuzzling.,
Keep excitable children away.",How to Earn Your Rabbit's Trust2," Once your rabbit is comfortable with you scratching their head, you can begin to pet their back as well. Limit your petting to head scratches and back rubs until the rabbit lies down beside you. They may even hop right alongside you and lie down with their back against your arm. Allow them to dictate the amount of physical contact they are comfortable with., Aside from edible treats, you have other options to help get your rabbit to warm up to you. Offer a stick to chew on or mineral chews designed specifically for rabbits. Rabbits enjoy chewing on things, and they must do so frequently to maintain the health of their teeth.Opt for apple, willow, aspen, and pine branches. Untreated pine lumber can also be used to build a hay basket. Your rabbit can then safely chew on the basket that stores its food!
Never give your rabbit apricot or peach tree branches.

, Even once your rabbit is comfortable around you and will come out to greet you, they may be startled by your hand movements. If this seems to be the case, lie on your stomach with your hands at your sides or on your back. The rabbit may approach your face. Hum softly and lowly, to mimic friendly rabbit communication. Your rabbit may even rub their nose and cheeks against your own., Until a child is willing to sit calmly and quietly around a rabbit, it may be best to keep them away from one another. Definitely do not allow a child to hold a rabbit until the rabbit goes to the child on its own accord. Even then, make sure the child knows that rabbits are fragile, and prone to skittishness.Understand that most rabbits do not like to be held or handled for more than a few moments.

Get your rabbit fixed.,
Hold a rabbit correctly.,
Watch for signs of injury or illness.",How to Earn Your Rabbit's Trust3," The most important step you can take in increasing your rabbit’s lifespan is getting them fixed. This will also likely make it easier to get along with your rabbit. Neutering a male rabbit and spaying a female rabbit will greatly reduce the risk of disease, and will prevent rabbits of both sexes from becoming aggressive. Have these procedures performed once a rabbit is four months old.
Be sure to take your rabbits to a vet that has experience caring for rabbits.

, Though you want to minimize the amount of time you spend holding most rabbits, it is safe to do so for a short time. Make sure to fully support the weight of the rabbit’s body. Always use your arm or body to provide a surface for your rabbit's hind legs as well.Never lift a rabbit by its ears.
Never hold a rabbit with its belly upward.

, Even if they’re shy, your rabbit should be active and alert. A healthy rabbit will frequently walk around its cage, eating, drinking, and making soft noises. If these behaviors are not occurring, look for other signs your rabbit may be sick. Make sure breathing is clear, and that the rabbit’s eyes and fur look healthy. If your rabbit begins to lose weight or hair, is lethargic, or has discharge coming from any part of their body, take them to a veterinarian."

Contact a vet.,
Ask lots of questions.,
Find out how to provide pre-surgical care.,
Obtain a rabbit carrier.,
Don’t worry about your rabbit.",How to Get Rabbits Spayed or Neutered1," If you have a vet already, contact them and let them know you’d like your rabbit spayed or neutered. If you don’t have a vet yet, contact local vets in your area. Look for one with experience dealing with rabbits.If you have a friend with rabbits or other pets, you could ask them for a recommendation.
A list of doctors associated with the House Rabbit Society is available on their website at rabbit.org/vet-listings.;
, Don’t hesitate to ask your vet questions if you’re looking for answers to specific questions relating to your rabbit. You should definitely ask about the cost of the surgery, as well as pre and post-surgical care. Find out, for instance, what your rabbit can eat after the operation. Other questions you might want to ask include:Will my bunny be in pain?
How can I help my rabbit recover after the surgery?
Do you anticipate any problems based on my rabbit’s age and health?
What is your success rate for spays/neuters of rabbits?
How much does is costs to spay or neuter my bunny?

, Before spaying or neutering, most vets recommend that you keep your pet’s diet stable. You might administer acidophilus to your rabbit. Acidophilus a probiotic, a bacterial supplement that can aid digestion and minimize risk of infections.Check your local pet store to find rabbit-friendly acidophilus supplements if you’re interested. Follow manufacturer directions .
Some people are surprised that they do no need to withhold food before their rabbit get anesthetized. But because rabbits cannot vomit, there is no need to disrupt their eating schedule., Your vet will not come to you. Therefore, it is important to find a carrier in which you can safely and securely transport your bunny to and from the vet. A good carrier will have a gated opening on both the front and side. The carrier should offer some room for your bunny to move around, but should not be too big.When turned sideways in the carrier, your bunny's front and back legs should be able to touch the sides.
Place a warm blanket or towel in the bottom of the carrier so your bunny can stay warm after the surgery.
Drive slowly and carefully when your rabbit is in the car. Handling your rabbit gently is especially important when bringing it home from the operation, since moving too roughly with it could cause pain and loosen its stitches.
Do not use cardboard boxes or containers of nylon or cloth to transport your bunny. Your bunny might chew through these materials.

, Spaying and neutering are some of the most common surgeries for pets. Vets who perform these surgeries have likely done them hundreds of times with a high rate of success.Other people worry that spaying or neutering will change their rabbit’s personality. But if you spay or neuter at a young age (younger than two years old), your rabbit’s personality should remain intact.


Rabbits spayed after the age of two will also basically remain the same, but could be slightly less affectionate.
Although the surgery itself only takes around 30 minutes, your rabbit needs to be prepared for surgery and then monitored after they recover. Expect to leave the rabbit with the vet and collect them later in the day.

"
"
Understand why spaying and neutering is important.,
Identify your rabbit’s sex.,
Don’t spay or neuter too early.,
Don’t wait too long.",How to Get Rabbits Spayed or Neutered2," There are many reasons why you might choose to spay or neuter your rabbit. Rabbits who are spayed or neutered live longer than those who are not, and have a lower risk for certain cancers. They also have better temperaments, and are more relaxed and loving than rabbits that don’t get spayed or neutered. This makes them easier to train and more affectionate than other rabbits. Plus, you don’t have to worry about your rabbit breeding if it shares space with another rabbit of the opposite sex., If your pet is female, it will need to be spayed. If it is male, it will need to be neutered. In order to identify your rabbit’s sex, cradle your bunny gently in your arms. It should be sitting in a position where its belly is facing up, and its back is nestled in the crook of your arm. Hold the bunny steady and look at the region toward the bottom of its belly between its back legs.Female rabbits will have a small prepuce, a protuberance that covers the vulva. Pressing down gently on the side of the prepuce facing you will reveal the vulva.
Male rabbits are most easily identified by the presence of testicles -- two hairless, round sacs, usually pink or gray in color, and crisscrossed by a network of blood vessels.

, You can neuter or spay your rabbit once it reaches the age of about five months old. Some female rabbits need to wait a bit longer and can only be spayed after they reach six months of age. Your vet will tell you if your pet is an acceptable candidate for spaying or neutering.Rabbits younger than five months (their age of sexual maturity) cannot be safely operated on.

, When a rabbit hits a certain age, it becomes riskier to perform surgery on them. For any rabbit over the age of 2, your vet will probably recommend a full health checkup and bloodwork before going forward with the operation. And after about the age of six, rabbits do not respond as well to anesthetics and take longer to recover. Some vets might spay or neuter after that age, but you might have a harder time finding someone who agrees to perform the operation."
"
Prevent against hypothermia.,
Provide post-surgical care.,
Feed your rabbit appropriately.,
Monitor the incision.,
Separate male and female rabbits.",How to Get Rabbits Spayed or Neutered3," Hypothermia is a rapid decline in body temperature, and is usually associated with exposure to cold temperatures over a prolonged period. But hypothermia is not uncommon in rabbits when they get surgery because their small bodies do not retain as much heat as a larger animal. Most vets provide a heating pad beneath the rabbit during surgery, and in an incubator when it stays overnight at the clinic for recovery.Once you bring the rabbit home, provide warm blankets (putting them through a tumble in the dryer first is a good idea) and check your rabbit’s body temperature.
If you touch your bunny’s belly and it feels cool, turn up the ambient temperature. Consider putting a heating pad in or near one portion of the cage so your bunny can get warmer.

, After your rabbit has been spayed or neutered, they will need to recover. Keep your rabbit in a peaceful, warm, quiet, and relaxing environment where they will be feel safe and free of stress. Your doctor will probably provide or prescribe a painkiller for your rabbit. Listen to your doctor’s directions and administer the medication in the recommended dosages.Some vets keep the rabbit at their clinic overnight.
If you bring your rabbit home, consider using a heating pad or heated blanket to keep it warm.
If the spay or neuter was done to solve another health condition, your bunny might need antibiotics., Female rabbits will probably not want to eat for 12-24 hours following the surgery. After this period, though, it is important to get your rabbit to eat something in order to move along the recovery process. Male rabbits will usually emerge from the surgery hungry and looking to eat. Be sure they have food and water waiting for them if you’re able to take them home. Provide your rabbit with some of its favorite foods in order to inspire its appetite.

, Look for signs of infection. It is normal for the scrotum to remain swollen for one or two weeks in male rabbits. Any redness, swelling, or yellowish crust or pus at the site of the incision beyond two weeks, however, should be cause for alarm.Additionally, handle your bunny gently during this time to avoid disturbing the sutures at the incision site.


Many vets use special sutures that cannot easily be removed by the rabbit, but if you see your rabbit has removed its sutures, contact your vet so they can bandage it back up.
If your rabbit’s incision becomes infected, let your vet know immediately. You will then need an antibiotic prescription for your pet.

, Male rabbits actually remain fertile up to four weeks after being neutered. If you have a male and female rabbit, keep them separated for at least four weeks after their surgery. If your female rabbit was spayed, keep it in a separate – but nearby – cage for two weeks to allow her to recover."

Figure out who's ""in"" and who's ""out."",
Act like you've been there already.,
Dissent from the popular opinion of the day.,
Slow down.,
Ignore the haters.,
Make lots of friends and keep them.",How to Act Cool1," Before you can position yourself as a super-cool person worthy of envy, you've got to figure out what cool means. Is this the right place for putting on shades and slouching? Is it the right time to talk about the Chocolate Vomits show at which you stage dived last night? Acting cool at work may be a lot different than acting cool in middle school, but you can learn to identify the different cool and uncool crowds, and tailor your coolness accordingly.


In a very large group, like a whole middle school or a whole company, try to find a smaller group of people to befriend and be cool with. Situate yourselves as the ""in"" group in opposition to the lamestream, er, the mainstream.
In a smaller group, it might be more appropriate to remain aloof to play it cool. If you come out too strong, you'll likely just make everyone think you're a weirdo, not cool. Find another cool buddy to be cool with and position your small clique as the in group.;
, According to an analysis of ""cool kids""one of the traditional markers of coolness is that other people perceive that cool people are more experienced, mature, and knowledgeable than they are. That doesn't mean you need to have spent time under the bleachers, at underground rock clubs, or in foreign countries to give off a cool vibe, nor does it mean you need to start bragging about things you've never done. You can learn to put on a mysterious and experienced act that people will believe.


Practice vague responses to specific questions about your experiences that will seem cool. If someone asks if you're a virgin, or have ever smoked a cigarette, say, ""What is this, a sewing circle?"" or ""That's a boring question"" and change the subject. Throw it back in their face.
Never make stuff up. It won't make you seem cool to lie and say you've been to Europe, or that you've done illicit things in the back of a car when you haven't. The truth will come out eventually and you'll be exposed and embarrassed.

, Acting cool means being different, doing things that make you stand out from the crowd. You're floating above the lame drudgery of the world in your super-cool cloud. You can't be a follower and act cool. Other people should want to be like you, because you're setting trends, surprising people with your fresh outlook and opinions, and bucking the common wisdom.


Play devil's advocate in group discussions and casual conversations. Don't get attached to being right or wrong, just poke at people's expectations and dissent every now and then for the sake of coolness. All your friends ragging on a teacher? Stick up for her. Being different is cool.
Alternatively, it may be ""cooler"" to join up with the crowd in some cases. In middle school, acting cool might mean embracing the newest Justin Bieber song, even if you're not crazy about Biebs. You can still listen to the good stuff when you're alone. But try to be true to yourself.

, Let the world come to you. Acting cools means relaxing, not rushing into anything due to uncool excitement. Instead, just chill, kick back, and wait.


Let other people talk first. Practice good listening skills, staying quiet until someone else wants to start the conversation. Acting cool means you're not desperate for chat. Just take 'er easy. Whatevs.
Take long pauses before you speak, even if you're fairly sure of what you're going to say. Dramatic pause will give people the chance to contemplate your smarts and your seriousness. Be stoic, like Kathryn Hepburn, Clint Eastwood, and the titans of cool.
Don't forget to slow your roll, too. Walk more slowly. Look around, scoping the sites. Smell the flowers. Walk with a cool lope, rather than an efficient bustle.

, Uncool people have a tendency to make it their mission to tear down cool people. Cool people from Kanye to Picasso to Yoko all have their haters, and it's lame. If you're going to join the ranks of the super-cool, and start acting like the cool, enviable person with the awesome life that you have, it's a given that you'll attract some haters. Learn to deal with them.


Keep a close watch on your social networking, unfriending or ignoring anyone who hates on your awesomeness. You don't need to listen to it. Instead, surround yourself with people who'll lift you up and support you in your coolness.
Prepare cool responses to haters. If someone tries to make fun of the super-hip style you're trying out at school, saying, ""What are you wearing?!"" have a cool response prepared just in case: ""Maybe I should let my mom dress me, like you do.""
Spread the coolness around and bestow it on others. The bigger your cool clique, the less chance haters will have of effecting you. Build a strong group of cool friends with similar interests so you won't have to be a lone wolf.

, One common misconception is that ""cool"" kids are an exclusive group, like the Navy SEALs, and if one of your friends can't pass the cool test, they'll get cut. A cool person treats everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of whether or not they're really ""cool.""


Seek out a diverse group of friends. Befriend other kids at your school that aren't necessarily considered ""cool"" and speak up for them to your friends. Build good will rather than sewing resentment.
Some recent studies show that kids considered ""cool"" in middle and high school end up experiencing functional difficulties in their early adult years, as a result of pretending to have more mature experienced early in life, alienating friends and close ones.Don't make the same mistake as the ruthlessly cool. Keep your real friends around.

Dress conservatively.,
Opt for natural makeup.,
Choose a light scent.",How to Act and Look Innocent (for Girls)1," A woman’s innocence is often reflected in her apparel. They choose to dress modestly, or conservatively. Instead of wearing clothing that reveals, or highlights, her feminine features, she chooses to cover her body. Modest fashion choices include:


Wearing knee length skirts, dresses, and shorts
Layering tank tops underneath low cut topsWearing maxi-skirts and dresses
Wearing loose clothing;
, “Bad girls” tend to overuse makeup. Innocent women, however, prefer a natural, girl-next-door look. To achieve this look:


Even out your skin tone with foundation and concealer.
Highlight your cheeks with a soft blush
Apply a few coats of mascara to your luscious lashes
Swipe on a subtle pink lip gloss for kissable lips, Like “bad girls,” innocent women also understand the power of fragrance. Instead of wearing a bold scent, innocent women prefer a delicate fragrance. A light, feminine perfume will hint at your innocence."
"
Button up.,
Be confident.,
Be a brilliant summarizer but not such a good detailer.,
Maintain a calm exterior at all times.,
Develop your own sense of style.,
Be unreadable.",How to Be Mysterious1," Or, in other words, put a lid on it. If you're an extroverted, happy-go-lucky, conversational dynamo, it can be hard to keep it all in sometimes. And yet, telling everyone your life story when you first meet, or date can end up being a turn-off, especially when the details are too much information (TMI). Relax. Take in the silence. Become more of an observer.


Telling all can often scare people off because they wonder why it's so easy to be that open about your life and they'll worry how much you'll want them to reveal, too. Learn to be discerning about what you tell others you barely know and leave more to the imagination.
Know when to speak. How did Plato put it? ""Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something.""Be the wise man, not the fool.;
, Being mysterious requires that you are confident enough not to have to fill in the gaps in conversations. It's also about not being rattled by the natural silences that crop up in day-to-day interactions between people. Use those gaps to greater effect, to amplify the meaning of the things you do say. Moreover, being confident within yourself will show in your posture, composure, and facial expressions.


To be successfully mysterious, you need to come off as needing nothing from no one. You don't need approval, and you don't need anyone to hold your hand through any endeavor. Does James Bond need approval? Angelina Jolie? Nope and nope.

, Never give away too much when you're talking about personal things. For example, if the person you're interested in wants to know about your past, be very candid but not specific. Never tell this person extra details, or give the whole story. Work on summarizing everything. They'll feel like they know without actually knowing.


It's important to be decisive. When you're answering questions, you answer them simply and to the point, no dilly-dallying about it. The other person won't know whether to probe or not, since you gave the whole story (even though it was with such little detail). How can they argue with what you had to say? What right do they have to the details? Most people will not want to tiptoe the line.

, Whatever else is raging on around you in the world of interrelating, avoid showing over-emotional reactions to events or people. Calmness is linked firmly to exuding confidence and a calm reaction will confirm that you're level-headed, as well as eliciting an aura of mysteriousness. People will wonder how you can manage to remain so calm about situations in which they're shocked, outraged, or panicking.


This may take some practice for you but you can begin by practicing deep breathing, learning to reflect before reacting to news events and family/friend rumors, and then slowly realizing that the calm manner in which you react can help you cope better.
When showing emotions like anger or love, be stoic and composed. Show emotion with your eyes, rather than your mouth or facial expressions or actions. Don't yell if you're angry about something, and don't jump to kissing someone if you think you're in love. A lover would be expecting both things, so don't go for the obvious reaction. Train yourself to be calm and reflective. Keep your voice calm and relaxed.

, Too often the clothes we wear put us into a box. Don an Abercrombie & Fitch polo and certain crowds will claim to have you all figured out; a Doctor Who t-shirt and a backpack in the shape of the Tardis and others will say the same. So however you come off on the outside, make it your own. No one will really know where you fit.


The same can be said for your actions in addition to your fashion sense. Doing something completely counter-intuitive to your personality will leave people wondering, ""Where the heck did that come from?"" So go ahead. After football practice, whip out your yodeling talent. After assembling that computer, treat yourself to a facial. Get home from the museum in time for the football game. Don't let anyone peg you.

, When James Bond is doing his James Bond thing, he's working in inconsistent clusters and, therefore, cannot be read. If he's flirting with a woman, he's serious and stoic, not eager or physically obvious. If he's cracking a joke, no one knows it's a joke until the very end of the punch line. Use this. Have your body not match the tone of the circumstance, be light-hearted in the face of adversity, be emotionless when things get dark. Have something about you that just doesn't make sense.


Doing this well will help you avoid the ""dark"" label that often goes with mysterious. A person that's not talkative, a bit of a loner, and needs no one can easily be mistaken as depressed. That's not what you're going for. Having something about you that doesn't fit the mold will avoid being lumped in with the cliche.

, When Shayla says she's leaving your party to go to a cooler one, you tell her she might want to change first, so her shirt matches her shoes. Again -- it's with a coy smile and a laugh -- not a snip-snap, hair-tossed retort full of vitriol. It's just that when someone else wants to say something a little less than tactful, you show that you can be a little less than tactful, too. Play the game, baby!

It takes knowing and loving yourself to have that gusto to do your own thing, to speak your mind, to not have the personality of a wilting wallflower. So to empower your inner sass, grab that confident girl within you and let her out! Because she's freaking cool.


If being confident sounds like a challenge to you, it may be easiest to start on the outside in. True, confidence comes from the inside, but a little can seep in from the outside! Get dressed up, start feeling good on the outside, and act like you think a confident you might act. Practice makes a habit, after all!

, Might as well ask your pet ferret to recite soliloquies, huh? But you can't think of it like that -- everyone has a sense of humor; everyone has things that they find humorous. It's a human thing, and it doesn't select for genes. So trust your gut -- if it makes you laugh, it probably makes someone else laugh, too!


Sassy girls tend to zero-in on two types of humor: humor at another's expense and humor at their expense (aka self-deprecating humor). Both are light-hearted, of course! So next time your friend has chocolate cake on their face all day, tell them, ""You had chocolate cake on your face all day. Because you ate it alone. So. Very. Alone."" And then when you have chocolate cake on your face all day, you tell everyone it's because you ate it alone. So. Very. Alone., Once we hit ten years old or so, we start unconsciously learning to not say what we have on our minds, girls especially. We learn to be courteous, polite, and we definitely learn to avoid embarrassing ourselves. In learning that, we lose our ability to be direct and honest. Well, to be sassy, you've got to get a little bit of that back!


This is, however, not an excuse to be mean. Sassy is not mean. So when your friend isn't pulling their weight on that group project of yours, it's not your place to say, ""Yo. Check yourself before you wreck our grade, slacker."" Instead, you're the one in the group with the moxie to say, ""Hey. We're all working our butts off here. If you don't want to help, you're more than welcome to do a project alone, but we'd rather you chip in.""

Yeah, some people will take your directness and honesty as being mean, but those are the people that expect you to be a doormat. As long as you're not going around hurting feelings for breakfast, you're fine.



, There's something about being sassy that is intrinsically fun. It's happy, it's bouncy, it's fun, and it's full of energy. If you're subdued, listless, and unenthusiastic, your sassiness could easily just get mistaken for cynicism. A pep to your step keeps your sassiness fun and enviable.


The easiest way to seem energetic (without running around the room, which is not what we mean) is to be present. Instead of slouching over your phone and responding to questions with glazed-over looks or daydreaming in your own little world, get in the moment. Look at people when they talk and smile and nod. Ask questions. Joke around and flirt. Live in the moment.

, This is a lot like the above step, but it doesn't hurt to have the reminder that being sassy is a lot about having fun. Why wouldn't you? You're confident, energetic, and cracking people up (even if it's just you). So don't be afraid to create an atmosphere of awesome, regardless of the situation. Because with the right outlook, everything is and you are, too.


Seriously. Be that person that can have fun with anything. Did you get an extra-large slice of coffee cake at lunch today? SCORE. Uh oh. Did you spill that coffee cake on your shirt? Fashion show time! Stains are all the rage, you know. Is Becky looking at you funny, modeling your coffee cake stain? Just tell her if she can rock pit stains, you can rock the cake stains. (Said with a smile, of course.)

, You know those people that manage to have some sort of invisibility power? They can walk into any room, and practically no one notices? They stick to the wall, slink in and slink out, barely making a sound? Yeah, that's not you. You're too rambunctious for that. Being sassy is something everyone notices!


So whether you're cracking jokes, telling stories, or putting on lunch-stain fashion shows, go for it. Don't shy away from all eyes being on you. And the best part? Your positive energy and vivaciousness will keep any party going. Not everybody can play that role!

, To be the sassy one, you'll be the one comfortable saying what everybody is thinking. You don't get embarrassed by telling it like it is -- good or bad. So many people are afraid to ask for what they want or to give even just their true thoughts on the matter. Not you!


So when your teacher gives you three days to write that 5-page paper, you tell him that that's an illogical amount of time. When your crush tells a funny joke, you're not afraid to tell him how cute he is. And when your friend is wearing that pair of pants she should not be wearing, you tell her before anyone else notices.

, Since you're confident, vivacious, and bold, your body language needs to match. What does a sassy girl seem like with her mouth shut? Here's a couple things:


Walk with your head high! Shoulders back and not slouching. Too much confidence for that!
Don't shy away from eye contact. You've got things to say and other people do, too. Why not connect with them in the process?

Be flirty. Smile, touch the person you're interested in, laugh -- you know how it goes.
An eye roll or some other body equivalent (something like ""talk to the hand,"" but less 1999) has its place in being sassy, too, but keep it to a minimum. That stuff gets negative pretty easily.

, Just for the record, there's not a lot of room for it in the ""being sassy"" domain. Some people are going to find your behavior off-putting; if you're a woman, some fiercely believe that women should be quiet and shy. And in addition to that, some people may be very sensitive and find your tell-it-like-it-is mentality to be hurtful. This is going to happen. Listen to the remarks, sure. Some may have points. But if they don't, don't pay 'em any mind.


Being sassy is partly about knowing your audience. You may have a friend that can't handle your sarcasm or you poking fun at them. If that's the case, recognize this. You shouldn't have to change yourself for anyone, no, but you should have to consider their feelings.

, Being sassy isn't exactly a stereotype that's easily accessible in modern society; however, that does seem to be slowly changing. There are more and more women in media who are stronger, bolder, and sassier by the minute. So find a role model and get some inspiration. Sometimes we need an example to follow!


Prominent examples that come to mind? Beyoncé, Ke$ha, Rhianna, even Taylor Swift has her sassy moments. Kristin Wiig, Jennifer Lawrence, and Tina Fey are good, too. Though your Aunt Jean isn't a bad idea, either!

, If a hobo is sassy, she's just being insubordinate and might be a little drunk. But if a girl who's rocking the style is sassy, she's got the whole package. While it shouldn't have anything to do with the clothes you wear, it definitely helps. When your clothes have a punch of attitude, it'll be easier for you to feel the sass, too.


""Stylishly"" is obviously relative. If you're into the punk scene, you're not going to think haute couture is stylish. Trust whatever this word means to you. The important thing to take away from this is that your clothes have an effect on people -- including you. Can you imagine being sassy in a walrus outfit?

, There is something about sassy that is unafraid. It's willing to go outside of the box and do whatever it takes. So if being confident is easy if speaking your mind is easy, take it to the next level and challenge your fears -- you'll be all the better for it. You'll be bolder and shine brighter. What's not to like?


So whether it's public speaking, heights, or slugs, challenge yourself. You're not afraid of challenging others, right? You call 'em out, you tell it as it is, you're honest -- so you have to be honest with yourself, too. It's only fair!

Dunno where to start? How about wikiHow's How to Overcome Fear article?



, Sassy girls (and guys!) are dynamic and anything but boring. Since they can find joy and humor in just about anything, there's nothing they're not unwilling to try. So be the one in yoga class that also practices krav maga. Bring your ukulele to choir practice. Let your personality run free.


Don't be surprised when everyone else starts doing krav maga or playing the uke, too. The sassy ones are often the trendsetters, doing what other people are often too afraid to do.

Find a cool icon.,
Build up a cool and flattering wardrobe.,
Relax and be comfortable in your own skin.,
Pick your ""thing.""",How to Act Cool2," Truly ""new"" looks don't really happen. Unless you want to wrap yourself in space blankets and wear undertaker make-up, it'll be hard to break new ground in the fashion department. The better and quicker way to spice up your cool style is to pick a cool muse, icon, or idol to borrow tips from. Actors, musicians, and even older siblings or locals can all make great style icons. Some classics might include:


Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke. Sometimes nothing is a real cool hand. Work shirts and banjos never looked cooler than on Newman in this classic flick. Study his icy gaze and his witty come-backs as you cultivate your style. Bonus: being familiar with this oldie flick will make you stand out among the Transformers-obsessed. See also: Steve McQueen in Bullitt, Peter Fonda in Easy Rider, and live clips of Johnny Cash.
Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Hepburn's bootleg brand of glamor made her a style icon in the 60s. Striking sophistication and manic weirdness can go hand-in-hand, she taught us. Also check out Brigitte Bardot in any film, Anna Karina in Band of Outsiders (obscure French film bonus points!), and Nancy Sinatra clips on YouTube.
Vintage Fashion photography. Check out Mae West, Betty Page, and issues of Vogue from the mid-50s to the 70s. There's a whole wealth of cool going unnoticed at the local library. Need a fresh breath of style in your life? Go back to the source.

, Buy clothes that make you look good and make you feel cool. Cool clothes are less about a particular style and more about giving you the confidence and the verve to put out the cool vibes. You want to make sure the clothes fit you and flatter your body shape, so you feel hip and confident.


Some trends like skinny jeans and high-waisted pants may not look great on everyone. It's not cool if it doesn't look good. Find something that you like to wear.
Wear sunglasses for classic cool. There's one constant in the cool-fashion universe: sunglasses look awesome on everyone. Get some cool shades, prescription if you wear glasses, and rock them when you're outside. Keeping them on indoors is lame.

, Look at old videos of Johnny Cash being interviewed, or Meryl Streep. They give off the impression that they know something you don't, that they're relaxed in their experience of the world. That's cool. Above all, the most important part of acting cool? Being relaxed. You want to give off the impression of feeling comfortable as you, as if you're at ease in the world you inhabit.


Try not to tap your feet anxiously, or chew your fingernails, even when you're just sitting. Sit quietly and contemplatively. Anxiety makes everyone anxious. Quiet dignity? That's cool.

, It's hard to be more than one kind of cool when it comes to style. You know yourself the best and you know what you think is cool, so if you want to commit to a cool style that'll have others awed by your awesomeness, it's important to pick a thing and stick to it. Are you a rocker? A jock? A nerd? Every subculture comes with it's own lexicon of cool. When you decide what kind of cool you want to pursue, throw yourself into it.

Get in shape.,
Prove that you're cool in competition.,
Show off your skills regularly.,
Get the right gear.,
Watch sports and pick your athlete icons.",How to Act Cool3," From Michael Jordan to Mia Hamm, athletes and athletic-types are cool. We regular types are in awe of the athlete's natural ability and cut-throat drive to win at all costs, making them super-cool in the eyes of many. If you want to be athletic-cool, the first step is to get in shape and start putting your body to good use in sports, exercise, and other physical activities. You don't have to be a pro athlete to be athletic-cool, but you do have to be in shape.


If you like sports, pick one and commit to a team or building a particular skill. Play soccer, football, basketball, golf, tennis, or whatever sport drives you wild with competitive energy. Get as good as you possibly can and get into shape by playing often and working out.
If you don't like traditional ball-and-net sports, many people still cultivate an athletic-coolness by getting into yoga, long-distance running, weightlifting, cycling, or hiking. These are excellent ways to get fit without having to join a team.

, Cool athletes are often driven by a desire to win, so it's a good idea to get on the field and see what you're made of when you're going for the gold. Whether you're on a team or by yourself, do everything you can to win, whether you're playing a board game or starting in the Super Bowl, win at all costs.


Take every opportunity for competition seriously. When Rafael Nadal was injured and recuperating, the loss of tennis competition drove him nuts, so he threw himself completely into competitive high-stakes poker to keep his competitive edge razor-sharp. That's cool.
try to be a good winner and a good loser. Cool means you drive others and yourself to succeed at the highest level, but also realize that you're ultimately playing a game. If you lose, congratulate your opponent and have the dignity to appreciate their achievement. There's nothing cool about whining like a sore loser.

, A cool athlete is always down to get physical, get competitive, and get moving. A quiet day indoors spend crafting and catching up on Battlestar Galactica? Forget about it. The cool athlete wants to start the day with a 5-mile bike ride, fuel up with fruit and oatmeal, then shoot hoops until the last possible minute before leaving for work or school. Cool athletes take every opportunity to push their body to the limit.


Go to public parks and gyms to meet other like-minded cool athletes. Play pick-up games in your area to make sporting friends and feed your competition monster. Be a beast on the field.

, Athletic gear and apparel is big business. Within any hobby, from b-ball to biking, there's a huge range of expensive gear and ""stuff"" that you can get to keep up your cool image. Outlets like Dick's, Cabela's, Outdoor World, and REI all specialize in gear for the cool athlete. It can be easy to spend a lot of sports gear, but try to spend appropriately in your price range.


Some hot brands for the cool athlete include North Face, Patagonia, Under Armour, Nike, and Adidas. These companies make regular clothes as well as extreme-use gear for a variety of purposes. Pick gear appropriate for your interests. Every sport likewise has a specific range of task-specific stuff you can check out when you learn more about your sport.
Team memorabilia and jerseys are also super-common among cool athletes. If you love basketball, get an old Sixers throwback jersey and a ball-cap. Rep your favorite teams.

, Cool athletes usually look to other cool athletes for inspiration and guidance. If you fancy yourself an athlete, it's important to follow your sport of choice. Keep up with the team, even in the off-season. The cool athlete is always checking into the Bleacher Report to see if Kobe's really going to retire, if Cristiano Ronaldo's knee has healed up properly, if RGIII can live up to the hype.


Pick your favorite teams and rivalries, with extra bonus points for local and regional teams. It doesn't make any sense to rep the Yankees if you live in Atlanta, unless you can claim some connection to the source. Be authentic to be cool.

Read cool books and magazines.,
Listen to cool music.,
Stay aloof.,
Commit to nothing and feel free to change your mind regularly.,
Hang out with musicians, artists, and creative types.,
Develop quirky or ""weird"" habits.,
Go for controlled chaos in your grooming.,
Go vintage with clothes and entertainment.",How to Act Cool4," One of the best ways to keep as up to date in the cool world as possible is to keep current with the hippest books, magazines, and online reading. If you expect to act cool, keep tapped into the intellectual hubs of coolness. Find stuff that you like, that will also give you cool cache.



Check out cool books, classics like Kerouac's On the Road, Plath's ""The Bell Jar,"" Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, and more contemporary hip-lit: anything by Tao Lin, Karen Russell, Roberto Bolano, or Haruki Murakami.

Check out cool culture magazines like Vice, Bomb,"" The Believer, Aesthetica, Oxford American, The Brooklyn Rail, and Interview.


Check out cool culture sites, like The Onion, Aquarium Drunkard, Slate, Narrative, and Brooklyn Vegan.

, Music is the lifeblood of the cool kids. Maybe nothing can more instantly inject you with cool juice than a taste in hip music and a contemporary knowledge of what's cool. You don't want to be the guy at the party with outdated taste, asking everyone if they've ever heard of Radiohead.


Check out cool archival record labels like Numero Group, Tompkins Square, and Light in the Attic, to learn about old obscurities. While the lame kids go gaga over Mumford and Sons, go deep into Laurel Canyon desert folk, Minneapolis soul comps, and weird ambient music from the 80s. Good and obscure equals cool.
Go to local shows and learn about the local scene in your area. If you can get in on the ground level with the next hip band before they get big, you can tell all your friends you knew them back when they were playing in your basement. Cool points +1000.
Collect vinyl records, both old and new. CDs are dead, and MP3s lack the cache of a sweet stack of vinyl. Most new records come with download codes anyway, meaning you can still check out the same record on your iPod. Bonus!

, Don't get too excited about anything, or anybody. Stay cool and aloof, as if you've always got something totally rad happening every night after school, or on the weekends. Just found out you won an all-expenses paid trip to Mexico? Shrug your shoulders: ""Sounds cool, I guess."" Your boyfriend just broke it off with you in front of all your friends? Laugh it off. He was a loser anyway.


Alternatively, if you're at a party full of ""too cool for school"" types, who sneer and can't even be bothered to take off their leather jackets, it might be cooler to speak out. Be the one cracking jokes, cutting up, and being loud. Find the mainstream and act in opposition to it, if you want to act cool.

, Some cool things are timeless. Plain white tees, Levis, and Chuck Taylors? Always cool. Motorcycles? Always cool. Bass guitar? Always cool. But you've also got to stay ahead of trends by keeping your ear to the underground and finding the ""next big thing,"" which might mean getting off the ""Harlem Shake"" train before it gets lame. It's cutthroat, the cool game.


When you see Ninja Turtles novelty tees at K-Mart, the trend has probably crossed over into lame. When you hear a band in a diamond commercial, they're probably not super-hip anymore. Move onto the next thing when it's reached it's pop culture apex. No shame.

, There's nothing more cool than being in a rock band, doing weird performance art, or being an all-around eccentric person. Hang out with such people and the coolness will rub off on you.


Frequent trendy coffee shops to meet bohemian sorts in your area. Carry a hip book with you and dress in your coolest clothes. Hit up art openings, concerts, and poetry readings. You'll attract the other cool sorts.
At your school, see if there's an art, guitar, or foreign language club you could join to hang out with other cool and worldly people. It's a good way to make cool friends. If your school doesn't have a music appreciation society, start one.

, Acting cool means having compelling interests in unexpected fields, topics, and issues. Cool people shake up the norm and do surprising things that make other people want to learn from you and sap off your cool vibes. You can cultivate some quirks that'll make you stand out and get noticed.


Maybe you could carry a cane with a rattlesnake on the handle for no reason. Maybe you develop a love of exotic butterflies, and decorate your room with your collection of specimens. The line between weirdo eccentricities and ""cool"" is sometimes blurry. Have fun with it and do something you really enjoy that's odd, unique, and cool.
Try thinking of calling cards, cool quirks that'll make you different and cool. Even things as simple as ordering bloody mary at night, or deciding to never see Forrest Gump might qualify as ""cool."" Be the never-seen-a-single-episode-of-Seinfeld guy? Why not?

, Acting cool means you want to look cool while also looking as if you put no thought whatsoever into your look. Look cool by controlling the chaos of your hair, your clothes, and your make-up.


Jeans and shirts should not be ironed, but not super-wrinkly or dirty. Holes in your jeans are cool, and so are paint-splattered boots and sneakers, as if you just came straight form the studio.
Necklaces, bracelets, and piercings are usually cool, if they make you feel good. Use your judgment. Shark teeth necklaces look cool on Johnny Depp, but might make you look like a dork. Combined with other cool stylings, you can start to build a look for yourself.
Wash your hair the night before school, rather than right before school. Going to bed with slightly-damp hair can give you rockstar body and frizz, giving it a controlled kind of wildness. You can always comb it out if it looks too crazy.
Cool make-up is usually minimalist. Go for a light natural look, highlighting your features and your own natural coloring.

, Classic tends to trump cutting edge when it comes to cool clothes, movies, and music. Classic Ray-Bans are cooler than Oakleys. Old-school Italian art house films from the 70s are cool, while Michael Bay movies are less so. Old-school synthesizers and analog guitar effects might be cooler than digital counterparts. Tape machines cooler than Ableton Live.

Assume a quiet confidence.,
Appear transparent.,
Abstain from risky, or “bad girl,” behavior.",How to Act and Look Innocent (for Girls)2," “Bad girls” exude confidence. Innocent women, on the other hand, are less sure of themselves. Due to their inexperience, these women are not aware of their own beauty, allure, or power. For example, an innocent women might not realize she is flirting or understand why others are attracted to her. If your effort to act innocent, don’t let on that you know how your actions, words, and appearance affect others., When compared to mysterious “bad girls,” innocent women are refreshingly simple and accessible. Some may mistake this honesty for naivety, but don’t let this prevent you from showcasing your true self.This transparency can take several forms.


Instead of acting aloof, present yourself as down to earth.
When you feel scared, don’t hide it.
Don’t pretend that you have everything figured out.
Allow yourself to be vulnerable with others

, Innocent girls don’t behave in a socially unacceptable manner. These standards vary from culture to culture. In the United States, for example, this often means that you refrain from breaking the law, underage drinking, smoking, and premarital sex."
"
Commit to your partner.,
Let your partner think they are more experienced than you.,
Let your partner corrupt you—just a little.",How to Act and Look Innocent (for Girls)3," Innocent women aren’t promiscuous. They remain loyal to their partners. This level of commitment is valued by partners seeking a serious, long term relationship., One of the major appeals of an innocent woman is that she is inexperienced. This innocence is a major confidence boost to the woman’s partner—it means they are more knowledgeable about worldly things. It places them in a position of power and leadership. Even if you are more experienced than your partner, feign ignorance., A more experienced partner is the innocent woman’s guide to the unsheltered world. While you should never compromise your values, don’t shy away from an opportunity to expand your horizons and take risks. Your partner will appreciate the opportunity to introduce a little corruption into your life."
"
Avoid volunteering information just to try to keep the conversation rolling.,
Leave some things unsaid.,
Play around with eye contact.,
Make good use of responses that don't tell much but do reveal that your inner workings are churning over.,
Use humor, smiling, and laughter to keep things mysterious.,
Avoid drinking too much or taking drugs that affect you to the point of lacking self-control.,
Be polite and considerate, not aloof.",How to Be Mysterious2," Instead, always switch the focus back to the other person by asking them questions about themselves and getting them to reveal more about their life and interests. Show a great deal of interest and listen avidly.


If asked open-ended questions aimed at eliciting more information about you, be polite and offer a little information – but not too much. Treat it very much as your interaction being all about the other person and not about you. If you're good at this, your attention to them will flatter them and it won't be until after the conversation that they've realized they didn't learn so much about you.

If you do this too well, the other person will never realize they don't know much about you. People love talking about themselves so much; it could go unnoticed entirely. However, avoid coming off as getting wrapped up in what they're saying -- you'll come off as clingy and submissive instead of as a good listener.



, When people ask questions, probe, or suggest their own answers, sometimes it is a good idea to just let their own ideas run free. Ask them questions like: ""Well, what do you think?"", or ""Is that what you really feel about my presentation?"", etc. but don't guide them too much. Of course, do set people straight about any disreputable assumptions they may hold about you!


If a lover asks you about past loves, there's no need to get into detail. Simply say that you don't remember because it was never that important to you. Another good approach is to say that once you decide to move on, you really do, and you don't remember the things about the past that no longer inform your current life. That's actually quite reassuring because it suggests that you don't hold grudges, a flame for someone long gone, or want to compare current people to people in your past.

Being vague about your past lovers will pique the interest of some people, but it soon passes when they realize that you simply won't budge on the point; however, if they keep harping on about it, consider that their ongoing insecurities might just be a sign for you that this relationship isn't worth pursuing.



, Make it clear that you can maintain eye contact when needed but withdraw eye contact when you're not ready to reveal something deep and meaningful within a relationship. This is not the same as lying, rather it is about deflecting; it should be used only when the touchy subject in question is raised. The other person will sense your unwillingness to contribute and should, if they're trying to stay in your good graces, back off.


Rather than looking furtive and worried, combine this tactic with appearing nonchalant, distant, and unconcerned by the situation you're in. Reward the other person with dedicated eye contact when the subject changes.
Look at people directly in their eyes when talking to them with a piercing or relaxed gaze, but don't stare. This will make you a dominant person and cause people to respect you. A powerful and confident gaze creates a magnetic effect.

, If someone asks you what's wrong, or what's up, instead of taking this as a cue to let it all out, simply say very lightly, ""Oh, I was just thinking,"" or ""I was just wondering about something,"" or ""I've just been reflecting over some things that I need to get to the bottom of."" And don't offer any further explanation. If you're probed, simply say, ""Oh there's nothing I can formulate out loud just now; it's all still in my thoughts.""


Be very careful not to come off as emo. You don't want to get viewed as sad. If you're ""contemplative,"" it's important not to downcast your eyes, to walk confidently, and to seem alert. If you're wrapped up in thoughts and too much black eyeliner, you may just be pegged as the misunderstood wallflower.

, Humor is a good means for masking feelings, allowing you to make things more mysterious by fending off questioning, and replacing any probing with deflective quips, one-liners, and general reduction of the situation to one that should only be laughed about.


If someone asks you a question, feel free to answer it literally. ""What are you doing?"" can be followed by, ""Talking to you"" or ""sitting on a chair."" You don't have to play into certain social norms if you don't want to. As long as you find it funny, you'll be able to pull it off.

, There is not a lot left to be mysterious about after a drug- or alcohol-infused state causes a person to reveal all. Since you have little or no control about what you tell once the alcohol or drugs impact you, you may exaggerate, tell too much, embellish beyond acceptability, and say things that leave you feeling vulnerable and exposed. To be mysterious, stay in control from the outset by watching your drinks and by avoiding taking drugs that disorient and take over your personality.


Drunken conversations often lead to tell-alls about exes, former people you've known, and people you can't stand. This is all information that is best kept in your head, so just don't let this happen to you and avoid getting sloshed. It's best for your brain cells, too.

, Keep your sense of respect and compassion for others; being mysterious is not about being more superior than others. It's more about leaving things not said, and showing others that you value your privacy and space.


There will be people that don't like this side of you. So what? If they're not comfortable with it, it's their problem. But if most people don't like it, you may want to consider how you're coming off.

Be respectful.,
Be attentive to your chores.,
Consider why your parents say no, instead of arguing.,
Express your disagreement in a polite manner.,
Be polite.,
Never rebel against your parents.",How to Be Obedient1," Part of being obedient is showing respect to your parents, honoring their ideas about what's best for you, and showing that you think they are worth listening to. Make sure that you listen when they talk and respond when they ask you to respond.


Don’t ignore them in public. When you are out with your parents you might feel a bit embarrassed by them, but pretending that you don't know them or that you aren't with them is rude in the extreme. It also has the potential to hurt your parents. They don't say that you embarrass them, so why think that way towards them?
Don’t roll your eyes when they ask you to do something. If you don't like what they are asking you, the polite way to respond is to ask them to present your feelings on why you don't want to do what they want you to. Think of all the times when you were a child and you asked your parents to do something for you and they did it without complaining.;
, Parents tend not to ask you to do a ton of chores. In fact, they probably work a lot harder than you do. Obedience means doing what you see needs to be done without your parents even asking you to.


Avoid making your parents ask you to do something more than once. Everyone gets distracted occasionally, so you might not always remember to do a chore without being asked. Try to avoid having this be a typical thing.
Do what you can to help out around the house without being specifically ordered. For example: offer to babysit your younger sister so that your parents can have a night off. Or find out when garbage day is and take the garbage out before your mom has to.

, Parents can have all kinds of rules about what they think you should or shouldn't be doing. You might not always like or agree with these rules, but an obedient child considers their parents' point of view instead of fighting about it.


Don’t give in to the knee-jerk reaction to argue with them or express your disappointment or displeasure. If you really need to respond with an argument, make it a debate and not a dispute--try writing or emailing them a letter or message explaining your point of view, rather than shouting and being uncompassionate.
If they say no to you hanging out with a friend on a Thursday night, they might be concerned about you not completing your homework on time or that you'll be too tired in school the next day.

, There are times when your parents might ask you to do something unreasonable, or place unreasonable restrictions on you. In many cases calmly discussing why you feel their demands are unreasonable, or offering alternatives or a compromise, can go a long way towards getting you what you want without being disobedient.


Calmly explain your side of things. Give facts and don’t rely only on feelings.
Obedience doesn’t mean that you don’t have a mind of your own and it certainly doesn’t mean that you will always need to agree with your parents. But if you disagree and want to express your disagreements, you will have to do it politely but firmly.

, Being polite to your parents is a sign of respect and obedience. You also want to be polite to other people: strangers, family members, friends. This way you'll be demonstrating how well your parents raised you.


Make sure that you ask permission to be excused at the dinner table.
Say “please” and “thank you” even for basic things.
Hold doors open for people, offer to help people with their groceries.

, You can disagree with them, but if they give you a reasonable instruction and you go against them simply to infuriate or upset them, this is not only immoral, but completely sinful. Think of the consequences before you decide to make a decision.

"
Act on your own desires, not other people's.,
Think about what ""cool"" means to you.,
Become the best you can be in the areas that interest you.,
Reject peer pressure with simple, direct language.,
Take pride in your appearances.",How to Be a Cool Teenager1," Being cool is, first and foremost, about being independent. People admire those that seem self-assured, willing to fight or stand up for their own ideas, and don't seem to need anyone else to be happy. Being cool is, in large part, about beating your own drum. You are rejecting the expectations put on you by parents, teachers, and even peer pressure because you're confident enough to make it work on your own.


Think about what you want in life. What are your personal hopes and dreams, and how can you pursue them?
Stick to your own personal ""code."" If you're constantly changing your ideals and morals with every new friend you make, people will eventually see you as untrustworthy and uncool.;
, Being cool is not something that is easily defined. More importantly, defining cool is often the easiest way to kill it. Being cool isn't about adopting a formula, finding the ""secret,"" or analyzing why some people are cool and others aren't. Being cool is much more relaxed and elusive. It is about being your own person, rejecting other people's authority or ideas for how you should live your life. But it is also about being friendly and open to new experiences. You should ask yourself:


Who do I admire, and why?
Who do I see as cool, and why?
What are the attitudes, not the hobbies, fashion, or upbringings, of the people I find cool? Notice how the hobbies are wide-ranging, but the attitudes are not., Talent and skill, in almost any field, breeds coolness. If you're the best musician in the room, can fix your friend's computer troubles with ease, or stay late to work on the best slapshot in the state, you will gain the respect and admiration of all around you. Remember that being cool is about being confident, and the easiest way to gain confidence is to work hard at something. The pride and self-respect earned by succeeding will rub off on other people, attracting them to you and your success.


Using your skills to help others out or teach newbies will get people to look up to you, fostering an atmosphere of cool that is impossible to fake.

, If you don't want to do something someone tells you, don't. But you also don't want to waver back and forth, showing that you feel swayed but aren't sure what to do. Be confident in your decision. People respect someone who sticks to their guns, even if they are disagreeing about something. If someone tries to bully you into something, or puts you down for something you did or someone you talked to, keep your response quick, honest, and to the point. If people keep pushing you, you can even jokingly note that ""You'll need a better reason to convince me than peer pressure."" Remember — be your own person, not someone's follower.


""No thanks, it's not for me. I'll catch up later.""
""Don't you have better things to worry about than me?""

, Anyone who pays attention to fashion will tell you that it is almost impossible to predict what will be ""trendy."" But appearing cool isn't about wearing the right clothes, it is about wearing the clothes confidently. Care about your appearance and about your clothes. They don't have to be expensive, they just have to look nice. Have your own unique style, and don't try to dress like anyone else unless you want to. Some good ways to cultivate a cool style include:


Check out fashion magazines or blogs for ideas on pairing clothing and current trends. You can gain inspiration from anywhere.
Keep it simple and effortless if you aren't into fashion. The little black dress is always in style, as is a simple button-down and a pair of jeans. Simplicity is easier to manage, and looking like you aren't trying hard to be fashionable is much cooler than going all out every day and wearing something silly.
Keep accessories to a minimum, but use them to give a flair of uniqueness. 1-2 simple pieces of jewelry, a nice watch, or a pair of sunglasses is all you need to take a simple, tasteful outfit into the next level of cool.

"
"
Pay attention in class and get good grades.,
Do your homework.,
Build good relationships with your teachers.",How to Be a Well Rounded Teenager1," School may seem boring, but it is important to try to do well. Good grades will give you more options in the future. Make sure to jot down any homework or test deadlines when you get them so that you don't forget to complete them and prioritize your study deadlines. When it is recommended to write notes from your classes, write notes, as this is one of the best ways for informing your revision before writing essays and sitting exams.


If there's something you don't understand, ask somebody! Read it through carefully again, and then if you still don't get it, ask a friend or a teacher. Despite what people might imply, there is never such a thing as a dumb question; it is better to get clarity than to stew in the dark, unenlightened.
When you get home from school, do a quick recap on what you learned that day. This will help you for when you need to revise it as it cements the day's learning and is much easier than cramming at the last minute. And while it may not seem like it now, learning-as-you-go creates long-term remembering whereas cramming trains only short-term memory and prevents you from truly learning and having access to that information in the future.;
, This sounds like a no-brainer, but doing your homework effectively doesn't just mean sloppily writing something down and handing it in. Do your best on every assignment, and as already stated, ask questions when you don't understand something. Plan a homework schedule so that you don't get yourself into a time crunch.

, This is especially important in high school because you may need to ask a few of your favorite teachers to write recommendations for your college applications. The better they know you, the better those recommendations will be. But more than this, these people can serve as mentors and guides as you move through high school and you can learn much from their knowledge and experience.

Find the cutting edge, and be on the right side of it.,
Find new ways of doing necessary things.,
Develop your online presence.,
Take school seriously and get a well-rounded education.,
Dress how you want.",How to Act Cool5," Technology, clothes, culture, many different kinds of things can change in an instant. Coolness is a moving target. try to stay as up-to-date as you can on the newest, the freshest, and the coolest stuff available.


Smart-cool people are always plugged in, have always seen that meme three days before it showed up on your newsfeed, and always have opinions about the newer, the more efficient, and the most innovative dispatches from the tech world. The newest Facebook privacy updates? Smart-cool people read about that three days ago, thank you very much.
Always try to update your hardware as soon as possible. The newest start-up apps, devices, games, and trends are usually cooler than slightly dated varieties. The new iPhone is cooler than the old iPhone. Why are you reading a paperback? Get an e-reader, already. You want to be the guy with the newest roll-out, drawing envious stares on the train during your commute.

, Shopping, eating, and traveling in the old ways? Boring. A smart-cool person doesn't waste time going to mall, instead opting to shop online at retailers like Frank & Oak or Warby Parker. A smart-cool person doesn't go to hotels, but researches cheap options on AirBnB, and gets there by hitching an Uber ride. Stay abreast of the coolest new start-ups and innovations in the consumer culture.


You don't necessarily have to be super-plugged-in to stay on top of innovative consumer trends. Even within your own neighborhood, you can seek out new restaurants, always going somewhere else, finding the next best thing. Be restless and keep moving.

, Smart-cool people pride themselves on their Twitter followers and take their online presence seriously. From your social networking to your personal websites to your World of Warcraft account, your online presence should be tricked out and fully developed. Have a blank avatar on your wikiHow account? Get serious.


Online friends are real friends. Forge relationships and friendships with people online, who'll get your particular brand of humor, your interests, and your personality. If you spend a considerable amount of time in your own head, online communities can be very welcoming. It might feel like home.

, Being smart-cool means you've got to be, well, smart. Get excited about how you can translate your smarts into a career by learning about innovative fields and developments in culture. See school as a means to an end, and keep moving forward into your bright future.


Develop a thirst for knowledge of all sorts, not just what you're interested in or consider your speciality. If you want to be a hacker, be the hacker who can quote Macbeth at length. If you want to be a novelist, learn how to do things with your hands, in addition to all that brain-work.
You know there's nothing cool about blowing off your homework, even when the supposedly ""cool"" kids at your school seem to blow it off all the time. Find confidence in the knowledge that you'll be in college, surrounded by awesome, intelligent, and beautiful people, while these fake cool kids go nowhere.

, In the world of smart-cool, looking as if you pay excessive attention to brands, styles, or other trends would be conspicuously uncool. A smart person wants to look as if dressing is the last possible item on a long list of items. Dress for utility and comfort, not for ""coolness."" Walking around with a corporate logo emblazoned on your chest, like a billboard? Please.


Novelty t-shirts are the calling card of the smart-cool. Shop online for funny shirts with inside jokes you and your friends will get, that will leave the lame jocks scratching their heads. Found a Monty Python tee you dig? Cool.

Pay attention to what they have to say.,
Discuss concerns or issues in private.,
Know how to obey authority.,
Understand what is expected from you.,
Make sure you complete tasks on time.,
Avoid backtalk.,
Act like you respect them.,
Never use blind obedience.",How to Be Obedient2," When you're trying to be obedient to an authority figure, like your teacher or manager, then you need to pay attention when they are talking. You want to show that you're interested.


In class look at the teacher while they’re talking. Take down notes when they give important information and look like you're interested.
Make sure that you are listening to your boss when they are giving you instructions. Again, eye contact is important.

, If there is a problem with an authority figure you should never bring it up in front of people. Instead, ask them if you can talk to them either in their office or after class.

, You should always respect authority, but never worship authority. Respecting authority means you recognize that the superior's authority and obey his or her reasonable rules. However, people who respect authority rarely sit quietly and suffer it if an authority figure treats them poorly or unfairly. People who revere authority, on the other hand, literally worship the authority figures; they think that, just because the superior has authority, whatever he or she says must be right. Therefore, revering authority often includes suffering injustices, while respecting authority only gives you the reputation of being respectful, kind and considerate--something worth going for.


For example: if you feel that your teacher gave you the wrong grade for an assignment, you would go and discuss it with them after class. Present some clear and concise reasons why you feel you deserve a different grade (and no, ""worked really hard on it"" is not a reason).

, It's hard to be obedient to someone if you're not really sure what they want from you. This is part of paying attention to what your authority figure says, because then you know what they need from you. If you happen to disagree with an authority figure, do not be impolite. Merely talk about it courteously, and you may end up getting your way.


If you're being obedient to your teacher then you'll need to stay on top of things like homework, classwork, any major projects, what they require in terms of in-class participation.
If you're being obedient to a superior at work then you're going to need to know what's expected from you in terms of your job. You're going to need to pay attention to long-term projects, and make sure to not fritter away your time at work surfing on the internet.

, Once you know what is expected of you it's time to fulfill those expectations in a timely manner. If there is a legitimate reason why a certain task or assignment isn't going to be completed on time, make sure that you inform your authority figure.

, Fighting or bickering with your boss or your teacher is the exact opposite of being obedient. Particularly in a classroom or work situation, your opinion on the authority figure isn't going to be that important.


Backtalk can also be nonverbal, such as rolling your eyes or smirking when they say something you disagree with or find to be stupid.
If they tell you to do something don't say something like ""This is totally unnecessary."" If you have questions or want to know why, ask respectfully but assertively.

, Respect and obedience have a tendency to go hand in hand. To be obedient to someone you need to act like you respect them as an authority figure. When they tell you to do something, you do it, as long as it is reasonable, moral and harmless.


Be polite and considerate. Say ""please"" and ""thank you"". However, remember never to apologize for something or assume responsibility for it if you did not do it.

, If your authority figures told you to jump off a cliff, would you still do it obediently? Just like everything else, obedience has its limits. If you cross these limits, you are turning from being disciplined to being unwise and foolish. Watch out when you obey your authority figures--they may be authoritative, but few are completely virtuous.

"
"
Cultivate humility.,
Commit to your faith.,
Make choices in line with your faith.,
Avoid judging other people based on their beliefs and obedience.",How to Be Obedient3," When you're obedient in following the mandates of your faith it means that you're also being humble. You accept that your god is helping to direct your life and that you accept both the good and the bad that comes.


Try to avoid taking ownership of the things that happen in your life. When something good happens, remind yourself that it was through the grace of your Great Teacher. If something unhappy happens it is a learning experience brought about by Him or Her, too.

, Most faiths and religions have specific rules and regulations that a practitioner is required to follow. Committing to your faith means giving up control of your life (not in a bad way) and understanding that what happens is coming from your Holy Teacher.

, Again, because of the rules and regulations in different faiths there are going to be certain choices that will be difficult, because they will make you choose between a life that might be materially easier, but not spiritually acceptable. Obedience to your faith means choosing the latter path.


For example: such a choice could be sacrificing your career path, because it doesn’t align with your beliefs.
It could also be something like taking significant time out of your day to incorporate prayer.

, Obedience to your faith is a personal thing. It means that you are in connection with your god and your faith and that can be wonderful.


It does not mean that you have carte blanche to criticize other people's beliefs or infringe on their way of living.

Embrace your own quirks and interests with confidence.,
Be open to new, fun experiences and ideas.,
Have a healthy sense of humor.,
Be sociable, accepting invitations and going to events.,
Don't do things for the sake of looking cool.",How to Be a Cool Teenager2," There is no one version of cool — it is more of an attitude than a set of interests or beliefs. Being cool requires confidence, an attitude that says ""I don't care what you think, I'm doing this for me."" If you don't like you, how can other people? Be comfortable in your own skin, and make choices that help you respect yourself. Respect for yourself is ten times more important than others' respect for you. Moreover, confidence in yourself is the number one thing most important thing you can do to be ""cool.""


What do you enjoy doing? What kinds of people to you admire?
Not everyone is cool to everyone else. Just because one group of people don't find you cool doesn't mean that another group won't think you're the best thing since sliced bread. Stop trying to find what other people think is cool; just be your confident, cool self. The admiring friends and followers will follow., If anyone suggests something to do, as long as it's legal, healthy, and doesn't go against your principles, don't turn it down. Be known to be someone who will support fun activities. Finding new hobbies or games leads you meet new people and gives you great stories and unexpected new ideas to bring back to your friends. Traveling, picking up a new sport, going to see a young band, or trying out some hobbies will broaden your horizons and friendship group.


Finding and sharing great new music, movies, and TV is a great way to show that you're up on the coolest new pop culture.
Trying new things gives you new things to talk about. This can help you start a conversation with anyone, since you might know a little bit about their favorite things.

, Typically, the funnier you are the cooler you become. Laughter is contagious, and your name will spread like wildfire along with the chuckles. But humor isn't just about cracking jokes. It includes being able to take a joke that is directed at you with grace and good will. Cool kids see themselves as a level above the rest, slightly detached and unworried by small jokes or slights. A mean joke just rolls off of them, because they don't care enough to get upset. They know that jokes are ultimately harmless.


The best way to deal with a joke aimed at you is to send another joke right back. This shows that you can handle the pressure calmly, but are also willing to stick up to yourself.

, Put yourself out there and go to as many events and social functions as you can. These could be dances, sporting events, parties, shows, etc. Support your friends at their events (like their games or concerts) as well, showing people that you care and can be relied on as a good pal.

, This is the most uncool thing that you can possibly do. Remember that being cool is about being true to yourself. It is about giving off the aura of individuality and confidence. If you're doing things to intentionally look cool, you'll never actually look cool. You need, instead, to ] and let the coolness come naturally. Once you're confident in your own abilities and coolness, you're the coolest kid on the block.


A recent study showed that kids who try to be too cool in high school have a higher rate of drug use and lower life satisfaction than the kids who just acted like themselves. Ultimately, those true to themselves end up cooler and happier."
"
Know that popularity and coolness are a result of making friends.,
Expand your friend group to include as many people as possible.,
Be friendly and approachable at school.,
Compliment people instead of putting them down.",How to Be a Cool Teenager3," The only formula to ""being cool"" is to have a variety of friends. When people like and respect you, they think you're cool. There are, of course, the bullies, jerks, and cruel cliques that tell themselves that they are cool by rejecting others. But you should ask yourself — if no one else in school really likes them, are they really cool? Or are they simply acting cool? More likely than not, the coolest kid you know is the one with tons of friends; the kind of kid that anyone would be happy to sit and talk to over lunch or between classes. If you want to be cool, this is the approach you need to adopt., You can have close friends, and even a best friend, but if you stick to one friend at all times you'll never meet anyone new. This doesn't mean that you should try and be everyone's best friend. But you should feel free to talk to anyone and everyone at your school. Give everyone a chance, even if it is only because they sit next to you at class. Think of it this way — when you see kids acting cool and ignoring other people, how cool would they be if they suddenly switched schools and lost their clique? Being cool is not about rejecting friends, it is about gaining them.


Simply asking someone ""how's it going?"" or waving hello to an old friend you may have lost touch with shows that you value people's friendship. People like to feel valued, and they will respond by valuing and respecting you.

, While there are plenty of Hollywood examples of cool people who are quiet, distant, and seemingly alone, in reality you can only be cool if people think you are cool. And people can only think that once they get to know you a bit. As a teenager, you spend 6-8 hours a day with the same people, and they will notice if you never take the time to talk to them. Wear a smile, sit down with people at lunch, and make small talk with your locket-mates and classmates. If people feel like they can come up to talk to you, they'll want to become your friend.

, A good, genuine compliment is one of the best ways to gain respect and admiration from your peers. Put downs, however, tend to push people away, even if they gain a quick laugh or surge in coolness. When you put people down, you create social walls, and that person will never end up thinking you're cool once you've hurt their feelings. Compliments, on the other hand, show people that you care and noticed their accomplishments, which in turn helps them tune into your successes.


When giving compliments, make sure they are genuine. Fake or half-hearted compliments make you look like a suck-up, and your coolness will tank."
"
Take your time to find the right friends.,
Watch out for peer pressure.",How to Be a Well Rounded Teenager2," The best friends are friends that you feel comfortable goofing off with and being serious with. You shouldn't have to change your personality to please them. Good friends can be hard to find, so remember that it's not uncommon to change your group of friends several times during your teenage years.

, Many people experiment with a lot of things in high school and middle school, and it is important to learn how to say no to anything you are not comfortable with. Listen to your instincts and do what's right.


Sometimes people pretend to be friends just to get you to do something they're unwilling to do themselves, such as steal things, buy drugs or cheat. None of these things are worth founding a relationship on, and if you're caught, it's you who gets into trouble and you'll find the so-called friendship fails instantly.

"
"
Build a relationship with your parents.,
Get to know your siblings.,
Help out around the house.",How to Be a Well Rounded Teenager3," Although it often seems as though they don't take you seriously, letting your parents know that they can trust you will usually lead to you having more freedom.


Recognize that this is a hard time for your parents. Remember that they're not out to make your life miserable—while you feel like you should be treated like an adult, your parents are struggling with the realization that you're not their baby anymore. They are also likely to be struggling with working, paying a mortgage, raising your siblings as well as you and doing their best to be good parents. It's not an easy job, but you can make it easier by being understanding and friendly.

, Your little sister might seem like the most annoying person in the world now, but you're likely going to spend the rest of your life with her. Plus, being at home will be much more fun when every night is like a sleepover with your best friend.

, Some chores take less than five minutes to complete when many hands are applied to them, and your parents and siblings will be in a much better mood if there is one less thing for them to do. You can even morph chores into a fun way to spend time with your family by turning them into a contest. Try blasting music that everyone enjoys, or having a nice conversation while you work and setting time limits for completion. If you have winners for properly completed chores, prizes can include things like choosing the DVD or movie to watch as a family or choosing what gets cooked for dinner for that evening.


When asked to do a task, do it. This can save many arguments around the house, and when the chores are done you're free to do whatever you want! Arguing can take up a lot of time and creates emotional friction that nobody wants to feel.

"
"
Schedule some me-time.,
Figure out your hobbies and interests.,
Stay happy.,
Listen to music.,
Learn ways to enjoy solitude.",How to Be a Well Rounded Teenager4," Life can get pretty busy as a teenager, but it's important that you spend time with yourself as well.

, Find something you love and make sure you do it regularly. This will allow you to be refreshed and happy when it comes to other parts of your life. Don't be surprised if your interests change in the space of months or years; that's natural while you're still working out what you enjoy most but don't try too hard. Just follow your interests to see where they lead and remain open-minded about new possibilities too.

, Depression is a very common condition that tends to show up in your preteen or teenage years. Seek professional help if you think you may be depressed. You may or may not get family support to help you through (depending on your family circumstances) but don't let a lack of such support stop you from caring for your mental health; there is always someone who can help you sort out depressive or negative feelings and problems and the earlier you are treated, the easier it will be to recover and gain both confidence and resilience for a happier future.


Allow yourself to goof off from time to time. Always trying to be serious or focused can make you feel unhappy. Give yourself space to do fun things regularly to balance your studies, activities, and relationships.

, This can help you relax and relieve some of the stress from a busy day at school or with friends. Music is a good way of expressing yourself too – if you don't already know how to play an instrument, consider learning one now, such as the guitar, piano or keyboard. And don't forget that your voice is an instrument too!

, Learning to enjoy time spent alone is an important part of realizing that you're whole without another person. This can help to prevent the development of co-dependent relationships or to seek to make another person the source of your life's happiness. Solitude also helps you to learn more about what makes you tick as a person and what your life's values are. Some ways to find effective and enjoyable solitude include meditation, walks by yourself, writing in a journal and spending time with pets.

"
"
Take care of yourself.,
Exercise.,
Eat well.,
Get enough sleep.,
Wake up on time.",How to Be a Well Rounded Teenager5," Wash your face, take regular showers, eat home cooked meals instead of ready-made ones, etc.


Always make sure to brush your teeth 2-3 times a day. This will keep them clean and your breath smelling good.

, You don't have to go crazy, but a little bit of physical activity each day, such as biking to school, will help keep both your body and mind healthy.

, Eating too much or too little will make it hard to focus and cause you to do poorly in other areas.

, Having about 9 hours sleep is the best thing to be doing, even on weekends; it will prepare you for school and make yourself feel better the following morning. Try to schedule each week so that you get your homework done at a reasonable hour. If you know you're going to have a lot on a given night, talk to your teacher about getting an extension, or even better, handing it in early. This will make your body more aware of what's going on, and will make any dreadful bags under your eyes disappear!

, Make sure you have enough time to have some breakfast, wash your face, have a shower if you need to, etc. before school starts.


Packing your bag and hanging up your outfit/uniform the night before will make everything a lot faster and more organized. Don't forget to lay out a clean pair of socks, underwear and a pair of shoes also!

"
"
Join Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts/4-H or similar programs and stick with it.,
Join a club.,
Try for a sports team.,
Consider volunteering.",How to Be a Well Rounded Teenager6," These programs will give you a sense of community and teach you life skills. They also open up a range of opportunities that might not be offered at school or through your social networks, such as public speaking, drama, life or outdoor skills, etc.

, School clubs are a great way get involved without sacrificing things you're passionate about. They can also help you work out what sorts of hobbies and interests you enjoy most. Try a few over your teen years and don't be afraid to admit when one doesn't work for you and to keep looking.

, This will teach you how to work in a team, and you will become good friends with your team members. Alternatively, if team sports don't do it for you, at least find a sport that interests you be it athletics, triathlons, swimming, tennis, cycling or other more individual but still excellent sports. Even individual sports have team elements when you play on behalf of your school or region.


Martial arts can be another excellent outlet for physical and mental development. They are also a good way of developing self-discipline. While it's a good idea to begin in one martial sport, it is possible to do more than one once you're proficient in your first martial art.

, Another extracurricular activity that benefits both you and others is volunteering. Choose something you're passionate about and set regular times to help out. It might be something that fits in with a sport or activity you love too, so it doesn't have to be about over-stretching yourself.

"

While getting a job is a wonderful way to spend your extra time, don't feel like it's necessary.",How to Be a Well Rounded Teenager7," The things discussed above come first - relationships, studies, and extracurricular activities. A job is not worth sacrificing any of those aspects of your teen years, and it is very hard to juggle a lot of different responsibilities with a job. On the other hand, if you feel you can manage to fit in a part-time job with your other activities, getting a job will help show your parents that you are responsible, and can give you money to save or buy things that your parents can't spare the money for. Some common teenage jobs include:



Babysitting. If you have little siblings, you can babysit them. If not, set signs over houses where anybody under 12 lives. You can usually make pretty good money babysitting, and this is a good weekend job that still lets you study or call friends on the phone once the children have gone to bed.







Pet sitting. If you don't feel comfortable being responsible for another person, a pet might be a way to start. Talk to your neighbors and family friends with pets, and let them know that you'd be happy to watch the pets when they go on vacation. The beauty of this job is that it will usually be periodic rather than every day. If you live in the country, don't forget that farmer neighbors might jump at the opportunity of the chance to take a little time off for a break knowing you're caring for their farm and animals.







Tutoring. If there's a subject that you excel at, you can make money teaching it to others. Post signs around town with your contact information, talk to your friends and their younger siblings or ask your old teacher(s) if s/he can recommend you to parents of struggling children.







Being a camp counselor. Contact the YMCA or the director of your favorite childhood summer camp and ask when they hire camp counselor and if you can apply. Usually, people start hiring for the next summer from around January to March or April, depending on the size of the camp.







If you can legally get a work permit, apply for jobs at a local business. Look into being a restaurant host/hostess, working in retail, or helping to coach a sport.

When you walk into a classroom, never hustle right to your seat and sit down quietly. Poke your friend in the ribs, say ""What up, teach?"" and burp before you sit down. Put your feet up on the desk. You're bad.;
, It’s hard to be a rule-breaker if you’re worried about getting back to your dorm room to feed your roommate’s fish, or if you have to walk your little sister home from school every day after school. A bad kid will flat-out refuse to take on unnecessary responsibilities. You've got only enough energy and attention to look out for one person. You. Don’t take on unnecessary responsibilities that will keep you from doing more important things. Like napping.


It's important to be responsible for yourself. If you absolutely have to do something, do it. You're not being responsible for your own fun if you get in trouble and have to stay home all day. If someone else is depending on you, come through. Then cause trouble.

, Being on time is for dorks, brown-nosers, and teachers' pets. The bell's ringing for class? So what? Your coffee break is over at work? Who cares? There's no sense in being on time. The party starts when you walk in the door anyway. They'll wait.


A bad kid never shows up to a party until it's in full swing. Roll up late, a couple hours after it was supposed to start. Never be the first one to show up.

, Little rules are meant to be broken. That's how people will know you're one of the bad kids and not some rule-abiding citizen. Find little things that you can do wrong without getting into serious trouble and you'll quickly get a reputation as a rule-breaker and a bad kid.


Break the dress code by wearing jewelry, or the wrong colors on the wrong day. Always chalk it up to a mistake. ""I didn't know,"" should be your catch phrase, followed closely by, ""What'd I do?""
There’s a difference between acting bad and being a real-life trouble-maker and criminal. Don’t break laws or engage in dangerous illegal activity that could get you into serious trouble.

, Being bad is hard work. You've got to learn to relax and be evil at the same time. Never let up on your bad ways. When you've got some free time, consider the following hobbies:


Play golf and lose badly, then blame your teenage cabbie. Berate the kid and complain about him to the manager. Get him to quit.
Go for relaxing Sunday drives on the interstate at rush hour. Let your rage bubble. Cut people off. Safely, of course. No sense in denting your Corolla.
Hunt big game. Go on hunting expeditions to exotic locations and kill large beautiful animals that have absolutely no way of defending themselves. Save their heads and put them on your wall.

, From wolves to teenagers, the bad travel in packs. Find a wolf-pack of other bad kids and form a little gang. If you want to be all greaser about it, you could even get leather jackets with patches on the back and make it official. Walk and snap, buddy. Walk and snap.

, If you're bad enough, you're going to end up spending a considerable amount of time being punished. When you're a kid, that might mean going straight to bed without supper, being sent to time out, being suspended from school, or even worse punishments. As you get older, the punishments will get more severe. Whatever the consequences, face them with icy and stoic poise. Be cool in the face of your punishment.


When you learn your punishment, say something cool, like ""Sounds fun."" You'll take all the wind out of your punisher's sales.
You always need to be aware of the consequences of your actions. Never break a rule you're not willing to pay for.

, If you're going to be bad full-time, it's a good idea to find some kind of job that will allow you to put your hard-earned skills to good use. Some good career fields for bad kids might include:


Working in media as the propaganda tsar for a logging corporation. Be the face of forest destruction.
Work in a slaughterhouse. Kill cute pigs, cows, and other farm animals for a living. Strong stomachs required.
Be a trial lawyer and only defend criminals. The worse their crimes, the more satisfied you are when they walk off free.
Be a mall cop or a security guard. Find a tiny kingdom and lord over it with extreme badness. Wear sunglasses.

"
Criticize instead of complimenting.,
Never start conversations, but end them with negativity.,
Talk loudly.,
Use four-letter words whenever possible.,
Ignore the body language of others.",How to Be Bad2," When you're talking to someone, never pay them any compliments. Instead, find reasons to point out things they've done wrong. Point out little failures and big disappointments. Go off topic if necessary. Never let anyone else succeed.


Practice the back-handed compliment: ""You're so good looking. I bet you wish you were smarter, though.""
Practice the humble brag: ""Oh you went to France, huh? I went there like five years ago. It's ok I guess. I was kind of bored. I guess you like it though.""

, You should be like a black hole for other peoples' ability to communicate. Sit with a scowl on your face and never contribute anything to conversation. If a topic comes up that you're interested in, just sneer and scoff. People will steer clear of you eventually, but that's part of the gig, buddy.


Don’t keep up your end of talking. Don’t ask questions or act like a good listener. Just stay focused on yourself.
Play “Debbie Downer.” If someone brings up their recent vacation to the Philippines, talk about Ebola. If someone talks about the wonderful meal they just had at an upscale restaurant, talk about e. coli.

, When you do speak, it should be uncomfortably loud and intrude on other peoples' conversations. Pay no attention to personal space and the noise level appropriate for the occasion. Speak loudly, shouting at your friends even when you're sitting right next to them. Bonus points for bad breath.


Make your conversations drastically inappropriate for the place. If you're in church, talk about death metal and Call of Duty with your brother. If you're at a Young Liberals meeting, start talking about the ""welfare state"" and how much you like Ayn Rand.

, Good as adverbs, adjectives, and interjections, curse words are pretty useful for the bad kid. Befriend them and use them in as many different ways as possible. Watch Scorsese movies for creative suggestions.

, Don't forget the nonverbal methods of communicating badly. If you notice other people around you looking uncomfortable, as if you've offended them, of they're put off by something that you're talking about, that means you're on the right track. Keep talking about whatever it is. It's doing the bad trick.

"
"
Make your resting face a scowl.,
Avoid eye contact.,
Use closed body language.,
Smirk instead of smiling.,
Dress like a bad kid.,
Consider a tattoo or a facial piercing.",How to Be Bad3," Practice this in the mirror: furl your eyebrows into a scrunched up scowl, as if you were concentrating really hard. Turn your nose up like something smells terrible. And frown. Turn your smile upside down, like you had two fishhooks hanging from the corners of your mouth. Beautiful. Make this face at all times.

, Bad kids never look anyone in the eye. That communicates that you're willing to talk and you're interesting in them as a person. A bad kid is never interested. Look over people, as if you're bored by what they're saying, or focus on the floor. Look anywhere but in another person's eyes.


Alternatively, if someone challenges you–another bad kid, or an unsuspecting goodie-goodie–then you've got to stare them down. Lock eyes and channel your death rays. Be an alpha.

, A bad kid should look totally unapproachable. That means crossed legs, crossed arms, slouching, and a drooping head. Look as if it's physically painful to sit up straight. If you have to sit next to someone, sit as far away as possible from them, as if the idea of physical contact would make you nauseated.

, No matter how bad you are, eventually–somehow, someday–you're probably going to crack a smile or two. Something will be funny, especially the misfortune of others. But when someone slips and falls on the ice, or you learn about a terrible school bus accident, you can't smile like a doofus: ya gotta smirk. Learn to smirk instead of smiling.


Try this: imagine you've got a fishhook through one corner of your mouth, and someone's pulling it up. Now squint your eyes and nod slowly, as if you're totally satisfied with what you're seeing, but can't be bothered to really care about it one way or another. Perfect.

, Bad kids make friends with the color black, especially if it's black leather. Learn to start dressing like a bad kid and giving yourself a nasty reputation instantly.


For boys, black metal band t-shirts, leather jackets, and combat boots are a quick way to look bad. You could always rock some camo pants if you want to get a commando thing going. It should always be dark and severe. For more of a corporate look, wear a tight-fitting suit and constantly talk about how expensive it is. Don't let anyone touch it.
For girls, styling your hair in a-symmetrical fashions and using severe make-up is a good way to stand out as a rule-breaker. Bright red lipstick, dark eye make-up, and chunky Doc Martens under a baby-doll dress. Put some safety pins in your jacket and you're ready for the punk show.

, No bad kid can complete the image without some ink and some metal. If you're of the right age, or can get parental permission (or better yet, an older brother who'll sign for you), you can get a tattoo to make your badness permanent.


Good tattoos for bad kids: skulls, panthers, anything sharp and barbed-wire-like. Sailor Jerry tattoos are popular, as well as Japanese-style ink. Any combination of the above is also acceptable.
Good piercings are typically facial piercing. Eyebrow, nose, or lip are common bad-kid piercings. Instantly iconic and recognizable. If you've got your ears pierced, add a second for increased danger cred. If anyone asks, it didn't hurt.

, You need to lighten up and have a ball.

, Bring back that child  who wondered about what it was like to live on the moon.  There was much good in your childhood play.  

,  If you want to wear shorts with socks and sandals, go for it.

, A child has no prejudice; everyone is a friend and a play mate to them.

, A boy plays with his best friend and they fight. The next day they forget about it and are still friends. An adult can hold a grudge forever.

, A child goes to a fast food place, plays with a kid and wants to invite them to their birthday party. An adult has to know you for years before you can socialize.

, A child believes in the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus and dragons. All you have to do is believe in yourself and have hope for better days to come.

, Remember how you couldn’t wait for Christmas to come or to get an Easter basket? Look forward to the good things to come such as spring, or warm weather, or a special event, or a new grandchild someday. In conclusion, often when we see kids playing we think to ourselves, look at how cute they are, so young and don't have a clue. Maybe it's adults who do not have a clue and kids are our greatest teachers.

Be clear on the type of event.,
Clarify cultural differences.,
Be observant.",How to Be Proper1," Before accepting an invitation or agreeing to tag along somewhere, ask a lot of questions. Find out where the event will take place, what type of event it is (formal or informal) and who will be there. Getting a ton of information upfront will allow you to asses the situation before you get there and make the right decisions so you can fit in.


If the event is formal, for example, a great follow-up question would be regarding the dress code. Ask if a tie is expected or if wearing a suit jacket will suffice.
By finding out the type of people who are expected to make an appearance, you can also make judgements about what's expected. For example, when going to a barbecue with your mom's co-workers, it would be inappropriate to dress like you're going club with friends.;
, What may be acceptable for one group, may be highly improper for another. Research these variables to avoid offending someone.


Consider, for example, slurping is the norm and a sign of culinary enjoyment in Japan but would be viewed as improper at a debutante dance in Georgia, U.S.A.
Another example of this would be understanding the religious observances of certain populations. It would be improper, for instance, to use your left hand while eating amongst certain groups.

, Always watch to see how others are behaving around you. This will offer clues as to what's proper or not. If everyone is greeting with a double kiss on the cheek, follow their lead.


In some cultures, waiting for the eldest to sit first is the proper protocol, while others have no set expectations.

"

Have table manners.,
Make everyone feel comfortable.,
Stop slouching.,
Open the door.,
Make eye contact.",How to Be Proper2," Even if you’re at the local burger joint, put a napkin in your lap, chew with your mouth closed, keep your feet off the table, wipe your mouth and don’t burp out loud. Proper table etiquette is a key to being liked and invited out more often.If there’s a wait staff, don’t forget the please and thank you.
Don’t go overboard with it. You can still be relaxed and have a good time.

, When inviting a few people over to your house, be sure each of them will have something to eat and/or drink. Find out prior whether they are vegetarian, are allergic to nuts or don't care for surgery sodas.


They will not only notice but appreciate the consideration.

, Carrying proper posture speaks volumes about who you. Stand up straight with your shoulders back and head up. No need to keep looking at the ground. It’s not going anywhere.


When seated, the same rules apply.

, If you are out and about and notice someone has their hands full, definitely grab the door for them. Wait for them to enter/exit the establishment and follow behind. You could even say something along the lines of, ""Here you go. After you...""


This also applies for someone entering your home. Greet the visitor and open the door, leaving them plenty of space to walk in. While it may be obvious that you want them to enter, it's best to say something like, ""Please, come on in!"", Get the hair out of your face and smile for goodness sake! When greeting someone for the first time, make sure you send the proper initial impression. You want to convey that you’re confident and mature.

"
"
Put the phone down.,
Be polite.,
Don’t make lewd gestures/comments.,
Watch your online posts.",How to Be Proper3," It’s completely improper to stare at a screen while speaking to someone or at the movie theater.Not only is it rude to those around you, it’s a distraction from being completely in the moment.


This also applies to all electronic devices. For example, if someone is trying to have a conversation with you, pull the headphones off or stop clicking away on the iPad for a few minutes. It will be there when you’re done.

, The proper thing to do when interrupting someone would be to say something like, “Excuse me” or “Sorry for interrupting, but…” Try not to just barge in on conversations. Think about how you would want another person to treat you.

, You might have seen something in your favorite comedy that you want to imitate for your friends, but be aware of your surroundings. It’s acceptable if you’re in a private setting, instead of the grocery store. Also, jokes are only funny if everyone laughs. Don’t try to get a laugh at someone else’s expense.


Notice the behavior of others around you as this will give you a clue as to what’s proper or not.

, Don’t forget that anything you post online is officially public. Think twice and perhaps three times before ridiculing or mocking another person.


Don't post things when you're angry. If emotional, walk away and gather your thoughts. This will ensure you offer a proper response/comment to any given situation."
"
Watch the cursing.,
Use proper grammar.,
Lower your voice.",How to Be Proper4," There isn’t a lot that is more improper than throwing out a bunch of curse words in the middle of a restaurant or baseball game. Doing so will make you look immature and oblivious. Keep your choice words and phrases for a more private setting.


Better yet, rid yourself completely of this habit. The more frequently you use this language, the harder it will be to stop when you get older. This could lead to serious consequences like getting reprimanded at school or fired from a job.The words you choose reflect who you are as a person. Do you want everyone to think you’re a brat or a proper young adult?

, Of course it’s cool to use the latest lingo amongst your closest buddies or skip proper sentence structure when texting, but you are simply creating bad habits for yourself. Watch how doing this will creep into your everyday speaking.


By using improper grammar, you will end up sounding like an uneducated dope.
Think about your future. Would you hire someone who sounded foolish?
If others start correcting your verb tense, it’s time to pay more attention in class., Everyone doesn’t need to hear your personal conversation. Whether on the phone or talking face-to-face with another person, be mindful of your raised voice. Check to see if people are turning to stare as an indicator.


It could draw unwanted attention and embarrass you, especially if the subject matter is sensitive.

Follow the dress code.,
Know where you are going.,
Don’t reveal too much skin.,
Skip tacky shirts.",How to Be Proper5," If your school has a specific dress code, it’s best to adhere to it as much as possible. It’s understandable that you want to flex your individuality muscles but school may not be the best place if there are rules clearly established. If your school requires you wear a uniform, you may not have much wiggle room, but if they only have a few restrictions, follow those, but still add a personal touch.


Determine what they are and figure out a way to work within those guidelines. If there is something you’re just dying to wear to school, consider asking an adult like your parents or a faculty member to double check.
You can still be yourself while following the dress code by wearing unique accessories like hair adornments, watches or cool footwear.

, What might be okay to wear with your friends at the skate park, may not be the best choice for church or to meet a college recruiter. Consider all your options when choosing an outfit to ensure you send the proper image.


Skip the suit and tie if that isn't your thing. Just make sure it's classy.

, This is especially true for young ladies. There’s no need to toss on a belly-bearing top and a short skirt, even if it is scorching hot out. It probably is the most comfy thing you own, but leave a little to the imagination. A good rule of thumb is if you’re showing skin on top, cover the legs or vice versa.


You should definitely showcase your sense of style and personality, but ask yourself what type of message you will be sending.
Remember, you want to be perceived as a proper young woman and nothing else.

, You’re hilarious and everyone knows it, but a proper young guy will not want to wear an offensive t-shirt, if trying to send the right message. Think about all the eyes that will be on you as soon as you step outside. They may not get the joke and think that you’re just a jerk instead."

, Always drink water throughout the day it keeps your breath fresh. Chew mint gum or have mints with you. Take a shower everyday and after every work out. Wash your face with an amazing face wash. If you have acne, spend money to get a really good face wash because acne is not attractive! Make sure to shave your legs everyday, whether it's gym or if you want to wear shorts. When you get out of the shower put a nice smelling lotion on, and then spray yourself with matching perfume. Spray the perfume while you're in a towel and after you get dressed. Some good lotions and perfumes come from Bath and Body Works.

, Get your hair trimmed or cut every 6 weeks. This improves hair growth and gets rid of unsightly split-ends. On the weekends try to find out which products are best for your hair.

, The clothes you wear should make you feel comfortable. Try to pick your outfits the night before you go to school or an event, so in the morning you have more time to focus on make-up and hair. Don't be intimidated by other girls outfits if they are really cute. Just compliment her, and be the better person. Use her as a role model and try to find outfits in the stores instead of just buying shirts and pants

, Add your own personal style to your outfits, hair or make-up. Get highlights, wear bright colored eyeliner or eyeshadow, or wear the same necklace with every outfit.

A girl next door is low maintenance, so don't bother buying a whole new wardrobe and just work with what you have. Be sure to wear whatever you feel most comfortable in, as long as you feel happy and confident in the way you look. If you want, wear skirts, blouses, and ballet flats all of the time, but don't be afraid to be seen in leggings and a T-shirt.
, Take a multivitamin, drink 6-8 glasses of water, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and exercise each and every day. Maintain proper hygiene by washing and moisturizing your face and hands every day, washing and moisturizing your body at least every other day, and washing and conditioning your hair as necessary. Keep your body odor under control with deodorant or a natural alternative. Also, brush and floss your teeth twice a day., You can wear as much or as little as you like, but the typical look is natural with a glowing complexion. To achieve this look, apply concealer on any blemishes or dark circles, place highlighter on your cheekbones and the bridge of your nose, apply a generous coat of lip balm or a natural pink lip gloss, and wear 1-2 coats of a really good mascara that lengthens, curls, and volumizes your lashes. This is an everyday look that is natural, dewy, and very easy to pull off, as it looks like you but more put together. Do not feel the need to wear makeup, as people are just as beautiful in their natural form., Wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner when necessary. Use a comb rather than a brush if possible. Cut your hair to a length that suits your personality, whether it be a pixie cut, bob, shoulder length, or long. Put in layers or long bangs if you want to change things up. If possible, avoid extra hair products, like gels and sprays, and heat styling. Additionally, if you can, tousle it to add volume and mess it up just enough to look effortlessly chic. You can also do easy hairstyles like messy buns, ponytails, half ups, pigtails, or wearing a headband. If your hair is curly or kinky and requires extra maintenance, do what you must to keep it healthy and protected, whether it be bantu knots, cornrows, dreadlocks, box braids, or anything else you'd like. Never feel that you must wear weaves, extensions, or wigs, no matter what your natural hair looks like, as it will be beautiful as long as you care for it and show it love., After all, you will look and feel better if you can relax, knowing where everything is and that you've gotten everything done., Everybody likes the girl next door because she is not afraid to let loose and have fun. Go to parties, the beach, the movies, people's houses, the mall, the bowling alley, the arcade, the bookstore, or wherever you believe you can have the most fun. Nevertheless, stay safe and smart with whatever decisions you make., A girl who is truly hilarious is not hard to find, but many suppress their own senses of humor to pursue other interests. Even if no one else finds your jokes funny, make them, so at least people know you have a sense of humor and aren't afraid of embarrassment. In time, your jokes will likely get funnier as you become more in tune with your comedic side and find the people who share similar interests., Strangers are just friends you haven't made yet. The world may seem to be a scary place, but it is filled with people who desire real, human connection. Allow these interactions to come by seeming easygoing, open-minded, and willing to converse with anybody. The nerds, the jocks, the goths, and everyone in between have their strong points if you're willing to see them. Even if your connections aren't permanent, every conversation can be impactful if you let it be., The girl next door type can be seen watching (or playing) sports, playing video games, reading comic books, and just embracing her inner tomboy. She can also be seen shopping, gossiping, dancing, and just hanging out with the girls. There are no gender limits on her interests, as she'll do whatever interests her. So make some memes, watch some funny YouTubers, write blog posts, listen to metal music, climb some trees, and do as you please. If you typically participate in activities generally associated with masculinity or femininity, explore the other side. Don't feel restricted to any particular set of hobbies. Some other fun things to do include

Making creative and funny videos by yourself or with friends. Write your own skits and have some fun with various characters.
Playing an instrument, singing, and writing your own songs. Try to explore all genres of music and pick out the artists you like, no matter what kind of music they make, and allow it to influence your personal taste and creations. There is little more satisfying than creating a song you love and allowing others to hear it.
Doodle, sketch, paint, sew, or sculpt. Create some sort of visual art in a cool and unique style, even if you're not that talented or artistically inclined.
Write stories about your friends, real or imaginary, and read them out loud. This will always make a fun group event.

, Friendship shouldn't be restrained. If you find people with the same sense of humor, hobbies, and outlook on life as you, welcome them into your life as you can truly have great experiences together. Don't completely abandon your old friends if you find that they are not like the new, real you, but introduce them to your true self and see if you still match., If you want to be weird, speak loudly, talk while eating, be a little gross, be a little wild, just do it. Choose dare and go to the greatest extent. What other people think is of none of your concern, as long as you love yourself and those around you, you will be just fine. However, take this advice with a grain of salt - you still want your boss to think highly of you, for example, so keep it professional when necessary. But, don't be afraid to let your personality shine."

When solving a problem, do you look inside first to solve the problem or outside? In other words, do you think about yourself first, or others? (Note: Do not be ashamed to admit that you think about yourself first. If you do, you are most likely a feeling type.)


Someone who normally looks in and is energized by social activity is typically extroverted in MBTI terms. They also crave being around people.
If you're the kind of person who thinks about other's feelings before acting and needs alone time to recharge, you're probably introverted.;
, Do you do it through sensing or through intuition? Sensors see the trees; intuitives see the forest.



Sensors prefer concrete detail and facts. They're more likely to say ""I won't believe it till I see it."" They tend to distrust hunches or guesses when they're not rooted in logic, observation or facts. They also are better at details. They also are very conscious about their own needs.

Intuitives, on the other hand, feel more comfortable with abstract information and theories. They are spontaneous and more imaginative than sensors and enjoy exploring beyond the here and now, especially when thinking about the possibilities of the future. Their thoughts revolve around patterns, connections, and flashes of insights. Some also have trouble staying in the present, often daydreaming or forgetful - for example, they may forget to eat their lunch when really focused.

, Once you gather your information, whether by sensing or by feeling, how do you arrive at a decision?


Do you tend to try to look at it from the perspective of everyone involved in an attempt to find the most balanced, harmonious solution (e.g. reach a consensus)? If so, your preference is probably for feeling.
If you tend to look for the most logical and consistent solution, perhaps measuring it up against a set of rules or assumptions, then your decision-making preference is likely to be thinking.

Feeling types tend to be very uncomfortable with the presence of conflict, while thinking types usually accept and expect it as part and parcel of dealing with others.
Some people assume that the feeling preference implies an emotional person, while the thinking preference is tied to a more rational person, but this is not the case. Both are rational approaches, and people with either preference can be emotional.



, Do you tend to communicate judgments or perceptions to others?


If you have a judging preference, you're more likely to explain to people how you make decisions and like to have matters settled - case closed. You like to make plans, check things off of a to-do list, and get things done ahead of deadlines.
On the other hand, if you're the perceiving type, you'll tend to share your observations with the world, leaving matters open. You also prefer to do things ""on the fly"", mix work with play, and wait until the last minute before making a decision or commitment.

, INTJ, ENFP).


The first letter is either I (for introverted) or E (for extroverted).
The second letter is either S (for sensing) or N (for intuitive).
The third letter is either T (for thinking) or F (for feeling).
The fourth letter is either J (for judging) or P (for perceiving).

, Simply doing an Internet search for the four-letter combination will result in several websites describing your Myers Briggs Personality Type. Read them in order to gain insights into your personality and determine areas where you can push out of your comfort zone and develop new skills.


If the description isn't accurate, you may want to take an MBTI test. There are many types available, ranging from free online quizzes to long, thorough and official MBTI evaluations administered by a qualified professional.

, If you don't trust the abyss that is the Internet, you may be interested in taking the MBTI test from a professional, like a psychologist or even a career counselor. More than 10,000 companies, 2,500 colleges and universities and 200 government agencies use the test to understand their employees and students.Join 'em!


You may or may not get the same results as you would on a test you take on the Internet. If you're on the fence on a trait or two, even the mood of that day could determine your results.

, Just knowing your type isn't all that's out there. There are entire profiles you can look up on the Internet or that your psychologist or employer could give you. It can help you understand what ""sensing"" or ""perceiving"" really mean. They are assigned titles, like ""The Giver,"" or ""The Teacher,"" etc.


The full profile addresses your personality type in a number of environments -- work, personal relationships, home, and so on and so forth. You may think the four-letter code doesn't sound like you, but a more in-depth analysis may convince you.

, When you know what type you are, you can begin to understand how you might fit into the world around you. If you're an INTJ and you're a salesman, you might be rethinking your line of work! There are plenty of everyday uses for this test.Consider it when you're learning. How do you take in and perceive facts and concepts?
Consider it in your relationships. How do you mix with other personality types?
Consider it for personal growth. Knowing your tendencies is the only way you can recognize them and begin branching out. Or harnessing your power!

, No single personality type is superior to another. The MBTI seeks to identify natural preferences, not abilities. When determining your type, look at it from the perspective of what you tend to do, not what you think you should do. Recognizing your own preferences is a useful tool in self-development.

, This is a fascinating concept -- quite clearly a trendy, fascinating concept: millions of people take it every year.So get to asking your friends! It may even help you relate to each other.


An ESFJ and an INTP might make for an interesting conversation when it comes to personality type. Find people who are different than you and sit down to talk about the test. And find someone who is the same -- did you know you were the same or were you surprised? Sometimes it's hard to tell.

, If you're unhappy with your results, don't sweat it. This is a very prominent test, yes, but there is so much more to you than your MBTI results. It's like saying, ""Oh. You're an Aquarius, huh? You'll never be punctual and caring!"" No. It doesn't work like that.


And in fact, your results may fluctuate throughout your life. That's partly because your environment determines a lot about you. So take the test now and revisit it again in a few years! You may have flip-flopped on a tendency or two.

Sell old items online.,
Sell things to local stores.,
Ask your parents to hold a garage sale.,
Make and sell crafts.,
Sell things in school.",How to Get Rich (Kids)1," You probably have some things lying around that you don’t use anymore. Selling your old items can be a great way to make money. Sites like Craig's List, eBay, and even Facebook can help you find people willing to purchase old items.


Old toys, video games, video game systems, books, DVDs, collectibles, like baseball cards and stuffed animals, can be great items to resell online.
Know that you won’t get as much money as you paid for items you are selling. Once something has been used, it loses value. So expect to make about 30 to 40% of what you originally paid for an item when you resell it.Try eBay. Make sure to accurately describe the condition of the items you are selling. eBay will allow you sell items in an auction setting or list a ""sell now” price. Be prepared to ship the items you are selling. It is going to cost you some money to ship the items, so be aware of this when coming up with your prices. Never give out your address, home phone number, or agree to have someone come by the house to pick the item up. You don’t who is agreeing to buy your items and you need to protect yourself. If you're under 18, you will need to have an adult create an eBay account that you can use.Try Craig's List. Craig's List has a section where you can post about items you're willing to sell. If you're posting in a specific city, you may have to meet a buyer in person if they make an offer on an item. Be safe. Meet the buyer in a public place and take a friend or family member with you.There may be specific sites to sell used books, video games, collectibles, and other items. A google search may provide you a list of possible websites where you can sell your products.;
, Certain stores, like bookstores and game stores, buy used items if they are in good condition. You could try taking books you have already read to the bookstore to sell them or video games you don’t play anymore into the game store to make some money. Old clothes, toys, and household items can be sold at thrift stores. Again, be aware that you won’t get as much money for these items as you originally paid, but if you have a lot of stuff to sell it will add up with time., Garage sales are great means to sell old items for a small fee and get rich when you are a kid. See if your parents are willing to hold a garage sale. If you're about to move or simply have a lot of clutter, your parents may jump at the chance to get rid of old items. You can set up your own booth where you can sell some of your own old items., If you're crafty, you can try and make and sell your own crafts. Knitted items, candy, jewelry, and gift baskets and other items might sell during holiday seasons when people are looking for unique gifts.


You can sell items at local craft fairs. You can also sell them online on websites like Etsy.If you're under 18, you will need an adult to manage your Etsy account.As with conducting any online sales, be careful. Do not give your address and only meet someone face-to-face if it's in a public space and you're accompanied by a friend or family member., If allowed, see if you can sell things in school. Things like pencils, erasers, snacks, or other school supplies might sell well if you can offer a discounted price. Resell items you did not use in the previous school year, or ask your parents if you can purchase them in bulk at an office supply store or discount warehouse. Just make sure you check with your principal and teachers. Make sure selling supplies in school is allowed given your school's policies.

Prove you can handle money responsibly.,
Do your homework on credit cards.,
Discuss the benefits of establishing and building a credit score.,
Understand the limits if you are under 18, or even 21.,
Start with a prepaid debit card.,
Establish your own checking account with a linked debit card.,
Become an authorized user on your parents’ credit card.,
Consider a secured credit card.,
Move on to a student credit card between ages 18 and 21.",How to Get Your Parents to Get You a Credit Card," If you can’t show that you have the maturity and self-control to be sensible with your money, you have very little chance of convincing your parents to let you have your own credit card. Used irresponsibly, credit cards can have lasting negative financial effects for teens as well as adults.Keep your spending under control. If you repeatedly blow your allowance on frivolous items, you will have a difficult time justifying being given access to even more money. Show that you can be thoughtful in your purchases, and can control your buying impulses.
Start keeping records. Even if you don’t have a checking account yet, you can keep a simple logbook of your income and expenditures. Showing an interest in keeping track of your money may signal to your parents that you have the maturity to handle a credit card.
Make your own money. If you are old enough to hold a part-time job, use it as an opportunity to demonstrate your responsibility with money. Many parents will want proof that you know that “money doesn’t grow on trees,” but instead requires hard work.;
, Instead of whining that you need a credit card because “all my friends have one,” take the initiative to learn about the particulars of credit card ownership and the options available to you. This will also be taken as a sign of maturity.If, for instance, you show an awareness of how compounding interest and/or late fees can make an unpaid balance skyrocket quickly, you may ease your parents’ minds about your likelihood of maxing out a card.
See the relevant section of this article for information on the types of cards available to teens.

, Some parents may already believe that it’s never too early to start building up good credit, but others may need some convincing. Research the subject and present a good case on why you should be building up yours already.Your credit score basically reflects your ability to utilize credit and pay it off on time and in full. The higher your score, the more credit-worthy you will be judged by potential lenders.
While only a small percentage of your overall credit score is affected by the amount of time you have utilized credit,even small increases in your credit score can make securing loans and purchasing cars and a home easier in your future.
Most parents love to hear that their teens are thinking about their future, so demonstrating knowledge and interest about your credit score may help get them to relent on a credit card.

, In the U.S., it is much more difficult for teens and young adults to secure their own credit cards than it was even ten years ago. The federal CARD Act of 2009 is intended to protect consumers, including those under age 21.If you are under 18, it is virtually impossible for you to secure a credit card in your own name. Your best bet is to consider debit / prepaid card options, or to become an authorized user on your parents’ card. See the relevant section of this article for more on these options.
If you are between 18 and 21, you now need to either have an adult co-signer or be able to prove that you have the income to pay the minimum monthly balance. In practice, unless you have a steady job, it will be difficult for you to secure a credit card on your own.

, If your parents show an interest in letting you have a credit card, but want to be able to supervise and (when necessary) limit your spending, a prepaid debit card can be a good “starter” card. It is also good practice for you before possibly moving onto other options.There are several prepaid debit cards marketed towards teens, such as the Visa Buxx card.Prepaid debit cards require your parents to deposit funds in your account, and your spending ability is limited to that amount. Cards marketed for teens usually allow both you and your parents to easily track your spending and receive spending alerts.
Such cards have no impact on your credit score (if you have one yet), but they work like a credit card at retailers and offer good practice in using a card and tracking spending.

, Especially if you are old enough to have a part-time job, it will be much more convenient come paycheck time for you to have a bank account. Linking a debit card to this account will give you some spending freedom, but still establish limits.Depending upon your age and the bank you use, you may need to open a joint account with your parent(s).
Look for accounts with overdraft protection, especially if you or your parents are concerned about your ability to keep track of the money in your account. You don’t want to get hit with big fees for spending money you don’t have.

, As an authorized user, you will receive a card with your name on it, and be free to use it wherever cards are accepted. All charges will be directed to the single account in your parents’ names.According to the 2009 CARD Act, this is your only real option to get a fully-functional credit card with your name on it if you are under 18.
This is the point when the “trust factor” really has to kick in. As an authorized user, you are legally free to spend up to the credit limit on the card, and the primary account holder (your parent) is liable for the charges.
This is also when you can start building up your own credit. Credit reporting agencies typically include authorized user accounts when determining a credit score. However, they have methods in place to exclude “piggybacking” — that is, adding your name to an account strictly to improve your own credit score.Expect and accept that your parent(s) will set strict spending limits except in cases of real emergencies (like a broken down car, not a sale at your favorite store!). They may also expect you to be able to pay your share of the bill each month.
If they are a bit wary, your parents may want to open a new card with a low credit limit to provide a cap on your possible spending.

, Secured cards are another option as an authorized user, or if you are over 18 and meet the income requirements for your own card. These cards require you to provide cash collateral in order to receive credit.With secured credit cards, you deposit a small amount into a bank account — often $250 or $300 — and this becomes your credit limit. If you can’t pay your monthly balance, the amount is taken out of this account.
So, similar to a debit card, your spending is connected to existing funds in an account. Unlike a debit card, however, you are incurring monthly credit charges and are expected to pay them off in full.
In order to build a good credit score with a secured card, you need to be able to pay off your balance in full and on time each month. You don’t want to have to dip into your collateral funds.

, If you have sufficient income to satisfy the requirements of the CARD Act, this is the point when you can truly have a credit card of your own. Look first at cards that are designed with students and young adults in mind.You may need to have a parent as a co-signer on your application (which means he/she shares responsibility for any debts), but try to convince him/her to make you the primary account holder. This means you will get the statements, and is a better way for you to build good credit card responsibility practices.
Practice good credit card management by spending only money you have (or will have by the time the bill is due), and paying off your entire balance on time each month. Instill good habits in yourself and, whenever possible, avoid sinking into credit card debt right from the start of adulthood.
A low-frills card, with a no annual fee, low interest rates, and a low credit limit is usually the best bet for a student credit card. Think of it as a card with “training wheels” before you move on to fully grown-up credit cards after age 21."

Spice up the mowing by going diagonally instead of using straight lines. This looks really fancy and it's just as easy to do as straight lines. Of course, ask your neighbors first whether you can cut diagonal lines.
Take pictures of your mow jobs and show them to your neighbors. This should make them less apprehensive about hiring you if they have any apprehension.

Have a garage sale.,
Participate in a flea market.,
Rent your things.,
Dress designing or stitching.,
Paint or craft.,
Sell entertainment.,
Take your items to a pawn shop.,
Sell used books.",How to Make Money Fast Without a Job1," A garage sale is a great way to get rid of unwanted household items and make money in the process! Staples of garage sales include old clothing, books, toys, household knickknacks, lawn and garden tools, sports equipment, and board games. Larger items like furniture and occasionally home appliances are also sold. Garage sales take time and preparation, so make sure to start planning well in advance.


Set a date. Pick a date 2-3 weeks ahead of time. This will give you time to plan and advertise your sale.
When setting a date, be conscious of the time of year and be sure to take weather and temperature into account. You are less likely to have good traffic on very hot or very cold days and rain is major deterrent.
Advertise your garage sale in local newspapers, on community bulletin boards and on Craigslist. The more people who are aware that your garage sale is taking place, the more people who will show up!
Gather items for sale. This should be done in the weeks leading up to your garage sale. Go through old boxes in the garage, attic and under the stairs. Walk from room to room and gather any items you no longer want or need.
Attach a clearly written price label to each item. This will make it easier for customers and save you time on the day. You can use small adhesive labels, bits of masking tape or a sticker gun.
Enlist help from friends, family and neighbors. This will make your garage sale more manageable and less stressful. You will also have more fun this way!
Have plenty of change. Go to the bank the day before your garage sale and get rolls of quarters, dimes and nickels and plenty of dollar bills.
Add interest to your garage sale by selling crafts, baked goods and beverages. Items like cookies and lemonade will sell well while also encouraging people to stick around a bit longer.;
, A flea market is a type of bazaar that rents space to people who want to sell or barter merchandise. You can sell all types of used goods at a flea market, though jewelry, household furniture and sports equipment are popular and profitable choices.


Find out the location of your nearest flea market. Talk to the vendors and find out if they are happy with traffic and sales in that location.
Find out how much it costs to rent a booth at the flea market. Compare with other flea market locations.
Find out when the flea market is open. Some flea markets are open every weekend and some only once a month.
Find out how booth space is reserved. Can you just show up on the day or do you need to reserve your space in advance? Are outdoor and indoor booths available?
Figure out if you need a permit to sell goods at your local flea market. One time vendors may not be required to have a permit, but if you intend on vending on a regular basis a permit may be necessary.
Think about whether you'll need tables, chairs or a tent to sell your goods. Find out if these items are available to rent.
When selling, make sure to have plenty of change available as customers may only have bank notes. Offer paper or reusable bags for your customers to use.

, Renting out your belongings is a convenient way to make some easy money. More and more, people are unwilling to spend large sums of money on items they rarely use. Instead, people are prepared to rent such items from thrifty people willing to lend their belongings for an appropriate fee. Luxury items such as holiday homes, boats and RV's have always been popular rental items, but nowadays items such as vacuum cleaners, power tools and electronic equipment can also find enthusiastic takers.


The easiest way to advertise the items that you wish to rent is by using a website that connects local owners and borrowers. Zilok, Rentalic and SnapGoods are among the largest — serving as listing, reservation and payment portals (made via the borrower’s PayPal account or a credit card).These websites provide a contract, which usually includes a security deposit to ensure that merchandise is returned without damage., By starting a little business of dress designing you can earn money, by getting order from boutique or from common people.

, If you are creatively inclined, making and selling artwork and craft items can be a fun and rewarding way to make some extra money. Paintings, pottery, photographs, glass work, needlecraft and handmade jewelry are some good examples of artistic creations that can be sold for a profit.


If you are a member of a painting or craftwork group, find out it they hold any art exhibitions. If not, why not organize one? Art exhibitions are a great vehicle for getting your artwork out there and generating interest with potential buyers.
Research whether there are any craft fairs in your area. If so, you may be able to rent a booth to display and sell your work at the fair.
You can also sell your artwork online using websites such as Made It Myself and Art You Can.
Be careful when pricing your artwork. Cheaper artwork is easier to sell, especially if you are an unknown artist. However, it's also important that you cover the cost of your materials and make a profit.

, If you can sing, dance, play an instrument or perform a magic trick then why not turn that talent into a business?


Entertain the public by working as a street performer. Find a good space to set up. You want plenty of foot traffic but don't choose anywhere too noisy, you don't want to be drowned out.
Find out if you need permission to perform in that space. Even if you don't need an official permit, it's common courtesy to ask the permission of any store owners within earshot.
Set out a hat, tip jar or instrument case to collect your tips. Put some of your own coins or bills in the case, as this will catch the attention of passersby and encourage them to tip as well!
Perform at events such as weddings, local fairs or children's birthday parties. This is easier if you are part of a band or dance troupe. Come up with a catchy name and ask friends and relatives if you can perform at their events for free in order to get your name out there. If you're good enough, you'll soon have people willing to book you for paid events.

, A pawn shop is a good option if you need to get some cash fast but don't want to part with any of your belongings permanently.“Pawning” means that you give the pawn shop an item in exchange for a cash loan. For example, you might give them your mountain bike as collateral for a $75 loan. If you repay the loan by a certain date, typically 90 to 120 days after you pawn the item, you can retrieve your bike. The loan repayment amount will include interest and fees that are regulated by the state. If you don’t repay the money on time, the pawn shop takes ownership of the bike and can offer it for resale.You also have the option of selling your item to the pawn shop, if you're not interested in taking out a loan.


Find the right pawn shop. Do some online research to see what others have said about working with local pawn shops. Then, choose a reputable shop and broker you feel comfortable with. Also, know that some pawn shops specialize in certain items. For example, if you have an antique, look for a pawn shop that has experience buying and selling antique items.Know if you want to pawn or sell. Pawn shops will give you the choice, so educate yourself on the options and know the ups and downs of each before you go in. The decision should be based on a number of things including your ability to repay a loan and the value you place on the item you are pawning or selling.Negotiate. Understand that pawn store owners are resellers, not collectors. Just because a collector values your vintage vinyl at $100, doesn’t mean that you will get that from a pawnbroker. Set a minimum price ahead of time so you don’t make a snap decision you’ll regret later.Be prepared to prove your claims. For example, if you bring in a valuable piece of jewelry, consider having a professional jeweler write up an appraisal so you can prove the piece’s worth. If the item runs on batteries, make sure it has fresh batteries in it so you can show that it works. Bringing items in their original packaging is always helpful.Show things in their best light. A layer of dust might make sense on an antique, but not on your printer. Imagine that you were going to purchase the item—what would you want it to look like?Pay on time. If you pawn an item for a loan, be sure to pay back the loan plus interest and fees on time and as agreed. Not doing so will cause you to forfeit your item or extend the loan which will carry additional charges., If you have a large pile of college textbooks gathering dust since graduation or just need to make room on your bookshelf, selling your used books is a great option to make some fast cash. You can get rid of your books the old fashioned way, using garage sales and book fairs, or you can sell your books online.


When selling books online, you have two main options. You can sell to buyers directly, using websites like Amazon and eBay. With these, you will be able to set your own price but you are also responsible for all organization, including including payment processing and shipping.
The second option is to sell your books to websites such as AbeBooks, Cash4Books and Powell's. With each of these, you simply input your book's ISBN number. They will immediately tell you if it's something they'd like to buy and what they will pay for it. One pro of using services like this is that they'll pay immediately, and even cover the shipping via labels you print out from your computer. The downside is that these companies are essentially middlemen who will sell your product to someone else for more money.
For college textbooks, many campus bookstores now provide ""buyback"" services. This is where you can sell your used textbooks back to the store you originally bought them from at the end of the school term or year. You will typically be able to sell the books back for around 50% of what you originally paid for them. The books need to be in good condition.

Clean the house.,
Do other basic chores.,

Do some wintertime jobs.,
Do computer chores.,
Ask your parents.,
Find other customers, if possible.,
Pick a price.,
Keep a written record of your work.,
Do a good job.",How to Make Money Through Chores," If you want to look for an easy way to make a difference at your house, look no further than cleaning. You can clean year-round, and if you do a good enough job you can ask to be paid. Talk to your parents about taking on cleaning responsibilities in different rooms and getting paid for it.


Start with your room. That's usually your responsibility, and not something that you'll be able to get paid to do. But if your room is clean, you'll be able to do other stuff and actually get paid for it.
Cleaning the bathroom, living room, and the kitchen are always good choices that get dirty quickly.
Think of other spaces, like the attic, garage, and sheds that might need to be cleaned. You might not need to clean these regularly, but once or twice a year you might do it for money.;
, There are lots of basic household things that you can learn to do, if you don't know how to do them already, and possibly get paid. All of the following are common household chores you might be able to volunteer to get paid for:


Taking out the garbage
Feeding pets
Walking dogs
Washing the dishes
Doing the laundry
Folding the laundry
Changing and making up the beds

, When it is nice and sunny out, you might as well get outside and get paid for it, right? Summertime means there's lots of things to do in the yard, in the driveway, and around your neighborhood:


Try doing a car wash, or washing your parents cars.

Try doing a lemonade stand when it's hot out.

Walking your neighbors' dogs.
Offer to babysit your neighbors' kids while you're on summer vacation.

Mow the lawn, or your neighbors' lawns.

Care for the garden, pruning and planting vegetables.

, As summer turns to fall, there will be different kinds of outdoor activities that you can do to keep your chore business going. If you have a yard, talk to your parents about caring for it to prepare for winter. Any of the following can be good autumn chores:


Cleaning gutters
Trimming bushes
Raking leaves
Picking up sticks, acorns, or other debris

, When winter and other holidays roll around, offer to hang or design decorations for the house, or for your neighbors houses. Bring in firewood, if you've got a fireplace that needs tending, and offer to be the one who cleans up snow.



Shoveling the driveway can be a great chore if you live in a very snowy area. It can be tough, so you can usually get a good price. Clean ice off the cars as well, or offer to scrape them each morning for a more regular chore.
Offer to do your neighbors driveways, too, if you can, or scrape their cars for them in the mornings.
Find out about delivering groceries to elderly neighbors, or checking in on them during long winter months.

, If you're a techno-wizard, you might be able to get paid to do things you would do in your free time. Instead of getting paid to do boring old cleaning chores, see if you can get paid to help your parents and neighbors do computer stuff for money.


Help elderly people learn to navigate a computer. Teach them to do the basics, like turning it on, using the keyboard and touchpad, and getting online.
Help people set up email accounts and email their friends and relatives.
Help people set up social networking accounts, like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Show them how to start accounts, make friends, and upload pictures and updates.

, If you want to get paid to do chores, the best people to talk to are your parents. Sit them down when they're not busy, and explain what chores you plan on doing, and whether or not they'll pay you to do them.


If they say no, ask what you could do that they would pay you for. It might be that you haven't chosen enough chores, or hard enough chores to get paid to do them.
They might ask you what you want money for, and what you plan to do with it. It's important to have a good answer ready to go, and make sure that it's something you'll be allowed. A good answer is always, ""I just want to learn to make money for myself."" They'll love that.

, Your parents are the obvious choice, but neighbors, local elderly persons, people from church or school, and anyone close enough to walk might also be good employers for your chore-doing business.


Whoever you talk to about making money, make sure you trust them first. Always talk to your parents before offering to work for a stranger. Never go over to a strangers house without a parent or trusted adult accompanying you.

, There are two ways to pick a price. You can either get paid for a whole job, or get paid by the amount of time it takes you to do that job. Bigger jobs are usually better to do by the hour, because they'll take longer, while smaller or easier jobs are usually better to do for the whole job, if they won't take long.


If you mow a lawn, it might take two hours. If you say you want to get paid a reasonable price, like 5 dollars an hour, you'll get paid 10 bucks.
The laundry might take several hours, but it's mostly just waiting. That's probably a better by-the-job choice. Say you'll do all the laundry for 10 bucks.
If you want your parents to pay you to do chores, it's likely that they'll pick the price point. That's ok. Just be glad you're getting paid.

, Get a notebook for your chore job. Make a list of the chores that you'll do, how much you'll get paid, and when you completed the chore. When you do a job, write it down in your notebook and how much money you're owed for that job.


When you get to certain amount or selected day of payment, add the total cost of all your extra chores and you have a bit of extra cash.
You might consider taking pictures of the work you've done with a phone, for proof. If you say, ""Here's what the room looked like messy, and here it is after I cleaned,"" you'll be in a lot better shape.

, If you're going to make chores your job, you have to take it seriously and do good work. You're not going to get paid if your lawn mowing is sloppy, or only gets done half the time. You have to be serious if you're going to get paid.

, When do you expect the borrower to pay you back? If multiple payments will be made, agree on specific dates for the payments.

, Especially if you're lending money to a friend or family member, it may seem a little extortionate to charge interest. But there are several good reasons why you may want to charge the person you're giving money to a little bit of interest:


If you're giving away money without interest, you're losing money. You're losing purchasing power (the ability to buy and invest with the money you're lending) and inflation is outstripping your money.
If you charge someone interest, the borrower may be more likely to pay you back quicker than had you not. Think about it: Interest lasts as long as the life of the loan, so if the borrower holds on to the money longer, they'll end up paying more interest.
Don't charge more than 15% or 20%. In fact, interest rates above 15% or 20% might not even be allowed under predatory lending laws.So keep the interest rate at something manageable and both parties will be happy.

, Include your signature along with your legal name.

Doing so makes it easier and more manageable to plan for the solution and take steps towards reaching it.For example, if you are hoping to increase the income in your household, you can pare this goal down to saving $100 first. Then, your goal might be to double that amount, and so forth. This is much more feasible than setting a goal to just save $500 right off the bat.

, Identify steps you can take to meet your chosen objective. Conduct research on each option to get a full understanding of each.


The variables to increase your income could be working more hours, searching for a better paying job, or decreasing other expenses to free up more income.

,


Perhaps, you cannot find a new job or increase your work hours right now. Therefore, the only option available to you would be finding ways to cut back on other expenses.

, If it did not, you can go back to square one, and try to see if another variable is now available to you that can better meet your goals.

Understand why bullies target girls' and women's sexuality.,
Know that it isn't just about sex.,
You know yourself the best.",How to Deal With Girls Calling You a Slut," The word ""slut"" is a sexual slur used almost exclusively against women. It's a way to say that a girl or woman is a bad person because she has too much sex or too many sexual partners.Sometimes it is used in a bantering way between friends, and other times it is used to bully or put a woman down.


Sometimes girls and women call each other ""sluts"" as a way to take back that word from its negative use, in an effort to make light of it and drain it of some of its power. It's a way for girls to take the shame out of enjoying their sexuality. There are many oppressed groups that have ""reclaimed"" words once used against them in this way. If you have friends who call you a slut, think about their intent: they may mean it in an endearing way. You can ask them to stop if it bothers you, and since they are your friends, they should understand and do their best to stop.
If someone is using the word ""slut"" against you in a way that makes you feel belittled, hurt, or harassed, it doesn't matter what her intention is. She is bullying you.;
, Although the term slut is usually associated with someone who has a lot of sex, or who expresses her sexuality in ways that other people don't approve of, in reality it is often used in other ways by girls themselves.


One study of college women found that the word had very little to do with the target's sexual behaviors. Instead, in the study, higher social class women used the term against lower social class women as a way of saying that they didn't want to include them in their social group.That study found that white, middle-to upper-class college women used the word ""slut"" against poorer women and women of color most often, and that the bullies themselves often had more sexual experience than the targets., This might seem silly, especially if you're not a little kid and you think bullying belongs in elementary school. Actually, people of all ages can experience bullying, which really just means that a person is mean to another person over and over again.Calling names like ""slut"" is a very common form of girl-on-girl bullying.They may be calling you a slut because gossip has spread about your relationships or sexuality (possibly started by someone who wants to increase his own reputation as a ""stud""), but this word and others like it (such as ""whore,"" ""hoe,"" or ""skank"") may simply be your bullies' way of humiliating you with little or nothing to do with your sexual behavior.

, Technology makes bullying easier than ever, so if you are active on social networking sites, you may need to take some precautions to keep bullies from having access to your information.


Lock down your privacy settings and ensure that your only friends on social media are people you know and trust in real life. If you are friends with your bully, unfriend her; you might also consider unfriending mutual friends, or at the very least limiting what they can see on your profile.
Never post anything — text or photos — that you wouldn't want circulated among your family, friends, workplace, or school.
Report any bullying or threatening messages you receive to your parents, teachers, and even the police if the messages happen frequently or contain any threats.

, You might be tempted to return like-for-like when it comes to bullying behavior, but fighting with your bully by calling her names, spreading rumors about her, or getting into physical fights will not help your situation. In fact, it might result in you getting into trouble, when she's the one who started the whole thing.


If you have one bully, consider approaching her and asking her to stop. Be the bigger person. This can be incredibly hard in the moment, but give your bully a sincere smile, and say something like, ""I'm not sure why you said that, but I really want you to stop."" Then walk away. Sometimes a bully can be so taken back by a genuine response that she won't know what to do.If you think your bully is an otherwise reasonable person, ask her if she wants to talk. You might say, ""Is there something I did that made you angry at me? Would you like to have lunch and talk about it?"" Sitting down and having a conversation can help get at the root of her behavior, if she's willing. She may have heard a rumor about you or may have some other explanation for why she is targeting you. Even if she doesn't want to sit down and talk, knowing that you're a reasonable person who is open to discussion might make her less upset with you and less likely to target you.
Think about the relationship as a balloon that is not fully filled with air. If you don't put any air into the balloon, it will continue to not have substance to it. If you do put air into the balloon, it will get bigger and bigger. Engaging a bully is a lot like this. If you refuse to feed into the bullying dynamic, you refuse to put air into the balloon. Eventually, the bully will pick on someone else in order to ""inflate her balloon.""

, Girl bullies often travel in groups, working together to pick on other girls to make themselves feel more powerful. It is not usually helpful to confront a group of several girls at once all by yourself.Avoid the situation as much as possible. Try to avoid running into your bullies if possible, and ask a friend to go with you if you have to go somewhere you know the clique will be.Don't react. Remember what your parents told you as a child, about how reacting to a bully is just giving them what they want? It turns out your parents were right. Bullies thrive on power, so if you don't respond by getting angry or crying, you'll drain the experience of fun for the bullies and they will hopefully move on. Try to stay calm and focus on something else if it happens again., If you are feeling targeted by girls at school or women at work, you don't have to suffer in silence. Talking about it can help you figure out strategies to overcome it.


Talk to your parents or other trusted adult. Explain the situation and ask them to help you figure out a solution. Sometimes having a parent intervene is the only way to get it to stop. Your parent might contact the bully's parents, the principal, or help you come up with strategies to use in the moment if it happens again. Parents should familiarize themselves with the school's harassment policy.
Talk to a counselor or therapist to help you separate the criticisms other people might throw at you from your actual value as a human being.
Talk to a teacher, school counselor, or supervisor if you are being bullied or harassed at school or work. That behavior is illegal in a workplace and almost always against the code of conduct in a school or university setting, and should be dealt with at an administrative level to be sure it doesn't keep happening.

, Whether you are in middle school, high school, college, or the workplace, gossip will always be an issue as long as there are other people around to talk.


On the one hand, you have to accept that gossip happens and there's not always something you can do about it. On the other hand, if negative gossip is spreading about you because of your behavior, you can take steps to improve your damaged reputation.

, If someone is spreading rumors that you are sexually promiscuous and it is not true, that is a form of sexual harassment. There are a few different ways you might choose to handle it, depending on who is spreading the rumors and what you feel comfortable with.


Talk to someone in authority to help you deal with the harassment. This might be a parent, teacher, supervisor, boss, or school counselor.
You can try confronting the person responsible for the gossip if you know who started the rumor. If you feel like you need to set the record straight, this can be a good option. However, if the person who started the rumor is a bully who does not care about you, you should know that confronting that person might make you even more of a target.

, If you're happy with your lifestyle, what other people say about you shouldn't have an effect on you. However, if you're doing things that are hurting you or others and it has damaged your reputation, you can take steps to take responsibility for your lifestyle and begin to repair your reputation.


Make sure your emotional needs are being met. Establish and maintain a network of supportive friends who care about you, value you, and support your choices.
Make sure you're not hurting anyone else. If you are having many sexual partners, be sure you're not hooking up with people who are in relationships, and be sure that your partners know what your intentions are. Be sure you use protection if you're having sex.


, If rumors have spread that you are sexually promiscuous, you may find that whether the rumors are true or not, people may begin to treat you differently. In particular, you may find that guys might treat you differently if they think that you are sexually available.


If you find yourself being sexually harassed or propositioned by guys, know that this is not your fault. No one is ever justified in treating another person as a sexual object. Tell the person to stop, and then tell someone you trust (like a parent, teacher, or supervisor). They will help you deal with the situation. If you ever feel unsafe for any reason, call the police or go to the nearest authority figure.
If people who were formerly your friends begin avoiding you, you may consider talking to them to find out why. Keep in mind that someone who would stop being your friend because of a rumor may not have been a true friend to begin with.

, It's true that your sex life is your business, but there's not much you can do to keep people from talking about it. The most you can do is humanize yourself as much as possible so that people won't want to waste their time talking about you.


Many times girls talk about other girls' sexuality because they are jealous or because they worry that sexually experienced girls will steal their boyfriend or husband. By showing everyone that you are a kind and sincere person, you can help to calm their fears.
Going out of your way to be kind to others — including people who have been unkind to you — shows that you are the bigger person. It takes a long time, but consistency, kindness, and sincerity can turn a bad reputation into a good one., The thing about reputations is it takes a long time to build a good one but only one mistake to get a bad one. It's frustrating and unfair, but it's also just a part of life you have to accept. Be determined to build a good reputation, even if it takes years.Find a hobby, club, or pastime to occupy yourself and take your mind off of your social issues. You can choose a volunteer position or give back to your community to help further your reputation as a caring and loving person.
In the meantime, try to learn to stop caring about what other people think of you .

, Your behavior is not at fault if someone else is bullying you, even if the gossip that she is spreading about you is technically true. Other people make their own choices about how to treat you, and no one is ever justified in making you feel worthless or outcast.


Even if you have had more sexual experience than other girls, no one is ever justified in calling you names or trying to hurt you. You do not deserve to be treated that way. You have value!

, It might be small comfort, but the fact is that most bullies are hurting inside. Bullying is a learned behavior, and there are many reasons why people would engage in this behavior. Studies show that bullies often lack close relationships and feel rejected by society. They take out their feelings on others by trying to make everyone else feel rejected, too.Bullies tend to be manipulative, jealous, and lacking empathy for others.Everyone has the basic need for acceptance, belonging, control, and meaning in their lives; unfortunately, bullies often lack all of these. They may bully people who seem unhappy and thus ""easy targets,"" or they may go after people who seem to have the things they lack, like loving relationships, good grades, or successful jobs.
The bully may be trying take the focus off of herself so that she is not a target herself; she may be trying to fit in; she may be bullied at home; or, it could be that the bully lacks a way to regulate her own anger and expresses it in unproductive ways.

, It is not a coincidence that the word ""slut"" is used against girls and women in a derogatory way. In fact, women have been targeted this way for a major portion of recorded history!


At least since the Victorian era, western society has focused on what some scholars call the Madonna-whore distinction. This is the idea that women are all either good, pure, innocent virgins, or sleazy, scummy, and sexually active.Of course, this is a ridiculous way to view humans, who are naturally sexual beings, but it is an idea that took hold in many cultures and still affects how we view and treat women today., While terms that focus on women's sexuality like slut, ho, or whore are often used to degrade women, there's usually a deeper, more sinister meaning that doesn't have much to do with sex.


When someone is called one of these things, it’s a way of saying that they are not a good girl or woman. They don't fit society's mold in some major way. The term is a way of showing complete rejection for that person.
You can fight back against this treatment of women by never using gender-specific insults, not even in jest.

Don't let anyone label you or stop you from doing what you like.If you enjoy sexual relations and if that makes you happy,please go ahead.If anyone who judges you based on what you're doing speaks volumes about them.Not you.

A legally-binding IOU can help you if you ever get audited by the IRS.It's therefore important that you make sure you have formatted the IOU as specified up top, especially if you're lending a significant amount of money.

,
Know the difference between an IOU and a promissory note.,
If in doubt about any aspect of an IOU, talk to a lawyer.",How to Write an IOU2,", IOUs are often difficult to enforce in court, being informal agreements usually agreed upon without the benefit of a witness. Whereas some IOUs only state an amount agreed upon, promissory notes state an agreed-upon amount in addition to the steps necessary to pay back the debt and the consequences if the borrower fails to do so.If you're lending a larger amount than you're comfortable with, take the time to make a promissory note. A promissory note will make it easier than an IOU to recoup any money you lent out in court.
In order to establish a promissory note, you should have it notarized. (Other than that, it takes basically the same form as an IOU.) Notarizing a document just means signing it in the presence of a state-sponsored witness and stamping it with a seal of approval.

, A lawyer will be able to explain all the small legal details associated with an IOU, and should be able to offer suggestions about possible legal recourse you can take if you become unable to recoup the principal.

Understand the downsides of chronic stress.,
Phone a friend.,
Do something you love, often.You may assume that having a pastime only serve to pass time.,
Unwind each night.,
Exercise.Dealing with problems may give you the urge to crawl into bed and sleep for a week.,
Relax on purpose.",How to Deal With Different Problems in Life2," Facing long-term stressors without healthy coping mechanisms can be dangerous to your health and well-being. Stress can either cause health troubles or worsen already existing medical conditions. You need to see a doctor if you suspect this is happening. Here are some of the physical signs that you are stressed:Headaches
Weight gain or loss
Depression
Anxiety
Insomnia
Difficulty breathing
Sleep problems
Changes in appetite

, When you are feeling stressed, engaging your social support system can be a great way to fight it. Your social support network gives you a sense of belonging, increased self-worth, and security.Calling a friend or family member to vent or simply take your mind off life's problems can be a great way to cope.

, In truth, hobbies help us recharge, relieve stress, learn new things, connect with others, and gain a new perspective.A hobby can be anything that you enjoy doing. Try reading, writing, sports, hiking, canoeing, skating, painting, gardening, etc. There are endless possibilities for finding something you like to do and doing it regularly.

, You have probably heard about the importance of getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep (more if you're a teen or child). But, getting good quality and duration sleep relies just as much on how relaxed and calm before you climb into bed. When you are struggling with problems in life, it can be hard to sleep. Try a pre-sleep routine to make it easier to drift off to dreamland.


Do something relaxing like stretching, listening to soothing music, taking a long, hot bath, or getting a massage., You shouldn't. Being physically active can actually make you feel much better about your life. Exercise promotes the release of feel-good neurotransmitters in the brain called endorphins.These chemicals improve your mood and give you that euphoric feeling many refer to as ""runner's high.""

, When life gets you down, you need a few tools to keep handy that help you battle stress and give you peace of mind. Relaxation techniques can be performed virtually anywhere, and at any time.Practice deep breathing by taking a deep breath in through your nose for 4 counts. Hold this breath for a moment, and then release the air for another 4 counts. You should see your lower belly rising with the inhale and deflating with the exhale.
Try progressive muscle by sitting quietly and comfortably in a chair or on a cushion. Move slowly through each muscle group in your body, tensing and releasing the different muscles. Start with your toes. Tense them for 5 seconds and take notice of how this feels. Next, release the tension and simply remain in the relaxed state for about 30 seconds before moving on to a new muscle group.

Strive for more empathy.,
Use ""I"" statements.,
Stop trying to change others.,
Learn when and how to apologize.",How to Deal With Different Problems in Life3," Oftentimes, we experience conflict with others because we do not take out the time to thoroughly understand their perspectives. Developing empathy for all humans can help you do this. There are many ways to build up your empathy. Here are a few suggestions:Aim to listen for understanding rather than responding. You probably spend most of your time listening thinking up what you are going to say next. Take the time to really hear what the other person is saying in your daily interactions. This leaves less room for misunderstandings.
Purposely go out of your way to shatter stereotypes. Do you have an unsupported opinion about a certain individual or group? Make an effort to meet, talk to, and get to know this individual(s) and see if your opinion changes.
Learn more about the world by reading, watching films or documentaries, and visiting museums that educate you about people from different walks of life.

, One of the major roadblocks to healthy communication is using language that causes the listener to get defensive. Forming your words in a manner that allows you to express your feelings while not blaming the other person for them can minimize interpersonal conflict.


An ""I"" statement starts by expressing a feeling, explaining the why behind the feeling, and offering a practical solution. An ""I"" statement might include the following: ""I feel unappreciated when you drop tasks on me at the last minute. It would be great if you could try to give me advanced notice next time.""

, Think about how you feel when someone close to you attempts to change some aspect of your nature. Perhaps your mom wants you to redecorate or your significant other doesn't like the way you dress. That probably feels bad, huh? Now, think about someone who seems to accept you for who you are. That feels so much better, right?


Constantly judging, nagging, or shaming others for their wrongness while emphasizing your rightness doesn't do anyone any good.Remember, ""a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still"". Trying to change others only frustrates you (and them).
Focus on working on your own faults instead of expending so much energy on others., If your words or actions have caused hurt or pain to another, you must make amends in order to prevent the relationship from becoming strained or totally breaking down. Apologizing demonstrates your willingness to admit a mistake and repair the relationship.Apologies express remorse, admit responsibility, make amends, and strive to prevent the same mistake from happening in the future.
An example of an apology could be ""I apologize for not being respectful of your free time. I will do the work myself this time, and next time I will be sure to give you a heads up to check that you are available.""

Start viewing problems as opportunities.,
Channel your strengths.,
Cultivate gratitude.",How to Deal With Different Problems in Life4," Change your language about the problems you encounter in life, and you can drastically change the way you handle them. Every problem opens up the doors to reassess, explore new options, and improve existing methods. Therefore, instead of labeling them as problems, think of them as opportunities to improve., If you felt like you had the ability to effectively handle life's problems, you might not become so overwhelmed by them. Once you identify and start using your strengths, you can gain a higher confidence for handling life's problems.


Grab a sheet of paper and list all of the accomplishments, values, and positive qualities about yourself you can think of. Also, call a close friend or family member who knows you well. Ask this person to help you identify your strengths.
If you have trouble figuring out your strengths, take a free online assessment like the VIA Character Strengths Assessment.After you have identified your strengths, learn to channel them effectively in your life. Review each strengths and figure out ways that you already use this strength in your life. Then, brainstorm additional ways you can use this strength to your advantage., Having gratitude about the good things in your life, or the previous problems that you were able to overcome, can help you cope with the present issues you are facing. To practice gratitude:Start a gratitude journal by writing out a few things that went well during each day.
Say ""thank you"" more.
Write gratitude letters to your family, friends, and acquaintances who have been a help to you in some way.
Transform your language to use these words more ""gifts"", ""fortunate"", ""blessings"", and ""abundance"".

Know the typical signs and symptoms of anxiety.,
Know the typical signs and symptoms of ADHD.,
Recognize the nuances of comorbid disorders.,
See a doctor to rule-out medical conditions.,
Get a referral to a mental health provider for diagnosis.",How to Deal with Comorbid Anxiety and ADHD1," Anxiety disorders most frequently co-occur with ADHD. The most common symptoms of anxiety are a difficulty concentrating, feeling irritable or on edge, feeling restless, insomnia, nervousness, pounding heart, muscle tension, and sudden feelings of panic or doom.Keep in mind that there are a range of potential symptoms associated with anxiety disorder, and each disorder can manifest in a person differently. Anxiety may also range in severity from mild to severe, so for some people it may not be noticeable and for others it may interfere with daily life.
Possible anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social phobia.;
, If you have ADHD, you may notice problems with organization, attention, focus, and impulsiveness. You may have trouble sitting still or sustaining attention to tasks at work or school.These symptoms must have been present before the age of 12 to meet the criteria for ADHD. Also, symptoms must impact your functioning in more than one area of life. For example, you might experience problems at school and at home.

, It is not uncommon to experience the symptoms of both ADHD and anxiety—about 30 to 40 percent of people with ADHD exhibit signs of anxiety.When ADHD and anxiety occur together, the symptoms experienced may differ from when the disorders occur alone.

If you have ADHD, you are more susceptible to anxiety because you tend to be sensitive to different emotions and situations. You might develop anxiety because you fear always forgetting things or missing assignments. As a result, you constantly worry and fret.

, If you have not been previously seen by a mental health provider, your first stop should be your primary care physician. Many health conditions from allergies to brain disorder mimic the symptoms of mental illnesses like ADHD or anxiety. It’s best to be seen by a doctor to get a clean bill of health first.It can help to keep a log of your symptoms to help your doctor better understand what you are experiencing. Your doctor will probably conduct a thorough interview to assess your symptoms, medical history and family history. They may also run tests to rule-out any medical problems because anxiety can stem from many different physical conditions.

, Comorbid conditions complicate the treatment process. Therefore, you should be seeing an expert to effectively identify these disorders and treat them accordingly. If your doctor doesn’t find any signs of medical illness, ask them for a referral to a local psychiatrist or psychologist.These are doctors with advanced training in mental health conditions. These doctors will usually have more comprehensive experience dealing with comorbid disorders, which means they can adequately diagnose and treat them.

Get your child psychological help if needed.",How to Help Your Child Cope With a Bully," If your child is being physically bullied, then he may display unexplained injuries. If you notice any of these signs, it could be an indication that your child is being bullied.Cuts, bruises, or scrapes that your child won't explain.
Torn or beat up clothing.
Broken or missing toys, electronics, or possessions.
Coming home from school hungry. Some bullies will take money or food from their victims and your child may not be eating lunch.;
, Not all bullying involves physical violence. Verbal taunts can be just as damaging as physical attacks. Watch for any unexplained or sudden changes in your child's behavior.A sudden withdrawal from friends or activities. This will often center on activities where the bully is present. For example, if your child suddenly doesn't want to go to baseball practice, there could be a bully on the team.
Sudden mood swings or aggression.
Sudden decline in grades at school.
Difficulty sleeping.
Nightmares or night terrors.

, If you notice any strange marks or behavior in your child, then it might just be as simple as asking if someone is bothering him at school. Some children may be embarrassed or not want to talk about it, but a direct question might give them the push they need to open up.Ask specific questions based on what you've observed. For example, state ""I've noticed you're coming home from school hungry lately. Is someone taking your food?"" or ""I see that your jacket is ripped. Did someone do that to you?""
It's likely that your child won't open up right away when you ask. In that case, make sure to leave the lines of communication open and tell your child that you're always around to talk.
Ask your child indirect questions if he won't answer direct questions. You could witness a bullying scene on TV and ask how he feels about that., Children are usually more likely to discuss problems with their friends than their parents. If you know your child's classmates, you can try to ask one of them if something is going on at school.Generally you should only take this step if you've witnessed other signs of bullying. Questioning classmates should only be used to confirm your suspicions.

, Adults involved in your child's life away from home may have observed problems he has had with other children. If you've noticed any physical or emotional signs of bullying, you can arrange a meeting with one of these adults. Ask if anyone has been bothering your child or if your child has complained about anyone., You should never belittle or criticize your child if he tells you about being bullied. It takes a lot of courage for children to confess this to their parents. If you react negatively, you could force your child further into isolation and endanger his or her emotional state.Instead, listen calmly to what your child is telling you. Say that you believe him and that you're glad he told you.
Children who are bullied often feel alone and isolated, so it's very important to let your child know you're always there to help.

, Bullies get satisfaction from seeing their victims react to their taunting. If your child starts ignoring the bully and walking away when the taunting starts, the bully can lose interest. , Sometimes your child will be in a situation when he can't walk away, like in class or on the field. In this case, you child has to ignore the taunts and teasing to disarm the bully. Acknowledge to your child that this is very difficult to do. It is definitely easier said than done, and your child might resist this idea when you bring it up.
It would help if you did some exercises with your child to help control emotions. Tell your child to close his eyes and count to ten when feeling angry or sad. Deep breathing exercises can also help control emotional responses. , If a bully refuses to leave your child alone, you can encourage him to stand up to the bully. Bully's like to pick on weak targets, and will often back down when someone stands up against them. Tell your child to say firmly, ""Leave me alone!"" the next time the bully bothers him.
Never advise your child to physically attack the bully. This won't help the situation.

, Bullies are usually more likely to go after victims when they are alone. Your child can avoid this by sticking with a friend or classmate whenever he goes somewhere the bully might be., If these methods don't work, your child needs to seek help from another adult. A teacher, principal, or coach might not even be aware that there is a problem, so your child has to report it. These people can take steps to prevent the bullying., After your child initially tells you about the bullying, it will probably be easier to talk about it in the future. You must, however, make sure you keep checking in with your child regularly. Ask how these methods are working and if the situation is getting any better. If nothing is working, you might have to step in and take more active measures.

, In many ways, the symptoms of cyberbullying are the same as other typical signs of bullying: decreased performance in school, mood swings, loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbance, and others previously mentioned. With cyberbullying, however, your child's anxiety may center on the computer or other technology.You child may suddenly not want to use the computer and express fear about the idea of being on the computer. He may look nervous or anxious when using it.
Your child might close or block the computer screen when someone comes near because he may be embarrassed about the bullying.
Remember that your child can access the internet from a mobile device too, so pay attention to changes in using these devices too. He may decrease usage, use password protection when he didn't before, try to hide the device, or express anger when someone touches the device.

, When you notice signs of cyberbullying, you should not waste time. Ask your child right away if he is having trouble with someone online. That way, you can take action as soon as possible before the bullying causes serious problems for your child., Like with ignoring a bully in real life, ignoring the messages is the first step to stopping the bullying online. When the bully stops getting a response from a victim, he will often lose interest. Hopefully this will be enough to stop the bullying, but be prepared to take further measures if the harassment doesn't stop.Social media sites and email servers often have an option to block certain people. Use this feature if your child won't stop reading or responding to the harassing messages.

, Cyberbullying presents a unique opportunity to present concrete evidence of bullying. It can be difficult or impossible to prove if a bully said something to your child, but texts, emails, and messages are all in writing. If you end up needing to contact the school or law enforcement, having evidence will help your case. Save any conversations or messages your child receives to document the bullying., Schools used to be powerless to stop cyberbullying if it occurred off of school grounds. In several states, however, the laws have caught up with the technology and schools have included cyberbullying in their bullying prevention measures.When you contact the school, remember to have the evidence you've gathered close at hand.

, In many states, making threats of physical violence, even online, are against the law. Contact your local law enforcement office if the bully has threatened your child to see if the police can help you.Again, have any evidence you've collected ready to show the police.

, Unfortunately, it's possible that even with all of your help, your child will still be bullied. In this case you should step in. Set up a meeting with someone at your child's school and report the problem. If you know who is bothering your child, tell the school representative. You want to make sure that the school knows who is causing the trouble so it can respond accordingly., If you know the bully's parents, you might have to talk to them if the bullying continues. They might be unaware that their child has been bothering yours, or they might not care and say that you're making too big a deal of it. Whatever the case, it might help for your to get in touch with the bully's parents.Don't act accusatory towards the bully's parents. Their first instinct will probably be to protect their child. Instead, say something like ""I notice my child has been having some problems with yours lately, and I'd like to talk about it,"" instead of ""Your child is a bully!""
Be prepared to talk to them again. It's possible that the bullying won't stop after this meeting, so be prepared to have another talk with them if you have to.
If you don't know the bully's parents, it's better to go to the school. Your child's teachers and/or principal can then approach the bully's parents if they think it's necessary., All kinds of bullying put a lot of emotional stress on your child. Prolonged bullying can lead to depression, anxiety, violent outbursts, and suicide. You can prevent this by taking your child seriously and getting him or her help when it's needed. Contact a mental health professional if the bullying continues or you notice any signs of emotional distress in your child."

Think about what you do well.,
Decide how much time you can work.,
Set your price.,
Find people to hire you.,
Make a work schedule.,
Keep at it.,
Try doing a little extra to see if you can make more money.",How to Make Money when You Are Too Young to Get a Job1," What can you do that someone will pay you to do. Can you do yardwork? Walk dogs? Babysit? Make and sell things? Recycle paper and metal items? Computer stuff? There are many things that you can offer others, if you think hard about it. Make a list, writing down ALL possibilities.


There are some things that will be more profitable than others, and some just won't be possible. Scratch out anything that involves materials that you don't have, or can't happen where you live.
Below, you'll find specific sections about babysitting, doing yard work and housework, washing cars, and finding other creative ways to make a buck as a kid.;
, You still need to save enough time for your schoolwork and hanging out with your friends, and doing other fun kid stuff. And if you play sports, or do other activities, it can be really difficult. Kids are actually pretty busy, so it can be hard to devote more time to making money than you've got on the weekends.


Figure out how much time you can afford to spend making money and set a strict time-schedule for yourself. Can you work as many as five hours on Saturday? More?
Make sure to clear you plan with your parents, always. They may have other responsibilities for you that you need to keep in mind as well.
Do the math, if you're trying to save up for something. If you can get $7.00 per hour, it will take about 40 hours over the next month to get $300.00. That means 10 hours/week.

, How much will you charge people for your service? Depending on what you're doing and who you're working for, any number of different prices might be appropriate. Negotiate with people, but have a specific number in mind.


You can set a flat rate (""I'll mow your lawn and rake your leaves for $25"") or you can set an hourly rate (""I'll mow your lawn and rake your leaves for $6 an hour.""). If your job will take a long time to finish, consider an hourly rate. If you can do it fast, but it'll be tough, go for a flat rate.
Find the minimum wage in your town, and make it slightly less than that. Some people have old ideas about how much to spend on something like this, so it's good to have an update figure.
Make it seem like you're a bargain. Find out how much a pro service would charge for doing what you're going to do. Low prices will get more people to hire you. If you're trying to save up, you may want to make it quickly, but you probably can't go charging people a $100 an hour to do yard work.

, Post flyers, ask family members for business, and ask the people you babysit for to recommend you to their friends. Let lots of people know about your babysitting services. Make sure your potential customers know who you are, what you offer, and how to contact you.


If you live in a neighborhood, knock on doors. Introduce yourself and talk up your new business. People love the idea of hiring a neighborhood kid, usually.
Find a place where your customers are likely to be. If you want to mow lawns, hang up a flyer in the local
Don't tell anyone why you need money. Instead, tell them how you will make their life easier or better by hiring you. For example, you are not offering to rake leaves. You're selling less work for them and a beautiful yard.

, Plan your time and work the number of hours you say you'll work. If you want to babysit, try to find someone to babysit for each Friday evening, if that's the day you pick. Do it as often as possible if you want to make money.


Put in the work. If you finish up early one day, spend the rest of the time you had for work knocking on doors or posting flyers. Don't close up the store just because nobody's shopping.
Work quickly. If you want to mow lawns, you may think it would be smarter to spend a bunch of time mowing one and charge more, but that's not appealing to customers

, Do a good job the first time, and make your gig a regular thing. Ask if you can come back next week, same time, same price. It's a lot easier to come back to a happy customer instead of finding new ones.


If the customer is happy, then ask them to recommend you to other people. Also ask if they would arrange a meeting for you.

, If you see another job that you can do, ask if they would be willing to hire you to do it. Take out the trash and clean up the house while you're babysitting, then offer to clean separately, or for more money. Take care of the shrubs when you're mowing the lawn, or offer to. Ask if they've got any other odd jobs around the house that you could do.


If you could do a variety of chores at one house, that's worth it. You don't have to lug your stuff all around the neighborhood all day. Just go one place to work.

Ask your mental health provider about treatment options.,
Consider medications.,
Look into natural remedies for ADHD.,
Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy.,
Join a support group.",How to Deal with Comorbid Anxiety and ADHD2," A psychiatrist or psychologist will likely interview you and have you complete an array of questionnaires or assessments. These allow them to get a clearer picture of your symptoms. If it is determined that you are experiencing the symptoms of comorbid anxiety and ADHD, you will need to decide on the best course of treatment.

How your mental health provider chooses to treat your comorbid conditions typically depends on the severity of the disorders and which occurred first. They might try to treat the ADHD first if it contributed to the development of anxiety, or they might treat both conditions simultaneously.Your mental health provider may also ask about the events leading up to your anxiety to provide tailored treatment for your condition.

, In general, medication is one of the best courses of treatment for both children and adults with ADHD. Stimulants are the first line of pharmacological treatment for ADHD, but some stimulants may exacerbate anxiety symptoms for a short time. Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is also used to treat co-occurring ADHD and anxiety.Side effects for stimulant medications may include sleep disruption, appetite changes, irritability, and involuntary tics.
Side effects of non-stimulants like Atomoxetine include sleep disruption, constipation, nausea, headaches, decreased sexual desire, and fatigue.

Over the course of therapy, you may learn to identify unhelpful thought patterns and learn techniques to change them.

, Psychoeducation is a beneficial aspect of treatment for any mental illness. Helping you and your loved ones understand the nuances of both disorders helps you better recognize and cope with symptoms.You can receive psychoeducational information through support groups facilitated by mental health professionals and/or peers.

Find parents in your neighborhood.,
Take a CPR class.,
Bring some creative ideas for entertaining the kid.,
Listen to the parents' instructions.,
Be patient.,
Be firm.,
Call for backup if you need help.",How to Make Money when You Are Too Young to Get a Job2," Babysitting is fun, pretty easy, and parents are always looking for a sitter to free up some spare time. Talk to your parents about talking to their friends, or neighbors in the area who might need a sitter. Think of parents in your neighborhood with kids and talk to them yourself.


Stick close to your house. When you're first starting out, make sure to pick a house that's close to your's, so your parents can help out if necessary. If there's an emergency, you'll be close to home.
If you live in an apartment complex, this could be a really great way of making money. Offer to watch kids and have them dropped off at your own house, so your parents can help out if necessary.

, Babysitters need to be trustworthy, especially if you don't know the people you'll be babysitting for well. One excellent way to get the skills necessary for babysitting is to take a short CPR class and become CPR-certified. Usually, these only last about a day, or several hours, and you can do it on the weekend.Generally, babysitters need to be around 12-13, at least. You need to be enough older than the kids you're babysitting so that they'll respect you, and so that you're capable enough to take care of them on your own.

, One of the best parts of babysitting is that you get to hang out with little kids and play for a couple hours. And get paid for it! To be a good babysitter, bring a lot of fun ideas about how to spend your time with the kiddos, and you'll be in-demand. Bring along some:


Games
Books
Art projects
Old toys
Outside toys or sports stuff
Dress up supplies

, Babysitting isn't all games and fun. Depending on how old the kid is and how long you'll be watching them, you may need to feed, bathe, clothe, put down, and even change the diapers of a kid. Listen closely and write down everything you'll need to do to, so you'll have a cheat sheet when they're gone.


If you don't know how to do something, be honest and ask the parents to demonstrate before they leave. Asking lots of questions helps to demonstrate that you're a good listener and serious worker.

, Little kids can be a handful. It might be fun to hang out and play for 30 minutes, but at hour 3 of the same game? Yikes. Babysitters need to be very patient and calm with the kids they babysit, to keep things under control as much as possible.


Remember: You're not there to have fun. If they paid you to have fun, everyone would do it. It's called work for a reason. Don't let yourself get grumpy because the kid wants to watch Finding Nemo twice in a row.

, Babysitters need to have authority and be in charge of the situation. When it's time for the kid to go to sleep, don't let yourself get pushed around. Be as firm as possible and expect the kid to push you. Speak calmly and firmly and be the adult in the room at all times. Stay focused on what you're doing.


Lots of kids will disrespect babysitters and say things like, ""You're not my mom"" when you try to get them to do something they don't want to do. Expect that it will be a challenge and prepare what you'll do in advance.
If the kid wants to argue with you, or starts getting hyper, don't get swept up in the drama. Be calm and quiet, and distract the kid with activity.
Sometimes, when kids get excited, a little snack will help them calm down. Most kids won't admit when they're hungry, but provide some cut-up apple slices and they'll pipe right down.

, Babysitting can be a handful. If you get in over your head, make sure you have some backup help ready, if necessary. Have a friend in your neighborhood come over and help while you're watching the kid, or call your parents if there's something you feel unable to handle.


In an emergency, always call the parents and call 911 if something serious is going on. Don't be afraid to act in an emergency. That's the sign of a good sitter.

, After a long winter, gutters tend to get clogged up and need a good cleaning. Mostly, this just involves removing the gunky leaves and twigs from the gutters and disposing of them in bags.


Even if you live in a place with really great weather, gutters need to be cleaned out regularly to avoid sticks, leaves, and other debris getting caught up in them.
Since this involves getting up on a ladder, or on the roof, it's maybe the most dangerous of all these jobs. You might want to double-check with your parents.

, In rural areas, lots of farmers and fruit growers will hire younger kids to help harvest the fruit during the ripe season. If you live somewhere with a lot of agriculture, keep an eye out at local feed stores, and rural outfitters for signs that local farmers are hiring hands.

Picking fruit, like peaches, apples, cherries, and berries
Pruning grapevine
Helping process wheat, or other grains
Digging potatoes
Detassling corn
Gathering chicken eggs

Clean up the kitchen and do the dishes.
Take out the garbage.
Tidy the living rooms.
Tidy up the bathroom.
Tackle the garage and attic.
Keep your room extremely clean.

, If you're good with your computer, you can market those skills to people who don't understand tech as well as you do.


You can help people set up email accounts, Facebook pages, and other social networking. Help people load pictures and edit them. Help with printing and copying.
Find older people who need help figuring out their technology. Start with your grandparents, and see if they'll talk to their friends, or other acquaintances about hiring you to help with computer-related stuff.

, If you want money and you're a kid, some parents are willing to give it. Talk to them about what specific jobs you can do around the house, or specific things you can do at school to help you make money. If you can get money for good grades, then try harder at school. If you can get paid to take care of your pets, or do yard work, or some other task, then do it.

Studies show that a big crowd of school-going children, approximately around 25 to 35 percent, usually have a role in the incidents, either directly or indirectly, as either bullies or victims.;
, It can even start from kindergarten and increase as the child moves to further classes, like early school in 1st grade or stepping into higher school. Soft and shy kids who are tend to be comparatively physically less strong, often become an easy target for bullies, as such kids are very less likely to oppose or retaliate. Plus, such a kind of kids usually doesn't have much confidence and social skills, so conditions become pretty easier and more supportive for gym-goer annoyers with a muscular body.

, Understanding the probable symptoms of bullying doesn’t require much.


If you are seeing a sudden change in behavior, social activities and performance of your child, he can be a victim of bullying. The kid may suffer emotionally and physically. It can bring a straight loss of self-belief and confidence.
Despite paying attention to the teachers and subjects, the kids usually start putting unknown blames on themselves. Consequently, a huge drop in their grades is more likely to occur. If bullying continues, they may be afraid to go to school. This low self-esteem and depression problem can lead the victim to a tragic personal and troublesome professional life too.
On the other hand, bullies can also receive severe impacts on their lives, such as failure in establishing positive relationships, unsuccessful personal and professional life and a natural lure to tobacco, alcohol and criminal activities.

Denying almost everything
Repeatedly crying for no reason
Trying to hide something

If there is still any problem or the teacher isn’t seeing any improvement, and your kid is getting afraid to go to school, you can take assistance of the school counselor or a professional psychologist.

Manage your body.,
Practice a strong voice.There is nothing wrong with your regular voice and your voice is not the cause of teasing.,
Learn self defense.,
Love yourself.",How to Get a Boy to Stop Teasing You1," Unwanted teasing isn’t your fault no matter who you are. No one deserves to be teased or made to feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, many people are teased because of non-verbal cues they give off to other people. Your physical body and the way you carry yourself say a lot about your self-confidence.Boys tend to tease others who show weakness. Use your body to give off a confident vibe so boys are less likely to mess with you.Look relaxed. Take deep breaths and keep calm. Sit or stand up straight, but keep your muscles relaxed. Be intentional when you look around. Avoid signs of insecurity like glancing quickly around the room, fidgeting, and lowering your head.;
, The more confident you sound when you speak, however, the less likely you are to be questioned. Stand in front of the mirror or sit with a trusted friend and practice. Speak loudly, firmly, and make eye contact. Use a neutral tone that conveys that you truly believe what you are saying.


Try having a simple conversation using your strong voice. Remember that you are developing general self-confidence so that you are ready to respond if you are teased.
Alternatively, practice saying specific comebacks like, “You’re not funny.”

, Boosting your self-confidence is just of the many benefits of learning self-defense. Sometimes just knowing that you can physically defend yourself from a boy is enough to make his mean words seem worthless.Seemingly harmless teasing can sometimes escalate to physical altercations. Poking, hair-pulling, inappropriate touching, or physical fighting may start with light teasing from a boy. Do not get physical with anyone who teases you. Instead, know that you have to tools to fend someone off if anything should happen.

, Build your own self-esteem by focusing on the positive things you have to offer to the world. Encourage yourself by making a note of the things you do well each day. Be nice to yourself and avoid putting yourself down.


Negative thoughts are something to accept as a normal part of life. Manage your negative or critical thoughts by noticing when they come up. For example, you might feel down about a bad soccer game and think, “I really suck at this.” Notice the thought and adjust it to something like, “I made some mistakes, but I know I can get it right if I practice.”"

Don’t get upset.,
Tell him to stop.,
Use a good comeback.,
Laugh.,
Walk away.",How to Get a Boy to Stop Teasing You2," Boys often tease others simply to get a rise out of them. The teaser knows he has the upper hand when the other person gets upset. If you want him to stop, don’t show signs that he is upsetting you.Boys often tease people when they look different. For example, maybe you just got a new hairstyle and a boy says, “Look, Sheila looks like my grandma!” This can be hurtful, annoying, or embarrassing, especially if you don’t want to look like anybody’s grandmother. Try not to get really angry, sad, or sulky. Maintain a neutral expression and keep your chin up. That way he’ll think he didn’t get to you.
Seek help if you are upset. Constant teasing that truly hurts your feelings can move into bullying territory. If you are feeling threatened by a boy or are always afraid that he is going to torment you, you should seek help. Bullying should not be taken lightly as it can have physical and emotional consequences if left unaddressed., Sometimes you can tell someone that you are not amused, and they will get the message. Look them in the eye and tell them to stop doing whatever is bothering you.


Keep it short and simple. Try saying, “Chris, seriously, stop doing that.”

, Some people have a natural way with words and have the perfect comeback for every situation. If this isn’t you, practice some comebacks with a friend, parent, or in front of the mirror. When he teases you, let him finish what he is saying, look him in the eye, and respond. Remember to use your strong voice and confident body language. Come up with short, neutral comebacks that don’t escalate the situation. Your goal is not to get into a fight, but to get the teasing to stop.


Some examples of short comebacks are, “Get a life,” “Yeah, whatever, Chris,” and “Wow! You discovered I’m different from you.”Add a little laugh or an eyeroll to show that you are done with the conversation.

, Often teasing can take various meanings depending on how the person being teased responds. If you laugh, most people--including the teaser-- will accept the comment as a joke.Laugh it off and move on. Start a conversation or get back to what you were doing.


If you feel the need to say something, try chuckling and saying, “That was so silly,” or “Whatever, Chris.”
Don’t laugh if you are truly hurt by consistent teasing. If a boy is constantly teasing you and making you feel uncomfortable, you should not keep laughing it off. Use a verbal response to let him know that you don’t like what he is doing.

, Sometimes the easiest thing to do is to simply walk away. Keep a calm body and neutral facial expression. Turn around and go find something else to do.

Talk to your friends.,
Talk to an adult at school.,
Talk to your parents or an adult at home.,
Learn from others.",How to Get a Boy to Stop Teasing You3," Your true friends will listen to you if you have concerns about teasing. Your friends might even be able to help you analyze the situation, and, hopefully, stop it from bothering you. You don’t have to let your friends completely change your mind or your feelings. Simply be open to hearing what they have to say.


Friends who are present during the teasing might offer a different perspective about what happened. Maybe the boy was teasing you because he likes something about you. Maybe the boy is insecure about himself so he chose to pick on you.
After the boy leaves, turn to your friend and say, “Hey, what was that about? Do you think he likes me?”

, Talk to a teacher, guidance counselor, or coach if you feel comfortable with them. Immediately tattling so that the boy gets in trouble may not be the best first move. You can, however, get advice from a teacher as you might do with a friend. Adults have a different perspective of student social life and can often offer more seasoned advice.


If the teasing happens regularly, makes you feel physically or emotionally uncomfortable, and generally affects your quality of life, you have a more serious problem. Teasing that targets one person in an effort to truly hurt them is bullying. Tell an adult if you are being bullied as this can escalate into more serious physical or emotional problems.School officials are trained to intervene in bullying situations, so be sure to communicate with them.
Approach a trusted adult. Try saying, “Hi Mr. Taylor, I wanted to ask you about something. Sam makes rude comments about my clothes during class and it’s starting to get to me. I’ve tried telling him to stop but it isn’t working. Is there something you can do?”

, Like an adult at school, your parents might be able to help you cope with teasing. They may offer new perspectives or help you practice comebacks for when you are teased. Ask your parent to help you handle the situation. Do not ask them to intervene. It is not recommended for parents to get involved with peer conflict.Sit down with your parents when you are both free from distraction. Be clear about what you want from the conversation. Maybe you only want them to listen, or maybe you are looking for real advice. Try saying, “Hey grandma, I need your help with something. This boy keeps making fun of my height. What do you think I should say to him?”

, The internet has many resources for people who are being teased. Read other people’s stories about teasing, and see if you can relate to their experience. It helps to know that you are not alone. Some websites, for example, have advice columns where youth send in their stories and get advice from experienced mentors."

Do they get upset, angry, or sad easier than they previously did?;
, Withdrawal from activities they used to enjoy, reluctance to go certain places, and /or isolating themselves, especially without a good reason why they are doing so, are possible indicators of bullying., Teenagers normally have strange sleeping habits – sometimes they seem to do nothing but sleep, and other times it seems they are always awake. Big changes in sleep habits like, sleeping a lot more than usual, not being able to sleep, and having nightmares can all be signs that a teen is being bullied., Some teens develop poor appetite, digestive problems or eating disorders because of bullying.Sometimes boys try to ‘bulk up’ or gain weight in an effort to address being bullied. Girls who are bullied because of their appearance may develop eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia in an attempt to end the bullying and raise their self-esteem.

, Sometimes, when a person is being bullied they will complain of “not feeling well” or having “a stomachache”.Often there is a pattern to this. For example, your teen might always have a headache before school, but never on weekends.


This may be because they are actually having physical symptoms of the stress of being bullied.
It may be that they are trying to avoid going somewhere or doing something that will expose them to the bully.

, Often teens who are bullied begin to show poor performance in school.Their grades may fall, but they also may demonstrate other problems in school like falling asleep in class, talking back, skipping class, etc.

, Bullying takes many forms which often have nothing to do with physically harming someone else. Understanding the different ways in which teenagers can be bullied can help you recognize that it is happening, understand what they are going through, and figure out how to resolve it.Direct bullying happens when the bully does something directly to the victim. For example, if Wanda looks at Sam and says, “Hey, Sam! You’re a loser”. Indirect bullying is when the bullying is more covert.For example, being socially excluded because of false rumors.
Name-calling, verbal threats, gossip, and socially isolating someone are all forms of emotional bullying.Cyberbullying occurs through text, email, blogs, social media, etc. It can take the form of threatening, offensive, or just plain mean posts and messages, as well as posting embarrassing pictures or videos of the victim.
The most recognized form of bullying is physical bullying. For example, kicking, hitting, pinching, pushing, etc. Damaging and destroying the victim’s property are also forms of physical bullying.
Sometimes bullies will use several different tactics to harass the teen. For example, they might have someone else video them slapping the victim and then post it online.

, While some teens may come to you with their problems, there are many that don’t say anything.Regardless of whether they come to you about being bullied or you go to them, let them know that you care about them, are concerned about them, and are there for them.


Find opportunities to indirectly bring the topic up. Teenagers are very perceptive. They will know what you are doing, but bringing it up indirectly gives them a little time while you are talking to work up the courage they need to tell you.
You might try saying, “I’ve noticed some changes in you that have me worried. It reminds of that movie we watched the other day. But, seriously, is someone or something bothering you? Are you being bullied?”

, If they don’t want to talk about it, or deny it, then don’t push it right then. There are many emotions and feelings that can come from being bullied. Sometimes a teen may need time to open up. Let them know that when they are ready to talk about what is going, you will be there. Bring up the topic again another day.


Sometimes teenagers feel embarrassed or guilty about what is happening to them.
Sometimes they're afraid that the bully will do something bad to them if they tell what is happening.

, Calmly listening lets them know you support them without putting any pressure on them. Listening attentively can give you details about the bullying that you may need later to resolve the situation. It can also give you insight into how the teen is feeling about what is going on.

, Let the teen know that they are brave and did the right thing for telling you.Letting them know they did the right thing by talking about it can relieve some of the anxiety they are feeling around the situation in general, as well as around talking about it. Try saying, “I know talking about this isn’t easy and it took a lot of courage. I’m glad that you opened up to me and I’m proud of you.”

, Get as much information about what is going on as you can. The more information you have, the better you can support the teen in ending the bullying. Ask questions like who, what, where, when, and why. Also ask questions about the teen’s emotions, concerns, reactions, etc.

, Often victims of bullying can feel as if they are to blame.They may feel that if they weren’t so overweight, skinny, weird, etc. then they wouldn’t be bullied. Try saying, “What is happening is not your fault. Don’t blame yourself and don’t feel guilty about someone else’s behavior and choices.”

, Being bullied can lower self-esteem, which can actually increase the risk of being bullied more.One of the best things you can do to support your teen is to encourage them and do and say things that boost their self-esteem. For example, tell them, “You are a great person with lots of talents and cool things about you. Don’t let the bullying make you forget that.”


If needed, have the teen speak with a counselor or therapist about self-esteem issues.

, Especially right now, make an effort to let the teen know you are always there for them. Although it may not be daily, taking regular time out to catch up is a great way to support a teenager that is being bullied. It lets them know that you care about them in general and what is happening to them. It can also help relieve some of their stress and tension., Because bullying can include so many different behaviors and actions (and combination of them) there are several different approaches that can and should be taken when addressing bullying. Let your teen know that they may need to tailor your advice to fit their specific circumstances.

, Parents may want to tell their teens to fight back or get physical as a way to handle a bully.Getting physical can escalate the situation quickly and result in someone getting seriously injured or in serious trouble. If your teen is being physically assaulted, they should defend and protect themselves as they try to get away.

, While you don’t want to advise the teen to completely or drastically change their life, avoiding the bully is one of the easiest ways to decrease bullying. Taking a different route, using a different restroom, etc. are ways that your teen can avoid interacting with the bully.

, Bullying is less likely to occur if they are with friends.Additionally, friends can offer moral support and can also serve as a witness to what happened, if needed. Spending time with friends can also help restore your teen’s self-esteem and confidence., Although it can be very difficult, especially if the bully is saying or doing extremely mean things, advise your teen to control their own anger, fear, and frustration and stay calm. Bullies want a reaction to their behavior and staying calm robs them off that.


Advise your teen to practice not reacting or to try having a ‘poker face’.
Remind the teenager to try not to cry, look upset, or even smile or laugh as these behaviors can further anger the bully.In online situations, the teen should avoid responding to mean comments or posts. If possible, delete them.

, Similar to avoiding the bully, telling them to stop then walking away from them is one of the most effective ways to deal with them. Ignoring the bully doesn’t give them the reaction they want and shows them they don’t have control; eventually they may tire of bullying your teen altogether. Advise your teen, that when bully begins to harass them, to tell the bully to stop and then walk away.

, They should do this for several reasons. For one, bullying often gets worse when it is not reported and the bully gets bolder with their actions because they don’t think anything will happen to them.Telling an adult is also documenting what happened in case the information is needed later.
It also relieves some of the tension and stress of the situation by giving the teen another ally.
Even cyber bullying should be reported to an adult. If possible, report it to a site administrator as well.

, Bullying can be an extremely stressful experience and effectively managing this stress can help your teen successfully resolve this situation. Staying healthy can also counterbalance some of the stress of bullying. Advise your teen to eat balanced meals, get enough sleep, exercise, and learn and use stress management techniques such as deep breathing, mindfulness meditation, visualization, etc.

, Remind your teen that although this is a difficult situation, there is still a lot to be grateful for and happy about in life. Keeping a positive attitude can help diminish the impact the bully has on the teenagers self-esteem and confidence.


Suggest that your teen re-engage with things they enjoy.
Encourage your teenager to keep a journal or list of things they are grateful for.
Recommend that your teen socialize with positive people as much as possible.

, Remind your teen that they have to be as determined as the bully. Your teen should keep telling the bully to stop. Keep walking away. Report each and every bullying incident until it stops. Your teen should be as persistent as the bully and not give up., Don’t wait to see if the situation will get better, do something as soon as you know that your teen is being bullied.


Talk to the teen, give them advice and support them.
Make notes about what happened so that when you report it, you can have the specifics on hand.
If needed, get emergency assistance from the appropriate places.

, Let the appropriate people know what is going on. Reporting it not only supports the teenager by creating a team of people addressing the problem, but it also holds people accountable for taking action and resolving the problem.


If you are a parent, report the bullying to your teen’s teacher(s) and principal, coaches, and/or other appropriate people.
If you are a teacher, report the bullying to your principal, the student’s parents, and if appropriate, the guidance counselor and/or other teachers and coaches.
Coaches, camp counselors, mentors, etc. should inform the teen’s parents as well as anyone else appropriate (league officials, camp directors, etc.)
If the bullying is especially vicious, causes physical or sexual harm, you probably need to report it to legal authorities and possibly seek medical attention.

, Often parents try to solve bullying by talking to the bully’s parents. In some cases this can be effective, but it can also cause more problems. Unless you are at least familiar with the parents and their home environment, it is best to allow teachers, coaches, counselors, etc. to contact the bully’s parents.If the bully comes from an abusive home environment, talking directly to the parents could place the bully in harm or escalate the bullying.
If you are certain you want to speak to the parents, then do it in a neutral place with someone that can mediate, such as at school with a principal present.
If you do speak with the bully’s parents, be respectful, calm, and open to problem-solving. This is probably a difficult ordeal for them as well.

, to find out what progress is being made in resolving the situation. Bullying usually does not stop overnight, but if you and your teen stay persistent, you can help your teen overcome it.

Educate yourself about weight and body image.,
Lead by example.,
Be open and approachable.,
Listen to your child.,
Boost their self-esteem.,
Introduce them to friendly peers.",How to Help Kids Recover from Teasing About Their Weight1," Body image is how individuals assume others perceive their bodies. Much of what your child perceives about their body is influenced by societal pressures through media, friends, and loved ones. Those who are not satisfied with their bodies are at higher risk of developing depression, anxiety, eating disorders (95% are within ages 12 to 25 years), low self-esteem, early sexual activity, substance use, and suicidal thoughts., Be the role model and positive influence that your child needs by showing them that you feel good about yourself and your own body. The more they see you be positive about yourself, the more likely it is that they’ll adopt the same pattern of behavior. Lead a healthy lifestyle for both you and your children by eating balanced meals and maintaining daily physical activities such as going on walks in the park.

Avoid saying “Wow, you look great! Did you lose weight?” to anyone when your child around. While this comment may appear to be a complement, it sends the message to your child that people need to look a certain way or be a certain weight to look great.

, During youth and adolescence, children go through many physical changes that may make them uncomfortable. If weight gain is an added concern for you child, youth may feel very emotionally distressing and overwhelming for them. You are your child’s primary source of support, so try to be approachable and available when they need you.

Do not force your child to talk if they aren’t comfortable. Rather, ask your child if they would be comfortable speaking to another adult for advice, such as a teacher, a counselor, another adult relative, or someone else they trust.

, Adults have an inherent trait of wanting to fix everything. Before you can do that, however, you’ll need to hear what the child is trying to say. Simply sit and listen to them tell you how they feel about the teasing. Just getting it off their chest can offer relief and help them feel better about the situation knowing they have you on their side.

Give the child your full attention when they are talking with you. Maintain eye contact and nod while they talk to you. Now is not the time to be on your phone or watch TV while you’re having this important conversation., Having one-on-one time with the child can do wonders for their self-esteem. It makes them feel important and reinforces your love for them. During this time you can continue to tell them how much you love them and how amazing they are.

Allow them to choose an activity. Try not to push anything physical on them, as they may feel like you are pressuring them to do something that helps with their weight., Whether you are a parent, teacher, or coach, you may know the general personalities of the kids you're around. If a kid comes to you feeling down about teasing, you can help them cope by opening them up to new positive friendships.For instance, if you're a teacher and a child tells you about teasing, you might suggest, ""Cora, I know Rachel had a tough time last year with a bullying incident. How about I introduce the two of you? I'm sure she can give you advice and support that I can't relate to.""

Tell them that what is happening is wrong.,
Advise them about how to respond to the bullying.,
Encourage them to spend more time with their friends.",How to Help Kids Recover from Teasing About Their Weight2," Some overweight children believe that being teased simply comes with the territory. They may think that what they are experiencing is normal. It is up to you, however, to let them know it is not and that they don’t deserve it. Teach your child that teasing about appearances is never okay. Define body image for your child and explain how negative influences can affect a person’s perception about body image.

Explain to the them that the bully is probably insecure themselves, so they project their issues onto someone else. Or that they may be unpopular and they think that teasing someone may make them fit in with the “cool” kids.If your child wants to lose weight, make sure that it’s for the right reasons, and not just to conform to a flawed societal perception of what is “beautiful”. Your child should not diet, but instead make a lifestyle change to live a healthy and wholesome life.

, Bullies often don't know how to respond when the intended victim doesn't play by the script. Tell the child to ignore the bully or act like what they say doesn’t bother them. For instance, they shouldn't look embarrassed or scared. Just walk away and find an adult they trust.

Standing up to a bully often stops them, but it can help to give other advice, too. This could include looking the bully in the eye or defending themselves physically, if needed.Tell the child to talk to an adult when the bullying occurs. They can talk to a teacher, guidance counselor, bus driver, or a parent if that is who is near when the tormenting begins. The adult can confront the bullies and stop the behavior., Bullying usually occurs when a child is alone. By spending more time with their friends, they lessen the chances of being singled out and picked on. Having close friends can also help them feel more confident about themselves.

Help the child make friends by enrolling them in different activities if they are having problems making them. Joining a youth group, drama or garden club, or even the Boy or Girl Scouts can put them in touch with potential friends. Enrolling them in martial arts can also give them confidence and help them learn how to defend themselves."

Contact your child’s school.,
Ask for support from your community.,
Keep track of the incidences.,
Tell your family teasing isn’t tolerated.",How to Help Kids Recover from Teasing About Their Weight3," Alert the child’s teacher of the teasing if they are unaware. Talk to the principal as well. Many schools have a zero-tolerance policy about teasing and bullying. Demand that the child’s school enforce the policy, if it has one.

Ask the teacher or principal to be on alert for signs of the teasing. Ask them to speak to the offending child or children so that they will stop. You may even want to request that the child spend as little time around the bullies as possible.Request a mediated meeting with the parent(s) of the children who are teasing or bullying your child, the principal, a counselor, and a teacher or two who are involved. A meeting like this should get everyone on board with an appropriate plan of action.

, Talk to your friends and neighbors about the teasing. Ask them to stop it if they see it. You can also ask them to help you initiate a zero-tolerance for bullying policy with your local school if one doesn’t already exist.

You can ask them to write letters to the school and the Department of Education in your area to request the policy. They can also join you in meetings to talk about the bullying and why a policy should be implemented., Write down the time and the place the bullying occurs. Go into detail about what happened so that you have a record of it when you talk to the principal, counselors, or police, if needed. Keeping this log can be used as evidence., Sometimes it’s the family members who provide the teasing. Parents and grandparents may call the child names that hurt their feelings when they are meant to be cute. Siblings may also use the child’s weight problem as a go-to during arguments. Make it understood that no one is to talk negatively about the child’s weight, and that strict actions will be taken if they can’t abide.

For instance, you may warn family members that they may be cut off from you if they continue to tease the child. You can also enforce punishments like grounding and taking away favorite items to your other children if they are the source of the teasing."

The bully could decide to target you, or could make things worse for your friend.

, As soon as you can, tell an adult whom you trust. This is important whether the bullying happens at school, online, or elsewhere.People you can tell include your parents, teachers, school administrators, or a religious leader.
If the person you tell doesn’t offer help immediately, tell someone else. Bullying should be dealt with as quickly as possible.

, Bullies often target people when they’re alone. Offer to sit with your friend at lunch, walk to the bathroom with them, or wait with them for the bus.If your friend is also being bullied online, don’t engage with the bully on social media. Make sure your friend blocks them. You can, too.

You can calmly tell other bystanders what you told the bully: this behavior isn’t cool. You can say something like, ""We shouldn't be encouraging this. This is bullying.""

, Almost everyone has been teased at some point. Often, we tease siblings or close friends. Teasing can sting a little, but is never meant to truly hurt someone. Bullying is different than that.Bullying is generally characterized by repeated behavior that is intentionally hurtful. It can have long-term consequences for the bully, the victim, and even bystanders.
Bullying can be physical, verbal, emotional, or sexual.
Bullying can happen in person, or online (known as cyber-bullying).
When someone is being bullied, there’s usually a power imbalance between the bully and the victim. The bully may be significantly bigger, older, or more popular than the victim.

, Some victims of bullying are afraid to ask for help. They may feel embarrassed or ashamed. Bullies can even make their victims promise not to tell anyone what happened. Let your friend know that you’d like to help-- even if they haven’t asked. Ask your friend what would feel supportive to them. They may want someone to eat lunch with, or for you to talk to a school official with them.

Get involved in guiding others through the maze of cyber bullying.,
Be patient.",How to Heal After a Cyber Bullying Experience," For children and young teens, the experience can be devastating for the emerging sense of self and morale. For older teens and adults, including seniors (sadly, nobody is spared from cyber bullying), it can cause an enormous dent in confidence, causing the person to shy away from further online interactions or to trust people again. Whether you're young, middle aged or old, your hurt, fear and disturbance is real and deserving of a caring response.;
, One way of making a clear physical distinction between the cyber bullying experience that is now over and the healing process that you're now going through is to make or buy yourself some sort of talisman or trophy that embodies your survival and your determination to thrive from this point forward. Put this physical manifestation of your courage in an obvious place where it will remind you regularly that you have risen above what has happened and that you're only going to get stronger. This talisman can be held or observed when you feel particularly down and disillusioned during your recovery, as a physical prompt to bring you back to the reality that you're a good and worthy person.

, This may seem very hard right now, but if you don't let go of the feelings of anger and hate toward the cyber bully, you let this person continue to hold power over you, directing you in negative ways. Forgiveness can free you from constant thoughts of revenge, hate or anger, which will only consume you completely. Your ultimate victory as a survivor who will go on to thrive is to not let this bully continue to bully your inner thoughts.


Part of forgiveness is undertaking an assessment of what you think might have driven this person to bully. Bullies are, on the whole, cowardly and insecure––bullying is a way of coping with things in their own lives that aren't working well for them. Perhaps this person has been the subject of abuse, has lost a loved one, feels dismissed or doesn't feel that he or she has made a success of life as you have. Maybe this person has a mental illness or lacked sleep and got into a situation from which he or she felt there was no backing down without losing face. Whatever the reason, it's never an excuse but it is a way of helping you to have greater understanding that people are motivated by very personal reasons that often have nothing more to do with you than that you were in the wrong place at the right time and suffered their lashing out. Your compassion can help you to heal much faster.

, Read books about enhancing self-esteem, praise yourself for the good you contribute to the world, and leave yourself positive notes that remind you why you're a good, worthy person.


Many people who have experienced cyber bullying find therapy, counseling or spiritual guidance helpful in working through the experience and building self confidence again. Therapy can be especially helpful with restoring your positive inner voice, the one that often gets swamped by ""stinking thinking"" when a bully constantly berates and harasses you.
Couple your reading with books about dealing with anxiety, trauma and depression. These books, provided they're self-help oriented and have worksheets or exercises to work through, can help you to undo the ""stinking thinking"" that has probably taken over your life.

, Hopefully a fair resolution was reached in your situation that lets you resume the activities you were enjoying online before. If not, or if there are some places where your safety cannot be guaranteed, leave these sites, chat rooms, or forums well alone. It is one thing to stand on principle and say that you shouldn't have to keep away and let the bully continue to ruin your experience. It's another to realize that until you're fully able to dismiss and cope with any future bullying behavior, that you are best helped keeping away from any places where it might occur. With the passage of time, the dynamics of an online place will change and you will also grow stronger through your own courage and reflection, but you must allow yourself this space to heal first.

, This person can serve as your touchstone if you start having worrying feelings or doubts, or if you think that someone might be trying to bullying you again. Be sure that this person can be contacted quickly and is likely to respond to you within a few hours, to help you stay calm. Your emotions will probably be on high alert and it can take a long time for things to turn steady again within you––while you wait for this person to get back to you when you need his or her help, stay offline or somewhere well away from the matter of concern.


You might also like to link with trusted online friends who know what you've been through and who continue to support you. Being in their presence when online can serve as both moral support and as potential protection should shielding you be required.

, This can help you to heal because it can open the pathway to greater understanding, both of yourself and of the motivations of other people. Learning in greater depth about the challenges and issues surrounding cyber bullying might even lead to life-changing decisions, such as a career change or writing a book about your experiences.


By making yourself an expert on the topic, you will feel stronger and more in control when confronted by similar situations in the future. You will also gain the wherewithal to help defend others appropriately.
Read stories about bullying survivors (whether or not it is cyber bullying) to learn how they coped; you may be able to draw inspiration from such experiences. Ask your librarian or book store for help finding such books, and search online for articles written by such people.

, When you feel constantly threatened, you are on constant high alert, meaning that it becomes very hard to relax and second nature to remain totally wound up. Instead of staying tightly wound like a spring about to go off, find something that will help you unwind in a peaceful and caring way. Suggestions include yoga; meditation; deep breathing; visualization; color therapy; a night class on a topic you really, really love; swimming; aromatherapy; massage (either having them or learning how to give them); learning a musical instrument; painting; writing; lying under a favorite tree, etc. Anything that takes you into a relaxed place is deserving of your attention.

, By spreading awareness and offering your own experience to others, they too can learn more about the impacts of cyber bullying. Many people aren't aware they're being bullied until they're so unhappy and terrified that they don't know which way to turn. You can help by calling out potentially bullying situations, either openly or privately, depending on the context.


Join forces with others on your favorite site to support your anti cyber bullying stance. Share stories and support amongst each other.
It's recommended that you don't get into a role of helping others until you feel healed enough. Before you have healed, any small incident can tip you back into the emotional pain of the original experience. You must feel strong enough first.

, It can take months and even years to overcome the pain of an especially vile cyber bullying experience. During that time, you will likely continue to experience some real lows amid the steadily increasing confidence you're regaining and you may not trust people as you did once. By acknowledging your feelings as normal and accepting that you need more time, you allow yourself the slow road to permanent healing and you'll do it your way. Provided you keep trying and keep respecting yourself as the wonderful person you really are (and you are), you will heal in time, in a way that sustains you for the remainder of your life.

Also, usually the people who do are either a bunch of little kids who doesn't have anything else to do but to be rude towards people online, or a bunch of immature adults who never quite grew up and need to fill an empty void in their hearts by beating people up online without having anything fighting back at them.;

, Don't live in the shell of silence. The worst thing you can do is to suffer alone and without support. Speak to your parents or guardians, to a trusted friend, to a counselor, a teacher, or anyone who is trustworthy.

, Sometimes the best course of option is to just simply ignore them. Because all they will most likely do is to intimidate you and make you feel fear or bad about yourself for absolutely no reason whatsoever. That's usually the result that they were trying to make you feel.

, Your bully wants you to think this is more real than it is. Stop engaging with this particular person. Don't worry about seeming like a wuss -

, This is pretty easy to do online, so make a special folder or mail file to keep evidence of the bullying. Show this to the person who is helping you overcome the bullying. If you receive unwanted images or requests for such images, tell the person you trust. It may have to be taken to the authorities if it is really bad.


Some instant-messaging programs, such as Skype or Telegram Messenger, allow the sender of a message to delete any messages they've sent. However, most programs store the messages you've received in the logs of the program; you may just have to dig a bit in order to get to them.

, This will help you to regain your perspective and to distance yourself from the bullying. Sometimes it is easy to get so caught up with a site, forum, chat room etc., that you stop realizing that it should be put in its place. Go out and play ball, take a walk in the park, rediscover the joys of real life.

, On most websites, you have the option to block users. It's a simple solution to make them leave you alone. Online games have a similar option, often called ""Ignore"", which keeps the user's messages from being visible to you. Use it!


If you can't block the user, see if you can make your account private or only accessible to people on a ""buddy list"". Many websites have features that allow you to toggle your profile's privacy settings.

, In some cases, you have the option of reporting the person who's cyberbullying. If someone was bullying you online, if they were threatening you or someone that you know, or maybe they said they will do something that could destroy your life or anything of the sort, you might be able to report the entire thing to the local authorities and allow them to track down who it is.


Reporting the user is also a good idea if they've been creating multiple accounts to get around profile blocks and harass you, as this is against the policies of many websites.

, Cyberbullies thrive on your reactions and their main hope is to get a rise out of you. That's what they feed on; picking on you. They love nothing more than to start drama with people because that is their only source of entertainment. Don't give them a reaction to feed off of. If they see that you react strongly, they won't stop picking on you. If you must respond to them, simply tell them ""Leave me alone"", and then don't respond to them after that. They won't get any fun out of picking on someone who doesn't react.

Disregard the teasing.,
Walk away from the bully.,
Find an outlet.",How to Handle Being Made Fun Of1," Unless it becomes a routine problem, if someone makes fun of you the best way to handle the situation is by ignoring the teasing altogether. By ignoring the bully you are denying them the attention that they are seeking by making fun of you. They are likely to get bored and leave you alone.When someone starts to tease you, don’t give them the attention that they are seeking. Continue to do what you were doing and act like you didn’t hear them.;
, If ignoring the bully does not work, consider walking away from the situation. While this still denies the bully the attention that they were seeking, it also sends a clear signal that you will not tolerate being teased. This will also prevent you from having to hear what the bully has to say.If someone starts to pick on you while you are at your locker at school, grab the books that you need and go to class.
When a co-worker is making fun of you in the office, find something else to do. Go to a different room to work, grab a cup of coffee, or take a trip to the restroom. The bully will likely be back to work by the time you return.

, If persistent teasing is getting you down consider finding an emotional outlet. Exercise can help you release built up anger and stress. It can also be a great confidence booster.Take up boxing or kung fu to release some built up aggression.
Yoga or distance running are great outlets to manage stress and clear your head.

Call a teasing help-line or find a support group.",How to Handle Teasing," Some teasing isn't as bad-natured as it may seem. Actually, people who tease other people tend to think it's less harmful than it feels.If the person teasing you is a friend or someone you know doesn't want to actually hurt you, try to laugh it off. Sometimes, teasing is even a way of showing affection.It isn't always meant to be taken too seriously, so roll with the punches. You can come up with a funny response, or try saying things like:


""That was a good one!""
Very funny. Ha ha.""
""Nice try.""
""You'll have to try harder than that."";
, One strategy to handle being teased is to brainstorm your options. This can be anything from planning your routes to coming up with a plan if you get cornered by someone who teases you. Make a list of two or three things you could do to handle the teasing better.Here are some examples:


Stay within sight of adults at school.
Stay out of unsupervised places where a lot of teasing happens, such as the locker room or bus stop.Prepare some quick responses you can throw out to the teaser to get him off your back.
Practice not responding to the teaser. Learn to control your anger so that you don't give him any ammunition.

, Standing up for yourself is a good way to get people to stop teasing you.If you assert yourself and give consequences for teasing, many teasers will back off. It's much easier to tease a target who doesn't defend himself than it is one who decides to stand his ground. This may not work in all situations, but asserting yourself is a good first step to deal with someone who is teasing you.


For example, you can say ""You can't tease me like that. Leave me alone, or I'll do whatever it takes to defend myself.""

, Taking classes in kickboxing or jiujitsu are good ways to learn how to defend yourself. You shouldn't pick fights, and they will teach you in these classes to only use violence as a last resort, but even training in a martial art will make you more confident.It will also cause your teaser to second-guess messing with you.

, If not, ask what you could do to change that. Would a hair-cut make you feel more confident? New clothes? Standing up straighter?


You can also work on things like practicing your ""strong voice."" You don't need to yell, just practice putting a lot of power behind what you say. You've probably heard people use this firm tone before, such as parents or teachers. Try to speak from your stomach rather than your throat.

, Sometimes the easiest way to handle being teased is to get away from the person teasing you. Since teasing is usually not as physical or mean as bullying, it shouldn't be too hard to walk away.Here are some things you can say to the teasing person while you leave:


""I don't have time for this. I've got better things to do.""
""I don't have to put up with this.""
""Find someone else to tease.""

, Another strategy is to avoid the teaser in the first place. Learn his schedule of classes or how routine in order to figure out what you should do to avoid crossing his path. For example, he may sit at a certain table at lunch, or he might take a particular route home. Find out where he goes and plan different routes. You can enlist help from friends who may have seen him around.

, Ignoring someone who teases you can take the ball out of his court. If you come across your teaser, look straight ahead and pretend not to hear anything he says. If you have an mp3 player and earbuds, listen to music so that you don't have to hear him. Avoid seeming frightened and never looking in his direction, which can make you seem like an easy target, but don't give him the time of day either., Pretend he's talking to someone else. If he's not your friend then he doesn't really know you, anyway, so he might as well be. Practice putting a protective shield around yourself by realizing that his words don't have to affect you. They're just words and he's not an important person in your life.


It can help to understand why people who tease other people do what they do. If the teaser is more of a bully, he has probably had a difficult life. He may attribute hostility to the people around him and have a lot of paranoia. Understanding that he is a hurt, fragile human being can help you put the behavior into context., You may be able to distract and redirect your teaser by changing the topic of discussion. Think of this as a magic trick to fool people who try to tease you. If you don't give the person teasing you anything to work with, he won't be able to keep going. In a way he needs your involvement in order to tease you. Here are some techniques you can use:


Pretend like you didn't hear the teasing comment and continue on with whatever you were saying before.
Forcibly change the topic. If someone is teasing you, act like you don't care and start talking about something else, such as homework or what you're going to do when you get home. This will take the steam out of his sails.

, Having a friend with you is a strong deterrent for people who tease and bully others. It's a lot harder to deal with two people than one person. If you're worried about being teased on the way home from school or in-between classes, plan it out so that you'll be with a friend at these times.Say to your friend, ""Hey, will you walk with me to class so won't mess with me?""

, If the teasing is bad, enlist help from a teacher or principal at your school. It's their job to protect you. You don't need to feel like you're ""telling"" on the teaser; he's the one at fault and all you're doing is taking care of yourself -- and others, most likely, since he probably teases multiple people. There are things that teachers and principals can do to stop the teasing and make you feel safe. Don't be afraid to involve them.You can tell her, ""This guy is teasing me and I need help. Can I talk to you about it?""

, If your teacher isn't doing anything about the teasing, or if it's out of her control, talk to your parents. They can talk to someone higher up in the school's administration and get the situation fixed. It may not seem ""cool"" to ask your parents for help, but it will be worth it in the long run. Harsh teasing can disrupt your academic achievement and your self-esteem.Try telling your parents, ""This guy at school is teasing me. Is there anything you can do to stop it from happening? Can you talk to the school?""

, Some school counselors are actually trained in dealing with teasing and bullying.Going to a school counselor is a great option if you're having a hard time handling the effects of being bullied. They can help you cope with the teasing, and what you say to them is confidential. The meeting will be private and the person or people who tease you will never know.Tell your teacher that you want to see the school counselor. She can help you find the right person to talk to.

, If you need someone to talk to or want additional support, try a help-line or support group for teasing/bullying. Talking to people who are going through similar difficulties can help you feel understood. You can also discuss strategies together for dealing with being teased.

Know the characteristics of those who bully: There are certain behavioral excess and deficits among those who bully.,
Be assertive once you spot them.,
Hold them accountable for their behavior.,
Help the bully change for the better.",How to Help Anti Bullying," It is important that adults discuss the topic of bullying with the children in their care. Have a clear understanding of what bullying is and what it does to them and others. Discuss the different ways that bullying can happen -- has your child seen it? Been a part of it? What are their thoughts?


Encourage communication. Allow the children to feel free in asking questions and making comments about bullying. Let them know and be comfortable with the thought that you are available for open discussion on the topic.;
, Teach your child how to be empathetic to the feelings of others. They need to understand the difference between what can be considered funny and what is actually thoughtless, tactless and cruel. They can only learn this from the adults in their lives, most often from the example that is set for them as they watch adults deal with each other.


For example, it is mean and cruel to snicker about another adult behind their back while pretending to be their friend to their faces. So many adults do this, not realizing their child is watching them from the wings, ready to emulate them later.
Teach your child that it's best to take a stand rather than just to stand and watch when they witness bullying. It's always best, regardless of who is being bullied or doing the bullying.

, Work with neighbours and friends in the community to create a safe environment that is inclusive of everyone. Join the Bully Prevention Training and help to spread the message of helping anti-bullying.Volunteer to host a talk or assembly to get momentum going. Who could possibly be opposed?


Take your campaign to the schools and children's centers to put this topic in the public eye and pressure on the organizations to make sure bullying is wiped out. It's only when people like you raise a fuss that something will happen!
The link between school and the home environment is necessary for several reasons. Firstly, the bullying behaviors need to be managed appropriately at both places. Secondly, it helps the parents first recognize bullying and then learn how to deal with these behaviors. Lastly, assertiveness at home and implementation of strict conduct at both places leads to much faster results.

, Teachers can devise programs which can prove useful for helping anti-bullying. These may include the following ideas:


Giving insight about bullying, clearly giving the awareness that it is intolerable behavior and how should the victims behave if they encounter any such situation
Helping the students learn about conflict-resolution without involving aggression. You can use different conflict arising scenes and then help the students generate the answers.
Building empathy among the students for each other. Help the children understand each other. This can be done using appropriate words like “I know what you have been through,"" “yes, it really hurts” etc. adding different scenarios and helping the children enact them, focusing on emphatic listening and appropriate words.

, Each person to help anti-bullying helps at least one less child to be bullied. If you're out there preaching for others to get involved, make sure you're practicing, too! If you ever run into bullying -- or see bullying on the horizon -- take a stand. On your turf, it is not allowed.


If anyone needs an example of how to be active in the anti-bullying campaign, let yourself be it. Be inclusive of everyone, kind, caring, and not heard passing judgment even in whispers.

, Bullying is described as a repeated behavior that is intentional and aggressive. It may be initiated by a person or group and tries to undermine those considered less powerful, innocent or less threatening. Racial acts of violence, physical harm, aggressive acts in any form, inflicting injury and negative acts all are considered bullying. This behavior is repetitive, exaggerated and aimed at making one’s self or one’s group superior. There are two main types of bullying:Direct bullying. This includes physical and verbal acts from pushing and kicking to threatening and taunting and calling names while the

Indirect bullying. This includes making faces, showing obscene gestures or even exclusion or giving the cold shoulder.

Knowing exactly what you're dealing with will help you first identify and then address it.



, Moreover, their personality has certain characteristics which differentiate them. Addressing these behaviors and personality traits will ultimately lower down bullying behaviors. Those who bully usually show the following behaviors:


Impulsive, react immediately or act before thinking.
Think of aggression as appropriate behavior to resolve conflict
Try to show and maintain dominance
Have poor social skills
Lack empathy
Are reinforced through the response of the victim
Have poor social intelligence and situational response

, This is the next step after identifying a bully or a group of bullies. Strict tone of voice and a strong warning at the first act often reduces the behavior in the future and helps anti-bullying. Talk with them using the following tips:


Call upon them immediately and let them know that their behavior is intolerable
Clearly state the future circumstances and make credible remarks (which you definitely can implement)
Make them realize that from that day onwards they will be under strong surveillance and there are no second chances
Give the first warning straight away and discuss the issue openly

, Once they know that they have to answer for what they have done and will be subjected to punishment then they'll often try to avoid any such circumstances that could lead to the same consequences again.


To make sure this happens, there should be adequate implementation at every level, so that no one stays believing that he or she will not be penalized after bullying. The second you drop your toughness, theirs will flare up.

, The bullies usually lack the skills to work in groups and work in co-operation with peers. They also lag behind in social skills -- if you can teach them this, you may be able to cut bullying off at the root of the problem. Here are some ideas:


Role play by helping the child adopt and then enact different roles for awareness. For example a bully might act as a victim while the victim acts like a bully and perform roles. This will enhance insight, teaching them other people matter, too.
Model appropriate behavior for them, helping the child understand what social skills demand
Make colorful cards depicting qualities of a person who is friendly and social towards others and on black and white cards depict how those behave who lag behind in social skills. Help the students choose and apply adaptive behaviors.

Gaining skills will help them develop the ability to act at a one-to-one level, with no upper or lower hierarchy, teaches them to listen and then act patiently, helps them respect the ideas of others, and how to work cooperatively.

Defend yourself against physical bullying.,
Fight back against verbal bullying.,
Take action if you are the victim of social bullying.,
Understand why the bullying is occurring.",How to Handle a High School Bully1," Are you being hit, kicked, punched, or tripped out of the blue or for no good reason? This is physical bullying, and you have to take action to stop it. In defending yourself, you should not take physical action to stop physical bullying -- violence to stop violence does not work. No one should have to put up with physical bullying, and you have options to stop it. From interrupting to making it harder for the person bullying you to make contact, there are many positive steps you can take., Verbal bullying involves hurtful comments about you, often designed to make you feel ashamed or isolated. It tends to be teasing and/or mean comments that might take the form of sexist, racist, or homophobic slurs, comments on your appearance, or remarks about other traits. Even though some might see it as harmless teasing, verbal bullying makes you ashamed and isolated, and those who choose to do it are hoping you won’t fight back. People who use verbal bullying to hurt others need to be stopped, and you have multiple ways to defend yourself, from your own comments back to making an official complaint., If you don’t take steps to defend yourself, social bullying can just get worse. This kind of bullying can be both open and covert, so identifying it might be challenging. By letting people know about it and putting it all out in the open (even if it’s embarrassing) those who use these tactics lose their power. Social bullying is about relationships -- challenging them, destroying them, trying to change their status. People who engage in social bullying will use the relationships you have with others to attempt to harm you. Even though it can be hard to explain to parents and teachers, social bullying is just as harmful as the other kinds. The emotional toll from dealing with someone who bullies you in this manner can be high.Sometimes bullying involves leaving people out of social situations on purpose to socially isolate them. Social exclusion is still a type of bullying.
Secret bullying strategies include spreading rumors, attempts to ruin another person’s social reputation, lying, and attempting to turn a person’s friends into enemies.

, Typically people who bully want to make themselves feel better at your expense. People who bully often do so for control, power, confidence, or social acceptance. The key is to not let them receive that kind of satisfaction."

Defend others like you.",How to Handle a Mean Girl," First and foremost, you should know the reasons why girls treat each other this way. Some typical reasons include:


They are jealous of you because you possess something that they don't have, whether it's beauty, talent, good grades, kindness






They see you as a threat because you are different: They might even try to steal your friends. Girls who are insecure about themselves don't appreciate it when a girl who is not like them in any way presents something different that what they are offering - so they view you as a threat to them.






You get positive attention from boys that they don't get.






You have true friends instead of people too scared to be a victim that they suck up to you.






You're the new kid and they don't appreciate you getting the most attention.





;
, A key factor in dealing with any kind of bullying is to remember you are not alone!


Go on YouTube and listen to these songs: Mean Girls by Rachel Crow, Who You Are by Jessie J, Who's Laughing Now By Jessie J, Brave by Sara Bareilles, Wings by Little Mix, Mean by Taylor Swift, and Work What You Got by Mary J Blige.






Look up material about bullying. Search for girls your age talking about their experiences.






Start a thread or a forum and discuss with others their experience with bullies






Ask your parents what they went through when they were your age and how they handled it







, When they are whispering while you're nearby pretend you don't hear a thing. If it's in class, keep your eyes on the task at hand. Whatever you do, don't respond to their rude remarks. In fact, don't even look in their direction. This will be hard to do but do your best; it takes away their ability to turn it into a tit-for-tat fight.

, In the case these girls decide to make it obvious they're talking to you and humiliate you in front of everyone, look her/them dead in the eye and slowly let a wide grin spread across your face without saying one word. Almost like a smirk. Then right when you see they are caught off guard walk away with that same smile on your face and your head held high. They will be frustrated that their stupid insults didn't affect you!

, Make your smile real. How you might ask? As you're watching this bully putting you down think to yourself: ""Wow, I bet she still sleeps with a night light and a teddy bear!"" sure enough you will begin to smile.

, Go shopping, take a day for yourself to pamper: pedicure, manicure. You get the point. (However, don't get a makeover or do anything that will change too much about your appearance. This might make the girls think they broke down so much of your confidence that you want to look different, which will please them.) Remember you are doing this for yourself, not to fit in with those little snots. They will have something mean to say about this. When they do, just keep on walking: head held high, shoulders back, good posture, and a big smile. Don't care at all, you are beautiful no matter what a stupid bully says!

, This will throw them. Instead of getting hurt, they will be forced to face the fact that you only say pleasant things back to them. This sets an example for them and others, but it also makes it very hard for them to respond nastily without looking really petty and cruel, which will then be noticed by everyone around. They themselves have probably been hurt themselves. By being pleasant to them, you show them how to act, and show that you consider them to be obviously immature and in need of help and guidance., Hygiene is important for increasing your confidence. Keep yourself clean by bathing daily, using deodorant, and moisturizing, and take good care of your skin using a daily cleanser that works for you. Investing time in yourself will boost your confidence.

, Look for people who have personalities like you. Believe or not, there is strength in numbers. You will feel much better if you have friends to take your side.

, If you've gone through all of these steps and you still feel bad, talk to a trusted friend. You could even get a counselor, a professional outside of school, someone you feel comfortable with.

, If you see it happening, go report it to an adult immediately. Wait until a little later and ask the person if they are okay and then invite them to eat lunch with you. You never know this could be the person that helps you get through your problem.

Interrupt the bully.,
Walk away if you can.,
Stay calm.,
Document your interactions with the person who is bullying you.,
Tell the school.,
Make it harder for the bully to find and get to you.,
Go to the police.,
Reach out for support.",How to Handle a High School Bully2," It can be something like “I need to leave now” or even something silly like “My monster needs me.” It’s about trying to keep the person bullying you off-balance. This often confuses the bully enough that he or she is less sure of how you will respond the next time the possibility of bullying arises. Bullying often follows a script, and you want to change it so the bully is off-balance. If you are a bystander and see someone being bullied, try to create a distraction or take the bully's attention off of what he's doing. You can also provide an interruption by telling the person being bullied like, ""Hey, I really need to talk to you for a second"" or ""Mr. X wants to see you for a minute."", If they follow you, or it happens again and you feel comfortable doing so, ask the person to stop. If the person refuses, detail the steps you will take to deal with the situation.For example, you can say something like, ""Please stop calling me mean names. If you don't, I will report you to the principal.""
It's important not to give bullying an audience if you're a bystander. Attention will only encourage the bully. Don't laugh at or encourage bullying behavior. If it feels safe, you can even say something like, ""That's really not funny"" or ""Take it easy."", No matter how the person who is bullying you responds, staying calm will show them their efforts to upset you aren’t working. Show that you are unaffected by their actions, even if you are inside. , Write down as exactly as you can what they said and did and who was there. This can help when you talk to teachers or people in authority about the situation., Letting people in authority know will make it harder for the person who does the bullying to continue. You might not be the only one suffering, and it might be time for the school administration to take action against that person. It’s important to have a record of complaint against the person doing the bullying in case it continues. If the verbal abuse has taken the form of sexist, racist, or homophobic slurs, you also might want to reach out to teachers involved in student groups trying to combat sexism, racism, and homophobia., Change your routes. Go with a crowd whenever you can. Bullies often avoid taking on someone with a group around them., If the bullying consists of any physical violence, go to the police immediately. Threats of violence should also be reported to the police, as they are illegal in many jurisdictions., Being the target of bullying is not your fault. No one should have to deal with bullying, social isolation, and shaming alone. Even if people who were your friends have gotten involved in the social bullying situation, look for new activities and new friends. Get yourself out of the toxic situation. If needed, speaking with a school counselor, joining a ""beat-bullying"" group, or seeing a therapist may also help with your emotional pain.

Go to the police if there are extreme threats.",How to Handle a High School Bully3," Cyberbullying can be the most distressful of all. Bullies have access to their victims 24/7, and the victim can feel like he or she has no peace at all. It can happen to anyone, and can be either someone you know or an anonymous user. If you are suffering from hurtful texts or emails, unwanted images, someone purposefully excluding you online, or even someone logging in to your account and making harmful changes, this is all cyberbullying.

Any time you can make your internet presence smaller and more private, do it.Often the painful part of social media is hurtful comments or gossip being spread and seeing this information on others' feeds. You may want to delete your social media accounts for awhile if the bullying gets out of hard or if it starts to have emotionally damaging effects.

, Sometimes cyberbullying can take the form of getting into your accounts and wreaking havoc. Choose passwords that are random and include letters, numbers, and symbols. Change passwords often and do not share them., If the cyberbully is targeting you through texts and images to your phone, a new number will stop their efforts. Only give your new number to close family and friends and ask them not to pass it on., When you do receive unwanted texts, images, or comments, don’t read or look at them -- send them to someone you trust. They can then put together the documentation you need to present to school authorities or the police., Even if the person bullying you is not at your school, cyberbullying can have a profound and harmful impact on your life, and your teachers should be aware. If it is at your school, teachers and administrators can help you raise awareness of the issue. , Also report the bullying to the websites and phone companies through which you are receiving the threats. In this case, you might consider limiting your online presence. "

Avoid the bully.,
Make new friends.,
Walk with a buddy.,
Stand tall and act brave.",How to Get Rid of a Bully when in a New School1," You may not always be able to stay away from someone who is bullying you, but there are some things you can do to try and keep from running into them. First of all, try to avoid places you know they will be. For example, if they are outside their locker at the end of the school day, take a different route that will keep you from passing them. Or, hang out in your classroom for a few extra minutes until they’ve left school for the day.


While it’s okay to make changes in your daily routine to avoid your bully, don’t ever hide or skip class to get away from them.It is okay to avoid the bully now and then to minimize conflict, but if you are changing your entire routine, then you may be fueling the bullying. Avoid making drastic changes to avoid the bully.;
, Being the new kid at school can sometimes make you an easy target for bullies because they think you probably don’t have many friends to back you up yet. Work on making friends at your new school so you have a good support system to help you deal with the bully. You’ll probably make friends just by being yourself and being confident, but if you’re having trouble making new friends, try to do some of the following things:


Smile at your classmates and be friendly to everyone. You might not know where you fit in at a new school for a while so it is important to talk to everyone so you can figure out which kids you have fun being around and have a lot in common with.
Joining clubs and organizations you’re interested in can also help you make friends. This is a good way to find people with the same hobbies and interests as you.
If the other kids are talking about getting together to do an activity you like and are good at, ask them if you can join. For example, if they are talking about going bowling over the weekend, you could say, “I love bowling, too. Can I come with you guys? It sounds like fun!”, Walking with a friend can help keep a bully from bothering you. When you’re by yourself, you might seem like an easy target. If you’re walking with a friend, however, the bully might not be confident enough to deal with both of you. Make plans with a friend to walk to and from classes or to the bus after school.


Do the same for any other kids that are being bullied. Not only will you help keep them from being picked on, but they’ll be more likely to do the same for you when you need them to., A bully might also be more likely to leave you alone if you act like you’re not afraid of them. To do this you don’t have to say anything to them, just stand up tall and act confident.


If you have trouble being confident, try doing things that make you feel good about yourself. For example, wear a pair of shoes you love or get up a little earlier to do your hair the way you think it looks best."

Understand that preschoolers often have a hard time really connecting with other children.,
Don’t punish your child before talking to him.,
Discuss other people’s feelings with your child.,
Ask your child why he bullied the other child.,
Ask your child to put himself in someone else’s shoes.,
Consider getting a firsthand look at the situation.,
Correct the behavior when you see it occur.,
Ask the teacher for details if your child’s teacher contacts you first.,
Consider bringing your child to a child psychologist if he will not stop bullying others.,
Take your child out of school if the problem is not being resolved.",How to Handle Preschool Bullies1," Children in the preschool age group (ages three to six) are typically not yet ready for real and lasting friendships and may still be learning to deal with others outside of their family. For children who have little real socialization outside of the sibling group, the preschool experience can be trying because they have to adjust to so many different skill sets at once.


At this age, children do not generally think of others in terms of what they want and are typically selfish but in a non-malicious way. Friends are basically defined as the person that is currently there, playing with them.;
, Of course, it is important to stop the behavior and that may mean some consequences, but it is equally important to understand the underlying causes of the bullying behaviors so that they can be dealt with and the problem corrected. This means talking to your child to find out why he feels the need to bully others.


Ways to talk to your child about this topic will be discussed in the following steps.

, Talking to your child about the feelings of others is important and should begin before the first day of school. Using reflective language allows the child to learn without feeling like he is in trouble. It is also important to use the words the child will understand.Saying that being mean “hurt Janey’s feelings” is more effective than talking about Janey’s self-esteem. Be careful that you are not using an accusatory tone.

, Asking ‘why questions’ may also be helpful and may allow your child to explain his own version of the events and give his reasoning for why he acted out.


For example, ask your child “Why did you pull on Janey’s hair?” or “Why did you use mean language yesterday?”.

, You might ask a child who is possibly engaging in bullying how he would feel if someone did the same thing to him. Let him act out that scenario. This question, which sounds simple and straightforward, may be the right push that your child needs to reveal that he has been the victim of bullying in the past, which explains his own bullying behavior now.


Take your child to apologize. Preschoolers often simply need to be explained to that something is bad, and then they will try to avoid it in the future. If you have helped your child to see that his actions hurt another child, he will most likely be open to apologizing. Preschool children tend to be able to forgive and forget much more readily than their older peers.

, Talk to your child’s teachers about dropping in at school during play time or during some other group activity. You could also volunteer to help on any projects that the kids are assigned; this will allow you to observe the situation better. Doing this can help you to see how your child interacts with other children.You could also have your child’s classmates over at your home or at an outing like a picnic. These outings or get-togethers will encourage mingling and if you do observe any bullying behaviour, you can address it right then and there.

, If you are there to witness your child being a bully towards someone else, step in and correct your child’s behavior. This does not mean yelling at your child, as this will teach him that yelling is ok. Instead, calmly tell him what he did wrong, focusing on his actions rather than his character, and then ask him to apologize.


For example, if your child takes away a toy that another child is playing with, simply talk him into returning the toy to the child. Making a proper and sincere apology can also be a good way to correct any instance of bullying.

, If your child’s teacher is the one who initiates the contact to inform you about any bullying behaviour, try to stay calm and to get as many details as possible about the incident. Ask for information about:


The name of the child or children that were bullied.
Where the incident occurred (whether it happened inside the classroom or during play time).
The type of behaviour that was exhibited.

, If your child refuses to stop bullying others, you may want to consider bringing him to a child psychologist who can help him to work through his anger and aggression. The psychologist will also give your child suggestions for what he can do to overcome his desire to bully others.


Remember that this counseling should not feel like a punishment and should not be treated like there is something “wrong” with your child. Above all, bullying is only improved and dealt with through love and understanding.

, Some children simply are not ready for preschool at the same time as other children. Meeting so many new people can be overwhelming, which can lead to your child acting out aggressively. If your child is having a hard time overcoming his bullying behaviors, consider taking him out of school and waiting another year before enrolling him in preschool again. He may simply need some time to get used to being around many people.


After you have dropped enrollment, work with your child to hone his social skills. Spend time talking about other people’s feelings and how your child can affect them, set up playdates for your child, and bring him on public outings.

Find people in positions of authority who can help.,
If the first adult you talk to is not helpful, try another.,
Talk to your parents.",How to Get Rid of a Bully1," Bullies push people around because they think they have the power to do so. They don't. Find people who are supposed to be in charge to help. It is their responsibility to stop bullying, and they should use it.;
, Bullying has become such a serious issue of discussion in recent years that it has become hard to ignore. In the past, adults often dismissed it by suggested that young people always must solve the problem on their own or simply told victims of bullying to ignore the bullies. Increased sensitivity to the issue has made those statements seem out of place. Both the National Institute of Health (a federal agency) and the American Academy of Pediatrics have websites devoted to anti-bullying initiatives, and these are just some indications of the growing awareness of bullying's significance.Some adults may not have gotten the message, but increasing numbers understand that bullying simply cannot be tolerated any longer.

, It is unfortunate that some adults won't listen, but if those in the area won't listen to you then they should at least listen to your parents. School officials and others who work with young people sometimes do not adequately respect the young people they supervise, but they usually cannot reject the input of parents--the ones who give them authority by placing young people in their care. If they still refuse to deal with the situation, then at least your parents can begin thinking of ways to get you out of that environment. But they can't begin this process unless you talk to them.

Ignore the bully.,
Use visualization.,
Tell them to stop.,
React like you don’t care.,
Walk away.,
Don’t bully back.",How to Get Rid of a Bully when in a New School2," If you can, ignore the bully when they say or do something to you. If the bully fails to get the reaction they want from you, they may lose interest and leave you alone. The following methods can help you ignore a bully:


Try to walk away when they come up to you before they say or do anything. Pretend that you are walking away from a friend so your body language (which you’re probably unaware of) doesn’t make it look like you’re scared.
Think about something else, like what you’re going to do with your friends this weekend or what you have to do for homework.
Come up with a sentence you can repeat to yourself when a bully approaches you that will keep you from being afraid. Try saying something like, “He’s just another kid. He eats, sleeps, and lives the same way I do.”, You can also use visualization to help keep yourself calm around a bully. This means that you picture things in your head that make you feel safe and protected. Here are some visualizations to try:


Build a wall around yourself in your mind. When the bully says something mean, just picture their insults bouncing off the wall you’ve created.
You can also try visualizing the bully in a funny way. For example, visualize them with three eyes or dressed in a silly outfit. This can help them seem less intimidating., When a bully says or does something mean to you, telling them in a confident voice to stop might help. They are probably not expecting you to stand up for yourself so this might be enough to make them lose interest and stop bullying you. If you find yourself in a situation where you’re being bullied, simply yell “Stop!” and walk away from the bully. Don’t turn back around no matter what they say., Bullies often keep picking on someone because the way they react makes the bully feel powerful or superior to the other person. If you can react to their comments like it doesn’t bother you (even if it really does), the bully might leave you alone because you aren’t reacting how they want.


For example, if a bully tells you your shoes are ugly, just start laughing and say, “I know they are!” Then walk away from the bully without saying anything else.
Some other lines you can use when a bully says something mean to you are: “Whatever!” “I’m not sure why you keep saying these things about me, but I don’t care,” or “Wow, did you come up with that all by yourself?”Making these kinds of comments can help to defuse the situation and take some of the power away from the bully.

, It is really important that, no matter what, you walk away after you show the bully you don’t care. By turning around and walking away, you’re taking the power away from the bully. You won’t be giving them the reaction they want so they’ll lose interest in picking on you., No matter how much they are bothering you, don’t ever hit, kick, or punch a bully. This is the reaction they want from you. In addition, you might get in trouble for hitting them, even if they started it. You should also keep from saying mean or hurtful things back to them. It might seem like it’s okay to be mean to someone if they have been bullying you, but bullying is always wrong and never justified."

Think about what you post.,
Keep your passwords secret.,
Keep your parents informed.,
Don’t respond.,
Keep a record of online bullying.",How to Get Rid of a Bully when in a New School3," Bullying doesn’t always happen in person. In today’s world, cyberbullying is also something people have to deal with. Like regular bullying, however, there are ways to prevent and stop cyberbullying. First, be conscious of what you post online. Don’t post anything that you don’t want shared with everyone you know. If it could be embarrassing or hurtful to you or others, don’t post it.


Always remember, absolutely nothing you post online is private. Take a minute to think about all the people who might look at your post or picture, including your friends, classmates, teachers, parents, and even strangers., It is also important to keep your passwords for your social media accounts to yourself. Giving someone your password allows them to access your account and post whatever they want, which could be something hurtful to you or another person.


The only people you should give your password to are your parents., Your parents can help you decide what you should and shouldn’t post online, so let them know what you’re doing and who you’re doing it with. They have your best interests in mind and want to keep you from opening yourself up to being cyberbullied.In addition, they can help you figure out how to get rid of the unwanted post and help you block the person so they can no longer communicate with you online.You may also consider asking an older sibling if you don’t feel ready to talk to your parents about it. If your sibling was also bullied, then they may be able to give you some feedback.

, Sometimes, no matter how careful you are, cyberbullies still get to you. If you’re being bullied online, never respond. Responding to a mean comment or post might only make things worse and give the bully more fuel to keep bullying you., It is always good to keep a record of any online bullying that is going on. Documenting when someone is bullying you can make it easier to let your parents or another adult know exactly what happened. If you can show them exactly what the bully said or did, they can help you figure out the best way to deal with it.There are a few ways you can document online bullying. You can print out the post or email that contains the nasty content, or save it to a file on your computer. In addition, you can take a screenshot of the text, post, or message on your phone.
Always remember that if the bullying gets intense, seek help. It is better to seek help early rather than wait.

"

Tell your parents.,
Tell a teacher.,
Tell another adult.,
Come up with a plan.,
Bring a friend or parent.,
Find a different way to communicate.",How to Get Rid of a Bully when in a New School4," Sometimes you can’t stop a bully on your own. If they are physically hurting you or won’t stop picking on you even after you’ve tried to get them to stop on your own, you need to tell an adult about what they are doing. Let your parents know what is going on at school. They can help figure out the best person for you to talk to at school and can help you decide how to approach them. They can also help you figure out and practice the best ways to deal with the bully until the issue is resolved., Teachers are there to make sure you stay safe and aren’t being treated badly by anyone, even if you’re a new student. They are a good person to tell about bullying and will usually be able to resolve the issue quickly.When you talk to your teacher about your situation, try saying something like, “Mark has been calling me mean names and pushing me in the lunch line. Can you help me get him to stop?”
While any teacher at your school should help you, you might feel more comfortable talking to certain ones. Tell the teacher you feel most at ease around. Feeling comfortable will make it easier for you to talk to them about your problem.

, If you think the first person you told didn’t believe you or if nothing is happening after telling them about the bully, ask another adult for help. This person can be a different teacher, a coach, your school principal, or a guidance counselor. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get the help you need right away. If the first person you told wasn’t able to help you, one of these people should be able to. Bullying is never okay and you should keep talking to the adults at your school about it until it stops., It can be difficult to talk to an adult about bullying, especially in a new school. To make this easier, come up with a plan on how you will approach them before you do. Decide who you feel most comfortable talking to, when is the best time to talk to them, and what you are going to say. Going in with a solid plan can make things much easier.


For example, think about who your favorite teachers are so far and why. You might decide to talk to your gym teacher because he is always nice and he always asks you about your favorite sports teams.
When you’re deciding when the best time to talk is, think about when you’ll have enough time and how you’ll feel after the meeting. For instance, asking to talk after school might be best because you’ll have as much time as you need to talk about your problems and you won’t have to go right back to class if you’re feeling upset after the meeting.
Plan out what you are going to say by writing it down or practicing it over and over before you talk to an adult. This will help you feel more confident and ensure you can explain everything clearly and without forgetting important details.

, If you’re nervous about talking to a new teacher, principal, guidance counselor, or coach, try bringing a friend or your parents with you. It might make you feel more at ease having someone you feel safe and comfortable around there with you, which can make it easier to talk about your problems.


In addition, your friend might be able to back up your story and help you tell the adult what happened.
Your parents can help make sure your teacher understands everything that happened and can work with them to figure out what to do next., It can be tough to talk about bullying. If you think you might be too nervous to speak about your problem, try communicating a different way. For example, you can write a note that describes what happened, when it happened, and who it happened with. Tell the adult you’ve been having a problem and that you’ve written down what happened, and then give them the note. This will make it easier to open up a conversation with the adult so you can get help to stop the bully.


You can also send an email, use an instant messaging system if your new school has one, or drop a note in your teacher, principal, or guidance counselor’s mailbox. Any of these methods will work to open up a conversation about the problems you’ve been having with a bully."

Make your child who has been bullied feel safe and loved.,
Talk about bullying frequently.,
Try to empathize with your child’s feelings.,
Consider contacting the parents of the child who bullied your child.,
Create an open dialogue with your child’s teacher.,
Set up an appointment with a child psychologist.",How to Handle Preschool Bullies2," Children who are being victimized may not speak about the problem at first. It is important that they know that they are safe and loved at home so that they feel comfortable discussing these problems. They should also feel like they can go to the teacher or another trusted adult with any concerns about bullying.


Give your child lots of hugs and let him know that it is not his fault that he was bullied.

, Parents should be having these conversations about bullying frequently during relaxed, non-stressful times of the day, whether the child is a suspected bully or a victim. It is important that the child understands both sides of the equation.


Talking to your child when he is relaxed may help him to feel comfortable about opening up about his experience with being bullied.

, Really listen when your child tries to explain to you how being bullied made him feel. Learning how to empathize with your child’s feelings will not only help you understand his issues from his perspective, which will help you find a solution to his behavior, but will also help you gain his confidence.

, If your child is willing to tell you who bullied him, it may be a good idea to contact the bully’s parents. Tell the parents about the incident, and work with them to figure out a time where their child could apologize to your child.

, If your child has been the victim of a bully and has told you about the incident, set up a time to meet with your child’s teacher. Discuss the school’s policies regarding bullying, and what can be done to keep this from happening in the future.


Once the teacher is made aware of the situation, he or she will be able to keep an eye out for any future occurrences.

, If your child refuses to go to school because of the bullying he has faced, you could consider bringing him to a child psychologist who can help him to overcome his fears and give him suggestions for what he could do if bullying occurs in the future, such as bringing a teacher’s attention to the situation.


Ask your child’s pediatrician for a recommendation for a child psychologist in your area.

Be confident.,
Stand up to the bully.,
Develop a wider circle of friends.,
Remember that you aren't defined by what the bully says or does.",How to Get Rid of a Bully2," Bullies often target those who appear vulnerable or cautious. If necessary, fake confidence. You may just discover after a while that you really are sure of yourself after all.Don't avert your eyes when a bully looks at you. Stay calm, acknowledge that they are there, and move on to what you really want to do. If you look frightened or seem to expect trouble from them, then they may feel that they have some power over you.

, This does not mean fighting them physically or threatening to harm them. But you can make it clear to the bully that you do not fear them. This is not easy, but it is necessary. Bullies seek victims, and you are less likely to be targeted if you refuse to treated as one., Bullies often target isolated individuals. If you have many friends, they are less likely to focus on you. There are two primary reasons for this. First, if the bully likes to physically threaten you, associating with others makes it appear that others are on your side. Additionally, for those bullies who prefer to insult others, their statements will be meaningless to those who actually know and appreciate you., The words or actions of others do not determine your significance. You have a value of your own, and no tiny facet of your life in which you are in contact with a bully should have any bearing on the things that are really important to you.

Understand the intent of the bully.,
Talk to your parents or guardians.,
Consider your options.,
Confront the bully.,
Get away from the bully.",How to Get Rid of a Bully3," Cyberbullying can be more complex than the typical stereotype of the playground bully. While traditional bullying was often intended to make the bully seem powerful to others, cyberbullying is often anonymous. While the person spreading rumors or attempting to humiliate others online may feel powerful, their goal is more often to do damage to someone's reputation. They are also do not necessarily limit the audience to people who personally know either the bully or the target of their aggressive actions. For these reasons, cyberbullying can be both hard to stop and difficult to predict., If you are being threatened or harassed, they need to know about it. A number of the steps you may need to follow to get rid of the bully can be complicated, and you should inform them of the situation early on.

, Because of the complexity of cyberbullying, there is rarely one easy solution, but there are also options that are less available for use in traditional cases of bullying.


In many cases, school officials will do little to handle cyberbullying cases; unless there is evidence that the perpetrator was using school property to post online, they actually may have little legal authority to intervene.Service providers and internet companies like Facebook consider cyberbullying a serious issue, and they may intervene if you contact them. You may also be able to block them on certain sites.
Certain legal options may be available to you and your family. Web content can provide irrefutable evidence of harassment or threats. As a result of new state and federal laws, threats of violence posted online can even result in lengthy jail sentences.If this seems like a bit of an extreme solution, just keep in mind that you are not without options and do have some power to change the situation.

, While this is part of the standard program for dealing with traditional bullying, it may also be the quickest way to put an end to it. Make it clear that you are not intimidated by the cyberbully. You will ignore their posts and eliminate any of their hurtful comments that you can.

, This is another tactic that was recommended for use against bullies, but it often didn't work. It is difficult to ignore someone right in front of you, but it may prove easier to do in the online world. As a last option, if all else has failed, you can close down your internet accounts. If those online connections are vital to you, you may want to start new accounts to replace them, but take steps to discourage the bully from tracking you down again.


It may be useful to find alternate sites to keep your social connections. Diaspora and Frendica, for instance, are just a few of the many alternative social networking sites in existence. You may be surprised to discover how many people you know are already on these other networks.

Keep in mind that while you may think your actions were embarrassing or humiliating, others may think it was cute or endearing. People often won’t react as you as expect. You may have misread the person or the person may have totally missed the moment by not paying attention. People may think ill of you, or they may not.


Realize that it’s common to have expectations for how people react (often negative), but these expectations don’t always come true.;
, When you find your thoughts trapped in worst-case outcomes, counter it with some best-case outcomes, an realize that both are possible., Think about whose opinions of you matter the most to you: the thoughts of your family and close friends are likely first; then perhaps co-workers; then neighbors; and finally acquaintances.If you find yourself trying to impress an acquaintance, ask yourself why. Will their opinion of you change anything?


If you are in school or university, think about how long these people will be in your life. You may graduate and never see your classmates ever again. How important will their opinions be in 1 year? Or 5 years?

, It’s impossible to have the approval of everyone in your life for every decision you make. Choose what issues are important to you, and who’s opinion counts.It may be important to you that your family approves of who you marry, but it may be less important if your family approves of you buying one car over another. Remember that you are in control of your life, and nobody can make your decisions for you.


When you need someone’s approval, you give power to that individual. Some people may abuse this power, so be careful who you allow to have this role.

, It’s possible that someone spread rumors about you or said some unkind things about you behind your back. Just because someone is mean to you doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with you or that you should feel ashamed of who you are.No one deserves to be treated disrespectfully or with unkind words or actions.

, It’s okay if people want to share their opinions with you, but don’t put all of your weight on what someone else thinks. Some people may think they know what is best for you, but the reality is, no one knows better than you know for yourself. Your parents may push you to attend one college, but you may feel like you want to go to a different one. Accept their opinion, but make a choice that is best for you. Sometimes, you know it in your “gut”.For instance, if you’re trying on a shirt that you really like but your friend doesn’t like it, don’t make your final decision based off of what your friend thinks, go off of how you feel.

, Surely there are people in your life that you do not like, for whatever reason. Differences of personality, lifestyle, and worldview can mean you get along with some people better than others. Remember that this is true of everyone; rarely can someone get along with every person he or she meets. It’s okay if someone doesn’t like you.


Someone might judge you for where you come from, what kind of job or education you have, or based on your looks.Recognize that these are judgments, and more a reflection of that person than of you.

, Is it worth it to pretend to be somebody else in order to impress someone? People who express the authentic self report having higher satisfaction in their relationships, a sense of purpose, and confidence in their lives.You may feel like your authentic self is weird or too different, but that’s highly unlikely to be true.


If you’re not sure who your authentic self is, start doing the things you love. You may love to create art, sing, dance, or create comedy routines. The closer you get to the things that make you happy, the more authentic you feel.
Don’t be afraid to be silly, goofy, or weird.

, You may feel insignificant or unworthy, but this simply is not true. Remind yourself of your positive qualities that make you unique and make you feel good about yourself.You might be a math whiz or an incredible sculptor. If other people put you down, remember that you have abilities, skills, and traits that make you special.


Focus on your positive qualities such as your kindness, generosity, and willingness to help.
Write a list of the things that you love about yourself, that make you different. Hang it up in your room to remind yourself.

, You can start to run a whole dialog or situation in your head that has either never occurred or never will occur, due to negative thoughts taking over. You may wonder, “What did this person think of me? Did I make a good impression? Did I come off as foolish?” Before you start to worry and dig deeper into negativity, stop yourself.


Ask yourself, “Am I catastrophizing and making a bigger deal of this than it is? Are my thoughts based in reality?”Use affirmations to help you reconnect to yourself when you feel anxious. Affirmations can help you get into a more positive mindset by telling yourself positive things in the now moment.If you’re concerned about an interview, say to yourself, “I am qualified for this job and a good worker. I am good at interacting with other people.”

, You may feel like no one understands you, or that you just don’t fit in at your school. Maybe you are the only gay or lesbian person you know and feel terribly alone. Or perhaps you are the only Chinese person at your school, or the only person you know who speaks a different language at home than at school. Recognize that these things make you awesome and interesting, not weird or an outcast.


If you feel on the fringe of your community, find an online community of people with whom you can relate. You can join organizations that unite people of certain backgrounds, sexual orientations, and cultures, which can help you feel more connected., You may really enjoy playing hockey, dancing, or eating a vegetarian diet. See if there are any clubs, groups, or organizations you can join to meet other people that share similar interests as you. It can be comforting to meet other people who share similar tastes and activities, and it helps you remember that you are not alone.When you meet other people with similar interests, you instantly have something to bond over, even if it’s as simple as you both have a dog.

, Don’t care more about what ‘popular’ people think of you than what your friends think of you. Surround yourself with people that love and support you, no matter what. Having great friends in your life helps support your mental and emotional health and even makes you more resilient to stress.If you really want to be friends with the popular people, ask yourself if you actually want to be their friend or if you like the idea of being their friend. Would they be good friends to you and treat you with respect? Or do you want to have social status, beyond wanting friendship?

, Reach out to a guidance counselor, trusted adult, or therapist. Just because you reach out for help doesn’t mean that anything is wrong with you, or that you are less than other people.It just means you want someone’s help to get you through a difficult time.


You can also talk to a coach, teacher, or spiritual mentor.

Recognize and part with toxic friends.",How to Get Other People to Be Nice to You," People more easily warm to someone who is authentic, honest, and genuine.Part of being yourself means staying authentic, even in the face of fads and trends. It's natural to experiment and try new things at any age to discover your likes, dislikes, and what makes you feel good and comfortable.;
, People find braggers and conceited individuals to be less nice than humble folks. The more you appreciate others instead, the nicer your friend will think you are.We often try to impress people to make them like us. Instead of playing the ‘how awesome can I make myself sound’ game, speak honestly and genuinely about yourself when asked but try to keep the focus on the other person, which will make him feel valued.Be able to summarize what your friend is saying. This shows you are really listening and he will appreciate that.

, Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language and using it is the fastest way to build rapport.Using someone’s name in conversation makes him feel important, valued, and respected, and makes a lasting positive impression.
For a difficult name, ask the person to help you pronounce it. Don’t feel embarrassed by it – he will thank you for caring enough to ask.

, Being kind to others and open to the world naturally draws other people towards you.


Showing empathy and even some vulnerability may help someone bond with you on a more intimate level of humanity.Show acceptance. Life comes in all walks, all races, all orientations, and the more accepting and, better yet, supportive and appreciative you are of other people, the nicer you will be seen.Be polite and considerate and have good manners.
Don’t try to fix other people. When you hear his problems, your friend will appreciate you asking questions to help him solve his own problems. Ask open-ended questions starting with “how” or “why” to get him thinking., Practice random acts of kindness. Even if no one is looking, you will feel better about yourself by being altruistic and studies show that our kindness in turns breeds kindness towards us and happiness.There are so many ways you can practice random acts of kindness. Donate your clothes to the homeless. Sit with seniors and keep them company. Let somebody in on the freeway. Pay it forward with a coffee., Having a friendly expression is the first step in putting your friend at ease.


Have a nice, relaxed, and genuine smile that doesn’t look forced.

, Having a body posture that suggests you are truly interested in someone lets him see how nice you are being to him.


Sit leaning slightly forward with your arms casually at your sides. Crossing your arms gives off an appearance of being guarded and closed.

, Be present in your conversation, ask questions to show you are interested and listening, and your friend will sense you are a person that he can really relax, trust, and talk to. People just really want to be heard.Asking questions about the people you are with makes the other feel special.
Look at it like a detective game, where the goal is to pick up on clues and cues as to who the other person really is inside. You’ll take more interest in him this way, and the person you are talking to will really warm to you., Good listeners make eye contact for about 75% of a conversation. You don’t want to stare, but show you’re interested.Look between his eyes and the bridge of his nose, or just slightly to the side at his ear lobe.

, Although you can’t be everything to everybody, you can ask a friend how you appear in social circles and if you seem open and friendly or closed and unwelcoming. You may find that you are unintentionally giving off the wrong vibe.You might think, for example, that your active-listening face shows you are intently paying close attention but an outsider may think you look stern or even angry.
Always offering to help people may come from a place of generosity and friendliness but may be accidentally perceived as you thinking that your friends can’t do something well enough on their own. You might not know this, however, unless you ask.
Guard your emotions, however, and be prepared in case you hear your friend bluntly tell you that you come off entirely different than you imagine., People are more likely to like and respect you if you respect yourself.Be assertive, nice, authentic, and confident.

, The theory of indirect reciprocity states that even if you are nice to one person and that person isn’t necessarily nice back to you, someone else will be. That is because someone else will likely notice your kindness, form a higher opinion of you, and you will feel good about yourself.Being nice to everyone does not make you a doormat, however. You can still say no to people – you just don’t have to be mean to people in the process.Be assertive and kind yet firm when saying no. Be brief, stating the reason you are declining someone’s request honestly but without elaborate explanations., If you think someone is undermining you or being unkind, remember that your perception is only part of the situation. You could be interpreting his actions incorrectly and acting negatively on an incorrect assumption will only get you more negativity.For example, be nice to your co-worker, even if you think he’s taking credit for your idea – maybe he had a really bad day and truly forgot to put your name on the contribution list.
Explore why that person might not be acting kindly toward you. If you have reached an impasse that you cannot mend, you can still be polite and considerate, taking the high road., Ultimately, you can only do so much to influence how other people perceive you and you have to accept that some people just might not warm to you for one reason or another.Many first impressions are based on competence and warmth., Learn the difference from being kind to people and having to do things for them. You don’t have to please everyone all the time.Spend your quality time with others wisely versus just trying to gain their approval by doing things for them. You will respect yourself more and they will, too.

, Sometimes, no matter how hard you try to be nice and want to be somebody’s friend, he’s just not the best person for you and won’t change his behaviour. Stay with supportive friends who make you feel good about yourself and let the bullies and toxic friends go.Consider whether this person puts you down, makes jokes at your expense, and whether you feel happy or sad in this person’s presence. If you feel unhappy when you are with him, he might not be a good choice of friend.

Detach from this person, don’t initiate contact, and put your effort into your healthy friendships instead.
Be friendly, polite, and kind when you can’t avoid seeing this person and don’t talk bad about him to other people.

Be honest.,
Encourage his empathy.,
Don’t leave any doors open.,
Threaten legal action.,
Say no with your body language.,
Shorten your communications.,
Stop your communications.,
Ditch him.,
Get Social Support.,
Find a resource appropriate for the situation.,
Consult the resource you have decided to use.,
Inform the individual that you have sought outside support.",How to Get Someone to Leave You Alone," Let him know that you are not interested; say this assertively but without being mean. You do not need to list all of his faults and hurt his feelings. Just be clear that you don't think a relationship (of whatever sort is at stake) will work and that you would prefer it if he leave you alone.For example, if he keeps trying to get you to go on a date and you want him to stop, you might say ""look, I'm sorry but I am not interested in dating you, can you please stop asking?""
If the honest reasons may actually hurt the individual (such as if you find him annoying), re-phrase the reason to make it less hurtful. For example, if he asks why you will not date him, instead of saying something along the lines of “I find you annoying” you could say, “our personalities clash and I do not think we get along that well”. This removes the emphasis from his character and places it on the particular dynamic that occurs between the two of you.;
, Empathy leads people to act more prosocially. Let him know that the way he is behaving towards you is making you uncomfortable or scared, and that the experience is unsettling. He may not realize that his attention toward you is making you feel uncomfortable; he may reach the opposite conclusion, that you like his affection and attention. Engage his emotions by telling him how you really feel about his unwanted behavior. For example, if he still is still pursuing you even though you have said your personalities do not match, you might say ""I have told you that I am not interested a number of times and I feel like you aren't listening, which is making me feel uncomfortable and nervous.""

, Do not give him any wiggle room to misinterpret your words. If you do so, he may stick around or give you distance only temporarily.


Rather than saying “I’m not interested in dating you right now” close the door entirely by saying “I am not interested in dating you”. , In severe cases of unwanted attention, after all other options have failed and you truly feel unsafe, threaten legal action; this may frighten him and cause him to back off.


Let him know that you are taking detailed notes about his actions toward you. Keep a record of all of the communications attempts he makes.

, This step will only work if he can see you during your communications. Having closed off body language or looking like you are in a rush may allow him to realize that his communication attempt with you is unwanted.


When he approaches you again, try looking away, slouching, fidgeting, or yawning, to signal that you are not interested.Be careful not to accidentally signal interest with body language such as leaning in or laughing., Sometimes telling someone you are not interested is not enough, or there may not have been an opportunity to pull him aside and break the news. Keeping any communications short and to the point will help him get the hint that you are not interested. It will also make it more difficult for him to continue communicating as there will be less to discuss.For example, if he texts you and asks you how you your day is going and whether you want to go for dinner, you might ignore answering the question about your day and just say ""thanks for the offer but no thanks!""

, If he has not yet gotten the hint and speaking with him directly has not helped, it is time to stop all communication. Do not give into feelings of guilt about backing off from the situation. If you believe that removing this individual from your life is a good idea, then keep that in mind if you start to feel guilty. Guilt motivates us to repair relationships, but sometimes it tries to motivate us when it is actually not in our best long term interest to do so.If, after you say no to his date requests, he tries to make you feel guilty by saying things such as ""I'm going through a hard time right now so you saying no really stings"" keep in mind that guilt can misfire and lead you to make poor decisions.
Just because you are stopping your communications does not mean you should delete the communications he sends you, particularly if you feel that you are or may be stalked by this individual, in which case it is a good idea to have a record of all communications should you need them for legal purposes.

, In severe cases, such as if you feel you are being stalked, changing your email address, phone number, or in the most severe cases, your home address and/or work location will greatly influence your chances of getting any unwanted individual to leave you alone.

, Tell your family and friends about your situation. They may be able to give you helpful advice on how to deal with your situation.


If the person you are telling knows the individual who is giving you unwanted attention, be sure to remind whoever you are confiding in to be discreet and to not share the information beyond who you say is OK to tell.

, Think about the severity of the situation you are in and whether it is time to seek outside help. In the United States there are laws against stalking; police involvement and other legal interventions are options in severe cases.. There are also hotlines to help deal with stalking, such as: http://www.stalkinghelpline.org/

, Do not hesitate to make use of the resource you have found, particularly if you feel threatened.


If this is a work-related matter, check with your human resources department about what resources are available for situations involving unwanted attention from a co-worker.
If this is a school-related matter, check in with your teacher or principal to find out how they can help you navigate the situation you are in.
If you feel that you are being stalked, consider getting the police involved.

, Only follow this step in certain contexts, however. In some cases it may be better to be discreet, such as if the situation is not too severe, or it is at the workplace. In other cases, such as if you feel like you are in danger, letting him know that you have the police or other social resource involved may lead him to back away.

Recognize that this is not your fault.,
Deal the messages.,
Decide who to talk to.,
Sit down with your chosen person and explain what happened.,
Talk about what to do next.,
Move on with your life.",How to Find Help to Overcome Cyber Bullying Experiences (UK)," Nobody deserves to be bullied, and these messages don't reflect on you. You may feel hurt, and that's natural, but recognize that the bully is in the wrong. Their mean words are inaccurate.


If you are having any thoughts of harming yourself, tell someone right away.
;
, When the messages first start coming through, ignore them and archive them—file them away in a folder, print them out, etc. You can take back control of the situation by storing them as proof of the abuse. It's best not to delete any of them, no matter how hurtful they are.


Block the user that is bullying you.
Protect your online accounts.
Inform any local authorities that can deal with the situation.

, When dealing with this difficult situation, it is best to talk to someone both responsible and trustworthy (preferably an adult) that you know very well. They will take this seriously, listen well, and help you find a solution.


You could also contact cyber bullying organisations-like Cybersmile or Childline.
Consider talking to a parent, teacher, guardian, older sibling, or school guidance counselor.
If you don't have anyone in your life whom you feel comfortable talking to, there are organisations you can contact. Try Childline, CEOP, Crisis Chat, Cybersmile, ETCB and finally, Pure sight. (You can also just type up "" how to deal with cyberbullying"" in any browser and an organisation should come up)

, While it's painful, going into detail is important, because it can help them figure out exactly what happened and exactly how to stop it. Here are things to tell them:


When it started
Why it started (Did they hate your video/image, feminist opinions, drama king friend?)
What type of things they have said (show the messages)
How it makes you feel
How it is effecting your life
Who else knows—have they been bullied too?

, The responsible adult can give you guidance on how to handle this situation. If neither of you know what to do, the adult can help you call an organisation where people are trained to deal with this.


Consider emailing the website to ask for an IP ban of the abusive user.
Tell them about this article, mention some of the organisations that can help, talk about what course of action you should take.
Alert the police via the non-emergency number, as it is not an emergency, just a problem that needs to be sorted through.

, Realize that none of this is your fault, and you handled it as well as you could. Bullying is a terrible thing that happens, but the victim is not the real culprit. If you still aren't feeling okay, talk to someone you trust about the after effects.

Change your perspective.,
Answer teasing with a one-liner.,
Make your voice strong.,
Get into an assertive body position.,
React in a cool manner.,
Let them tease you.,
See it as a compliment.",How to React when Someone Teases You1," Others can often perceive someone’s potential reaction to teasing by the way they act under pressure. If your perspective on teasing is the same as theirs—that it makes you get angry—then making fun of your quirks is what a bully is likely to do. But if your perspective is indifferent towards teasing, you may find that bullies don’t think you’re much fun—and they’ll leave you alone., Instead of engaging with the bully and teasing them back, wait until they are done taunting you throw and a one-liner at them before walking away.After saying your line, shrug, turn on your heels, and walk calmly away. This displays that you aren’t easily ruffled, making you a boring target. You can try one-liners like these:


“Thanks for telling me that.”
“Oh, I thought I was cool.”
“So what’s your point?”
Try to keep a sincere tone of voice instead of a sarcastic or angry tone, as this might display your irritation and perpetuate the teasing.

, Using a confident tone of voice displays your refusal to back down to the teasing. Don’t sound like you are going to cry; don’t sound like you are angry or upset; and don’t whine. Instead—even if you’re shy—raise your voice so that they can hear you and make your tone even and strong.


A shaky voice is also an indicator that the teasing has worked to upset you.

, Looking as strong as you sound is also important. You can communicate your inner confidence—or look like you have inner confidence, even if you don’t feel it—by using body language to your advantage. Things like gesturing when you talk and having good posture help your body take up more space, making you actually feel confident.Make sure that your posture is assertive. Stand with your feet firmly planted on the ground, your arms hanging down at your sides, and your hands relaxed. Maintain eye contact with the bully and keep your face relaxed. You might even want to smile a little, since this demonstrates assertiveness.Try power posing for extra confidence. Standing in a powerful position can increase your sense of well-being and confidence for a short period of time.For example, you can try standing like a superhero with your hands on your hips, legs shoulder width apart, chest out, and chin up. Stay in this position for a minute or two.

, Bullying often gets worse when you get angry in response, so it is a good idea to respond in a calm, cool way. Instead of bursting into tears or yelling out an angry response, try to react as little as possible. Doing so will show the bully that you are not afraid of him or what he is saying to you.


Avoid responding directly to what the bully has to say. Instead, try saying something to show your lack of interest or concern. For example, you could say something like, “Are you done talking? I haven’t really been paying attention.” Or, “Your life must be pretty lame since you are always so interested in mine.”Try to avoid starting a teasing cycle. It can be tempting to fight back by teasing a bully the same way they are teasing you, but it is likely that such an action will backfire on you because it shows that you’re irritated. Showing any kind of emotional reaction to teasing usually makes the teaser want to do it more.

, Do an experiment. For one week, take your new attitude with you wherever you have been getting teased (or keep the new attitude available if you aren’t teased on a regular basis). Allow the people to tease you without reacting at all, as much as they want. If after a week they haven’t moved on to teasing someone else, you don’t have to use this strategy anymore.The best way to appear calm through a teasing session is to choose to believe that their teasing doesn’t bother you. This way, if you answer a direct question or use a one-liner, your voice is strong and sincere instead of angry or sarcastic.
Say to yourself, “It’s all right if they tease me because it doesn’t bother me at all.” Choose to believe this mantra, and it will show.

, You may be the target of teasing not because someone thinks little of you, but because they are attracted to you and don’t know how to talk to you except through negative attention. Even if they do have negative intentions for teasing, if you see it as a compliment that you have been chosen, you may be better able to resist getting angry.

Act like you can’t hear.,
Walk away without saying anything.,
Yawn instead of getting angry.,
Respond with a different topic.,
Tell an adult or other authority figure.",How to React when Someone Teases You2," One strategy to deal with teasing is to pretend like you can’t hear what they are saying in order to transform it into a joke. If they get in your face and try to force you to respond, just hold your hand to your ear and shake your head. This can turn into a funny situation, especially if you move your mouth without making a sound and perhaps pantomime being in a box or behind a wall.


Using humor can diffuse tense situations. If you show the bully how things can be funny instead of hurtful to you, they might start to leave you alone., You can try a good old fashioned cold shoulder, although this action can also carry with it an emotional reaction. If you walk away with poor posture, this makes you look defeated; or if you turn away with tears in your eyes or a flushed face, the bully will know they have gotten to you. Try to walk away with your head held high, as though the bully means nothing to you.


Act like you meant to walk away anyway.

, Looking bored can also indicate indifference to being teased. You can add crossed arms and tapping feet to show your impatience with the barrage, looking at your wrist to indicate that you don’t have time for this. Boredom shows that you aren’t bothered, and eventually a bully should move on.

, If someone approaches you with teasing behavior and you don’t want to encourage it, answer them with a comment or question that has nothing to do with their taunts. Ignoring the teasing this way shows that you aren’t interested in allowing it to take place.


Respond with a joke like, “What games do tornadoes like best? Twister!”Say a comment about something else, like an event or the weather.

, If none of these ignoring tactics work and the bully doesn’t show signs of stopping after a few days, you can tell a teacher, adult, or other authority figure (such as a boss if it is in the workplace). However, your first request of this adult is for advice, not resolution.


If you don’t solve this teasing situation yourself, it can get worse. Having someone else confront a bully on your behalf can show that it bothered you just as much as crying or getting angry in the moment.

Understand that it’s a game.,
Acknowledge that it’s fun to them.,
Recognize that it’s all about your reaction.",How to React when Someone Teases You3," Although every bully or teaser has a different reason for why they pick on someone, the reason they all choose to tease is because they see it as a game. When you react, they win the game; when you don’t react, you win. Losing isn’t very fun, which is why minimizing your reaction usually makes a bully move on.If someone is teasing you because they like you, it’s still a game, but not reacting won’t make them stop—rather, it might help them to confess their feelings of attraction and be honest with you.

, You have to understand that bullies tease because it is fun for them. It is an entertainment they engage in to make themselves feel good and forget negative feelings. They don’t always pick on others because they don’t like them or have low opinions of them. Once you see that it’s not always as personal as it sounds, this can make it easier not to let the teasing get under your skin.Ask around about your bully’s background and see if there isn’t something sad about their life. Having compassion for your bully is also a way to stop letting teasing get to you.

, It’s always important to understand that teasing is all about your reaction. When you don’t react, the game is over, and you have won. Bottom line, the best way to react when someone teases you is to not react.

Ask them why they are bullying.,
Listen objectively.,
Stay calm.,
Ask yourself if you are an enabler.,
Set boundaries with your bullying friend.,
Threaten consequences.,
Tell them how they can stop.,
Step in when you witness the behavior.,
Befriend the victim.,
Encourage them to stand up for themself.",How to Get a Friend to Stop Bullying Someone," Your friend may not even realize they are being a bully. Questioning them makes them aware of their behavior. It may also help you understand the reasoning for the behavior, which may make you stop it.For instance, you could say, “I notice that you say cruel things to that person. Why do you do that? I think it makes them feel really bad.” Letting your friend know the negative effects of what they do could make enough of an impact that they stop.;
, Don’t go into the conversation with any preconceived notions. Your friend may tell you something you had no idea about, which could help you understand their behavior. Listen with an open mind and try not to judge them before you have the conversation.For example, you may find out that they are having a difficult time with something and their behavior is actually a cry for help. Or, they could have a mental condition that you weren’t aware of. Another possibility is that your friend is acting out because they feel that they have been bullied by others.

Be empathetic to your friend’s situation if you discover the situation isn’t as clear-cut as you first thought.

, Coming at a bully aggressively will likely only cause a fight. Instead, go in with a calm manner and your chances of having a productive meeting are high. Speak calmly, take a neutral stance, and use “I” sentences.For instance, you could say, “I am concerned about the way this person is treated,” and “I am worried that you are bullying someone.” Making it about you, instead of being accusatory with something like, “You are so mean to that person,” increases your chances of getting through to the bully.

, You may help your friend get away with their behavior without even knowing it. Allowing the bullying to go on is one way of enabling. Defending your friend to others is another way. Stop your behavior now if you believe you are in fact helping the bully. It may put an end to what they’re doing., Tell your friend you do not agree with their behavior. Let them know that what they are doing is wrong. You may even want to add that you will stop being their friend if they continue with the unacceptable behavior.


For example, you could say, “I feel that what you are doing is rude and cruel. I can’t be friends with someone who treats others that way. We are going to have to go our separate ways if you don’t stop.” This type of ultimatum may be enough for the person to end their bullying., Let your friend know that you will take action against them if they continue. This may mean alerting a principal, boss, or loved one about their behavior. Taking this step may cause the end of your friendship, but you may not want to be friends with a bully anyways.


You might try saying, “I am going to let someone know about your behavior unless you stop right now.” The possibility of getting in trouble at school or with people close to them, or the risk of losing a job, may be enough to end the bullying., Your friend may be so caught up in the bullying that they don’t know how to stop. Being a bully may be their identity, and without it, they may not know how to behave. Let them know there is a way out.Help them to see that ending the bullying is nothing to be ashamed of. Stopping will make them feel better about themself, and will help their victim feel better, as well. Encourage them to end their involvement with people who may deem them as weak if they stop the bullying. Not feeling the pressure to keep up their ugly behavior may actually be a relief for them.
If your friend has been behaving this way because they see themselves as a victim of bullying, help them determine a course of action. They may need to talk to a teacher, boss, or other authority figure to improve their own circumstances.

, Confront your friend if you happen to see the bullying take place. Attempt to stop whatever you see. Ignoring the behavior means you are allowing it to occur.


For example, if you see your friend composing an email or text speaking badly about someone, try to intervene and stop them from sending it. You may also walk in between the two people if they are engaging and tell your friend to stop. Ending the behavior when it is in front of you shows your friend and their victim that you do not condone the bullying., Being a victim of bullying is lonely, isolating, and extremely difficult. They often feel they have no one in their corner. Showing the person that you are on their side may help them feel better about themself and their situation.


Tell the victim that you don’t support the way your friend is behaving. Let them know you have taken a stand against your friend and won’t stay in the friendship if they continue to act that way. You may be the only person they have on their side right now., There’s only so much you can do as an outsider of the situation. Helping them learn how to fight against the bully may be exactly what it takes to end the behavior. Your advice may be especially helpful since you are friends with the person who is bullying them.


For example, let them know that telling your friend to leave them alone may be helpful, as is ignoring the situation. You know your friend and possibly know the tactics that can work to put them in their place. Be careful not to give out information that could turn the victim into the bully. Just relay suggestions that you believe may stop the bad behavior."

Minimize your reactions.,
Give them the silent treatment.,
Pretend you can't hear them.,
Have a friend with you.",How to Ignore Bullies You Can't Get Away From1," Bullies often feed off how upset or angry they are making their target. The more they feel like they are succeeding and the more reaction they get out of you, the more they will continue.Try to make you reactions as mild as possible. It may be really difficult, especially if what they are saying or doing is hurtful.Before reacting, try slowly counting to 5 in your head.
Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, slowly breathing in and then out again.
Focus as hard as you can on some object nearby. Focus your mind by thinking of as many qualities of the object as you can (size, color, function,etc.).;
, By “silent treatment” we mean ignore their comments. You may suspect they're talking about you to their friends, but try to divert your attention somewhere else. Whatever they are saying is likely untrue and mean. If they are determined to act this way, there is little you are going to be able to say or do to stop them. Being silent is the best way to deal with rude people and you will be healthier for it.Remember that they're not worth it, and your time and energy are valuable.

, As difficult as it may be to stop yourself from listening to what they are saying, you can pretend you can't hear them.

Just act as if they are not there.

Try replacing everything they say with the word “blah” or some other word, so that when they are talking all you hear is “Blah blah blah, blah blah, blah.”
Imagine a soundproof wall between you and them. Or a soundproof box around you that keeps all the commentary out.

, Generally, bullies prefer people who are on their own, isolated, or presumed weak.It will be easier to ignore them and easier on you if you have a friend nearby to support you.

This should really be your first step in responding to the bully before you try to ignore them.


Try to talk to the bully in a one-on-one setting. This is important, as many verbal bullies feed off of bullying people in front of others. If you get them away from a crowd, they may be a lot more receptive to what you actually have to say.
Ask the bully if they’d be willing to talk to you out of earshot of other people. Say something like “I would really like to have a conversation about our relationship.”

Depending on the setting (school, workplace, or your social circle) let them know that if they don’t cease their abuse, you will contact the proper authorities.
The bully might try to belittle you or intimidate you into not contacting the authorities. Ignore these tactics and stay focused."

Take into consideration who is confronting you. Is it someone you don't like or doesn't like you? Is it someone who is known for harassing people? Is it someone who is rather close-minded on other issues, such as race, gender, sexuality, or religion? If it is, think through what you should say very carefully. If not, you may not need worry about too much.;
, Maintain a straight face, and politely ask if the other person(s) has something they'd like to say.

, When asked why you like a little girls' show, say, ""I don't see you making a big deal over other whether or not I like Powerpuff Girls, Kim Possible, Teen Titans, etc. (any kid shows that you may enjoy that is not considered unusual)."" This is to shift the logic of the confrontation.

, If it happens, which it is bound to, smile and say, ""Now who's acting like a little girl?""

, If they really want to know why you bother with My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, just shrug and say, ""Why does anyone like any TV show? It's good!""


When/if you feel they might be willing to hear an actual explanation from you, feel free to give your reasoning, whatever it might be.

, Most anti-Bronies simply can't comprehend the notion of Bronies themselves, and thus are against it. When this topic comes up, bring up other examples of products made for children that everyone can enjoy. If this doesn't work, give a few examples directly from the show to describe why you find it enjoyable.

, If there is another local Brony/Pegasister (or more), join forces to back up each others' statements, provide more examples, and give a wider perspective to anti-Bronies.

, If you are being taunted, they are definitely looking for a reaction. Be the better man. Do not give a negative reaction to sneering losers.

, In the case you are accused of being a pedophile, avoid getting angry. Do not attempt to logically reason either, because at this point the other person clearly is desperate to belittle you in any way possible; doing so will only be disregarded. Instead, reply with something sarcastic, like, ""Want some free candy? I've got a van out back.""

, If they say something along the lines of, ""Can you believe they watch My Little Pony?"", grin and respond with, ""Your loss. You're missing out.""

, If it's not a big deal to you, it will soon cease to be a big deal to them.

Or, are you being harassed for a silly reason, such as the fact that you wear braces? If so, recognize that the bully is attacking you just because the bully feels s/he can. They also want attention and enjoy the fact that they have the power to hurt others. Read below for more tips on how to deal with these qualities in the typical bully.;
, Talk to your best friends or your parents first, and tell them about the problem. They may have some advice for the first steps to take. Don't be afraid to get your teachers involved if you aren't able to put a stop to the bullying on your own and/or with others that you talked with.

, It's very important to have people standing by your side at school. When many people stand up for you and defend you, bullies are afraid to play bad tricks on you. You don't need an army. It really only takes one or two strong allies to make a positive difference. They should be friends, and if they are a true friend, they will stand up for you in no time, no matter who the bully is. The same goes with you.

, Try to have funny, witty replies if bullies make fun of you. Don't be afraid to speak your mind. If you give them a good reply, they may be too intimidated to speak again to you. Example: They draw a picture of you, and the picture is ugly. Say: ""Haha! That's a funny picture!""
Avoidance. If you're not witty or funny, just avoid them. Don't talk to them, don't show them that you care about the things they say. Soon they will become bored with your lack of response and stop annoying you.

, For instance, if they make a comment on the fact that your hair looks messy, you can say, ""Thanks for reminding me to brush it""!

, The aim is to make you angry, so don't give bullies the pleasure of seeing you getting cross. The more reaction they get, the better these people like picking on you. If you show less interest, they will follow suit soon.

, Are you big, compared to the bullies? Or are you small, skinny, etc. Bullies are often only interested in bullying someone who can be bullied - see? If you appear weak physically, that may make you a target, but even a bigger person can be picked on if a bully senses that the bigger person is afraid or timid. If you are small: Avoidance may be your best bet, but you can also try ""seeming bigger"" (try the next suggestion). Even if you are big talk to a faculty or an older friend and let them know that you are being bothered. Responding by any form of aggression will make you an ally in the longer scheme of things. Never show aggression even if it was only intended as a show. Usually in situations it is hard to maintain emotional control and things get worse. The only way to put an end to the chain reaction is to step away calmly from the situation but surely reporting it to more mature people who can help you.

, This will increase your self confidence in handling such situations with even greater emotional poise. But never use your strength to bully in reverse. If attacked you have the right to defend yourself.

Walk away.,
Stay calm.,
Do not offer an apology.,
Limit your interaction with them.",How to Reply to Someone Who Hates You1," Walking away from a confrontation with someone who hates you does not mean that you are admitting defeat or accepting the reality that a perfect solution cannot be reached. Instead, it demonstrates that you have complete control over the situation by not engaging in their negativity.Haters never offer constructive criticism or positive feedback, only criticism. If you already know this then there is absolutely no reason to have a dialogue with them.
Listening to a hater will only ruin your day. All of the negativity will do is hurt your feelings, make you angry, or incite you to participate in the pessimism.;
, A hater will get under your skin whenever they can. It is important to stay calm when this happens so that a physical confrontation does not occur. Stay level headed and understand that a hater does not deserve a response from you, especially in retaliation.By staying calm and not responding to their attacks you demonstrate that their opinions and destructive comments are not valued by you. Over time, this should reveal to them that attacking your character is a waste of time.
Remaining calm will conserve your energy for more positive pursuits. Do not waste your time or energy on a situation that does not deserve your attention.

, Since a hater will seek out negativity and place undue criticism on you don’t submit to their turpitude. They will want you to explain your mistakes in front of others to reveal your imperfect self. In response, never justify, explain, or apologize to them until they approach you in a respectful and sensible manner.Value your self-worth and don’t degrade yourself to their level unless they treat you with the respect you deserve as a person.
In this case, it is probably unwise to reply with a smart comment or to try and play it off as nothing important because it gives them an opportunity to turn the tables again on you for not addressing their accusation to begin with. Let them embarrass themselves without help.

, This might be difficult to do if you work with this person or have to deal with them on a daily basis, but you can take steps to limit your exposure to them. By limiting face time, it will reduce how many times a day you have to take evasive action or submit yourself to their hate.Simple changes to your daily schedule will throw the timing off just enough to help you avoid the hater. Try taking your breaks at work as different times; come home later in the day or leave earlier in the morning if the hater is your neighbor or roommate; or stay in different rooms of the house during holidays if the hater is an extended family member.
In each of these cases, if you come into contact with the hater then either politely excuse yourself and exit the area or try to keep things neutral and unemotional if you must interact with them. Avoid bringing up topics that provide an opportunity for the hater to become negative towards you.

, You can't triple your strength overnight, can you?

, Don't provoke one, just do this if they provoke you, not the other way around.

,, You need the basics, because a fight will last a little less than 5 minutes.

,, That is how long a LONG fight is, because, 10 minutes is hard, and most fights are powered in adrenaline AND the initial strength.

, No more though, and punching the bag counts.

, If things go well, 2 weeks passed by now. You have the stamina, and the strength, knock the bag down, and it proves you have more.

, You need more stamina, a fight is very tiring AND painful.

, That is all you need, a fight is nowhere near 20 minutes, 10 can be supplied with adrenaline.

, You can now knock the first bag, so get another, and master this one too. Your strength has improved a bit.

, This tells me that your strength has increased by 2x. If things go well, you should have 3 months and a half left.

, You still need to not be tired, because your strength will lower. 3 months and a week left. Stamina should be 6x as before, so tiring won't be a deal.

, You need another bag, the old bag is too weak. Congrats!

, If you can, your strength is x3 from the start. Maybe you can defeat one guy you fight. 2 and a half months left.

, Your punch needs to be stronger.

, Then fill it with sand, and guess what, 4x strength power. 2 month left.

, Then get a new bag or so, 4.5x strength. 1 and a half months left.

, Your punch is now 6x stronger, and spend a month or so on it. You can knock a sixth grader down! You are not anywhere near stronger than an adult!

, Hit the bag with a ""almost knock you down punch"" then block it, you have the strength and endurance, now you need to block it, for a week.

, Dodging is a lot harder than blocking, and consumes more energy, and your ready for the fight, practice for a week.

, The dude and/or his gang still bullies you? The next time he does it, tell him to stop, and if he doesn't say something like ""dude, lets just be friends"", and if he still doesn't stop, keep calm and say ""I really hate it when you harass me"", and if he still doesn't stop, go to the next step.

, Telling on him is not a good idea, and doesn't get them busted. Use it as a last resort. Teachers in my experience don't do anything, except talk to them, so they keep on doing it. This is called not learning.Some people don't learn, so if they don't learn, continue.

, Tell him to do it 1 on 1 if he is a real man, but probably he will bring his gang with him. Do not act dirty, it will make you lose respect, and you shouldn't depend on a teacher to come, although it is better if they do, before someone is hurt.

, If he doesn't come, he's scared of you, a bully usually doesn't fight back, plus you got muscles, not many elementary people can punch 110 lb. If he apologizes, then accept it. If he fights, then go to the next step.


If he comes alone, just use this tactic: dodge, rapid strike, many strikes, finishing blow, do not injure him, just make him too hurt to be aggressive, and help him get up and wash him or something.






If he comes with a gang. Fight them like a one on one, but pay attention to the gang, and focus at one guy at a time, so they don't recover, then watch them.
You fight, gang or alone and are getting pummeled, then run. Run and try to go somewhere, and even though your reputation is low, you still shouldn't avoid the hospital.

,, It will be ""talking"" 12 or so times, to ""detention"" to ""suspension"" finally to ""expelled"", if he doesn't stop.

Don't worry if you don't feel close with any of your teachers, or even like any of them. In this situation it isn't about who likes who, it's about you being a victim of bullying and the teacher will put any disputes they have with you aside in this situation. It's their job to be responsible for students and do whatever they can to ensure all students have the best possible experience whilst in education. Without bullying.;
, Make sure you know your teacher is going to be in, and that other students aren't going to be around. Perhaps after school/college/university, after a lesson, before break/lunch, etc.  


You don't want other students to hear otherwise this could cause gossip and other un-wanted situations, so it's best to do it in private.

, Is your friend being bullied too? Then it's best they go with you as this will make it easier.


Discuss the situation with your friend and persuade them to raise the issue with your chosen teacher with you. Assure them it will be worth the outcome.
Whether your friend is being bullied or not, still ask them to go with you if you feel comfortable enough to talk about it with them present. Having support will make the situation a lot less nerve-wrecking for you.
If you still feel too nervous, perhaps ask your friend to do the talking for you until you feel comfortable enough to speak for yourself.
Don't worry if you don't have a friend to go with. Having a friend is not necessary and the teacher will treat you and the situation no differently.

, If you suffer from anxiety and/ or other similar conditions, maybe confronting your teacher is still out of the question. Find out the school/college/university number and contact them when possible.


Make sure to check whether they are open at the time you plan on ringing them.
When you've phoned up, simply ask to speak to the teacher you wish to and hopefully something can be arranged when your teacher is available to speak over the phone.

, Try to give the teacher the best description you can about the bullies as the teacher may not know who they are. For instance:


How old they are/What age group they're in.
Are there various different bullies, or just one/group of people?

, Try to think of all the issue's occurring that you want to mention to your teacher. Write a list to help you remember, as talking on the spot to your teacher may make it easy to forget things (optional). These are some common examples of bullying that you might need to mention:


Racism
Hate crime
Slander (Rumours)
Sexism
Stalking
Harassment (Towards people of disabilities, etc)
Sexual Harassment
Religious beliefs
Social Status (some people, sadly, get picked on for being less wealthy than their peers)

, How have your bully/bullies been bullying you? Try to describe what's been happening the best way you can. Give your teacher an example of a recent event that has happened with the bully/bullies. For instance, ""Last night I received constant text's from *Insert name*..."" and so on. Answer to yourself the following bullet points and inform your teacher whichever one's are relevant to you:


Is there a main culprit? Or are the bullies all equally as bad as each other?
What type(s) of bullying has been going on? (Verbal, physical, social, cyber, etc)
When and where does it happen? Is it off school/college grounds, after class, at lunch/break? etc. All of these things matter as changes need to be made to prevent the bullying from continuing. So informing your teacher when and where issues have been taking place is necessary.

, Has bullying caused other personal issues for you? Make sure to tell your teacher as they may be able to give you the help you need, or advice on what to do, such as going to the doctors. Here's a list of common issues that occur to victims of bullying:


Mental health/emotional problems (Being depressed, anxiety, etc)
Anti-social
Physical Injuries
Low self-esteem
Addiction
Relationship troubles

Evaluate past interactions.,
Understand that this is not your problem.,
Change your perspective.",How to Reply to Someone Who Hates You2," Think about your past interactions with the hater. There might be absolutely nothing you can do but you might discover their hate is rooted in a single conversation, action, or event that could easily be rectified. This does not mean that you have to make an effort to resolve the problem; rather, it will allow you to identify the source of hate and provide you with the knowledge of how better to live your life around the hater if you choose.People are often quick to judgment and perhaps there was a bad first impression left by you. If so, try to re-approach them and let the hater get to know you a little better. Their attitude might change.
The same can be said about shyness. Some people mistake shyness as rudeness. Make an effort to at least say hello or good morning. This will at least prove you are not ignoring them.
You might illustrate your success in way that another person might perceive as boastful. Or, they might be jealous of your achievement because they lack the traits necessary to attain the same success. In this case, you might want to tone down your triumphs for the sake of peace.
Joking or horsing around could also lead to issues with haters. Some people don’t like to see others enjoying life when they are miserable or they might not be part of the “in” crowd and resent it. Either try to include everybody in the fun or simply cut it out when the hater is present.

, The issue the hater has with you is their problem and not yours. The quicker you realize this the quicker you can come to peace with the situation. Indeed, most haters have no real basis for their animosityThe most direct way of dealing with the problem is to ask them what their problem with you is if they have not already made it clear. If it is their own personal problem, tell them to seek help and leave you out of it.
It is important to remember that hurt people hurt people. Have you ever met a happy, well-adjusted person hurt you or somebody else? Of course not because they don’t waste their time being negative and hurtful.
Don’t take on a hater’s vicious criticism. Since they spend so much time trying to destroy your image they spend less time being creative and constructive. Avoid their problems so that you can move forward with your life.

, As a person, no matter if you ignore the hater or not, you will still probably wonder why they are giving you such a hard time. In order to come to some type of conclusion, think about the situation from a different perspective. Look at it from a third person’s point of view and find the source of the problem. Seeing the situation from a new angle will help you rationalize their hate on a deeper level.No matter how much you try to avoid it, there could have actually been something you did to make a hater dislike you. As hard as that can be to accept, try to put yourself in their shoes and consider what issues they might be dealing with.

Detach yourself emotionally.,
Remain positive.,
Strengthen your self-confidence.",How to Reply to Someone Who Hates You3," Until you detach yourself from the harassment of a hater, your life will be consumed by willfulness, fear, or discomfort, none of which makes for a happy existence. You never want to give up on somebody in life, but sometimes you have to prioritize your relationships and what fits your lifestyle. A relationship with a hater is usually toxic, draining, and unhealthy. In an already busy world, these are surely three things that you do without.Life is fragile and it is important to surround yourself with healthy and supportive people who care about you. Make sure to seek out friends and family when dealing with a hater to support you through the experience.
When dealing with a hater, make sure you spend time everyday building up your emotional stamina by performing relaxation exercises, focus on your goals, and be social. This will help ease your mind and reduce your anger and anxiety towards the hater.

, Remain positive by doing the things you love and engaging with the people you care about. This will distract you from the situation and help you find your inner peace. You might even want to be nice or friendly to the hater. It is generally harder to hate somebody who is consistently friendly and makes an effort to include everybody. In other words, give them fewer reasons to hate you.Keep your energy focused in a positive direction and ignore the negative dialogue that the hater is trying to fill your mind with. Try image training. Think of a happy time, your favorite picture, or a movie role you cast yourself in and think about these things when you are being harassed by the hater.
Take what the hater says with a grain of salt. Whatever a hater says, no matter how close to the truth as they twist it, never take it to heart. Just let it bounce off your skin and forgive and forget.
Keep a list of your positive traits and accomplishments. If a haters becomes too harsh or overbearing, get the list out and think about all of the positive contributions you made to society to wash out the negative commentary.

, The more you build your self-confidence the more able you are to overcome the obstacles in front of you. Self-confidence gives you the power to look at all situations in a positive way even with haters. The stronger your self-confidence is the less likely a hater can hurt you emotionally. Don’t allow the hater to make you a victim.When you meet with friends and family try to engage with positive enthusiasm. Instead of languishing with the problems and haters in your life, keep your focus on solutions and achieving goals.
Make sure you are exhibiting positive body language and exuding confidence. Somebody who is always smiling and making friendly eye contact is harder to hate.
Always be prepared to deal with a hater. The more prepared you are the better you will handle yourself and the situation.

Understand what a bully is.,
Consider whether the bully turns all your friends against you.,
Look out for the sign of criticizing.,
See if the bully involves his/her friends.,
Don't accept physical abuse.,
Don't ignore your missing things.,
Understand that the bully will always point out your mistakes.",How to Tell if Someone Is a Bully at School1," A bully is offensive, abusive, intimidating, threatening and humiliating, undermining your self-confidence . Ask yourself a few questions:


Does the bully make you feel frightened, upset or extremely uncomfortable in any way? Bullying doesn't just have to be physical abuse. Acts of bullying include spiteful comments, gossiping to others about you or simply anything that makes you personally feel upset that the bully does on purpose.
Is the bully nasty to you, then goes running to a teacher stating that you're the nasty one? Putting people with authority on the bully's side is a major sign of bullying.;
, This is a horrible happening that can leave you with severely damaged confidence. This is definitely bullying. Always remember that it is not you at fault; it is always the bully.

, The bully will criticize everything you say. This bullying behavior can leave you feeling depressed. If this happens, just ignore them, because they're just looking to start an argument.

, Having them obviously gossiping about you, exchanging looks at everything you say, and backing each other up when insulting you is horrible and unacceptable. Involving other people in order to insult you is bullying and should not be tolerated.

, Shoving you when you go past, tripping you up, throwing things at you, and pinching are all acts of bullying. Always tell someone in the first incidents of these - there could always be a time when the bully goes too far, and you end up with a major wound and not just bruises.

, Maybe your stuff is being hidden and every day turns into one big treasure hunt. This isn't just bullying; it is a crime, especially if your stuff has cost a lot of money.


98% of the time, it isn't you just losing stuff, especially if you have no unusual history of losing stuff. Make a list of the things that have gone missing and show your parents. This is important because you don't want to get into trouble for losing things that you haven't lost.

, The bully will not only point them out, but spread it all over your school as well. Don't let him or her put you down.


Bullies always put you down. They would say some things which would make you feel depressed. Simply ignore them and look at your good sides.

Understand playful teasing.,
Know different types of teasing.,
Know when it’s okay to tease.,
Notice the tone of the statements.,
Identify hurtful teasing.,
Control the outcome.",How to Tell Teasing and Bullying Apart1," It’s common for siblings or teammates to tease others as a way to poke fun of them in a lighthearted or funny way. If someone teases you as a way to be silly or gently poke fun of you, this should be playful and fun. Teasing can foster feelings of affection or closeness. Ideally, the teasing should occur in a relationship where both people can appreciate the teasing and the person being teased is not distressed.If you’re teasing someone, make sure that they are smiling or laughing.;
, Generally, there are two types of teasing. The first, endearment teasing, is a way to bond over something small or silly. For example, if someone is very dressed up or looking especially put together, you might say, “You got a big date tonight?” Influence teasing might include correcting a behavior, like pointing out to someone that they are speaking with their mouth full.Influence teasing can help to change someone’s behavior without being critical. Instead, it helps to make light of the situation.

, There are some times when it’s okay to tease and other times when it is not okay. For example, don’t tease someone you just met or barely know. If you want to tease someone, make sure you have a relationship with them. Appropriate teasing might happen in a casual social situation, like while friends are hanging out and relaxing.If you’re teasing someone, be ready for them to tease you back!

, Teasing should be done in a joking or affectionate tone, not a violent or aggressive tone. The person teasing shouldn’t be trying to be controversial or mean to the person and everything should be in good fun. It should be harmless and not cause someone to feel bad or insecure. It should never feel aggressive.The tone of the conversation shouldn’t escalate or become tense following teasing.

, There is a fine line between teasing that is considered acceptable and the kind that is considered controversial. It is important to avoid the controversial kind of teasing. Hurtful teasing may not always be intentional, but it can be hurtful nonetheless. For example, harmful teasing includes making fun of someone’s ethnicity, disability, religious or spiritual beliefs, or looks. If you know that someone feels self-conscious about something (like their teeth, hair, car, weight, or money), don’t tease them about this, as this teasing makes them feel bad or insecure.If you tease someone and mean for it to be funny yet they seem upset, apologize immediately. Say that you did not mean to hurt their feelings. Say, “I’m really sorry. I didn’t know that would hurt you. I won’t do it again.”
If you’re a parent and overhear hurtful teasing, say, “It’s not nice to talk like that.”

, It is very important to be direct with the person who is making the remarks if you do not like the behavior. If you’re being teased and you ask the person to stop, the person is often quick to cut it out. With teasing, people tend to be more respectful of boundaries and wanting a positive outcome. Because the comments are not meant to be hurtful, you can influence whether they continue or not. If you say, “Hey, I don’t like that,” the person should stop teasing you.A simple, “I don’t find that funny” can stop teasing fairly quickly.
As a parent, you can say, “We don’t talk like that. Please stop.”

Stay safe.",How to Tell Someone to Leave You Alone," If you want to tell someone who means well to leave you alone, then it’s important to find a nice, quiet place to do it. Whether the person is someone who has a crush on you or just an annoying classmate, if you feel comfortable around the person, then you should try to tell him or her in a quiet place where you can be alone without the threat of someone coming in and asking what’s happening. You should also find a time when the person you want to talk to isn’t distracted, busy, or stressed out, so the conversation goes as well as it can.


Though it’s important to find a good place and time if you care about the person you’re talking to, you also shouldn’t wait around forever for the perfect time to come along. It’s important to get the message across so you can both move on with your lives.
If you feel more comfortable having a friend there for support, then that’s fine too. Don’t put yourself in an uncomfortable situation if you’d rather not be alone with the person.;
, Once you get the person alone, it’s important to be open and honest about the fact that you want to be left alone. If the person has a crush on you and you don’t return those feelings, then say so. If the person is your neighbor or classmate who always wants to hang out and you’re just not interested, then get the point across. Say it loud and clear so there can be no mistake that you just don’t want to see the person.


For example, if the person is a girl who has a crush on you, you can say, “I’m sorry that I don’t return your feelings. I’m flattered, but I’d like to be on my own.”
If the person is an annoying person who keeps trying to hang out with you, just say, “I’m sorry, but I’m just not interested in spending time with you. I thought you should know.”
If the person has actually done things to annoy you or make your life difficult or if you’ve already given him or her a few chances, then you can say this to get the message across.
If you’re nervous about what to say here, then practice in advance.

, It’s natural to be a little bit, or very, upset when you have this kind of conversation. However, if you want to get the message across, then the best thing you can do is try to remain calm and keep your wits about you. If you feel yourself getting emotional, take a deep breath, and give yourself some time to return to your senses. If you keep your cool, then the person will see that he can’t mess with you and that he should take you seriously.


You want to look like you have it together. If need to take deep breaths or even need to excuse yourself for a minute to get the message across, then don’t be afraid to do so.
If the other person gets mad and says things to taunt you or make you upset, don’t let it get to you. Don’t stoop to that person’s level and fight back and take the high road instead.

, Though you may think it’s better to make excuses to soften the blow, if you say things like, “Now is not a good time for me” or “I’m just not ready to date, but I really like you,” then you’ll just be giving the person false hope. Instead of doing this, telling the person that you’re honestly not interested will make it much more likely that the person will get the message and will leave you alone. And what’s more, you won’t be hurting the person’s feelings as much.


Of course it’ll be easier to make an excuse in the moment than to be direct. But if you do that, then you won’t be getting the message across and the person will come right back to you.
If someone is just plain mean to you, you can say so. Say, “I don’t want to hang out with you anymore because you always end up making fun of me. I really don’t appreciate it and would like to be left alone.”

, If the person is genuinely nice, then you shouldn’t try to hurt his or her feelings more than you need to. It can be tricky to find a balance between getting your point across and being sensitive, but you should work to make it clear you don’t want to spend time with the person without name-calling or being insulting. You want to be better than that. Besides, you want to end the relationship, whatever it may be, not fuel the fire and lead the person to keep bothering you for even longer.


If a girl likes you and you don’t return her feelings, you can be honest about the fact that you don’t feel the same way without explaining that she’s just not your type and that you like girls who are taller, or saying that you think she’s annoying.
If the person is a younger sibling, while you can’t get him or her to leave you alone forever, you can say something like, “I’d really like some privacy while I hang out with my friends. You’re getting in the way right now.”

, If you respect the person and he or she has something to say, then you should give him and her the chance to talk. As long as the person is emotionally stable and just genuinely likes you a lot, he or she may want you to listen for a little while. If you want to be nice, then give the person this allowance, taking the time to really pay attention. Though you shouldn’t make this last more than a few minutes, if you care about the person even a little bit, then can take this time to listen.


Don’t interrupt or offer your own opinions. Wait for the person to say what he or she has to say, respond as kindly as you can, and get ready to end the conversation.

, Before you end the conversation, it’s important to ask the person if he’s clear on the fact that you are to be left alone. You want to make sure that your words had a lasting effect and that your message was received loud and clear. You can even see if the person will repeat that he’ll leave you alone so he sees that you’re serious and that you weren’t just having the conversation for fun.


Before you leave the conversation, you should make sure that the person understanding in no uncertain terms that you are to be left alone.

, If the conversation has gone reasonably well, then try to end it on a good note. Thank the person for hearing you out and understanding that you want to be left alone. This conversation was likely pretty difficult for both of you, and you should try to wrap it up positively, given the context. Of course, it can’t be too positive if you’re asking to be left alone, but you can try to be as nice as possible.


Though you may not feel like saying thank you, it’s only polite, and it may lead you to have a better understanding with the other person.

, If the person has really been bothering you and you don’t want to be alone with him or her, then you should get a few friends, an older sibling, or even a parent or teacher to go with you when you ask to be left alone. If you’re genuinely afraid for your own well-being, then you should make sure not to be left alone with the person when you have this difficult conversation so you can feel safe and confident.If the person is a bully, then having your friends there with you can make a big impact on your confidence. Though you may try to settle it yourself first, if that hasn't worked, having your friends around can make a difference.
Your friends or siblings should be there for support, but you should do as much of the talking as you can, to show that you can stick up for yourself.

, If you really need to be firm, then you shouldn’t make small talk but should come right out and say it. Just say, “Leave me alone” or “Please leave me alone from now on.” Though this won’t be pleasant, the sooner you get the message across, the better. If this is someone whom you really need to be firm with, then you shouldn’t waste time on small talk.


Look the person right in the eye and show that you’re not afraid. If you look down at the ground, then you’ll look intimidated.
Speak slowly and clearly. Make sure your words are heard loud and clear.

, Make sure you’re saying these words in no uncertain terms. Don’t say “go away,” “not now” or “I’m busy,” but make it clear that you want to be left alone at all times, for good. Though it won’t feel great to say these words, it’ll be far better than being wishy washy and making the person think you’d be up to seeing him or her again. If you’re struggling with being direct, have the friends with you help get the message across.


It should take more than a minute to say what you have to say. Just a few clear sentences on wanting to be left alone will do the trick. If the person is a bully or just not worth your time, then there’s no need to explain why you want to be left alone; that should be obvious.

, The person may have some excuses for why he doesn’t want to leave you alone or how he thought he was just helping you out or thought that you really liked him, deep down. If you’re serious about wanting to be left alone, then you should make it clear that you won’t take these excuses and aren’t open to having a debate or a conversation. You’ve made your point and want to move on.


If the person is a bully who keeps insulting you, just walk away. There’s no reason to listen to that.

, If the person really doesn’t seem like he or she is getting it, then you can start bringing on the consequences. Say that you’ll talk to your parents, the person’s parents, your teachers, your school administrators, or even the police if the person really does not listen to you. It’s important that the person knows that this cannot drag on any longer and that you mean business.


The more specific you are, the better. If you can name specific teachers or administrators you will tell, then that will scare the person off much more effectively. If you plan on telling your parents, you can say that you can pick up the phone and call your dad at work, right now. Make the person see that you’ve put a lot of thought into him leaving you alone and he will be scared off.

, If the person really won’t go away, then you should talk to your parents about it. Let them know that you’re feeling threatened, or just really, really annoyed by the person who won’t leave you alone. You may be a little embarrassed telling your parents about it if the person really has a crush on you, but they can help you get rid of the annoying person and deal with the situation. They can make you feel safer and can even take further action to limit your contact with the person.


Your parents will know what to do and you’ll be safe in their hands. They’ll appreciate the fact that you went to them with your problem and will feel responsible for you.
You shouldn’t look for the perfect time to tell them. Just make sure they’re not busy or about to run off to work and sit them down and have the conversation. And if it really can’t wait, then tell them what’s up.

, Your friends can also be a big help in this situation. Not only can they be around you more when you think the person who won’t leave you alone will be there, but they can also help tell the person to leave you alone and will discourage him or her from following you around.


Your true friends will be there for you through thick and thin and will understand that you’re in a tricky situation. They’ll make sure to spend more time with you and will see to it that you’re never alone if you’re feeling unsafe.
If your friends are always with you, then the person will lose interest, whether he has a crush on you or wants to taunt you.
Your friends can also help you see what the best course of action is. If the person you want to be rid of is a real bully, then they’ll tell you that you need to get more help than they can provide.

, If you gossip about the person or keep talking about how he won’t leave you alone, then it’ll get back to him. Not only will this make him angry or even more persistent, but he may even have the idea that you really do like him or want him to come around. If you didn’t, then why would you keep talking him? If you really want to make it seem like you want to be left alone, then you should just drop the subject as much as you can.


You can confide in your close friends about what’s happening and ask for their advice, but you should avoid telling just about anyone who comes your way about the situation, or the person will hear all about it.

, If the person is really persistent and follows you around or keeps pestering you everywhere you go, then it may be time to get your teachers or your administrators involved. Tell them that the situation has gotten out of control and see what punitive measures they can take to keep you safe from the other person. Having an adult involved can sometimes change the person’s mind and will help him take your threats seriously.


Don’t be nervous about it, especially if you’re dealing with a bully. You should talk to these authority figures as soon as possible so measures can be taken.
If the person is a bully, then he’ll threaten you and will say that you’ll be in trouble if you tell your teachers or administrators. However, these are empty threats. It’s much better to tell people what’s going on and to stay safe.

, If you’ve tried everything and have even gotten parents and administrators involved, then you can work on changing your routine to avoid the person for a little while. Though you shouldn’t have to change your life too much to suit the other person, if you’re reaching your last resort, then you can work on avoiding places where the person is likely to be. This can mean hanging out in a new part of the park, going to a different movie theatre, or discovering a new restaurant with your friends. As the person loses interest, you can go back to your old life.


You don’t have to change absolutely everything you do. But if walking to school a new way leads you to avoid the person who is bothering you, then it may be worth it.

, Though ignoring a person isn’t the most mature way to get him or her to leave you alone, if you’ve tried having a conversation, telling other people, and even avoiding him or her, then this may be something you have to try. If that person walks by and says something mean to you or smiles at you, act like he or she doesn’t exist. If that person somehow makes it into a group conversation you’re having, casually walk away. If you end up in the same coffee shop, get out of there without causing a scene. Though this may not feel great, it can help to get the message across.


If the person sees that his words or presence don’t affect you or make you upset and that you couldn’t really care about what he or she says, then he’ll lose interest. And if you leave every time he or she shows up, then that will grow old, too, which is exactly what you want.

, If you’re dealing with a person who won’t leave you alone and that person is threatening to you, then the most important thing is that you stay safe. The person may be more than annoying and may even be emotionally unstable, and you should make sure that you feel safe and protected at all times. While you shouldn’t stay at home all day for fear of running into the person, you should make sure that you’ve taken measures to protect yourself from this person, even if this means contacting the authorities.


It’s not worth it to risk your safety just for your pride. If you genuinely feel like you’re in danger, you should absolutely say something as soon as you can.

Tell an adult.,
Be firm.,
Stick up for yourself.,
Walk away when the bully is being nasty to you.,
Stay positive.",How to Tell if Someone Is a Bully at School2," It does sound cliché, and you've been hearing this advice for all your school life, but it's valid advice. Remember, this is the only way you can win with bullying.


If you know that the bullying will get worse if you tell someone, be sure to consider this and tell someone again straight away if the bully continues. If your school has a bad bullying system, then always confide in your parents. If the bullying gets bad enough, you and your parents might consider leaving the school.
Ask for help of an adult if you are being bullied. An adult can help you to fight them or can help you to complain.

, Don't be a mouse; this is what the bully wants. If the bully insults you, tell them firmly to stop it, because if it continues you will go to a teacher.

, Never let bullies put you down.

, This works best when the bully is attention-seeking. Ignoring also might work, but not to the extent that you ignore the whole situation entirely.

, If the bully harasses you, speak up. Try asking him or her to stop his or her behavior.

Stay calm at all times.,
Ask your child for more details about the situation.,
Ask your child why he or she thinks he or she treated the other child this way.,
Help your child find alternative ways of interacting.,
Set a positive example.,
Have your child apologize to the classmate the next day.,
Remind your child what bullying is in the first place.,
Be firm about consequences.,
Talk to your child's teacher routinely.",How to Talk to Your Child Who Bullied a Classmate," You may feel angry at your child for bullying, and that is normal, but you should still try to maintain your composure and listen actively and calmly as your child opens up to you more about the situation.;
, You will want to know what the name of the other child is, what grade he/she is in, whether the two of them have any classes together, and how the victim reacted after being bullied, if your child knows (did he/she tell a trusted adult? Did he/she report the incident?).


It's also useful if you know about the severity of the situation; while you don't want to condone any poor behavior, your reaction is likely to be different if the situation involves some mutual, light teasing, as opposed to any physical violence or ongoing verbal or emotional abuse. Match the seriousness of your discussion to the seriousness of the incident.
""Bullying"" won't mean the same thing to all people. Stay away from using that term directly at first, and try to get your child's account of the facts. Both sides will have a story to tell, and both stories should be taken with a grain of salt, but it's important to get a clear account of what your child thinks happened, and how he or she reacted to it.
Ask your child specific questions, like ""What did he/she say?"" and ""What did you do then?"" and ""How did that make you feel?"" Get the full story of what your child recalls happening and how he or she felt about it; you may never know all of the details from a neutral standpoint, but it's important to understand your child's perspective.

, Maybe he or she was bullied by the same person and wanted to get revenge? Maybe the two of them are ""enemies"" and hate each other? Maybe your child didn't realize the impact he or she had on the other child? Maybe he or she was feeling depressed and lashed out because of those feelings?


Avoid leading questions, since these can become excuses if your child is looking for an ""out"" from the responsibility. However, keep an open mind about where your child is coming from; if there's a history of bad behavior between the two children, it may explain the lead-up to the current situation. A history of tension does not excuse an act of bullying, but it may put into context a difficult relationship that both parties are at least somewhat responsible for.

, Ask your child what he or she could have done differently. If something in particular set him or her off or made him or her lash out, ask what your child could have told instead; structure your discussion in a way that helps you child discover the ""right"" answer (for example, telling a teacher, getting a parent involved, or simply walking away).


If there was no clear catalyst to the event, talk to your child about ways he or she can channel the energy of a bad mood or unhappiness. Suggest that if he or she doesn't want to be around someone in particular, your child can just go elsewhere and avoid that person, rather than lashing out. Equip your child with ideas for solo activities to engage in until he or she feels better. For example, if your child is on the playground, he or she can get out some energy by running or playing ball, or spend some quiet time alone reading a book or drawing. Help your child find out what activities improve his or her mood and avoid bad behavior.
Do some role-playing. A lot of tense social interactions become easier with practice. Act the parts out with your child, and take turns being your child and the other kid. Have a go at egging each other on and even teasing/needling one another, so that your child can practice more calm and productive ways of dealing with that kind of tension. Help him or her practice how to take the higher road and walk away, rather than retaliating or bullying. Give your child some firm but respectful words to use when a game or social interaction moves towards a fight or altercation, like ""I don't want to do this anymore. I'll see you around.""

, One of the best ways you can teach your child to interact positively and supportively is by doing so yourself. Even in a situation like this, where you're upset with your child, don't lash out at him or her; be supportive and understanding. Make sure you're listening actively, and let your child know he or she is being understood. Even if you stand firm on how unacceptable bullying is (and you should!), you can still express some understanding for how your child was feeling. Be fair and kind but firm; this kind of approach will help show your child how he or she can handle disagreements and take a higher road, even when others are disrespectful.

, You could tell your child to apologize in person or write a letter stating how sorry he/she is. If you have him/her write a letter, review it and make suggested edits before he or she passes it to the child in question. Review it just to make sure he or she does not use bad language, ""non-apology apologies"", etc.

, By definition, bullying is using superior strength or influence to harm or intimidate those who are weaker. Reiterate that bullying is never okay, no matter how much smaller the other person is, no matter how much one hates another, or no matter how depressed/hopeless one is feeling.


The term ""bullying"" itself might be a loaded one, if it's used in the disciplinary context a lot at school. If your child objects to the use of that label, explain gently that it doesn't matter what you call it, so much as how you treat other people. Give your child a rule of thumb: ""Treat others how you want to be treated."" Whether or not your child considers what he or she did bullying, ask him/her whether it was how he/she would want to be treated by someone else. If not, that's his or her sign to avoid that kind of behavior in future.

, You want to be understanding when it comes to your child's feelings and help him or her navigate through any difficult relationships at school; however, even while offering this support, you want to be absolutely clear that bullying, disrespecting, or abusing others is not an option. Tell your child that he or she will be punished if he/she does it again, and that you will work with his/her teacher to make sure guidelines and expectations are consistent both at school and at home. Consequences could include being grounded, having his/her electronic devices taken away and being deprived of sweets.

, Check in to see if there have been further incidents that need to be addressed where your child has been bullying others. Get to know the other child's parents, if appropriate, and check in with one another about how the relationship is going. The more you can communicate with everyone involved, the better.

Recognize types of bullying.,
Notice a hostile tone.,
Identify an imbalance of power.,
Recognize that bullying is meant to hurt.,
Identify repeated offenses.",How to Tell Teasing and Bullying Apart2," Bullying may include social alienation, physical force (such as hitting, punching, kicking, or throwing), verbal aggression (such as yelling, name-calling, taunting), or intimidation. A bully may make threats, spread gossip or rumors, or make racial slurs.These actions may occur in person, through social media, texts, or phone calls.
If you’re a parent, your child’s mood may change or they may start acting out. Ask them how things are going and if they’re having any problems with peers.

, A bully’s remarks cannot be interpreted as playful, funny, or silly. The words are meant to harm and likely are said in a mean or angry tone. A bully may do something to make a person feel small while trying to feel big. Bullying is an attack on someone.Unlike teasing, there is nothing affectionate or playful about a bully’s words or actions.

, With teasing, a person who teases should expect to be teased right back. With bullying, however, the bully intends to be the one in control. The bully may have more power among peers than the person being bullied. Also, the bullying may occur as a bid for power, or as a way to show others that they have more power than another.For example, someone with money might make fun of someone who is poor. This is not playful and is done to show a power or status difference.

, A bully is intentional in trying to hurt someone else. Bullying is meant to hurt, not be playful. The bully says something or does something in order to embarrass or humiliate the person. The comments or actions are intended to make someone feel low or bad.A bully may point out something that makes the person different. For example, a bully may say something about a disability, stutter, or difficulty with a school subject.

, A bully may continue to pick on someone, even after they’ve shown that they want it to stop. If someone says that they want the bullying to stop, the bully may enjoy taunting the person or make fun of them feeling embarrassed. Bullying may happen every day on the bus, after school, or during classes.With teasing, a person will often stop if asked. A bully, however, may continue the bullying well after someone has told them to stop.

"
"
Tell someone.,
Say something.,
See a counselor.",How to Tell Teasing and Bullying Apart3," If you’re a kid, tell a trusted adult. This might be a parent, guardian, teacher, friend’s parent, or babysitter. Say what you’re feeling and what’s going on with the bully. They should listen to you and support you. They may even help you find ways to solve problems about your bully.Ask the adult for help in what to do.
If a child comes to you for help, think about possible solutions. If the bullying is happening at school, for example, tell the teacher or principal. Offer support and say, “I’m sorry this is happening to you. Nobody should be treating you this way.”

, If you’re being bullied by someone, say something. A bully tends to love the power difference, so stand up for yourself.If you’re feeling shy, have a group of people come with you to confront the bully. Say, “What you’re doing is mean, and I want you to stop.”


When you stand up for yourself, you reclaim some power against the bully.
If you are a parent, carefully consider getting involved. It can turn into a “he-said/she-said” interaction with the two children. However, you might say to another parent, “Our children are not getting along. What do you think we can do?”

, If you’re struggling in dealing with the bully, see about going to a see a school counselor or therapist. They can help you build skills and respond in different ways. They may get you involved in a social skills group or help you build confidence in standing up for yourself.You may go to a counselor at school or see a therapist at a clinic. You may build skills around confidence, self-esteem, and assertiveness.
Be aware that if your child or someone you know is feeling distress due to being bullied, then it is important to take care of the issue as soon as possible. Bullying, no matter how insignificant it might seem, can have lasting consequences for mental health."
"
Recognize that the semi-anonymity of the internet leads some people to behave badly.,
Realize what are you dealing with.,
Translate all the comments, if necessary.,
Take a break to deal with your emotions.,
Discern between comments about your actions and who you personally are.,
Never fight back.,
Answer the acceptable comments politely.,
Block and report the unacceptable comments.,

Don't overthink about the insults.",How to Take Action Against Insults on Social Media1," Just like how people can be rude or mean in traffic, people can act this way on the internet, where faces aren't as easy to see. People may say things online that they would never say to your face.;
, The why or for what reason doesn't matter. Because the answer is simple: There are people out there who are ignored by the others or even being bullied. Social Media are probably the only place which they can put a mask over who they really are, hide their weaknesses and insult others. You can't find any of them saying the same words out of the Internet. So realize this fact and don't be mean. Instead, Try to calm down and investigate the situation by knowing the real part of it.

, It's an essential to know the comments all, especially if you receive a lot of comments. Ask your admin to translate them all. It's so important to put time for this. Because you may have 10 comments of insults but 2 fan comments between. Never judge them all together when you don't understand the language.

, You might feel hurt, confused, angry, sad, or any number of emotions. This is normal, and okay. Take time to process all of this, without acting. This can help you deal with the stress, so that you will be able to re-approach it later with a clearer head.


Try venting about the problem in person to a trusted friend, family member, or mentor. (Do not mention it online yet.)
Find someone whose judgment you trust, and ask them for advice in handling this. They may be able to be there with you, and help you feel less alone.

, Sometimes, criticism of your work or actions can really hurt, and it may feel personal even if it's not. Wrap yourself in a fluffy blanket, sip a calming drink, and carefully analyze the comment. Is it personal, or was it something you did? Is there any validity to their criticism?


For example, there's a big difference between ""that was a mean thing you said"" and ""you're a garbage loser bully who will never find true happiness.""
Tell the difference between constructive and destructive criticism. Constructive criticism, while sometimes painfully blunt, tells you how to improve, such as ""your story is a bit over-the top; it would benefit from more subtlety."" Destructive criticism is not specific or meant to help you, such as ""your story is a Mary Sue drama fest full of whining and unbelievable events.""

, If you start hurling insults back, the admins may decide that you are just as much at fault as the aggressor is, and they may punish both of you or do nothing. It's extremely important to be a noncombatant. Don't respond, or if you must, be friendly and polite.

, Some comments are made by people whose first goal is not to be hostile; they are just bad at social skills or particularly grumpy today. So answer them in a very respectful and polite way. Show them that you are open to discussion, and invite them to talk politely without hurling insults.


For example, ""I'm concerned that you feel my edit to the wiki page was a bad one, and am open to discussion about the ideas involved.""

, If a commenter clearly does not mean well, and only is interested in being mean, the best thing to do is block and report. They may get banned for continuously breaking site rules. Whatever happens to them, when you block and report, you show them that they won't get a reaction from you. They'll discover that you're no fun for them, and eventually, they'll look for easier prey.


If you respond to trolls, other trolls may notice and decide they can get attention from you. If you feed one, five more may appear. It's best not to talk to them at all.

, Different websites will have different policies, and may or may not intervene on your behalf. Some stress good-faith communication only, and will dole out warnings and punishment to bullies. Others take a non-intervention approach, even if it is one party antagonizing another party that is trying to make peace. Some will even overlook awful messages, such as death/rape threats or messages like ""kill yourself.""


Whether people will care depends on your situation and the website. For example, some websites consider harassment of women normal and acceptable, and will do nothing.
Don't blame yourself if admins don't care. It doesn't mean that your pain is any less real or important.

, Don't let others see the bad words in your user page. Because there are young teenagers working with the Social Media. Teenagers are easily affected by what others do or say. They're the future generation of the world, so don't let the insults teach them how to insult!

, Nowadays, there are many campaigns such as ""Block and Report campaign"" which are being created to take action against insulting, especially on Social Media. Join them and if there aren't any in your country, don't be afraid to create one.

, realize that the person who insulted can't actually say the same words in the real world. Social Media are probably a good chance for these people to fake themselves. This never worth to put your time on thinking about. Because they are never real, but you are.

Litigate your lawsuit.",How to Take Legal Action Against Cyber Bullying," Although it can be difficult, engaging the bully typically only encourages him or her to continue or even escalate the attacks against you. This includes making any public online statements about the situation.You may want to make an initial statement telling the person to stop. If you do, make a statement in a calm manner and don't respond further.
More likely than not, the person will use your direct contact as an excuse to try to bait you into arguments or to continue to harass and insult you.
Keep in mind that many bullies often are looking for attention. If you start attacking the bully, or encourage your friends to attack them, you're playing the bully's game, giving them exactly what they want.
Responding to the bully also runs the risk that you will begin insulting and harassing him or her as well, which can hurt your case when you attempt to take legal action against the cyber bullying.;
, One of the biggest difficulties police and prosecutors have with arresting and prosecuting online bullying is proving that the conduct was taking place. Because victims often don't keep records of their interactions with bullies, the situation too often comes down to a case of ""he said, she said.""

If the person sends you emails or direct messages, save those messages in their entirety.
You also want to take screen captures of the messages or comments on posts. Make sure you can read the messages clearly in your images.
If you don't know how to make screen captures on your computer, search for instructions online or in the help file of your computer's image or photo application.
Make sure you record the dates and times of the messages or comments. If friends of yours have seen the messages as well (such as if they are comments on social media posts visible to your followers), ask them if they'd be willing to testify as to the content of those messages.

, It may sound simplistic, but most websites and social media networks have methods by which you can block users who are bothering you. Typically, you won't be able to see any posts or comments from people you've blocked, and they won't be able to see yours.Particularly on social media networks, go to your account preferences and look for the options dealing with safety or security. Typically there will be a place where you can enter a username and block that account.
On some websites you may be able to block the person simply by clicking on his or her name or icon and following the prompts.
Keep in mind that this method only works when you are logged in to your account, and it doesn't prevent the person from opening a new account and using it to bully you, once he or she finds out you blocked the original account.

, If the bullying or harassment is only happening on one website, and the bully has shown no signs of following you anywhere else or attempting to disrupt your life off-line, you may be able to get rid of him or her by temporarily closing your account on that website.


Keep in mind that your ultimate goal should be to get the bullying to stop – not to take revenge against the person bullying you, but to restore your ability to use the internet in peace.
If the website where you've become a target for cyber bullying is not that important to you, consider leaving the website, or starting a new account under a different username.
In some cases this might not be a legitimate option for you, particularly if you are being bullied on a social media site you use to connect to family and friends who live far away. The decision ultimately is yours – no one can force you to take down your account because someone else is bullying you.
If you're contributing content to a website or blog run by someone else, you may be able to contact the company and have comments closed on your posts, or have your posts removed.

, Before an online service provider can take action against someone who is bullying you, it must have account information for you and the person who is bullying you, as well as evidence of the comments or conduct that has taken place.Typically you will need to provide evidence of the comments or messages to get the online service provider to take action. You probably will have the ability to attach digital images such as the screen-caps you took.
You also should take a moment to write a chronological summary of the events that took place and the pattern of bullying you experienced.
This summary will not only help you file a complaint against the bully with the website, but also when you file a report with the police or work on filing a civil lawsuit.

, Most websites and social media networks have contact information, typically an email address, that you can use to alert the company about the bullying you've experienced.

Some websites may have a form you can fill out and submit online that provides basic information about the bullying you've experienced and what you want the website to do about it.
Once you complete this initial form, it will be reviewed by the website's employees and someone will contact you, typically through email, to ask for further information.
If you don't receive a response within a reasonable period of time, you may want to contact the website again. Some websites take longer to respond than others, but there's no reason why more than a week should go by without you receiving some response.

, In most cases, bullying violates a website's terms of service, which all users agree to follow when using the website. The website will take action against users who violate its terms of service.

Read through the site's terms and conditions and other community guidelines, and make a list of the clauses or terms that your bully has violated through his or her communication.
When you send your formal complaint, list these terms specifically, using their number or title. Then point to the exact message or comment in violation of that term.
Include as much evidence as you have to back up the statements you make, such as screen-captures or permalinks to posts where the bully's comments appear.
Typically a formal complaint against another user also must include your own personal information, such as your full legal name, email, and mailing address. You may want to include a statement that you don't want this information shared with the person you're reporting.

, Once the online service provider has reviewed your complaint, you typically will get a notice letting you know what the website's representative found and what actions were taken as a result.Don't be surprised if you get a message back telling you to simply block the person. If you've previously taken such steps, you should let the website know.
You also may want to let the website know that the person is harassing or bullying other people from the same account, if you have any evidence that this is true.
The website also may tell you that if you feel personally threatened, you should file a complaint with your local law enforcement.

, Often if you want the local police to do anything about the cyber bullying you are experiencing, you must be able to prove that the person knows where you live and presents a threat to your life or well-being.Often, cyber bullying must be prosecuted under other laws that prohibit stalking, threats, or harassment. The type of evidence required to prove these crimes varies.
To learn more about the anti-bullying laws in your state, you can visit http://www.stopbullying.gov/laws/ and click on your state on the map.
You may want to print copies of the laws against cyber bullying in your state and take them with you when you go to file your report.
Police typically are reluctant to get involved unless you are concerned for your safety, so focus your evidence on anything that would demonstrate a local contact or an intent to physically harm you or your family.
Keep in mind that typically it is not enough to show a single message, or even an isolated string of messages or comments. You must be able to show a pattern of continuous behavior.
If you have a friend or family member who lives nearby and is familiar with the bullying you've experienced online, you may want to ask them to come to the police station with you for support.

, Take all of the information you've gathered about the cyber bullying you're experiencing and the person responsible for it to your local police precinct and ask to file a police report.

Keep in mind that some officers may not understand cyber bullying, or realize that the behavior is against the law.
If you've brought copies of your state's criminal law, show them to an officer and insist on filing a police report.

, After you've filed a report, you typically will be interviewed by an officer who will ask you questions about your report and give you a timeframe for any investigatory process that the police will undertake.A police investigation is most likely if you know the identity of the person bullying you online, and know that they live nearby or have the ability to cause you harm ""in real life"" – not just in the online world.
If the person is an anonymous user or not someone you know, on the other hand, it may be very difficult to get the police to act on your report. However, it's still important that you have a report on file in the event something else happens.
Make sure you get the name of the officer who takes your report, and get a copy of your written report for your records before you leave the police station. Your report typically will have a number for you to use if you call for updates.

, If a few weeks go by and you haven't heard anything from the police regarding your report, call the station and ask about it. You also want to let an officer know if you acquire additional evidence concerning your case.In many cases, persistence pays off. Tell the police officer with whom you speak that you want the case against the person to be prosecuted.
You might also consider calling the district attorney's office and telling them about your case. Provide a copy of your police report and let the district attorney know that you understand the person's actions are against the law and you want him or her prosecuted for it.

, If you've decided you want to file a civil lawsuit against the person bullying you, an experienced personal injury attorney may be your best option to ensure you recover the maximum amount in damages.Damages in civil lawsuits for cyber bullying typically hinge on emotional distress, and can be extremely difficult to prove. An attorney with experience litigating these cases will have a good idea what your case is worth and the types of damages that can be proven.
In many cases, a personal injury attorney will take your case on a contingency-fee basis, meaning you won't have to pay any attorney's fees unless you settle the case or are awarded monetary damages in court.
For this reason, if you plan to file a civil lawsuit it's in your best interest to have a lawyer on your side.

, A complaint is the document you'll file with the court to sue your bully, and will list your factual allegations against the person and explain why those facts add up to a legal wrong for which you can sue the person.Your attorney will need information about the bullying to craft the allegations for your complaint. The evidence that you've gathered will help, as well as any reports you've filed with the police and online service providers.
Your attorney also will likely want to know about your relationship with the person who is bullying you, including whether you know them personally and how they came into your life.
Typically, your complaint will be based on a cause of action such as defamation or intentional infliction of emotional distress. For either of these causes of action to succeed, the bully's statements must be extreme – annoyances or vague insults aren't enough.
Your attorney will go over the complaint with you before filing it. Make sure you understand everything in the document and that the allegations are correct.

, To initiate your lawsuit, you must take your original complaint, along with several copies, to the clerk's office of the court where you want your case to be heard. If all of your documents are in order, the clerk will file your complaint once you've paid the court's filing fee.The court will charge filing fees when you file your complaint. If your attorney is working on contingency, you typically won't have to pay those fees yourself. Rather, your attorney will pay them and add them to the costs of your lawsuit, which will be recovered if you win or settle the lawsuit.
Once the complaint is filed, it must be served on the person you're suing. Typically this involves either having the complaint and summons hand-delivered by a sheriff's deputy, or having them delivered using certified mail.
After service is completed, the bully must answer your lawsuit before the court's deadline or you may be eligible to win your lawsuit by default.
However, keep in mind that even if you file a motion for default, you typically still have to prove that you are entitled to the damages you've requested.

, If the bully files an answer to your lawsuit, you will begin pretrial litigation, during which you will gather information and prepare for the trial. During this time you also may have the opportunity to settle your lawsuit.Discovery may become one of the most important parts of this phase of litigation. Through written questions and depositions, you have the chance to ask the bully about his or her motivations and goals in harassing you.
Through requests for production, you also have the opportunity to find out if the bully was also bullying or harassing other people, and what was being said about you to others.
Keep in mind that lawsuits are expensive, stressful, and time-consuming. These realities can become huge factors when considering the value of a settlement offer.
As angry as you may be, and as tempted as you may be to go all the way to trial just for ""the principle of the thing,"" a trial – whether by judge or jury – carries no guaranteed result.

Stop communicating with the people who insult.",How to Take Action Against Insults on Social Media2," Realize and know the fact that there are actually few people who show a complete version of themselves on Social Networks and Media. On the other hand, There are people who fake what and who they really are. Some do this by fake names, fake photos, and etc. Unfortunately, there are some who fake themselves by insulting on other user pages. The thing that probably just 1% of them do in the real world. Because in the real world, if they insult, they'll probably be judged and shamed by others. So what you have to do is knowing that they're not real, and fake people are not worth judging.

, If you see an insult on a user page - whether your favorite celebrity, your friend or a simple e-Pal, know what is the comment about. If it's in other languages, translate. If it's talking about previous comments, read the previous comments. To do the right action, you have to know what the comment is about and decide whether you need to get involved. Sometimes It's better to back off while sometimes, you should react.

, Although usually, people insult on Social Media for no reason, There are sometimes that there's a fight between them. Never be part of it. Instead, ask the fighters to calm down and stop, even if there is a right person. Because Social Networks are not places to fight. If you stand by with one person and judge another ones, you're only adding fuel to the fire. So remember that you can not put out a fire with oil.

, There may be some comments that although have insults, but are trying to express a fair criticism. It's not bad to teach others how to criticize. Some people really don't know how to remove insults when criticizing. On the other hand, there are people who were just in a bad mood. Although it's not a good excuse but it happens. What you have to do is respectfully ask them to delete their comment themselves and try to express their ideas without insulting. Tell them you understand that people may have mistakes. Do not ask them to apologize. Instead, be as polite and respectful as you can so they'll immediately regret their words and apologize themselves. If they regretted, kudos to yourself and if they didn't, ask them again. If that happened again, know that twice is enough. Simply block and report them.

, There are comments that the only point of them is nothing! They don't express anything but the obsession. These comments show that these people were under emotional child abuse pressure in their childhood. The only thing you can do is to block and report these people so they'll get out of Social Media and nobody gets hurt, especially teenagers.

, Explain that trolls are like birds: if you bother to feed them, more will come.

, Send them friendly messages, find fun things to do together, and remind them how much you care. This positivity can help them stay grounded and mentally healthy despite the insults. Give them some good memories. It can help them get through this.

, Some campaigns such as ""Block and Report campaign"" are being created to take action against insults, especially on Social Media. These campaigns will probably decrease the number of insults on Social Media. If there aren't any campaign against insults in your country, start one.

, Realize that they don't even worth discussing. Because they may know that you're right, but are not going to confess. If you discuss with them, then what's your difference?

, If he's saying this to be mean, you can either tell him off or just ignore him.

, Is there something you are doing to hide your unique feature? Are you always biting your lip? Do you stare at the floor? Do you hide your face with you hair? If you decide that you are not happy with your image, now might be a good time to change your wardrobe, hair, etc. Remember: everyone is beautiful in their own way, some in the inside, some on the outside, some both. Every has different ideas about beauty. Not everyone sees beauty in the same things. Accept that you will always be judged by some on your looks. It's up to you what they judge you for, a smile,or a frown, someone obviously obsessed with their appearance, or some one having too much fun to worry about how they look.

, One comment should not make you completely miserable. Just walk confidently and have fun.

,, If you understand that ""ugly"" is a weak and childish insult, then respond in a polite, very adult way. Thank whomever called you ugly, and tell him that he is very kind. Then walk away. It drives people crazy when they can't get a response out of you.

, Sometimes something that makes the person who insulted you laugh, or anyone around laugh at him, can make you feel better.

Especially if you are shy, having a journal to express your feelings can be helpful.

, Exercise is a great way to bust stress and help you feel good about yourself.If going to the gym isn’t your thing, there are plenty of things you can do to move and sweat. Jump on a trampoline, take your dog for a walk, or ride your bike.


You can also dance, ice skate, or do tae-bo. Do things that interest you and that you enjoy!
Learn a new skill. Learning something new can increase your confidence as well as show you your progress as you keep working with it.

, While it may feel like nobody likes you, you can try to join different clubs or teams to make friends that share similar interests as you.This can be at school or outside of school. Look into different clubs at school such as drama club, yearbook, poetry club, and activities like music or sports. Outside of school you can join like karate, dance, and spiritual organizations.


Think about what may interest you, then go check it out. You may feel weird or out of place at first, but give it a shot.
Sometimes the hardest part is going to your first meeting. You might feel really anxious or tell yourself all kinds of stories that no one will like you or that you’ll be ignored. Don’t listen to any of it! Just go one time, and give it a try.
Remember that all the people there share that same interest. Try getting to know other club members by asking them, “When did you first get into photography?” or, “How long have you done karate?” or, “Who’s your favorite poet?”

, Instead of dwelling on thoughts that nobody likes you or that people are mean to you, change your perception.There’s no need to replay negative situations in your head over and over. By focusing on the past on your negative experience, you actually empower the people that hurt you. Instead, empower yourself by creating positive thoughts about yourself.


It may be easy to get stuck on a loop of when people rejected you. (“What did I do? What could I have done differently? Why were they so mean?”) but get off that loop as soon as possible. These people do not define who you are, and their opinion is only an opinion, not a fact. .
Think about the positive qualities you possess (like being kind, compassionate, caring, and generous) and your unique abilities (such as being a great dancer and big brother).

Ignore the bully.,
Find strength in numbers.,
Talk about the issue.,
Stand up for yourself.,
Tell an authority figure.,
Find ways to feel good about yourself.",How to Stop Bullying in Your Classroom1," Sometimes, simply ignoring a bully is a great way to cope. Bullies often thrive on attention. If a bully is not getting a reaction from you, he or she may give up and move on to another target.Use body language to show a bully you're not interested in giving him or her your attention. Hold your head high and stand up tall to convey confidence. When the bully is addressing you, simply walk by without turning your head or paying attention.
Bullies may take on online harassment as well, which can also be ignored. Simply do not respond to negative social media posts, e-mails, and instant messages.
Many people are reluctant to simply ignore bullying as this feels like a cowardly response. However, ask yourself whether engaging with a bully is really worth it. While you may dislike feeling cowardly or weak, oftentimes addressing bullying only escalates the situation. The bully may get aggressive and double down on his or her efforts. Try ignoring the bully for a week or so and see if he or she backs off.;
, Friends are a great way to deter a bully. Seek out friends who stick by you through adversity. If a bully is spreading rumors, for example, stay close to the friend who tells you he or she refuses to believe lies and gossip. Have friends accompany you during lunch, between classes, and during breaks like recess. This can help deter the bully from harassing you.In addition to sticking by your current friends, seek out new friends with shared interests. Join a school club that interests you. Try signing up for a sport's team. Enroll in extracurricular activities outside of your school district, such as local volunteer work. This can provide you with the opportunity to meet friends outside of your own school.You should strive to make friends with people who don't bully. You may be inclined to befriend someone who has a reputation for being tough. However, if you're friends with someone who makes a habit of bullying others, this person could turn on you in the future. Seek out friends who do not bully if you want to avoid being on the receiving end of cruel behavior.

, If you're being bullied, talking about the issue is important. You can help stop bullying by talking out your feelings with a friend, a parent, or your school's guidance counselor. This can help you work through your fears and frustrations. Simply managing your emotions can allow you to find better outlets to address bullying., If ignoring the bully is not working, you may want to stand up for yourself. Bullies often target people they feel will not fight back. If you make an effort to stand up to a bully, the bully may back off.Tell the bully to stop when he or she is harassing you. Loudly say something like, ""No, that's enough!"" and then walk away. If you see a bully targeting another student, you can also intervene. Say something like, ""Hey! Leave that kid alone!"" Then, the two of you can walk away together.
Avoid getting angry or physical when standing up to a bully. Name-calling, foul language, kicking, hitting, and other forms of physical violence will only serve to escalate the situation. You do not want to put yourself in a position where you might get hurt or become the aggressor yourself.

, After a certain point, you need to talk to an authority figure about bullying. If the bully continues to harass you, despite your efforts to ignore or address the situation, you need to report it. Do not think of this as tattling. If a bully is targeting you, chances are he or she is targeting other students as well. Bullying creates a toxic environment that is harmful to everyone. It's important to make sure bullying is addressed.A parent, a teacher, a classroom aid, a principal, or other authority figure can help address bullying. Choose an adult you trust, who you feel will handle the situation appropriately. If you know anyone who witnessed the bullying, or who has also been targeted by the bully, ask that person to come forward as well.
Bullies will often stop as soon as an authority figure gets involved. Many bullies want to avoid punishment.
Bullies often lash out at other students due to their own issues. A bully may have issues at home that need to be addressed. By reporting the issue, you're giving a bully a chance to get the help he or she needs.
You can also try asking a teacher if you can move chairs. Even if your teacher is hesitant to discipline the bully, he or she may allow you to move to another part of the room so you feel safer.

, Bullies often target people with low confidence or self-esteem. If you find ways to feel good about yourself, this may be a natural deterrent for bullies. Work on engaging in activities that allow you to feel good about yourself.Exercise is a great confidence booster for many. It can also help elevate your overall mood, which may help you cope emotionally with bullying. Try to engage in physical activity each day, like going for a bike ride with friends or taking your dog for a walk.
Get involved with something you're passionate about. If you're interested in writing, volunteer to write a column for the school newspaper. If you're into nature, join a hiking club. Developing your skill set can help boost your confidence.
While raising your self esteem can help deter bullies, keep in mind bullying is never your fault. It's good to find ways to feel better about yourself, regardless of your situation, as this can help you when you face adversity. However, do not take this to mean you brought bullying on yourself due to a lack of confidence.

Observe people with great social skills.,
Communicate with body language.,
Be a great listener.,
Practice your social skills.",How to Survive with Your Sanity Intact when Everyone Hates You at School2," Lots of people who feel socially shy, anxious, or find communication difficult often focus on themselves and their own social performance. Look at someone at your school that is popular, gets along with people, and has lots of friends. What does this person do that makes him or her so likeable? Notice the way this person stands, body language, facial expressions, and the way he or she interacts with others, verbally and nonverbally.See the positive things this person brings to social interactions, and practice them in your own interactions.
When you’re focused on yourself, you may miss the cues that other people give you. Start to notice cues that people give in other interactions, and see if you can start to pick up on cues in your own interactions.

, If you cross your arms and legs and look down, it’s unlikely people will see you as a warm and inviting person to talk with. Instead, make sure you communicate your openness by appearing open in your body: lean toward people, smile, nod your head, and maintain comfortable eye contact.Try and avoid crossing your body, but keep your shoulders open and not hunched.


When making eye contact, it’s okay to look away; no need to lock eyes indefinitely. You can also look at different focal points such as the forehead, nose, mouth, between the eyes).If you’ve generally avoided eye contact in the past, it may be a difficult practice to adopt, but keep at it.

, Don’t feel 100% responsible for carrying a conversation. If you’re so wrapped up in thinking about what to think next, you may miss what the other person is saying.Listen to what the other person is saying, and ask questions that build on what is said. For instance, if someone tells you, “I like to garden”, ask “What kind of plants or flowers do you grow?” or “How did you get into gardening?”


Active listening means you put your attention onto what is being said and show interest in it and the person. Don’t be afraid to nod your head, say “oh yeah” or “really?” or “Wow! That’s fascinating!” to show that you are listening along.

, It’s one thing to know what to do, it’s another to practice these skills! Practice different skills with people you feel comfortable with first, then start using your skills more broadly with people at school. Remember that the more you practice, the more natural it will begin to feel.Even if it feels completely out of your comfort zone, keep practicing! It will become easier.

Walk away.,
Withdraw.,
Keep a wide perspective.,
Be funny.",How to Survive with Your Sanity Intact when Everyone Hates You at School3," When you walk away from a bully, you show that that person doesn’t have control over your actions or emotions.Engaging the person means you are meeting him or her on the same level. You don’t need to engage this person, and there’s no use putting any of your energy into the situation.


Remember that you choose your response. Is it worth engaging with this person? It may be better to just walk away and not even bother.

, If someone is harassing you or egging you on, calmly tell this person that you are not interested in engaging with him or her.Remember the person can only bully you if you give him or her power over your emotions. Once you no longer seem to care what this person thinks, he or she may become bored or disinterested.


If the person persists, ignore the person.
Say, “I don’t want to talk to you” or “This doesn’t interest me.” Remember that you have control over how (or if) you react. If it isn’t worth your time, say so.

, Ask yourself, “Will I remember this situation in 1 year? What about 5 years? Will this affect my life then?” If not, determine to spend your energy and time elsewhere.Also ask yourself if these are people that will continue to be in your life for a long time. If you have plans to go to college or move, it’s likely these people will be gone from your life soon enough.

, If someone is being mean to you, respond with a joke or with some humor.Humor completely disarms someone trying to hurt you, and he or she may be too surprised to know how to respond. When you use humor, it shows that this person has no control over you.


If a mean person targets you and you respond with a joke, it’s likely he or she will lose interest in trying to hurt you.
If someone is making fun of your shoe size, say, “You’re probably right. I tried out for the Lord of the Rings but I guess my feet weren’t hairy enough.”

Talk to your parents.,
Connect to friends.,
Talk to a teacher or guidance counselor.,
See a therapist.,
Have compassion on yourself.",How to Survive with Your Sanity Intact when Everyone Hates You at School4," Your parents want to help you and support you. If you are struggling, consider asking your parents for help and guidance.They may share how things were difficult for them when they were your age, and what helped get them through difficult times at school.

, There may be other kids at school who feel similar to you. If you know other kids that are struggling, reach out to them. Maybe they have been bullied, had rumors spread, or are having a hard time adjusting. Whatever it is, offer your friendship to other people that struggle and show them that you understand and are there for them.


If several of your friends feel bullied by someone, approach the person altogether. There’s strength in numbers, and standing in unity will show that you are strong together.

, Especially if people are mean to you at school, talk to an adult at your school that you trust. You may just want to talk about the situation, or seek some action toward the people hurting you. Even if talking about it doesn’t change the situation, it can change how you feel.You can also talk to a coach, friend’s parent, or spiritual leader.

, If you struggle deeply at school and feel like nothing you do will make it better, ask your parents about seeing a therapist. A therapist can help you work through the emotions you have, find ways to cope with negative feelings, and help you become more self-aware.Seeing a therapist doesn’t mean you’re “crazy” or incapable of handling your own problems. It just means you’re reaching out for help from someone who’s been trained to support you and help you grow.

, Even if it feels really hard, remind yourself that you deserve to be treated with respect, by other people and most importantly, by yourself.You are worthy and valuable, no matter how people treat you. Remember that other people’s perceptions of you doesn’t make up your identity, you choose who you are. Above all, treat yourself kindly. When you emotionally beat yourself up (“I’m so stupid” or “nobody likes me”), be your own best friend and stick up for yourself.


Find ways to respond to your negative thoughts in a way that makes them untrue. If you think, “I’m stupid”, think of all the things that make you smart, and it doesn’t have to be school. You may be smart in math, or in building things, or problem solving difficult situations.

Watch for bullying.,
Address behavior without using labels.,
Praise positive behaviors.,
Get parents involved.,
Foster open communication.",How to Stop Bullying in Your Classroom2," If you want to stop bullying as a teacher, vigilance is key. Keep an eye out for bullying in your classroom, as well as in places like hallways and bathrooms. This way, you can stop bullying as it's occurring.When your students are engaging in activities, pay attention. Listen to how students communicate with one another. Listen for things like name-calling or put downs. You should also keep an eye out for physical behaviors, like pinching, poking, or other signs of aggression.
Monitor places where students think teachers aren't watching. Places like bathrooms, stairwells, and hallways are frequently where bullying occurs in schools. While you cannot keep an eye out all the time, walk through these areas periodically when you have a free moment. You should ask other teachers to do the same, and have them report any signs of bullying they notice to you.

, Students may be apprehensive to be labeled ""bullies."" If you get parents involved, many parents will become defensive if you accuse their children of bullying. When you notice a student engaging in bullying, address that student's specific behavior. Try to avoid labeling that behavior as bullying, as this can lead to unnecessary resistance that will prevent you from finding an effective solution to the problem.Talk about the specific behavior you observed and why you feel it's a problem when talking to a student. For example, do not say something like, ""Clyde, I noticed you were bullying Mason during gym the other day."" Instead, talk about the problematic behavior directly. Say something like, ""Clyde, I noticed you were calling attention to Mason's weight in gym class the other day.""
Make sure the student doing the bullying understands their behavior is wrong and the consequences of this behavior. For example, say something like, ""Weight is a very sensitive issue, and pointing out another person's weight can be very embarrassing and hurtful for that person."" If there are specific punishments for bullying outlined in your school's handbook, let the student know. Say something like, ""According to our school's handbook, you'll need to have a talk with the guidance counselor and write an apology to Mason.""
You should also keep in mind students who bully come from a variety of backgrounds. A student may have emotional baggage or issues at home causing him or her to lash out at others. Try to proceed with patience. Present this as an opportunity for a student to better him or herself. For example, ""I know you probably don't genuinely want to hurt another person. I think us having this talk will give you the opportunity to learn a bit about yourself and how to better interact with others.""

, It's easy to point out when a student does something wrong. However, students need positive reinforcement as well. In addition to addressing bullying when it occurs, try to be on the lookout for positive behaviors. Point out when a student has shown compassion or kindness and use this as an example for your classroom.Children or teens may get frustrated if they're always reprimanded for bad behavior but never praised for behaving in an appropriate fashion. While you may not think children should be rewarded for doing what they're supposed to do, keep in mind students who bully are often testing boundaries. They may not understand what constitutes appropriate behavior. This needs to be taught as well.
If you see a student engaging in positive behavior, point it out. For example, say something like, ""Clyde, I noticed you helped Harper with a math problem the other day. It's really nice of you to encourage a student who's struggling. I think that will really help Harper's self esteem, as she sometimes gets embarrassed when she's having trouble with a problem.""
Pointing out good behaviors helps students learn appropriate conduct. If students are praised for behaving well, they'll be more likely to avoid bullying and engage in kind behavior towards other students.

, If a student won't stop bullying, you need to get the parents involved. This can be tricky, as parents are often reluctant to acknowledge their child has a problem. However, parental involvement is vital to stopping bullying in your classroom.Try to avoid terms like ""bullying"" when contacting parents. The label of ""bully"" has a lot of negative connotations. Even if you feel a student is a bully, using this term may not help you effectively address the situation. Focus on specific behaviors over an overarching label.
Take a multi-faceted approach when addressing the behavior with parents. Focus on a student's attitude towards school, his or her friends, behavior, and grades. All of these factors can affect how a student treats others. Ask parents a lot of questions about their child, and offer suggestions on how to make a positive change.
When talking to the parents, present yourself as an ally rather than an authority figure. Try to frame conversations in the positive. Emphasize that you want to help their child cope with his or her emotions in a more positive manner. Start the conversation with something like, ""I care about all my students, including your son. I want to see him make some positive changes that will make him a better student and community member.""

, Lastly, foster open communication in and outside of your classroom. Students and parents should see you as a trustworthy resource who they can come to with concerns and comments. This will help you keep track of any bullying happening in your classroom.Address behaviors as they occur. Talk to parents right away if you notice an issue with their child. If a student seems upset or bothered, ask him or her what's wrong. Use empathetic listening. Repeat what's being said to the student to show you understand.
Be open with parents. At the beginning of the school year, send out information to parents with your phone number and e-mail address. Tell parents they're welcome to come to you with any issues they're having. This way, if a student is being bullied, parents can contact you right away. Even if you're vigilant, you may sometimes miss bullying in your classroom.

Learn what constitutes bullying.,
Asses bullying in your school.,
Lead by example.,
Teach anti-bullying lessons.",How to Stop Bullying in Your Classroom3," If you want to prevent bullying, you must first learn what kind of behaviors constitute bullying. Bullying can often be subtle. Whether you're a teacher or a student, strive to educate yourself on the various manifestations of bullying.Teasing is very common in classrooms. Students often tease friends in a way that's lighthearted and not meant to be taken seriously. However, when teasing becomes mean-spirited, hurtful, and constant, it crosses a line and becomes bullying.
Bullying can be physical. A student may hit, kick, or otherwise get physical with another student. It can also take the form of name calling. A student may mock another student, calling him or her names or calling attention to perceived shortcomings. Bullying can also occur on social media. Students may target one another via outlets like Twitter or Facebook, making aggressive posts about one another.
People often brush off bullying. You may feel it's something you need to ""tough out."" If you're a teacher, you may see bullying as something that simply happens as kids grow up. While light teasing and occasional goofing around is normal, if something is making you or a student feel uncomfortable or unsafe, it needs to be addressed. School should be an environment where everyone feels they can learn safely.
Power relations often play a role in bullying. A bully may be in a position of power over his or her victim. The bully may be older, for example, or have a position of authority in an after school club or sports team. This may mean the bullying gets inadvertently overlooked as the victim may be hesitant to report the issue., If you're a teacher or school official, make an effort to assess bullying in your school. Students may often be hesitant to come forward if they're being bullied, fearful of being labeled a ""tattletale"" or a ""squealer."" Try to find ways to allow students to report bullying anonymously.Surveys can be helpful to assess bullying in your classroom. Provide students with handouts asking them if they've ever been bullied or witnessed bullying. You can also pass out surveys to school officials, asking that they report any bullying they've seen in their classrooms or in places like hallways and bathrooms.
You can also encourage increased vigilance around your school. Ask that teachers and school officials watch for bullying and report it to the principal as it occurs.

, A good way to prevent bullying is to lead by example. Follow the golden rule and treat others how you would like to be treated. Try to behave in a kind, empathetic way to discourage bullying.If you're a teacher, always be patient with students. If you interact with other adults in your classroom, be kind to them as well. Be courteous to the bus driver on field trips. Always say ""please"" and ""thank you"" when a technician comes to fix something in your classroom. Show your students how to treat others with kindness or respect.
As a student, do not engage in bullying yourself. If another student is being made fun of or treated disrespectfully, show that student kindness. Disengage in gossip and other negative conversations. If you hear a student make a rude comment about someone else, point it out. Say something like, ""How would you like it if someone said something like that about you?""

, As a teacher, you can teach about bullying. Go over what bullying is, how to recognize it, and why it's wrong. You can then encourage students to engage in activities that help reduce bullying.There are a variety of activities your students can do that teach them how to treat others well. For example, you can have them draft a bill of rights for an imaginary planet. You can have students take turns sharing stories of when they've been bullied, using a talking stick to take turns sharing.
You should have a strict code of conduct for your classroom. If you school provides a code of conduct, have your students read it as homework. Discuss it in class the next day.

Walk away.,
Tell someone so the bully will stop.,
Look the bully in the eye and tell him or her to stop.,
Stay calm.",How to Stop Bullying1," If the situation seems threatening or dangerous, it's best to get away from the bully. Even if it is not a dangerous situation, remember that you don’t have to listen to someone say mean things to you. The best thing to do might be to calmly walk away from the person. This will send the message that you won’t put up with this kind of treatment.


Try to walk towards people, such as towards a teacher or someone else who will not put up with bullying.;
, It is important to report bullying right away so that it will stop.By telling someone that you are being bullied, you will be standing up for yourself and showing the bullies that you will not put up with their abuse.


Find a teacher, parent, school counselor, or someone else who can help you and immediately tell them what the bully has been saying or doing to you.
Try saying something like, “Joyce is bullying me. She keeps making fun of my weight and she will not stop. I have asked her to stop, but she is still doing it. I think I need some help to make it stop.”
You can also write a note to explain what is happening deliver the note to your teacher, school counselor, or principal.
Tell someone else if the first person you tell does not do anything about the bully. Don’t accept that you will have to put up with the bullying.

, Using direct, assertive communication and body language is the best way to address a bully.If a bully continues to harass you even after you have walked away, then let him or her know that you will not put up with the behavior. Turn and face the bully and tell him or her to stop.


To use assertive body language, stand up tall and face the bully. Look the bully in the eye when you are speaking to them. Don’t look down and don’t try to make yourself smaller, such as by folding your arms or bringing your knees in close to your body. Pull yourself up to your full height, keep your arms at your sides, and your feet about shoulder width apart.
Keep your request short and direct. Try saying something like, “Stop it, Jennifer.” Or, “Cut it out, Craig.” As you say this, make sure that you look the bully directly in the eye and speak in a calm, clear voice.
Don’t compliment or insult the bully. If you say nice things to a bully after he or she has been insulting you, putting you down, or physically threatening you, then this will only increase his or her sense of power. Calling the bully names may enrage the bully and increase his or her efforts to hurt you.

, It is the bully’s goal to get an emotional response out of you, so do your best to keep calm and avoid showing the bully how you feel. Try your best not to show that you are angry, sad, or frightened. The bully may feed off of these emotions and increase his or her efforts.



Take a few deep breaths and think about something that makes you happy, such as getting a good grade on a test, playing with your dog, or something fun that you are planning to do with your family over the weekend. Doing this may help you to take a step back from the situation and avoid reacting to your emotions. Make sure that you keep your eyes open and maintain eye contact with the bully as you do this.
Respond to the bully in a calm way. For example, you might say, ""Jack, I know you think you're funny but you're not. Stop."" Or, ""Stop now or I'm asking the teacher to move you away from me.""
Be sure to talk about how the bully made you feel with someone later on. Talk with your parents, a school counselor, or a teacher.

Apologize.,
Stop and think.,
Make a point of being kinder.,
Be more accepting.,
Use stress management techniques.,
Walk away.,
Develop new friendships.",How to Stop Yourself from Bullying1," Approach the person you have been bullying and sincerely say you are sorry. Telling him is one clear way to let them know that you are sorry for bullying him and won’t do it again.Try saying, “I want to apologize for how awful I have been to you. I know I can’t take it back, but I do want to tell you that I am truly sorry. It won’t happen ever again.”
If it is too difficult to do in person right now, then send him an email, text, or even write him a note.
He may not accept your apology immediately. Understand that he probably has some negative feelings towards you that may take time to get over — he also may not trust that you are being sincere. Use your behavior to support your apology and over time he will see your sincerity and forgive you.;
, Before you do something that could be mean or hurtful, think about what you are doing and why you are doing it.

Taking just a few seconds to consider these things can change what you were about to do. Thinking about what you are doing before you do it can help you stop bullying.

Think about the immediate and short-term effects of bullying. What effect could this have on you and the person that you are bullying right now and later?
Think about different ways you can address the situation and interact with that person. Can you ignore her or even try being nice?
Think about the person you are trying to be. Is bullying in line with that?

,

While you don’t have to buy gifts for everyone you know, make an effort to be nicer, more compassionate, and helpful.Try to do at least one nice thing a day. Not only will you be changing your behavior in a positive way and stop bullying, but you could also develop new friendships.

Pay someone a compliment or just ask him how his day is going.
Volunteer or donate something to a local charity or your favorite cause.
Become a tutor or mentor for someone.

, If one of the reasons you were bullying was because the person is different in some way or because of your feelings about certain issues or things that person represents, then work on being more accepting. Accepting the differences in others is not only a part of growing up, but also a big step in not bullying.Instead of harassing the person, accept that she is different and even accept that you aren’t completely comfortable with that difference.
Try to learn more about the person. Although she may have some things about her that you don’t like, you may find out something about her that you actually like.
If you simply cannot accept the person, then just leave her alone.

,

Instead of bullying, when you feel yourself getting upset, stressed, scared, tired, etc., practice some stress and anxiety reducing techniques. Doing this on a regular basis will change your long-term behavior so that bullying isn’t a natural reaction for you.Taking a few deep breaths is one way to calm down in the moment.
Try picturing yourself someplace fun and peaceful.
Do something that calms you like drawing, listening to music, or even exercising.

, If you feel that you are on the verge of bullying someone, decide to walk away instead. If you need to, spend a few minutes completely by yourself so that you can work through what you are feeling without hurting anyone. Walking away is one of the easiest ways to stop yourself from bullying someone.


If possible, leave the immediate area so that you can calm down.
If you can’t leave the room ( for example, if you are in the middle of class) then try to go to another area in the room or just turn away from the person.

, One way to change your behavior and stop bullying is to associate with people who support this change. While you don’t have to get rid of all your old friends, if they were part of the reason that you were bullying in the first place, then you should strongly consider it.


Meeting new people will allow you to have a ‘fresh start’ without the reputation of bullying.
New friends can help support you when you feel you may be about to bully someone.

Ask personal questions and try to understand why they are mocking you. This will help you take control of the situation and resolve it on your terms.


Remember that the bully's mocking you is a reflection of the bully, not of your worth as a person. This person is having their own problems and is wrongly taking them out on you.
For example, you could say, ""I see that mocking me makes you feel powerful and in control,"" or ""I understand that you feel better taking your anger out on me rather than confronting your problems.""
You could also say, ""I see that you're making fun of me, and it's not funny.""
Think of yourself as a therapist trying to understand your bullies issues.;
, Sometimes taking a firm stand and addressing those making fun of you head on works. Calmly and assertively explain to those mocking you that you do not appreciate their comments. Although this tactic is more direct, it is unlikely those making fun of you expect this response. You might be surprised at the outcome., Put your best face forward when people are mocking you. Stand up straight and try not to reveal how much their comments are hurting you. They are trying to get a response out of you and, if you respond confidently, your bullies will not get the reaction they desire., If you are being mocked, try to stay calm. With the wave of embarrassment and hurt feelings washing over you, this is probably easier said than done. However, in the moment, staying cool takes away the power of those trying to hurt you. Their goal is to hurt you and see you sad, not reacting denies them the satisfaction of knowing that they got to you.Take a deep breath and count to ten.Focus on your breathing.
Think about your happy place and concentrate on your breathing.
Think about how someone you admire would handle this situation and try to imitate that.

, If you find yourself being made fun of, and your efforts to engage with the bully have failed, walk confidently and slowly away. This will remove you from the situation and convey to those mocking you that you do not appreciate what they are saying.Stand up straight and walk slowly. Running away tells those mocking you that they have gotten to you.

, The people making fun of you expect you to react negatively by either getting angry or being sad, so laughing will throw them off. Give a big hearty laugh like the mocking is the funniest thing you have ever heard. This will deflect the attack and show how little power they have over you.Slap your knee and really exaggerate how funny you think their comments are.
Say something like “that’s a new one” or “that’s the funniest thing I’ve heard all day.”
Say something like “that’s enough” or “quit being rude.”

, In the moment, it can be difficult to focus on anything other than the mockery that is being directed towards you. However, mentally leaving the situation may help you better deal with it.

Try the “Yes, and…” technique. If someone is giving you a hard time about something just respond by acknowledging their teasing and then inserting a joke. For example, if someone zings your new haircut by saying “Nice haircut. Joining a punk band?” You can reply with “Yeah, and tomorrow I’m piercing lips, nose, and mouth.”, Although it might seem counterintuitive, sometimes the best way to deflect mocking is to acknowledge it. Addressing part of the bullies’ attacks takes the power away from them and puts you in control. You can then reframe their attack in a way that you want.For example, if you are being mocked about wearing a hat they consider “weird,” you can respond by saying “yeah, it looks weird but you have to admit that it’s pretty cool.”

This will convey to the people mocking you that their words have not hurt you.

, It is important to remember that those who are making fun of you are doing so because they are unhappy and they want to make you feel the same way. Developing compassion for those who are mocking you will put you in a better mindset to deal with their attacks., Although it might seem like lashing out at the people mocking you is the best response, it gives those teasing you the emotional response they wanted and may escalate the situation. Remember to try to stay calm and avoid saying any mean-spirited or hurtful comments to those bullying you. Try to take the moral high ground and show that you are the bigger person.Remember that two wrongs do not make a right.
Matching your bully’s mean comments with your own can escalate the situation and lead to a fight.

, Stick with your friends and try to avoid situations where you are alone. You are more likely to be singled out for ridicule when you are by yourself than when you are with your friends. If you have good friends, they will stand by you and give you moral support if someone mocks you while they are around.If your friends are the ones mocking you, they might not be your friends. You should talk with them about their behavior.

, Steer clear of places where you know that you might be mocked. If you can avoid it, do not walk by your bully’s locker or the lunch table where the people who tease you eat lunch. Simply try to share as little space with those who mock you as you can.Learn your bullies schedule and determine routes that will keep as much space as possible between you and them.

, If you have tried everything in your power to put an end to others mocking you, report the bullying to an adult or superior. This will get you help and may make you feel less afraid. Knowing that you have someone on your side will give you some much needed confidence. Most people do not want to see you build and will try to help you in any way they can. Be sure to tell the authority figure exactly what happened. This will help them better understand how to help you out.
